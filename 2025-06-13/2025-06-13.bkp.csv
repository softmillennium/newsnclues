• Israel attacks Iran: Israel has launched unprecedented strikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear program and military leaders. The attacks have continued across multiple cities across the nation, and Iranian state media reports that fresh strikes are hitting Tehran. Iran's foreign minister said that Israel will “deeply regret” its attack.
    


• Trump warns Iran: President Donald Trump told CNN that the US “of course” supports Israel in its actions. Trump warned Iran earlier today to agree to a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left.” It's unclear if scheduled nuclear talks between the US and Iran will go ahead this weekend.
    


• Military leaders killed: Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and one of the country's most powerful figures, was killed in the attack. Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's highest-ranking military officer, was also killed.
    


• Nuclear targets: Netanyahu said “Operation Rising Lion” struck Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz, nuclear scientists, and what he called “the heart of Iran's ballistic missiles program.”
    


            Israeli authorities discussed “the price we'll have to pay” before launching their overnight attack on Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
    


            “There were doubts, people were asking questions, mostly about two things: in regards to our capabilities and in regards to the price we'll have to pay,” Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video.
    


                    “Regarding the price — I said there will be a price, and we are trying to reduce it in various ways I will not elaborate on. But it is important for me that you citizens will help reduce it by, not being euphoric … and simply obey the instructions (of the Home Front Command) and stay next to safe spaces, because we and you want to minimize harm to life as much as possible,” he said.
                





            Discussing the possibility of a counterstrike from Iran, Netanyahu said: “I tell you there will be. We have hit a considerable part of the Iranian military leadership. We hit a considerable part of the nuclear scientists leading their nuclear program. We are also acted against their air defense. … This came as surprise to them.”
    


                    “I told (US President Donald) Trump surprise is the element of success,” he added. “It created, of course, chaos in Iran but we all need to assume there will be a counterattack against us. It can come in waves and can be very hard.”
                





            Israel's decision to strike Iran in the early hours of Friday morning was “not made lightly,” Israel's UN envoy Danny Doron said a news conference on Friday.
    


            “The decision to act last night was not made lightly. It followed repeated violations by the Iranian regime, continued deception and an absence of meaningful international consequences,” Doron said
    


            Doron claimed that his country had “uncovered clear evidence” that Iran was “planning a surprise attack” on Israel.
    


            “Israel could not and would not wait for that moment to arrive,” he said.
    


            Doron said that his country has “nothing against” the people of Iran, telling journalists:
    


                    “I'm telling to the Iranian people very directly that we have nothing against them. We know that they are suffering. We have seen the conditions where they live… Our fight is not against the people of Iran. The attack was taking (place) at the time when people were not in the streets, and we did everything we can to minimize civilian casualties,” he said.
                





            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel coordinated with the United States “in advance” of the attack on Iran, and the Trump administration “knew about the strike.”
    


                    “We have told them in advance, they knew about the strike,” Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video released Friday afternoon. “What they will do now, I leave it to President Trump, he makes his own decisions independently.”
                





            “I will not speak for him. He speaks very persuasively and very firmly and said Iran should not have nuclear weapons, they should not have enrichment capabilities,” Netanyahu added.
    


Keep in mind: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Thursday that there was no US involvement or assistance in the strikes.
    


            Iranian air defenses shot down an Israeli drone in the vicinity of Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), an underground nuclear facility located some 20 miles northeast of the city of Qom, Iranian state media Press TV reported Friday evening local time.
    


            This was reported around the same time that Press TV said the Hamedan Airbase in western Iran was hit by Israeli airstrikes. Fardiz, a city in north-central Iran, was also targeted by Israeli strikes, Press TV reported.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment
    


            The Israeli military has said that it is working to intercept a missile launched “from Yemen toward Israeli territory” on Friday evening.
    


            Sirens sounded in several areas across Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.
    


            “Aerial defense systems are operating to intercept the threat,” it said.
    


            President Donald Trump told Reuters it's uncertain whether Iran's nuclear program exists following Israel's strikes and that US talks with Iran are still planned for Sunday, although he isn't sure they'll happen.
    


                    “We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out. They can still work out a deal however, it's not too late,” Trump told Reuters in a phone interview.
                





            In another phone interview with NBC News, Trump reiterated that Iran “may have another opportunity” to strike a nuclear deal and implied that Iranians are reaching out to him.
    


            “Now, they may have another opportunity. We'll see,” Trump told NBC.
    


                    “They're calling me to speak,” Trump added without specifying who is calling him. “The same people we worked with the last time … Many of them are dead now.”
                





            Air defenses across Iran were activated as fresh air strikes targeted Tehran Friday evening local time, Iranian state media reported.
    


            Press TV reported that missiles were intercepted south of Tehran, as the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) reported that west Tehran was being hit by new strikes. Karaj, a city near Tehran, was also targeted, IRIB wrote.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
    


            Israel is committed to guaranteeing that there is no nuclear weapons program left in Iran, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, told CNN.
    


            “Those who are going to challenge our will to live in peace are going to have to be challenged by us, and that's what we're in the process of doing now,” Leiter told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


                    “Maybe now the Iranians will be in a better position to actually succumb and give up on their nuclear program. But if not, we are committed to seeing this operation through to the point where there is no nuclear weapons program left in Iran,” he continued.
                





            “Iran will not have a nuclear path to a nuclear bomb,” he said.
    


            Israel deployed reservist troops throughout the country before attacking Iran overnight, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Friday.
    


                    “As part of the IDF's preparations for defense and offense across all arenas and with the start of operation ‘Rising Lion,' the IDF began to deploy reservists from different units to all combat arenas throughout the country,” the statement said.
                





            Iraq's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Fuad Hussein, urged Iran to continue talks with the United States after Israel's attacks on Iran, according to a statement released by Iraq's foreign ministry.
    


            “Minister Hussein expressed Iraq's strong condemnation of the military aggression targeting the Islamic Republic of Iran, affirming Iraq's solidarity with the Iranian government and people in facing this dangerous escalation,” the statement said.
    


                    Hussein also “urged the Iranian side to continue pursuing dialogue with the United States through Omani mediation, in order to reach solutions that would help de-escalate tensions and enhance security and stability in the region.”
                





Nuclear talks: Iran and the US have recently held several rounds of nuclear talks, most recently meeting in Rome in late May. A sixth round of nuclear deal talks was scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday.
    


            Iraq has submitted an official complaint to the United Nations Security Council regarding the strikes, it continued, adding that “Iran reserves the right to respond and defend its sovereignty in proportion to the scale of the threat.”
    


            Radiation levels at Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz remain “unchanged,” according to the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
    


            “Radiation levels outside the Natanz facility remained unchanged. The type of radioactive contamination present inside the facility, mainly alpha particles, can be managed with appropriate protective measures,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement on X.



            The United Nations' nuclear watchdog confirmed that Natanz had been hit amid Israel's attack on Iran, but said earlier it had not observed an increase in radiation levels in the area.
    


            Iran summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran to deliver a warning to the United States, accusing Washington of complicity in Israel's attack.
    


                    “It is unthinkable that the Zionist regime's aggressive actions against Iran were carried out without cooperation, coordination, and at least a green light from the US, and in this regard, the US must be held accountable for its illegal behavior in this regard,” the Iranian representative told Nadine Lozano, the Swiss Ambassador to Tehran, according to a statement published on state run IRNA.
                





            Iran also warned against any US support for Israel during Tehran's response, “including by preventing Iran from exercising its right to legitimate defense,” the statement said.
    


Some context: The US and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and Switzerland serves as the official representative of US interests in the country.
    


            Israel's foreign minister said that Iran's “war against Israel” began with the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in 2023.
    


            “Already on October 8, 2023, the day after the terrible massacre, I wrote: Yesterday was the first day of Iran's war against Israel,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on Facebook.
    


            He said the attack on Iran was necessary to “remove from Israel the threat of annihilation.”
    


                    “In such situations, decision-makers must ask themselves not only what the gains and costs of military action will be, but also what the cost of inaction would be. In this case: placing Israel in danger of annihilation,” he continued.
                





For context: Iran, which has supported Hamas, has denied that it had any role in the October 7 attacks. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser at the time, said days after the attack that the Biden administration didn't have direct evidence linking Tehran to the planning and execution of the assault. And multiple intelligence, military and congressional officials with access to classified intelligence told CNN that no direct evidence was found indicating Iran was directly involved.
    


            Sa'ar added that he has spoken to a number of his international counterparts, including foreign ministers from India, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, Paraguay, Panama, and Cyprus, as well as the European Union.
    


                    “We already have significant achievements in the bold and impressive IDF operation in Iran. These must be deepened,” he wrote.
                





            President Donald Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu several times on Thursday, including prior to Israel launching unprecedented strikes on Iran, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
    


            The source would not divulge the substance of the calls but reiterated that Trump believes the attack was a result of Iran failing to strike an agreement on a new nuclear deal before his 60-day deadline expired.
    


            Trump is set to speak to Netanyahu later today, according a US and an Israeli official.
    


            White House officials continue to argue that the president is committed to salvaging the ongoing nuclear talks with Iran. The source said special envoy Steve Witkoff is “ready” to meet Iranian officials when they are — whether it be in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled or at some date thereafter.
    


            Iran's paralysis following Israel's massive strike against its nuclear facilities is unlikely to last, Iran experts say, warning that Tehran will imminently retaliate as a “Rubicon has been crossed.”
    


            “Iran's leadership is likely reeling, but that paralysis is unlikely to last,” Sina Toossi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said in a statement to CNN.
    


                    “A large-scale retaliation, likely involving drone and missile strikes into Israeli territory, appears imminent,” Toossi said, adding that “rather than crippling Iran's military and nuclear capabilities, Israel's escalation risks fueling nationalist sentiment, solidifying internal cohesion and triggering a dangerous cycle of retaliation, all while increasing the likelihood of American entanglement.”
                





            Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN that it would be difficult for Iran not to retaliate, adding that Iran's response is likely to be bigger than its attack in October, which saw Iranian missiles attack Israeli military sites.
    


            It is unclear how long it will take Iran to recover from Israel's blows, however, Parsi said.
    


                    In its attack, Israel has “tried to kill off several of the norms around the use of force and international law, to essentially bring it down to a situation where it is law of the jungle,” Parsi said.
                





            Toossi added that Trump has warned Israel not to strike. “Whether that was a strategic ruse or genuine restraint is now irrelevant. The Rubicon has been crossed,” he said.
    


            The State Department stood up a task force to track developments and coordinate efforts in the need of any US evacuations from the Middle East on Thursday, before Israel carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, two State Department officials said.
    


Why this matters: The task force serves as a convening mechanism for the department's wide intake of information and is standard practice when there is heightened security concerns.
    


            As of Friday, multiple embassies in the region were actively reviewing their posture, but officials said there had been no decision to further draw down personnel. One senior US diplomat saying that would only come if there was the expectation that US facilities and personnel in the country were going to be targeted in Iran's retaliation.
    


            The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany spoke this morning following Israel's attack on Iran overnight, according to a spokesperson from the British Prime Minister's Office.
    


                    “The leaders discussed the long-held grave concerns about Iran's nuclear program, and called on all sides to refrain from further escalation that could further destabilize the region,” the statement said.
                





            “The leaders reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense, and agreed that a diplomatic resolution, rather than military action, was the way forward,” it added.
    


            President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Israel's attacks on Iran are “great for the market” because it means Iran won't have a nuclear weapon.
    


            “I think ultimately, it would be great for the market because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. It will be great for the market — should be the greatest thing ever for the market. Iran won't have a nuclear weapon that was a great threat to humanity,” he told the newspaper in a brief phone call.
    


            The Wall Street Journal also reported that Trump told the newspaper he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday, plans to speak again today, and that his team was aware of Israel's plan to attack.
    


            When asked how much advance notice the United States had received, Trump said: “Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.”
    


            Trump described the Israeli operation as “a very successful attack, to put it mildly.”
    


Remember: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there was no US involvement or assistance in the strikes.
    


            Iran has no choice but to retaliate against Israel's attack, US foreign policy expert and former US State Department adviser Vali Nasr told CNN's Becky Anderson, adding that it may take the shape of a prolonged war of attrition.
    


            Nasr added that if this attack was a tactic to bring Iran to the negotiating table, it is unlikely to work.
    


            Washington has long sought to limit Tehran's nuclear capacity, with the most recent negotiations in Rome last month ending with no agreement. A sixth round of US-Iran talks had been scheduled for Sunday in Oman — and it's not clear if it will go ahead.
    


            “Trump misunderstood Iran,” Nasr said, and now, “instead of talking, we're going to see use of weapons as a tool in the negotiations.”
    


                    “This regime's back is put to the wall. If it doesn't respond, it will lose all credibility, it will be weak and the Israelis are not going to stop,” Nasr said.
                





            Israel will “come to deeply regret” its “reckless aggression” in attacking Iran, the Iranian foreign minister said in a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Friday.
    


            Abbas Araghchi called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, calling on the body to “strongly condemn this act of aggression” and “take urgent and concrete measures to hold this Israeli regime fully accountable for its crimes.”
    


            The attack on Iran was a “brazen and unlawful act,” as well as a “reckless and deliberate escalation that flagrantly violated the charter of the United Nations and the most fundamental norms of international law,” Araghchi wrote.
    


            “Israel, the most terrorist regime in the world, has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished,” the letter read.
    


            Iran will respond “decisively and proportionately to these unlawful and cowardly acts. The Islamic Republic of Iran will act with full resolve to protect its sovereignty, its people and its national security,” Araghchi said.

The US will “defend itself and Israel” if Iran retaliates for West Jerusalem's “preemptive” strikes, President Donald Trump has told Fox News. He made the remarks in a phone call with host Bret Baier on Friday morning, according to the network. 

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier said it struck dozens of targets across Iran, including military installations and a nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Iranian media reported that at least five people were killed and 20 injured in Tehran following the strikes. The attack came just two days before the sixth round of US-Iran nuclear talks scheduled for Sunday in Oman.

Trump told Fox News that he had spoken with Netanyahu multiple times in recent days and knew of the planned strikes in advance, adding that “there were no surprises.” He stressed, however, that “the US was not involved militarily” and expressed hope that Iran would return to negotiations.

“Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and we are hoping to get back to the negotiating table. We will see. There are several people in leadership that will not be coming back,” Trump reportedly said, apparently referring to Iranian officials killed in the strikes.

Iranian media identified the victims as IRGC commander Hossein Salami, Deputy Chief of Army Staff Gholam Ali Rashid, and nuclear scientists Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi and Fereydoon Abbasi.

Trump added that he is monitoring whether Iran will retaliate. The Iranian Army has said it will not tolerate Israeli “aggression” and warned that “a bitter lesson awaits Netanyahu.” Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stated on Friday morning that Israel “should expect severe punishment.” 

“CENTCOM is on high alert, the US will defend itself and Israel if Iran retaliates,” Trump said, according to Fox News.

The White House has not commented on the phone call.

Ahead of the strikes, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the US “remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue.”

“My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran. They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon,” he posted on Thursday night.

The US gave Iran “chance after chance to make a deal” over its nuclear program, US President Donald Trump has stated, suggesting that the Israeli airstrikes against the Islamic Republic are the result of its own recalcitrance. He called on Tehran to agree to Washington's terms “before it is too late.”

The Israeli military conducted a series of airstrikes on numerous targets across Iran early on Friday, including military and nuclear sites. The Iranian authorities have confirmed that the attacks killed Major General Hossein Salami, the commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces. Several media outlets have claimed that several other high-ranking Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists also perished.

In a post on his Truth Social platform later on Friday, Trump wrote that he “gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal” on its nuclear program, telling the Iranian leadership, “in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it'.” The US head of state suggested that he had warned Tehran that failure to comply with Washington's demands would result in a massive Israeli attack, noting that its military is armed with a large number of US-made weapons.

According to Trump, while Israel is prepared to carry out further, “even more brutal” attacks against Iran, there is still a possibility to reverse the escalation.

“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire,” the US president insisted.

Since April, the US and Iran have held several rounds of talks in Oman about Tehran's nuclear program but no breakthrough has emerged.

The next encounter was scheduled for Sunday, but following the Israeli strikes, the Islamic Republic has reportedly withdrawn.

Washington has demanded all along that Tehran stop all uranium enrichment – something Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described as “completely detached from the reality of negotiations.”

Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity, far above the 3.67% cap set under the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal, which was rendered null and void after President Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from it during his first term.

Several top US officials have warned Tehran against targeting American forces following Israeli air strikes that killed the country's top general and nuclear scientists and multiple explosions at key elements of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. 

In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, US President Donald Trump confirmed that he had prior knowledge of Israel's military action, known as Operation Rising Lion, which targeted nuclear facilities and missile infrastructure.

Trump reiterated the US position that Iran must not acquire nuclear weapons, adding that he hopes Tehran will return to talks over a nuclear deal and that the US military in the Middle East is on high alert.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers denounced Iran as the “aggressor,” saying “its pursuit of a nuclear weapon is an existential threat that will not be tolerated.”

“The US was not involved in the strikes, but our forces stand ready to defend themselves and our ally Israel. Any Iranian attack on US forces would be a grave miscalculation,” he warned.

Iran has repeatedly denied that it has plans to develop nuclear weapons and insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.

US House Speaker Mike Johnson affirmed Israel's right to self-defense, saying, “Israel IS right – and has a right – to defend itself!”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the US was not involved in the Israeli strikes. “Our top priority is protecting American forces in the region… Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.”

Iran's Foreign Ministry said Tehran has a “legal and legitimate” right to respond to Israeli attacks, adding that they “cannot have been carried out without the coordination and authorization of the United States.”

It went on to warn that “the United States government, as the main supporter of this regime, will also be responsible for the dangerous effects and consequences of the Zionist regime's adventure.”

Vishwash Kumar Ramesh must have acted fast to seize his unlikely chance to escape, say experts in crashes and safety

‘I saw people dying in front of my eyes': British survivor describes Air India crash

Tony Cable, a former senior air crash investigator, has one piece of advice for Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India plane disaster: “Buy a lottery ticket straight away.”

The 40-year-old Briton walked away from the wreckage of flight AI171 after it crashed less than a minute after takeoff from Ahmedabad to London on Thursday, killing 241 other passengers and crew and dozens more on the ground.

Surviving with minor physical injuries seemed miraculous, but the focus on how Ramesh may have stayed alive turned to his seat on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner – 11A, an emergency exit seat near the front of the plane and close to one of the strongest parts of the fuselage known as the “wing box”.

After the plane slammed into buildings about 30 seconds after takeoff, Ramesh thought he was dead, but when he realised he was alive he saw an opening in the fuselage. “I managed to unbuckle myself, used my leg to push through that opening, and crawled out,” he said. It was not clear whether this opening was the door or a rupture in the fuselage.

“The aircraft was pretty nose up when it hit the buildings,” said Cable, a former senior inspector of air accidents at the UK Air Accidents Investigations Branch. “It has presumably broken open in an area of the fuselage adjacent to this guy and fortuitously he has popped out without major injury.”

Ramesh's seat had space, rather than seats, immediately in front of it, which may have given him more room for escape than many of his fellow passengers. It may also have meant that while the passengers in front of him may have been crushed together on impact, he avoided that fate, Prof John McDermid, Lloyd's Register chair of safety at the University of York, said.

“My suspicion is that because of the nature of the impact, he was in a strong part of the airplane at the front edge of the wing,” he added. “There is not just the fuselage, but the extra structure of the wing to protect from the compression of the fuselage.”

“It's possible that the impact loosened the door and he could kick it out and get out,” McDermid said. “The external door was only just in front of him so he didn't have far to go.”

But before Ramesh could even consider an escape, he had to have the luck to survive the impact of the crash.

“If you've got an accident like this, where you've got an aircraft full of fuel and it's making a crash landing off the airport into the built environment, that's unlikely to be a survivable accident,” said Prof Ed Galea, an expert in fire safety and evacuation at the University of Greenwich. “The fact that anyone has survived is miraculous.

“He seems to have been lucky in that: a) he survived the trauma of the impact, b) he wasn't severely injured in that crash, and c) he was sitting right by the No 2 exit. Whether he used that or exited via a rupture that was close by, is not clear. But he was very close to an exit point.”

Galea has previously carried out research on plane crashes which found that, in less devastating crashes, people sitting within five rows of a serviceable exit have a greater chance of surviving than dying while those more than five rows away were more likely to perish. He said he always tries to reserve a seat within five rows of an emergency exit.

Galea said other passengers may have also survived the impact but were too injured to evacuate or were not close enough to an exit point. Passengers who did not adopt the brace position may have struck their heads on the seats in front of them knocking them unconscious, but there were no seats immediately in front of Ramesh.

While the structure of the plane may have given him a chance at survival, Ramesh still needed to move fast to take that chance, said McDermid. “If he hadn't got out in a very few seconds, he would have been unlikely to make it out because of the fireball,” he added.

The plane had enough fuel on board to carry it to London Gatwick and this appeared to ignite upon impact.

Galea said Ramesh may have found himself exiting in front of the fireball if the aviation fuel had been pouring from the ruptured tanks in a rearward direction.

“He was a very, very unlucky man being on that airplane, but he was also a very, very lucky man being able to get out,” McDermid concluded.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Many who engage are ‘discriminating and value-driven', with a minority consuming ‘extremely misogynistic content', study for Ofcom suggests

Men who engage in the online “manosphere” and the content of Andrew Tate are often able to express a “strong commitment to equal treatment and fairness”, according to research commissioned by Ofcom.

Prompted by growing concerns about internet misogyny, researchers for the UK communications regulator followed the journeys of dozens of men through online content ranging from the US podcaster Joe Rogan to forums for “incels” (involuntary celibates). They found that while a minority encountered “extremely misogynistic content”, many users of the manosphere were critically engaged, selective and capable of discarding messages that did not resonate with their values.

They found it was far from a unified community: many participants felt the various subcultures under the manosphere umbrella were misunderstood, with extreme misogyny being grouped with benign self-improvement content. Several participants were drawn to it by its perceived humour, open debate and irreverence as well as connecting with views they found about traditional gender roles and family dynamics.

“This research does challenge the assumptions about the experiences and perceptions of individuals consuming manosphere content,” Ofcom said.

“Many of the participants expressed a strong commitment to equal treatment and fairness. They showed particular sensitivity to situations they perceived as unjust or discriminatory. This extended to issues specifically concerning men.”

The report's author, Damon De Ionno, the managing director of Revealing Reality, which was commissioned by Ofcom to produce the study, separately told the Guardian it “suggests society has overestimated” the risk posed by the manosphere.

It comes after rising violence against women and girls (VAWG) in England and Wales. Data published by the National Police Chiefs' Council in July 2024 found that about 3,000 VAWG offences a day were recorded by the police in 2022-23, an increase of 37% since 2018, with one in every 12 women a victim each year.

Separate expert studies have found some evidence that the language of the manosphere can escalate into physical violence. A submission to parliament by a group of UK academics cited cases in which incels had gone on to commit offline acts of violence, including Elliot Rodger in Isla Vista, California, in 2014 and Jake Davison in Plymouth, England, in 2021.

The Ofcom study involved 38 men, and more misogynistic men may have declined to take part. Some potential recruits refused to take part, considering the government-appointed regulator to be part of the “mainstream”. Perhaps the most impressionable group, boys under 16, were also not included.

The study investigated several manosphere subcultures, including “red pill” (men who believe the world is unfair to men) and “black pill” (those who believe unattractive men have very limited options for relationships) communities, incels, “men going their own way” (MGTOW), men's rights activists, pickup artists and “looksmaxxing” groups (where young men share tips about achieving chiselled cheekbones or “hunter eyes” in an attempt to boost their sexual “market value”), as well as topics surrounding self-improvement, masculinity and gender politics.

Some of the content trawled for the study was obviously misogynistic, including posts condoning sexual violence against women. In other cases the misogyny was more ambiguous, such as self-help posts about boosting sexual success based on assumptions about women's sexual preferences.

All of the men had engaged with content from Tate, the self-styled misogynist influencer who is facing charges in Britain including rape, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain, which he denies.

But one participant said they viewed watching clips of Tate as “entertainment” akin to watching a horror movie or playing Call of Duty, and the researchers said none of the interviewees had agreed with Tate's most extreme misogyny.

Incel communities contained the most extremely misogynistic content, the Ofcom study found. They were notably full of messages promoting depressive and suicidal outlooks.

“Our research suggests society has overestimated the risk of the manosphere to women,” said De Ionno. “It's not zero risk, but most of it doesn't have the power to radicalise people who are pretty discriminating and value-driven.”

The research examined the attitudes of men who had become involved in several different corners of the manosphere from relatively mainstream content creators such as Piers Morgan to more niche groups such as those that talk about being “red pilled”.

One was the MGTOW movement, which discusses living without women. It has been described as misogynistic, but Ofcom's interviewees insisted it was not because it was about choosing to live without women, not hating them.

One survey participant's pathway into the MGTOW part of the manosphere began with him being intentionally misidentified as a child's biological father, known as paternity fraud. Richard became involved in supporting other victims and came to believe that “feminist ideology runs through” the courts system. He stopped dating and said: “Once you've red-pilled about all this, you can't unsee it.”

Another man, Matt, said the MGTOW influencers “prey on any … amount of bitterness and resentment you have in your life from a negative situation”.

Ofcom said: “A minority of participants described encountering extremely misogynistic content online – with the most extreme examples more likely to be found on closed groups or among incel communities.

“These spaces were also notably full of messages promoting ‘black pill' concepts of self-loathing and hopelessness, as well as depressive and even suicidal outlooks. Participants that were more socially isolated offline tended to have greater depth of engagement within these closed communities, and so may be at greater risk of adopting harmful views or mindsets, due to their strong group identity and the individual's wider vulnerability.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Officers say 265 bodies found so far as families queue at Ahmedabad hospital to identify loved ones

The flight data recorder has been recovered from the wreckage of Thursday's Air India crash in Ahmedabad, as investigations continued into the cause of the worst aviation disaster in a decade, in which more than 240 people died.

The discovery of one of the aircraft's two black boxes “marks an important step forward in the investigation”, India's civil aviation minister, Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, posted on X on Friday. “This will significantly aid the inquiry into the incident.”

All but one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard the London-bound flight were killed when it ploughed into a residential district shortly after takeoff and exploded. Kanan Desai, the deputy commissioner of police in the city, said 265 bodies had been counted, suggesting at least 24 people died on the ground, but the final death toll remains unconfirmed.

Teams continued on Friday to search the wreckage of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft and the buildings into which it crashed, including a staff hostel at a nearby hospital.

In emotional scenes, hundreds of family members waited for hours at the Civil hospital in the western Indian city to give DNA samples, in the hope of identifying and retrieving their loved ones' remains. Doctors had worked through Thursday night collecting dental samples from bodies that had been recovered, one told reporters.

Ashfaque Nanabawa, 40, said he was searching for his cousin Akeel Nanabawa, and his cousin's wife and three-year-old daughter, who had been onboard. He had spoken to his cousin on the plane just before takeoff, he said. “He called us and he said: ‘I am in the plane and I have boarded safely and everything was OK.' That was his last call.”

Others hunted for people who had been in the damaged buildings. Many of those in the doctors' hostel were having lunch in the canteen when the plane struck; images of the area in the aftermath showed the aircraft's wheels and other parts embedded in the walls, while clothes and books belonging to the students lay scattered on the floor. Some steel tumblers and plates, still containing food, remained where they had been abandoned.

The plane, which was bound for London Gatwick, was carrying 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian, whose identities and tragic stories have been emerging as their families have confirmed their loss.

Among the British-based victims was Dr Prateek Joshi, a hospital radiologist based in Derby, his wife, Komi Vyas, also a medic, and their three children. They had shared a beaming selfie moments before takeoff as they sat on the plane. The media outlet NDTV said Vyas had recently left her job at a hospital in Udaipur to take the family to join her husband in the UK.

Akeel Nanabawa, a businessman based in Gloucester, also died, along with his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their four-year-old daughter, Sara. In a statement, their family said they were “widely loved and deeply respected. His quiet generosity, her warmth and kindness and their daughter's bright, joyful spirit made a lasting impact on everyone who knew them. She was a ray of sunshine in her school and they were a pillar of strength in our lives.”

A British man, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, who miraculously walked from the wreckage with minor injuries, has described the horror of watching people “dying in front of my eyes”. Speaking on Friday from a hospital bed where he is recovering from burns, Ramesh, 40, told the local broadcaster DD News that before the moment of impact the plane had seemed to be “stuck” in the air.

“When the flight took off, within five to 10 seconds it felt like it was stuck in the air. Suddenly, the lights started flickering – green and white. The aircraft wasn't gaining altitude and was just gliding before it suddenly slammed into a building and exploded.”

Ramesh, who was sitting in seat 11A, next to one of the emergency exits, had thought he was dead, he said. “Later, I realised I was still alive and saw an opening in the fuselage. I managed to unbuckle myself, used my leg to push through that opening, and crawled out.” He added: “I don't know how I survived. I saw people dying in front of my eyes – the air hostesses, and two people I saw near me.”

Downing Street said a hotline set up to support British citizens affected by the crash had received almost 300 calls. Foreign Office staff had been in contact with Ramesh to offer consular support, a spokesperson said, while Lindy Cameron, the British high commissioner in India, met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Friday to offer the UK's condolences and support in the investigation.

Modi toured the site of the crash on Friday and was briefed by officials. “The scene of devastation is saddening,” he said in a post on X. “Our thoughts remain with those who lost their loved ones in this unimaginable tragedy.”

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and UK. Experts from Boeing and the engine manufacturer GE Aerospace will also fly out to offer assistance.

Investigators were examining the jet's engine thrust, its flaps, and why its landing gear remained open, a source told the Reuters news agency, while Indian aviation authorities have ordered the airline to carry out enhanced safety checks on its entire Boeing 787 fleet.

The Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner issued a mayday call shortly before it crashed around lunchtime on Thursday, after lifting barely 100 metres from the ground.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US President Donald Trump, whose second term has been devoted to going it alone, makes his return to the G7 in crisis mode after Israel attacked Iran.

The G7 summit starting tomorrow in Kananaskis, Canada, marks the first major global gathering of Trump's second term, in which he has been even more brash in shattering diplomatic norms.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had set the agenda on largely uncontroversial themes such as building global supply chains for critical minerals.

That agenda could now be upended, as Israel launched a massive military campaign against Iran yesterday, saying it was taking pre-emptive action against its adversary's contested nuclear program.

The Trump administration has closely aligned the US with Israel, taking aim even at close allies who criticize its offensive in Gaza. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly defied Trump, who hours earlier had called for a diplomatic solution, and whose Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff had been due to hold new talks with Iran tomorrow.

 

A NEW LEADER 

The last time Trump attended a G7 summit in Canada in 2018, he stormed out early and took to social media to disassociate the US from the G7 statement and brand then-Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau as “dishonest and weak.”

The bad blood never ended, and Trump upon returning to office mockingly said Canada should be the 51st US state.

Trudeau handed over the premiership in March to Carney, who told Trump firmly that Canada was “never for sale.”

Carney has patched up with Trump through his analytical skills and competence, G7 Research Group founder John Kirton said.

Trump also has an incentive to keep the peace in Kananaskis — the US is to lead the G7 in 2027.

“He doesn't want to kill the G7 golden goose before he can produce the ‘biggest, best summit ever' for the whole world stage two years from now,” Kirton said.

 

‘AMERICA FIRST' 

Trump is expected to push back in Kananaskis if allies seek to moderate him, Atlantic Council senior fellow Rachel Rizzo said.

“He does not view these organizations as ways to deepen and expand American power and influence. He sees these fora as constraining America,” she said.

Europeans would observe Trump at the G7 to see how he treats their alliance, Center for Strategic and International Studies Europe, Russia and Eurasia program director Max Bergmann said.

“Our allies and partners in Europe are really questioning the US commitment and they are asking themselves, is this a relationship that is going to be maintained?” he said.

The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to visit Canada next week, his first since relations plummeted after the assassination of a Canadian Sikh separatist in Vancouver, triggering diplomatic expulsions and hitting trade.

Analysts hope it is a step toward repairing ties that soured in 2023, after then-Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau pointed the finger at New Delhi's involvement in murdering Hardeep Singh Nijjar, claims India furiously denied.

An invitation extended by new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to Modi to attend the G7 leaders summit in Canada offers a chance to “reset” relations, former Indian diplomat Harsh Vardhan Shringla said.

“This is a new moment,” The Asia Group India Practice chair Ashok Malik said. “A gesture has been made by Canada and it has been reciprocated by India.”

India is not a member of the G7, but is the world's most populous nation and fifth-biggest economy has been invited to summits since 2019.

The invitation is also a pragmatic reflection of India's role in global supply chains as an alternative to China, and with markets rocked by threats of punishing US tariffs.

“India is being called to the G7, because of its weight and size as an economy,” Malik said.

Modi's visit comes as Ottawa seeks to insulate its economy from the trade policies of US President Donald Trump — who is also expected at the summit.

Modi would have his eye on Trump, with an expected meeting to push a trade deal with the US — India's largest trading partner — before the July 9 deadline when Washington's 26 percent tariffs are set to resume.

“For Canada, mutually beneficial ties with India make sense today, given how the Trump administration has upended Washington-Ottawa ties,” the Times of India wrote in an editorial. “Add to this Trump's propensity to weaponize tariffs, and both India and Canada have enough reasons to cooperate on trade.”

SENSE OF BETRAYAL 

The unsolved investigation into the 2023 assassination of 45-year-old naturalized Canadian citizen Nijjar remains.

Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside India. That community includes activists for “Khalistan,” a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority carved out of Indian territory.

The Khalistan campaign dates back to India's 1947 independence and has been blamed for the assassination of a prime minister and the bombing of a passenger jet.

It has been a bitter issue between India and several Western nations with large Sikh populations.

New Delhi demands stricter action against the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India, with key leaders accused of “terrorism.”

Nijjar was a prominent supporter of the Khalistan movement.

Canada has accused India of directing a broad campaign targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil, which Ottawa said has included intimidation, threats and violence. 

Protests would be expected at Modi's visit, as Carney's invitation has inflamed fringe Canadian Sikh groups who expressed “anger and a sense of betrayal.” 

CHANCE FOR CHANGE

India sees Carney's leadership as a chance to put aside the fury that was directed at Trudeau, and discuss the Nijjar probe and Indian concerns over criminal gangs linked to fringe groups that operate in both countries.

“India has always offered that, with these issues on the table, we need to increase cooperation to ensure mutual interests and security concerns are protected,” Shringla said.

He also called Carney “a very mature individual” who views issues “from a larger perspective.”

Still, Modi's trip is only a first step, The Hindu newspaper said.

“It would be naive to imagine that these issues can be resolved in a summit,” it said in an editorial on Thursday, adding that it was “imperative” that ambassadors were restored and trade talks restarted.

“India and Canada must use every opportunity to reset ties,” it said.

By Shigeru Kitamura / Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun

11:00 JST, June 13, 2025

Lee Jae-myung, head of the left-leaning main opposition Democratic Party, has won the presidential election in South Korea.

There is no doubt that the removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his December declaration of martial law, which was found “unconstitutional and unlawful,” provided a tailwind for Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential race.

Japan's focus is on how the new president will steer the country's diplomacy in the future. The security environment surrounding Japan will change significantly depending on how South Korea advances its relations with Japan.

In the past, Lee repeatedly criticized Japan over historical issues and its defense cooperation with South Korea. There is much attention on whether the efforts made under the Yoon administration to improve relations between Japan and South Korea will stall or whether the Lee administration will adopt a pragmatic course.

One of the symbolic issues between the two countries is a series of lawsuits by former wartime requisitioned workers from the Korean Peninsula or their surviving families seeking compensation from Japanese firms. The Yoon administration established a third-party foundation under its umbrella to cover the compensation that South Korean courts had ordered Japanese companies to pay. Lee strongly criticized this solution as “diplomacy that exonerates the perpetrator and humiliates the victim.”

First and foremost, the issue of compensation was legally settled in 1965 when Tokyo and Seoul signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, as well as the Agreement on the Settlement of Problems concerning Property and Claims and on Economic Cooperation.

During the administration of Moon Jae-in, who, like Lee, was backed by the Democratic Party, rulings ordering Japanese companies to pay compensation to former wartime requisitioned workers were successively finalized. South Korea thereby resurrected a settled issue as a diplomatic matter, causing Japan-South Korea relations to deteriorate rapidly. Will Lee follow the same path?

Moreover, Lee repeatedly argued that Japan had not apologized enough for its rule of the Korean Peninsula and the issue of comfort women. Japan has expressed remorse and apology as articulated by the prime minister's statement in 2015 on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Nevertheless, Lee reacted negatively, even saying that it was “impossible to build an equal bilateral relationship with a nation that denies its history of perpetration.”

Lee was also wary of trilateral defense cooperation among Japan, the United States, and South Korea, as he thought it “could be used as an excuse to justify Japan's rise to military power.” After the Japanese government decided in December 2022 to strengthen Japan's defense capabilities and possess counterstrike capabilities as part of the new National Security Strategy, he criticized it as a step leading to the “resurgence of militarism” in Japan.

When Japan decided to release treated water stored at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, Inc.'s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant into the sea, Lee used the provocative term “nuclear wastewater.” Asserting that “the government's role is to protect the lives and safety of its citizens,” Lee denounced the Japanese government and the Yoon administration, which was cooperative with Japan.

If we take his words and actions at face value, we cannot dispel concerns about a deterioration in Japan-South Korea relations.

There are also concerns about the future of information sharing between Japan and South Korea regarding security matters. A breakdown in this sharing could hinder joint efforts to address regional security threats, particularly those related to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

In late 2018, when Moon was in office, a South Korean Navy vessel directed its fire-control radar at a Japanese Self-Defense Forces aircraft. This incident, along with other factors, led to a significant strain in Japan-South Korea relations. In August 2019, South Korea notified Japan of its decision to scrap the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan.

As GSOMIA is an agreement to ensure secrecy when sharing information about North Korean nuclear and missile programs, the Moon administration's decision could have led to a setback in Japan-U.S.-South Korea security cooperation.

The accord was set to expire on Nov. 23, 2019. At the time, I was right in the midst of the problem, having been appointed Secretary General of the National Security Secretariat in September of that year. Before that, I had served as Director of Cabinet Intelligence, tasked with collecting and analyzing information on key Cabinet policies.

I, of course, worked closely with U.S. officials to dissuade South Korea from discarding the intelligence-sharing pact, although I cannot go into further detail. On the day before the scheduled expiration, the Office of the President of South Korea announced that it had “suspended the effect of the notice to scrap GSOMIA,” effectively maintaining the pact.

In March 2023, the Yoon administration withdrew the notice of termination of the intelligence-sharing agreement and revived reciprocal visits of leaders between Japan and South Korea. It also advanced trilateral cooperation with the participation of the United States. In a related development, South Korea announced its own Indo-Pacific strategy, based on former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. It also pursued strategic objectives with China in mind, such as referring to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

During the Yoon administration, South Korea normalized its security cooperation with Japan and the United States. Still, the wide political swings between the left and right in South Korea made its relationship with Japan unstable.

This left-right oscillation is not likely to be resolved easily. It is rooted in a serious confrontation between the conservative camp, which transitioned the country from military rule and authoritarian economic development to democratization, and the left, which promoted democratization, launched a campaign to end regionalism and called for reconciliation with North Korea.

Yoon declared martial law in December, saying he did so to prevent the left-leaning opposition party, which he labeled as “pro-North Korea anti-state forces,” from “paralyzing the government” with multiple attempts in the National Assembly to impeach high-ranking government officials. The tumult in South Korea, which culminated in the impeachment and removal of Yoon, can be attributed to the intensification of the conflict between the conservative and left-wing forces in the country.

North Korea is likely to capitalize on the political rift in the South. In the past, Pyongyang had demanded that the Moon administration terminate GSOMIA. This time, too, the North will undoubtedly seek to establish its status as a de facto nuclear state by creating an “atmosphere of dialogue” between North and South Korea while playing upon the South Korean left-leaning group's policy of reconciliation with the North.

The security environment surrounding Japan and South Korea is becoming increasingly severe. North Korea has been sending troops to Russia in support of Moscow's aggression against Ukraine. In return, it receives Russian space and nuclear technologies — the North is thought to want nuclear submarine-related technologies in particular desperately. China continues its military rise, repeatedly conducting joint military exercises with Russia. Against this background, the need for Japan and South Korea, as allies of the United States, to strengthen cooperation is becoming even greater.

Due to Lee's fixation on historical issues with Japan, among other matters, he is often perceived as an idealist or a populist.

On the other hand, he has a history of emerging as an action-oriented, practical leader in local government. He is also known to show consideration for fiscal consolidation, such as through carbon and digital taxes and budget structure revamping. He has shown a pragmatic side by mentioning possible political compromises essential for government management.

Left-leaning politician Kim Dae-Jung was president of South Korea from February 1998 to February 2003. He flexibly changed his initial political stance after becoming the head of state.

Known as a “pro-democracy fighter” and a “human rights activist” in the progressive camp, Kim carried out pragmatic diplomacy as president. About South Korea's relations with Japan, he brought them to the best state since the end of World War II by prioritizing future-oriented bilateral cooperation while placing importance on settling past issues.

I can only hope Lee will follow the example of Kim and employ realpolitik foreign and security policies.

15:21 JST, June 13, 2025

The Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association released Thursday a statement on the internet and election reporting, saying member companies will push accurate information on elections as fears grow that inaccurate posts on social media could influence elections.

The statement adds that members will review how they have reported elections and reference the fact-checking methods that have been deployed overseas.

The internet plays host to much information that is either false or of uncertain veracity, including on social media. The news media group expressed concern that by significantly influencing elections, such information “could lead to the self-destruction of democracy.”

According to the statement, member companies “will review from the ground up how they report on elections, and proactively report in a way that provides information voters can rely on in decision-making, by making reference to international fact-checking methods and taking other measures.”

In 1966, the group issued a statement saying that there were no restrictions on election coverage so long as it was not false and did not distort the facts. The latest statement asserts that this perspective is “something that should be maintained even today, in the year 2025.”

Additionally, the group announced Thursday that it would create an account on X, where it will publish articles from member companies that verify the accuracy of election-related information.

U.S. President Donald Trump on June 12 praised Russia's role in World War II, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""confused"" why everyone ""hates"" Moscow.

Speaking at a White House press conference, Trump recounted a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron about World War II commemorations. 

""I said, 'You're celebrating our victory?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, ""Your victory?'"" Trump said. 

""And then I spoke to President Putin at the time. He lost 51 million people. He (sic!) fought with us in World War II. Russia did fight. It's interesting, isn't it? It fought with us in World War II, and everyone hates it.

""And now everybody hates Russia and loves Germany and Japan. It's a strange world.""

Trump said Putin had expressed confusion over the West's treatment of Russia post-war, citing the Soviet Union's wartime alliance with the U.S. and U.K. 

""We were your ally,"" Putin allegedly told Trump. ""Now everybody hates Russia.""

Trump's remarks align with a Kremlin propaganda narrative that downplays the Soviet Union's World War II non-Russian casualties. According to Ukraine's Institute of National Remembrance, Ukraine alone lost more than 10 million people during the war and suffered immense destruction on its territory — a fact often overlooked in Kremlin-led historical revisionism.

Russia has frequently weaponized its version of World War II history to justify present-day aggression. The Kremlin has invoked anti-Nazi rhetoric and Soviet-era heroism to rationalize its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022 — a war that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of millions.

Trump has positioned himself as the only leader capable of ending the Russia-Ukraine war, but his reluctance to apply real pressure on Moscow has left Kyiv and its allies doubtful. The U.S. president has softened his tone on Russia while repeatedly threatening sanctions over its attacks on Ukraine — yet no new measures have been imposed.

Talking at the press conference about the war and the stalled peace efforts, Trump said he was ""disappointed"" with both Russia and Ukraine, adding that ""deals could have been made.""

Trump has previously said that he refrained from imposing additional sanctions in hopes of securing a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. 

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said on May 28, adding that a decision would come ""in about two weeks.""

Despite failed peace efforts in Istanbul and Russia's continued refusal to agree to a ceasefire, Trump reportedly asked Senate Republicans to delay voting on a bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries buying Russian oil. 

The legislation, introduced in April, has broad bipartisan support, including backing from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Meanwhile, Russia continues its offensive in Ukraine and has shown no signs of seeking peace. It continues escalating its attacks on Ukrainian cities, causing numerous civilian casualties. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Kyiv on June 13 expressed concern over the security situation in the Middle East after Israeli air strikes against Iran, but stressed that Tehran remains a ""source of problems"" in the region ""and beyond.""

The statement follows what Israel called a ""preemptive"" strike against Iran overnight on June 13, targeting the country's nuclear program and reportedly killing top military officials.

""We would like to remind you that the Iranian regime supports Russia in its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and provides Moscow with weapons to kill Ukrainians,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Along with North Korea, Iran has been a key ally to Russia during its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing thousands of Shahed strike drones and short-range ballistic missiles.

Ukraine has called upon the international community ""to take joint and decisive action"" and deter a ""group of aggressive regimes — Russia, Iran, and North Korea.""

Kyiv nevertheless also warned that further hostilities could destabilize the region with ""negative consequences for international security and global financial stability, especially in oil markets.""

Israeli strikes were quickly followed by a surge in oil prices, Russia's key export commodity, with Brent and Nymex crude prices jumping by more than 10%.

""We are convinced that restoring peace and stability in the Middle East will serve the interests not only of the region but also of the entire international community,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

Iran has pledged a response to Israeli air strikes and accused the United States of ""also being responsible for the dangerous consequences of this reckless escalation."" The Trump administration has acknowledged it knew about the operation in advance but denied any involvement.

According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran has already launched over 100 drones against Israel in response.

The attacks took place amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to find a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear aspirations. A round of indirect U.S.-Iranian negotiations in Oman was scheduled for June 15.

Russia has condemned Israel's attacks as ""unprovoked aggression"" and a violation of the U.N. Charter. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha warned on June 13 that Russia has begun preparing strategic military reserves, signaling plans for military operations that may extend beyond Ukraine.

""According to our intelligence, Russia has started to prepare strategic reserves, which indicates plans for combat operations not only in Ukraine,"" Sybiha said during the Globsec conference in Prague, calling for urgent diplomatic and economic pressure. 

""Allies need full diplomatic mobilization to stop this war. This is not just a question for Ukraine. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin only understands strength, and right now it's crucial to apply sanctions in a timely manner, using them as economic weapons to pressure Russia,"" Sybiha said.

The comments come as Russia intensifies its military offensives and missile strikes across Ukraine, despite participating in two recent rounds of peace talks in Istanbul. The first talks were held on May 16, followed by a second meeting on June 2. While both rounds produced agreements on prisoner exchanges, they failed to secure a ceasefire.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a June 12 interview with Germany's Bild newspaper that Russia is using the talks to delay tougher U.S. sanctions, while continuing to escalate attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Russia also continues to issue nuclear threats to Western countries. Putin claimed on June 11 that Russia possesses the world's most advanced nuclear systems, with 95% of its strategic nuclear forces reportedly made up of modern equipment. 

Putin emphasized the need to significantly strengthen Russia's ground forces. Russian defense spending has surged to 6.3% of GDP, the highest level since the Cold War, as Moscow continues to ramp up its military investment amid the ongoing war.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Canada's main stock index declined on Friday, dragged down by losses in technology shares, as Israel's wide-scale strikes on Iran dampened global risk appetite.

The S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.5 per cent at 26,490.64 points.

Israel has warned that the strikes were the start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon. Iran has promised a harsh response.

However, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program, saying there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.

The downturn in the TSX was limited as investors shifted to safe-haven assets, boosting metal mining shares. The materials sector gained 0.6 per cent.

The energy sector rose 1.7 per cent to be the top gainer as the tensions in the Middle East sparked worries about supply disruptions, boosting crude prices.

“I don't think it's any surprise that Toronto Stock Exchange is going to hold up greater than New York, which is more based on technology or multinational corporations,” said Allan Small, senior investment advisor at Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.

“Gold and oil make up a big chunk of our market and anything commodities-based is relatively going to do well.”

The technology sector fell 1.5 per cent, while the heavyweight financial stocks were down nearly 1 per cent.

The benchmark index achieved a second consecutive record high on Thursday and appears poised to secure its third straight weekly gain, provided losses remain contained.

As of midmorning south of the border, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 659.45 points, or 1.52 per cent, to 42,313.10, the S&P 500 lost 60.38 points, or 1.00 per cent, to 5,984.88 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 227.71 points, or 1.16 per cent, to 19,435.01.

Oil prices surged nearly 7 per cent on fears the conflict could disrupt crude supply from the Middle East. U.S. energy stocks rose in tandem, with Exxon up 1.7 per cent.

Airline stocks dropped as fuel costs could surge if supply bottlenecks materialize. Delta Air Lines was down 3.7 per cent, United Airlines dropped 4.4 per cent, and American Airlines declined 4.7 per cent.

Defense stocks climbed, with Lockheed Martin, RTX Corporation, Northrop Grumman gaining between 2.2 per cent and 3.2 per cent.

“We have major domestic policy uncertainty and now on top of that, you have geopolitical unrest, which not only is impacting oil markets, but the broader risk premium,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management.

Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sub-sectors fell, with only energy stocks gaining 1.2 per cent. Financials declined the most, with a 2.1 per cent fall. Information technology lost 1.3 per cent, weighed down by Adobe's shares.

Adobe fell 6.6 per cent despite the Photoshop maker raising its full-year results forecast.

Most megacap and growth stocks declined. Nvidia was down 2.1 per cent, Apple fell 1.5 per cent and Amazon lost 1.3 per cent.

Visa shares hit an over four-week low and were last down 5.9 per cent.

U.S.-listed shares of gold miners rose tracking a rise in bullion prices. Newmont gained 2.2 per cent, while AngloGold Ashanti rose 2.1 per cent.

The S&P 500 remains 2.6 per cent below its record high reached earlier this year, following stellar monthly gains in May driven by upbeat corporate earnings and a softening in Trump's trade stance.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is about 3.8 per cent off its record closing high reached in December last year.

A tame consumer price report, softer-than-expected producer price data and largely unchanged initial jobless claims earlier this week helped calm investor jitters around tariff-driven price pressures. However, Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to keep rates unchanged at their meeting next week.

A University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment increased to 60.5 for June from the previous month, according to a preliminary estimate.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.88-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.4-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 70 new lows.

The G7 summit is being held in Kananaskis, Alta., next week amid a burgeoning trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

The four European members of the G7 face a delicate summit in Kananaskis, Alta. They know that U.S. President Donald Trump is in attack-dog mode on tariffs, defence spending and other issues and that lashing out against him could backfire. 

Ian Lesser, distinguished fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States and executive director of the public policy think tank's Brussels office, believes the G7 will focus on Mr. Trump – but the goal will be to avoid antagonizing him. 

“They aren't looking for a fight with Trump,” he said. “Part of their victory would be just having him there and engaged without any overt conflict with him.”

The non-American members of the G7 – Canada, Japan, Italy, France, Germany and Britain – know from experience that Mr. Trump can be a force of disruption at the summits, as he was in 2017 in Taormina, Sicily. There, he berated the other six for skimpy defence spending, threatened to leave the Paris climate agreement (which he later did) and shunned the traditional closing news conference. 

Ditto at the 2018 summit in La Malbaie, Que. Mr. Trump left it early after a spat about trade with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The U.S. did not appear in the final G7 communiqué.

The two-day summit in Kananaskis begins June 15, and the non-U.S. members no doubt have spent months plotting strategies. One option is to present a united front against Mr. Trump on tariffs, China, defence spending, support for Ukraine – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend – and other issues. Another option is to go soft on demands for fear of triggering Mr. Trump's wrath, which could see him unleash another round of tariffs.

Carney should ignore any antics from Trump at G7 and focus on business, Chrétien says

Certainly, the six have plenty of reasons to be wary of Mr. Trump – and furious with him – for the turmoil he has inflicted on global trade. Since taking office in January, he has imposed double- and triple-digit tariffs on America's trading partners, reversed or lowered them several times, then threatened to reimpose them, as he did in May with his vow to hit the EU with a 50-per-cent trade tax (now suspended until July 9). Today there is a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on most countries, though not Canada and Mexico, plus a 25-per-cent levy on autos. Early this month, Mr. Trump doubled the tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent, a level high enough to cripple Canadian exports of both products. 

A Reuters analysis says the tariffs have cost the biggest companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia – among them Porsche, Apple and Sony – more than US$34-billion in lost sales and higher expenses. The analysis did not include the damage inflicted on the thousands of smaller companies that are not listed on the leading stock market indexes such as the S&P 500 or Europe's Stoxx 600.

Since all the non-U.S. G7 members, plus the European Union itself (whose leaders will also be in Kananaskis), are in various stages of negotiating new trade deals with the White House, they will be wary of jeopardizing any progress they have made so far by angering Mr. Trump. For instance, if the EU fails to negotiate a trade deal by the July deadline, the threatened 50-per-cent levy may come into effect. If it does, the EU would almost certainly plunge into recession. 

“Tariffs are the keystone of his approach to the world, and no international meeting is going to change this,” said trade lawyer Lawrence Herman of Toronto's Herman & Associates. “Until the Trump ascendancy, G7 leaders tended to find consensus on major issues. It's hard to see that happening in Kananaskis, especially given Trump's unpredictability as well as the adversarial relationship between the U.S. and the Europeans and Canada.”

Since convincing Mr. Trump to back down on tariffs seems like a long shot, progress elsewhere may be pursued. Bulking up militaries will almost certainly be included. In principle, all the G7 countries agree that spending has to rise, especially among the EU countries, which face the prospect of the U.S. winding down its commitment to NATO, leaving Europe less able to confront a revanchist Russia. 

Carney lays out defence boost, says era of U.S. dominance over

NATO's current defence spending target for its 32 member states is 2 per cent of GDP. Mr. Trump wants to see it rise to 5 per cent. NATO, whose own summit will be held June 24-26 in the Dutch city of The Hague, is set to embrace that figure, though it could be fudged by allowing 3.5 per cent in hard military spending and the rest for infrastructure, cybersecurity and other outlays not directly related to weapons or military headcounts.

Defence spending in much of Western Europe, especially Germany, is surging. In March, the German parliament ripped up the government's “debt brake,” which will allow Chancellor Friedrich Merz to spend essentially unlimited amounts to rebuild the country's military and infrastructure. 

Still, some countries will resist doubling their military budgets. They will have to consider their positions carefully ahead of the G7 and NATO summits, since Mr. Trump has been insistent since his first term as president that the U.S. will no longer support a NATO full of cheapskates. Italy will almost certainly argue that it already has one of the biggest militaries in Europe, including two aircraft carriers and an order for 115 Lockheed Martin F-35s, the most advanced fighter jets in the NATO arsenal, suggesting that its relatively small military budget in no way means it is an inefficient spender.

With agreements on tariffs and defence bound to be hard work at the G7, easier victories will likely be sought. Mr. Lesser said they might strive for a common front on the relationship with China in areas such as intellectual property, investment screening and disapproval of Beijing's support for Moscow as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.

What is known is that Mr. Trump will be the wild card at the Canadian G7, as he was at previous G7s.

Editor's note: A previous version of of this article incorrectly stated that the G7 summit in Kananaskis begins June 17. It begins June 15 and ends June 17.

Good morning. When I heard about a small-business owner locked out of her Meta social-media account, it was a familiar story. She had tried every mechanism available to her, but the social-media giant provided no customer support and gave no indication it was even aware of the problem with her Instagram account. 

Soon, I stumbled upon a shadowy network of brokers and Meta employees who profit from helping to get accounts like hers back online. More on her experience, and many others, below. But first:

Hi, I'm Kathryn Blaze Baum, an investigative reporter with The Globe. 

Before I went on maternity leave in early 2023, I received a text in a group chat from a woman I know socially. Her business' Instagram account had been hacked, and she couldn't get Meta Platforms Inc. – the US$1.75-trillion company that owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp – to do anything about it. 

But then a friend of hers, who had just been through her own Instagram hacking and customer-support nightmare, made a suggestion: Reach out to a guy named Moe.

This mysterious Moe said he could expedite the recovery of her account. Desperate, she paid him $2,500. Sure enough, she soon regained access to her account – to all the engaged followers and customers she had worked so hard over the years to attract. 

I was intrigued, to say the least.

Who was Moe, and how exactly did he get the account back? Why was Moe, some guy who didn't even work for Meta, necessary? To what degree is this a big problem for small business owners, who rely heavily on Meta platforms for sales and growth?

Upon my return to work in the fall of last year, it was the first story I pitched to my editor, Greg McArthur. He, too, was curious where the reporting would lead, as was The Globe's cybersecurity and financial crimes reporter, Alex Posadzki.

Over the next few months, we conducted dozens of interviews and pored over hundreds of pages of court filings across Canada and the United States. The reporting brought into focus a lucrative and global underground economy – one where well-connected brokers collude with Meta insiders willing to abuse an internal mechanism and recover people's accounts for substantial fees. 

We spoke with 11 Meta users who lost access to their accounts as a result of hacking or because of purported violations of the company's community standards. Despite their persistence in filling out requests with Meta, not a single user was able to recover their account through formal channels.

Enter the brokers.

Moe is Mohammed Ismail, an Ontario man who, we came to learn, ended up in the crosshairs of Meta's legal team. The company sued Mr. Ismail in 2023 for allegedly offering unauthorized account reinstatement services. 

According to the court filing, he was working with Meta insiders who abused an internal mechanism intended to help employees and their friends and family submit expedited account-recovery requests.

But there was more. Meta had gone after other alleged brokers, including one who was a high-school student in rural Ontario when he first drew Meta's attention. He was accused of making at least hundreds of thousands of dollars selling unauthorized account services. 

In those cases – and in two others in Nevada – the company wasn't just trying to shut down the alleged brokers. It was also seeking orders to compel them to disclose the identities of their connections within Meta. 

We took our questions to Meta. We wanted to know how big the underground economy was and how many Meta personnel had so far been implicated in it. We asked about the company's reputation for having poor user support, about the internal mechanism being abused by its employees and contractors, and about what the company was doing to prevent such misuse. 

Meta told us the use and provision of unsanctioned account services violates its policies, and that people who offer such services in partnership with Meta personnel are deploying deceptive practices and exploiting users.

The company didn't provide us with individual answers to the upward of 30 questions we sent over the course of two months. The size and scale of the black market for unauthorized account reinstatement services, then, remains unknown.

One thing, though, is for sure: So long as users are unable to get Meta's help promptly recovering their precious accounts, there will be people looking for ways to capitalize on their desperation – and make money doing what the company won't.

New numbers show the market share for electric vehicles tumbled in the first quarter of the year, raising doubts about Ottawa's aggressive targets for battery-powered vehicles.

World stock markets tumbled and oil prices surged as Israel launched military strikes on Iran, sparking a rush into safe havens such as gold. Wall Street futures slid more than 1 per cent, and TSX futures followed sentiment lower despite the boost in commodity prices.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.82 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 slid 0.26 per cent, Germany's DAX tumbled 1.37 per cent and France's CAC 40 gave back 1.07 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.89 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.59 per cent.

The Canadian dollar traded at 73.26 U.S. cents.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Large anti-tourism protests planned across Spain","https://www.dw.com/en/large-anti-tourism-protests-planned-across-spain/a-72827312","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:20:56 GMT","

Overcrowded city centers and housing shortages that displace locals are among the many reasons why Spanish residents are protesting the influx of tourists.

Protests against mass tourism are starting up again just in time for the summer vacation season. They follow in the footsteps of large-scale anti-tourism demonstrations in vacation hot spots in Italy, Portugal and especially Spain in recent years.

The coalition of activists and campaigners that make up Sur de Europa contra la Turistizacion (Southern Europe against Touristification) have once again called for large-scale demonstrations on June 15 in Venice, Milan, Lisbon, San Sebastian, Valencia, Barcelona and the Balearic Islands, among other places.

Members of the group recently met for a conference in Barcelona to discuss overtourism, which according to the UN World Tourism Organization is usually defined as the point at which locals or visitors feel tourism has negatively impacted the quality of life in a region to an unacceptable degree.

That is the case for many people in Barcelona, where large-scale demonstrations with thousands of participants have taken place in recent years. Also in the mix are attention-grabbing tactics involving water guns.

In 2024, protesters in Barcelona doused unsuspecting tourists dining along the popular promenade of Las Ramblas in order to draw attention to the problem of overtourism. It worked — a media flurry followed, as did several other incidents involving water guns, which have become something of a symbol of the fight against overtourism in Barcelona. In April, for example, activists blocked a tour bus parked in front of the Sagrada Família — one of the city's top attractions — and soaked stunned tourists with water guns. Chants of ""tourists go home,"" were heard in the air.

""The kind of tourism we have today in Barcelona is not compatible with the lives of the local population,"" Daniel Pardo, a member of the Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth (Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic), told DW. Pardo has been involved in organizing anti-tourism campaigns for years. He and others want to stop rampant tourism growth which they say has resulted in noisy streets, air pollution and overcrowding in their city. ""The moment when it was still possible to find a balance came to an end a long time ago.""

Pardo specifies that it's not only about protesting mass tourism, but rather about going against a ""tourism-first culture"" that prioritizes the tourism industry over the quality of life of many locals.

Around 30 million tourists visit Barcelona a year, a city that is home to around 1.7 million people. The majority came from Italy, France, the United Kingdom and Germany, followed by the United States. According to city officials, the tourism industry generates around 14% of the city's gross domestic product and supports 150,000 jobs.

""Yes, that's always used as an argument for why we shouldn't complain,"" said Pardo. ""But we are still complaining!"" Many jobs in tourism are rife with precarious labor conditions with wages that are below average. ""Ultimately, dependence on tourism impoverishes the population.""

The level of frustration is also high on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Just like in Barcelona, there will be a demonstration in the capital of Palma on June 15 under the motto: ""For the right to a dignified life: Let's stop the touristification."" Other popular vacation spots on the Balearic Islands, as well as in Andalusia, in the Basque Country and on the Canary Islands have also criticized what they see as a ""tourism-first"" mentality taking over their cities. Topping the list of complaints is the increasing number of short-term vacation rentals, which critics say are partly to blame for rising rents that push out locals.

But the short-term rental market is only one aspect of how touristic areas are changing. In some Spanish vacation towns, traditional retail is also disappearing. It's becoming easier to find an ice cream parlor or souvenir store than say, a bakery or supermarket. As a result, locals feel alienated and are moving away.

""Tourism is driving us out of our homes, villages and neighbourhoods,"" Spanish group Menys Turisme, Mes Vida (Less Tourism, More Life) writes on their website in the call to protest on June 15.

In 2024, citizens around Spain also took to the streets to demonstrate against rampant tourism, yet despite the backlash — and the water gun splashes — tourists don't seem to be dissuaded from visiting. In fact, the country is predicting record numbers of tourists in 2025.

In 2024, almost 94 million international travelers came to the country, making it the world's second most popular tourist destination after France. According to a recent study by tourism lobby group Exceltur, the number of short-term rentals has jumped 25% in Spain over the last two years, despite the ongoing housing crisis.

The government has, however, made some recent attempts to mitigate overtourism. In recent months, there has been stricter regulation of vacation rentals. The central government in Madrid recently made it obligatory for short-term rental providers to register their properties in a newly created database in an effort to prevent illegal offers. And in mid-May, the Spanish Ministry of Consumer Protection ordered Airbnb to delete around 65,000 apartment listings that did not include the required registration numbers.

Last June, Barcelona's city council announced it would abolish short-term vacation rentals by 2028, and that licenses will no longer be renewed after they expire. Yet, for better or worse, tourism is one of the main pillars of Barcelona's economy. The growth of the sector has played an important role in the economic revival of the city, say city officials.

However, Jordi Valls, the city official responsible for tourism, admits that tourism in Barcelona cannot continue to grow at the current pace. ""We are reaching our limit,"" he said. 

Activist Daniel Pardo acknowledges that ""at least no politician dares to openly call for further growth"" of the city. But he pointed out that more concrete action needs to be taken to mitigate the problem and improve the lives of residents.

""We need a real debate about the limits of tourism,"" he said. The upcoming protest, he hopes, will see that debate happening sooner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","What's next for Iran after Israel attacks?","https://www.dw.com/en/whats-next-for-iran-after-israel-attacks/a-72899743","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:57:00 GMT","

Tehran has said it considers Israeli strikes on military leaders and nuclear sites to be a ""declaration of war."" A diplomatic de-escalation seems like a distant prospect.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said Israel will suffer a ""bitter and painful"" fate, following Friday's attacks on Iranian targets. Iran's military has warned there will be ""no limits"" to its response.

Israel's military has said over 100 targets in Iran were struck overnight, which were followed up later in the day by another series of strikes.

The targets included at least six leading nuclear scientists and four senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who were killed in attacks on residential buildings in the capital, Tehran.

Iranian media have reported that the IRGC commander-in-chief, Hossein Salami, was among those killed, along with top Khamenei aide and diplomat Ali Shamkhani, who also led a committee coordinating nuclear talks.

Iran has characterized the Israeli strikes as a ""declaration of war.""

""The current situation is the result of a lack of effective and functioning diplomacy between Iran and the US in the nuclear negotiations,"" Mohammad Sadegh Javadi Hesar, a former Iranian parliamentarian and editor in chief of the dissident Tus newspaper, told DW.

""This situation has created a space in which Israel is behaving undiplomatically and has drawn both negotiating parties into a military confrontation that neither was desired nor is desired by Iran,"" he added.

The US in recent months had restarted negotiations with Iran over Tehran's nuclear program with the aim of reaching a deal to keep Iran away from developing a nuclear weapon. In 2018, during his first term, US President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a nuclear agreement with Iran that traded sanctions relief for a verifiable Iranian drawdown of uranium enrichment. 

Israel views the Iranian nuclear program as an existential threat. The Iranian leadership does not recognize the state of Israel and regularly threatens to destroy it.

However, Tehran officially emphasizes that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a different perspective. According to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, Iran is enriching uranium to an extent that exceeds that of all other non-nuclear weapon states.

In a resolution on June 12, the UN nuclear watchdog declared for the first time in almost 20 years that Iran had violated its nuclear non-proliferation obligations. This provides an opportunity to refer the case to the UN Security Council.

In response to the IAEA's condemnation of the lack of cooperation, the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Agency jointly announced their intention to build a third uranium enrichment facility ""in a safe place.""

Javadi Hesar, an Iran-based political critic, told DW that the IAEA ruling has allowed Israel to legitimize its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

""Israel can now claim that even the IAEA has determined that the Iranian nuclear program is neither predictable nor controllable. Therefore, it is necessary to strike preemptively and destroy Iranian nuclear facilities out of self-protection,"" Hesar said.

""To prevent this escalation from turning into a major war, and to keep the confrontation between Iran and Israel at a low and limited level, the US government — as Iran's negotiating partner — should quickly condemn Israel's actions and make it publicly clear that it was not involved in this attack,"" he added. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later on Friday said the US was not involved in supporting or orchestrating the strikes.

IAEA chief Grossi, meanwhile, condemned the attack on Iran's nuclear program.

On Friday, he stated that, according to the Iranian authorities, the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz had been hit by the Israeli attacks.

Israel claimed the facility had been ""significantly"" damaged. The IAEA has not seen increased radiation levels at the site.

A second facility in Fordo and the nuclear center in Isfahan were not affected as of Friday afternoon.

Iran has spread its nuclear facilities over several locations, some of which are in underground bunkers, which makes it difficult to completely destroy them.

If Iran's nuclear facilities are attacked, Iran has little choice but to strike back for internal political reasons, according to Arman Mahmoudian, Iran expert at the University of South Florida.

He added Iran is concerned about a development similar to the Syrian war, in which Israel destroyed several nuclear facilities under construction.

""Iran feels compelled to send at least a limited but clear countersignal in order to prevent further attacks. Israel, in turn, could expand its operations and target Iran's electricity and oil infrastructure in order to increase the pressure on Tehran on a daily basis,"" Mahmoudian told DW.

Iran's first reaction was to fire more than 100 drones at Israel, all of which were intercepted outside Israeli territory, according to the Israeli military.

The Iranian armed forces released a statement saying that Tehran had ""no restrictions"" in its response to Israel's strikes.

Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh has said that ""new"" weapons had been tested and handed over to the armed forces. Iran has also called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

US President Donald Trump on Friday took to his Truth Social social media platform and called on the Iranian leadership to make a ""deal"" and warned otherwise of ""even more brutal"" attacks.

""There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,"" Trump posted.

Trump told US broadcaster CNN on Friday that the Israeli strikes were a ""very successful attack"" while it was left to Rubio to confirm the lack of US involvement. 

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the prime minister will speak with Trump at some point on Friday.

""So far, Iran has not wanted to be drawn into a direct military conflict with the US, which would be an extremely risky undertaking,"" said Iran expert Mahmoudian.

""However, there is a difference between the US merely supporting Israel and actively getting involved in a war with Iran,"" he added.

To completely destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, Israel would need more advanced weaponry that only the US would be able to provide.

Should such involvement occur, Iranian retaliation would likely also target US facilities in the region, which would further destabilize the already tense situation in the Middle East.

The UN nuclear watchdog has slammed Iran for failing to comply with its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in two decades.

The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA has condemned Iran for being in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost two decades, diplomatic sources have said.

The agency's 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution to that effect on Thursday, they said.

They said the motion, drafted by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, was carried by 19 votes in favor. Russia, China and Burkina Faso opposed the motion, 11 abstained and two nations of the 35 did not vote.

Iran responded defiantly to the resolution by announcing it would open a new enrichment site and upgrade centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility.  

""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said in a joint statement.

The IAEA board ""Finds that Iran's many failures to uphold its obligations since 2019 to provide the Agency with full and timely cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple undeclared locations in Iran ... constitutes non-compliance with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the Agency,"" the resolution text, seen by Reuters news agency, said.

Thursday's move could lead to further tensions between the West and Iran over its nuclear program and pave the way for United Nations sanctions on Tehran to be restored later this year.

The resolution by the IAEA comes after Iran failed to give the agency credible explanations for the presence of uranium traces at undeclared sites in the country.

The report by the agency at the end of May found that three of the four locations ""were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.""

US intelligence services and the IAEA have suspected for some time that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program it halted in 2003.

Iran has gradually been abandoning the commitments it made under the nuclear deal it agreed with world powers in 2015.

That deal, which collapsed after the US withdrew from it in 2018 during US President Donald Trump's first term, lifted some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear program.

The IAEA resolution comes as tensions in the region have been rising.

The US State Department announced on Wednesday that it was pulling out people whom it considered non-essential to its operations in the Middle East.

Staff reductions are being carried out at the US Embassy, and there are reports that personnel are also being moved from Kuwait and Bahrain over security concerns

President Donald Trump has also warned that Israel or the US could carry out airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if ongoing US-Iran negotiations failed.

Iran in its turn has responded with threats to hit US bases in the region if the US takes military action.

Israel, Iran's regional archenemy, has meanwhile said the world must respond ""decisively"" to Iran's non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.

When a black Jeep rolled into the Home Depot car park just after 8.30am on Friday morning, Abraham sprung into action.

As Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents dressed in vests and helmets climbed out of their blacked-out vehicle, he did his best to warn his fellow illegal migrants camped outside the hardware store in search of work.

“La migra! La migra!” he screamed, before sprinting away from the scene. Dozens of people tried to follow him.

“I felt very scared when I saw them coming but I ran like a flash and they didn't get me,” he says.

Like the 100 or so men who gather daily outside the DIY shop in Westlake, Los Angeles, that morning Abraham had been hoping to pick up a day's work from customers in need of help for their home improvements.

Most of those he was standing with are undocumented.

Nicaragua-born Abraham managed to escape but not everyone was so lucky.

At least 40 men, some of whom had lived in the US for decades, were handcuffed and detained by ICE agents who had raided a string of workplaces and Home Depot locations that morning, sparking a wave of volatile protests which have gripped Los Angeles and spread to more than 35 other cities.

Despite the pervasive threat of deportation, Abraham was back at the Home Depot parking lot on Wednesday morning to resume his search for work.

The targeting of day labourers in Home Depots, workers at car washes and clothing manufacturers marks a gear change in the administration's attempts to ramp up its deportation efforts in order to fulfil Donald Trump's “largest deportation program” in US history.

While officials had initially focused their efforts on those with criminal records, Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr Trump's hardline immigration policy, instructed ICE field officers to begin widening their nets.

Mr Miller has set a target of “at least” 3,000 arrests a day, a steep jump from the roughly 660 daily arrests during Mr Trump's first 100 days in office. He is understood to have directed ICE chiefs to start targeting spots where migrants congregate, specifically naming Home Depot.

It is a move that has drawn fierce opposition from not only Mr Trump's political opponents such as Gavin Newsom, the Democrat governor, but also from some of the Republican leader's supporters, with Florida State Senator Ileana Garcia, the co-founder of Latinas for Trump, saying the move was “not what we voted for”.

While demonstrations have brought parts of the state to a standstill, the ICE raids have continued at pace, with uniformed officers chasing farmworkers through fields and turning up at churches to arrest migrants.

While the majority of migrants have stayed home amid the ongoing threat, Abraham, a father-of-two, who crossed the El Paso border with Ciudad Juarez three years ago, says he has no choice but to take the risk and continue his search for work at Home Depot.

“I'm not afraid to come... I have to work because if I don't work I can't eat,” he tells The Telegraph as he cools himself from the California sun with a pink plastic portable fan.

Obdulio, another undocumented worker who managed to flee the Home Depot raid on Friday, had also returned on Wednesday despite seeing at least a dozen people “grabbed” by ICE agents.

The Guatemalan, who has lived in the US for 20 years, was frustrated he could not do anything to help his friends.

“You can't confront them because they're going to take you away, so what we did was shout at people to run and we kept running,” he says.

Obdulio, 48, who did not want to give his last name, told The Telegraph: “We are still in fear because we've heard ICE is still roaming here.”

“We're not criminals, we come to work honestly without harming anyone,” he adds.

Standing on the other side of the Westlake Home Depot car park, Edwin Cuadra, who is from Guatemala and has a green card, recounted how he saw ICE agents arriving on Friday morning in his car's wing mirror.

“Those who don't have papers had to escape, they started running,” he says.

The number of people out looking for work has since dwindled, he says, because migrants are terrified they will be caught.

“It's very bad,” he adds, becoming tearful. “They are my brothers, like my family. They need the money to pay rent, to pay bills.”

On the sixth day of demonstrations in Los Angeles, a largely peaceful protest of around 1,000 protesters briefly became chaotic when police on horseback charged at protesters and hit them with wooden rods before the area's 8pm curfew came into effect.

Officers fired rubber bullets and pepper balls into the crowd before carrying out dozens of arrests and packing protesters into police vans, but the streets downtown were mostly quiet by 9pm.

In recent days demonstrations across the city at times became violent, with some agitators setting fire to cars and throwing Molotov cocktails, fireworks and rocks at police.

Some of the thousands of National Guard troops controversially deployed by Mr Trump despite governor Gavin Newsom insisting they were not needed have been assisting ICE officers as they round up illegal migrants on raids, standing by with their rifles as agents arrest and detain people.

The 700 Marines sent into Los Angeles by Mr Trump will also accompany ICE agents on missions, officials have said, sparking fears that the administration could further intensify the pace of its raids.

Mr Newsom has warned the unprecedented militarisation of the state would spread further.

“Democracy is under assault right before our eyes,” he said on Tuesday. “California may be first, but it clearly won't end here.”

The Department of Homeland Security released an Uncle Sam style poster on social media on Wednesday urging members of the public to report “foreign invaders”.

As ICE raids continued in spite of the protests, on Monday morning a Home Depot in Huntington Park, around eight miles away from the Westlake branch, was targeted.

Eduardo Baz, 45, who illegally crossed into the US from Honduras 20 years ago, was lucky to have escaped. He had been a safe distance away when he saw federal agents starting to detain migrants in the car park at around 7.30am.

The only saving grace, he says, was that it was early so not many people had arrived at the shop. On Wednesday morning he was one of a handful of migrants who had returned to the car park hoping to pick up work.

“Of course we're all afraid,” he says. “All these years later, they can send you home in one swoop.”

“You're never calm, you're always afraid they might catch you at any moment.”

The cuts have already caused some 300,000 deaths and could lead to more than 3 million preventable deaths per year.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered the termination of all remaining overseas employees of USAID to complete the dismantling of the six-decade-old agency. USAID was an early target of Elon Musk and DOGE. We look at the dismantling of USAID and what it means for people around the world to lose this lifeline, as detailed in a new Amnesty International report. “We talked to somebody who actually saw IVs being ripped out of arms when the stop-work order came down,” says Amnesty's Amanda Klasing, who describes the consequences of the U.S.'s retraction of critical aid to countries in the Global South and refutes the Trump administration's claims that no deaths can be traced to the cuts. Now, lacking funding from the wealthiest country in the world, aid workers like Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council are turning to other countries' governments to bridge the gap. Egeland says, “The U.S. is leaving international solidarity and compassion completely,” even though, as Klasing notes, “It's been the leader of humanitarian aid, and it should remain so.”

Immigrants are only the first target of a rapidly expanding digital dragnet that can track our individual movements.

Immigrants are only the first target of a rapidly expanding digital dragnet that can track our individual movements.

President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard and military against protesters in Los Angeles is widely being interpreted as a display of intimidation and state power ahead of his birthday, when Trump will oversee a military parade in Washington, D.C. in the style of a dictator. The president has warned that protesters in D.C. will be “met with very heavy force.” Democrats and civil rights groups say the president is inflaming tensions to justify further repression, crossing the line into blatant authoritarianism as demonstrations against his administration spread across the country.

However, perhaps the greatest consolidation of state power is not happening in the streets, but quietly being hammered out in courtrooms and behind closed doors, where Trump's campaign of mass deportation is being used to justify a rapid expansion and centralization of the surveillance state.

“The idea that this is something that just affects immigrants is wholly untrue,” said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst and digital rights watchdog at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview with Truthout. “I think immigrants are the first target; it is a permission structure, and if they can get away with doing these things to immigrants, what are the legal barriers from moving on to the next undesirable group?”

This reality became brutally apparent on June 8 as law enforcement attempted to quell a protest through intimidation in downtown Los Angeles. A booming voice from a police helicopter hovering above the crowd announced, “I have all of you on camera. I'm going to come to your house.” As Truthout has reported, law enforcement across the country have embraced facial recognition technology despite numerous studies showing such software is racist and results in false arrests. Pro-Israel extremists used facial recognition to dox campus activists during protests against the genocide in Gaza, including international students targeted by the Trump administration for deportation.

Meanwhile, Trump announced that wearing face masks would not be allowed at protests. The president does not have authority to outlaw masking by decree, but he doubled down on Monday with a social media post declaring, “REMEMBER, No Masks!”

In a blog post this week, Guariglia and his Electronic Frontier Foundation colleague Adam Schwartz argued that wearing a mask at a protest is a perfectly legitimate form of self-defense — and not just from airborne viruses. Forcing people to unmask in public is a violation of privacy.

“There has been a massive proliferation of surveillance camera networks, face recognition technology, and databases of personal information,” they wrote. “There also is a long law enforcement's history of harassing and surveilling people for publicly criticizing or opposing law enforcement practices and other government policies.”

In response to the crackdown in Los Angeles, some protesters attacked self-driving Waymo vehicles, which have cameras that law enforcement have used to collect data on the public. Without a human driver inside, the autonomous vehicles have become a potent symbol of the rapidly growing, high-tech surveillance state, according to Emerald Tse, an associate researcher at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University.

“More people are seeing these technologies deployed in even more contexts, and that's why people are paying more attention to this issue now,” Tse said in an interview with Truthout. “People were tagging and burning Waymos, which suggests that they viewed the vehicles as an extension of the surveillance state. Those autonomous cars are a way to watch everyone, and that information is going to the government.”

While mainstream media has framed the issue in terms of surveillance of immigrants, data on all Americans is being sucked into a growing digital dragnet. Guariglia and other privacy advocates are sounding the alarm over efforts by the Trump administration and its Silicon Alley partners to consolidate personal data on millions of people at the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies. As law enforcement increasingly turns to private companies to buy data instead of asking courts for search warrants, a data broker owned by major airlines has sold customer flight records and personal information to Customs and Border Patrol, according to an investigation by 404 Media.

“You are seeing that federal agents working under this current administration are very openly using surveillance technologies to trump our free speech, to completely violate our privacy, and not even giving personal privacy consideration anymore,” Tse said. “That is the thing that I am seeing that is new.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is in charge of Trump's mass deportation effort, has worked with local police departments to turn networks of traffic cameras and automated license plate readers into a nationwide surveillance system that by 2022 was operating in cities home to an estimated 75 percent of the adult population, according to the Center on Privacy & Technology. ICE — which has collected at least 1.5 million DNA samples from incarcerated immigrants for nationwide policing database — recently inked a $30 million contract for system that can track people's movements with “near real-time visibility” with Palantir, the controversial data fusion firm co-founded by right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel.

And even as Elon Musk, the audacious tech bro and Thiel's Silicon Valley rival, makes an unglamorous exit from the White House, the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) “cost-cutting” project he started after Trump took office continues to dig deeper into our personal information. On Friday, the Supreme Court overturned lower court orders limiting DOGE's access to sensitive Social Security data, allowing Musk's colleagues unfettered access to personal information on millions of people while legal challenges wind through the courts.

The bolstering of the surveillance state goes all the way to the top. On March 20, as part of a flurry of moves meant to expand executive power before courts or Congress can intervene, Trump has issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to make all their digital data available to his political appointees. The order aims at “eliminating information silos,” which may sound innocuous in the digital age, but Guariglia said in many cases these silos were intentionally created by policy makers and Congress to protect personal data and maintain public trust.

“We like to envision government surveillance looking like hidden microphones in our houses, or the FBI looking through webcams, but we should also think about what happens when our bureaucratic information gets weaponized,” Guariglia said, adding that people will be reluctant to share personal information in order to file taxes or receive health benefits if they worry it could be used against them.

Real danger arises when government agencies use data for reasons other than why it was collected in the first place. Guariglia pointed to World War II, when authorities used census data to locate and force Japanese Americans into internment camps, a gross abuse of human rights that became one of the nation's darkest memories from that era. Census data is critical for maintaining government operations, but the system only works if people can trust that their data won't be used against them.

“A lot of these ‘silos' existed for specific purposes,” Guariglia said. “The 1929 Census Act was supposed to protect census data, and then the war thwarted that, and census data was used for Japanese internment.”

On May 30, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration is deploying Palantir's software to implement an executive order on information silos and share data across at least four federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (which includes ICE and Border Patrol) and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees health coverage for millions of people. The effort raises questions about whether the president is building a “master list” of U.S. citizens that would give him unprecedented surveillance powers, according to the report.

The report is based on public records and interviews with unnamed administration officials, and Palantir issued a statement denying that its software is being used to create a “master list” and accusing The New York Times of faulty reporting. Still, the news sparked angry protests on social media, with even hardcore Trump supporters expressing dismay that their leader had “flipped” and fell in line with the so-called Deep State, a bogeyman at the center of various conspiracy theories that Trump promoted on the campaign trail.

“Surveillance technology companies are the ones that are profiting off our taxpayer dollars, and they are doing it at the expense of our privacy free speech and human rights,” Tse said. “Palantir is just one of them. The current Trump administration is continuing to try to invest more in surveillance technology, and they have said that openly.”

Tse said government surveillance accelerated after 9/11 and continued to grow as technology advanced under Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2022, the Center on Privacy & Technology released an investigation into the sweeping surveillance powers deployed by ICE to deport immigrants, which includes accessing datasets containing detailed personal records of the vast majority of the people in the United States. By 2022, ICE had access to the driver's license data of 75 percent of adults in the U.S. and had scanned license photos for one-third of all adults, according to the report.

The Center on Privacy & Technology rereleased the report with an updated forward in May. The original report documented surveillance infrastructure that could one day be used by an authoritarian president to “coerce and control” the U.S. population at scale. “We did not anticipate that this day would come within three years,” the authors wrote in the updated version.

On May 27, the tech reporters at 404 Media released a report and a trove of government records showing that ICE is accessing data from automated license plate readers that are powered by AI and installed by local police in communities across the country. These devices scan license plates, allowing police to pull up information on drivers and track their movements. ICE does not have a contract to use the license plate readers or the data they collect, but records show ICE agencies lodged at least 4,000 requests with local police to access data on drivers as part of criminal and immigration investigations.

“Automated license plate readers, I think pound for pound is probably the surveillance system in America that most captures people and most affects people at this current moment,” Guariglia said. “It is possible months later, years later, to fully recreate people's daily routes in their cars just by accessing this data at intersections and cameras on the street.”

Guariglia said privacy advocates are constantly on the lookout for policing that involves gathering large amounts of random data that have nothing to do with specific crimes they are investigating, as such practices can be violations of privacy and civil liberties. Another 404 Media investigation recently revealed that a local sheriff's office in Texas searched data from 83,000 license plate readers and more than 6,000 cameras across multiple states in an attempt to track down a women suspected of seeking abortion care in the state. Abortion is banned in Texas, but the sheriff's office was able to search cameras located in Washington and Illinois where access to abortion remains protected.

“Once all that data is just collected and sitting on computers and collected by police departments, there are no rules dictating what they can do with it, and who they can give it to,” Guariglia said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","GOP Budget Puts at Least 200 Planned Parenthood Clinics Nationwide at Risk","https://truthout.org/articles/gop-budget-puts-at-least-200-planned-parenthood-clinics-nationwide-at-risk/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 15:16:42 GMT","

People who use Medicaid make up half of the total patient volume nationwide for the clinics' health care services.

If the budget reconciliation package before the U.S. Senate becomes law in the coming weeks, reproductive health advocates say the provision that would cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood clinics could serve as a backdoor nationwide abortion ban, eliminating access to 1 in 4 abortion providers.

The Republican-led bill, which already passed the House by a slim margin, is more than 1,000 pages and includes sweeping tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy coupled with steep spending cuts to social services, including Medicaid.

On page 339 of the bill, Republicans included a provision prohibiting Medicaid funding from going to any sexual and reproductive health clinics that provide abortions and received more than $1 million in federal and state Medicaid funding in fiscal year 2024. While there may be a few independent clinics with operating budgets that high, it effectively singles out Planned Parenthood clinics.

Planned Parenthood clinics rely heavily on Medicaid funding, not to provide abortions, which is not permitted by federal law (except in cases of rape, incest or life-threatening health emergencies), but to provide standard reproductive health care at little to no cost, including treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, as well as contraception. Planned Parenthood provides services for about 2 million patients every year, and 64% of its clinics are in rural areas or places with health care provider shortages.

A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said people who use Medicaid make up half of the total patient volume nationwide for essential health care services provided by their clinics. Even though those patients aren't seeking abortion care, funding cuts would affect the financial sustainability of those clinics, the spokesperson said.

The organization already identified that 200 of its clinics in 24 states are at risk of closure with the cuts but told States Newsroom on Thursday that further analysis revealed nearly all of those clinics — 90% — are in states where abortion is legal, and in 12 states, approximately 75% of abortion-providing Planned Parenthood health centers could close. The entire organization has about 600 clinics in 48 states.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” would result in nearly 11 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told States Newsroom she and other advocates have been meeting with senators to lobby against the bill's passage, emphasizing that it will have an outsized negative effect on rural clinics and hospitals.

“We are encouraging everyone to reach out to their representatives about this,” McGill Johnson said. “They know that they're doing this under a watchful eye, and we want to make sure their constituents know about it.”

The defunding effort would be a win for several prominent anti-abortion organizations that have long lobbied for this change and nearly achieved it in 2017 with a similar budget bill. Americans United for Life sent a fundraising email to its supporters Thursday saying this is a “crossroads” for abortion in America. 

“So far in 2025 more than a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics have closed, their taxpayer funding is hanging by a thread, and the highest-ranking federal health officials are undertaking a ‘top-to-bottom review' on the abortion pill,” the email attributed to CEO John Mize said. “It's possible that very soon, mail-order abortion could be walked back, and more Planned Parenthood locations could be closing their doors for good.”

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, another anti-abortion organization that helped draft the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint for the next Republican president, told States Newsroom in an emailed statement that the budget provision should be no surprise, and there are better uses for the funding, like community health centers.

“Republicans have identified budgetary concerns with funding Big Abortion since 2015, and the bill language to do so has remained substantially the same,” said SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser.

Planned Parenthood has already closed some clinics around the country, including eight clinics across Iowa and Minnesota at the end of May. Dr. Sarah Traxler, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood North Central States, which includes Iowa and Minnesota, said the U.S. Health and Human Services' decision to freeze Title X family planning funding to many reproductive health clinics at the beginning of May contributed to the decision to close those clinics. The North Central States affiliates serve more than 93,000 patients each year, about 20,000 of which use telehealth services.

About 30% of those patients use Medicaid to access care, she said.

“When Planned Parenthood isn't able to provide services to patients as an essential safety net provider, it has ripple effects across the health care system at large,” Traxler said. “We are already sitting in a time in our country, and have for several decades, where we have patients who can't access care.”

Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, told States Newsroom that 865 Title X clinics in 23 states are impacted by the federal freeze. She said there are no Title X services in eight states: California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee and Utah. She said the funding freeze affects one-quarter of all Title X funding grantees, translating to about 842,000 patients who have lost access to care.

“In the two months since HHS withheld federal funding for nearly two dozen Title X family planning grants, affected grantees have been struggling with the unknown of whether they will ever receive the vital funds,” Coleman said in an email. “Some have had to close clinics, lay off staff, and reduce essential contraceptive and sexual health care services. … On top of the Title X funding freeze, proposed Medicaid cuts will be devastating for Title X grantees. Rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs will increase, cancer screenings and diagnoses will be delayed, and decades of public health progress will be reversed.”

After the Iowa Legislature axed Planned Parenthood from its family planning program, Traxler said, the rates of sexually transmitted infections increased considerably across the state — an outcome verified by a 2022 medical study. She expects similar effects from these cuts.

People already travel long distances for abortion care, she said, and that will only get worse if more cuts come to pass. But she also expects to see patients start traveling long distances for routine gynecological care.

Like many independent abortion clinics, the all-trimester Maryland abortion clinic Partners in Abortion Care does not receive Title X funding. But because Maryland is one of 17 states whose Medicaid program covers abortions, they do see a lot of patients who are on Medicaid, at a significant cost to the clinic. Certified nurse-midwife and Partners co-founder Morgan Nuzzo said the clinic did not receive more than $1 million in federal or state Medicaid dollars in fiscal year 2024, and in fact loses about $1 million annually for seeing Medicaid patients.

Nuzzo said Maryland's Medicaid program reimburses first-trimester abortions at a “decent rate,” but at a very low rate for later abortion cases, which are more medically complex.

“After about 15 to 16 weeks [gestation], we're losing money on these cases,” Nuzzo said. “We've been billing now for almost a year through the state. In second and third-trimester abortion care, we're losing about 85% of what we would charge for a cash pay fee. So that comes out to about $250,000 a quarter that we are losing just by the under-reimbursement from Maryland Medicaid.”

For that reason, Nuzzo is hopeful about Maryland's new $25 million Public Health Abortion Grant Program, recently approved by Gov. Wes Moore. The program will be open to clinics like Partners and abortion funds like the Baltimore Abortion Fund, but Nuzzo said it could be a while before that funding is available. Right now she is uncertain and concerned about how the federal reconciliation bill could potentially impact Maryland's Medicaid program. 

Because Partners provides abortions for all trimesters, they see patients from all over the country, and even the world, and the vast majority need financial assistance, Nuzzo said.

“People are traveling further for their procedures, just like they were before,” she said. “The landscape is constantly changing, almost week to week, about where you can access abortion, which is confusing and chaotic to patients. Changes to Medicaid and insurance coverage of abortion only adds to the chaos.”

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

On the evening of June 12, Israel launched a series of major strikes against Iran. The targets included Iranian nuclear facilities, missile sites, and multiple senior military and political officials. In a televised speech, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared success. Iranian officials, meanwhile, swore revenge. Leaders across the region braced for unrest.

To better understand what Israel's strikes might mean, Foreign Affairs senior editor Daniel Block spoke with Daniel B. Shapiro. Shapiro served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East until January—charged with, among other things, considering scenarios in which tensions between Israel and Iran escalated into all-out war and preparing U.S. options for responding. Now a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, Shapiro has also served as U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Senior Director for the Middle East and North Africa on the National Security Council. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity.



Just how big a deal are these attacks? How much more serious are they than were the Israeli attacks on Iran in April and October of last year?

The full extent of Israel's strikes on Iran has not yet been revealed. But they are orders of magnitude beyond what Israel achieved in its April and October 2024 attacks. It is already clear that Israel was able to strike key nuclear sites, such as the Natanz enrichment facility, locations associated with possible weaponization research, ballistic missile launch sites, and numerous senior regime leaders and figures involved in Iran's nuclear program. That is far more extensive than almost anyone forecast.

As the details emerge, the degree of Israel's penetration of Iran's system will further embarrass the regime. Iran will be highly motivated to respond, but its ability to do so meaningfully in the near term will be hampered by the leadership chaos the strikes have sown. What's still unclear is the extent of the damage to nonofficial sites, or the civilian casualties. But Iran will probably try to match any losses they suffered in the civilian sphere, in addition to attacking Israeli military, intelligence, and leadership targets.

So far, the Trump administration has firmly distanced itself from these strikes. Why do you think that is?

Trump had sought additional time from Netanyahu for nuclear talks, and Netanyahu did not give it to him. By distancing himself from Netanyahu's decision, Trump is seeking to deter Iran from directing any response against the United States. Trump may also hope that he can keep nuclear negotiations alive. But his dream of a diplomatic resolution which ends Iranian nuclear enrichment appears dead. Iran is now far more likely to try to sprint to a nuclear breakout, leaving Trump with the dilemma of whether he will need to act militarily to prevent it.



What do you make of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement promising to protect Americans, but notably omitting Israel?

Rubio's statement was intended to signal to Iran that the United States was not involved, and that Israel acted unilaterally. The omission of Israel is a further indication that Washington does not want to be seen as having endorsed the Israeli action. But it is inconceivable that U.S. officials did not have prior knowledge.

Rubio's statement does not mean the United States won't assist in Israel's defense. It will.

Why did Israel decide to strike now, despite Trump's apparent wishes?

Netanyahu has long promised Israelis that he won't let Iran develop a nuclear weapon. It has been central to his political career. And I think he sensed that Israel might never have a better opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Israel decimated Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, in September 2024. It then destroyed Iran's Russian-provided S-300 air defense batteries—Tehran's most sophisticated—in October. Those two successes, combined with the fall of Iran's key regional ally, the Assad regime in Syria, have left Iran with far less ability to defend its nuclear sites or retaliate.

How can we expect the Iranian response to unfold? And how will Israel's defense play out?

Iran may try to launch as many as several hundred ballistic missiles at Israel. This is in keeping with how it responded to past Israeli actions. After Israel killed a key Iranian leader in Damascus in April 2024, Iran lobbed over 300 munitions, including over 100 medium range ballistic missiles, at Israel. In October, after Israel decimated Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran launched double the number of ballistic missiles. In April, Israel was able to avoid serious damage thanks to both its own air defenses and those of a U.S.-led coalition. But the October attack scored a few dozen hits that caused relatively minor damage. And earlier in June, Iran specifically pledged to strike Israel's own nuclear facilities in response to this kind of attack.

By concentrating its defenses on certain sensitive sites and civilian populations, Israel, with U.S. support, will probably attempt to prevent its air defenses from being saturated and minimize damage, as it did against Iran's two previous attacks. The United States has positioned two THAAD (Theater High-Altitude Area Defense) batteries in Israel to help. This system supplements Israel's Arrow missile defense, as well as nearby U.S. naval vessels with missile defense capability.



Israel will also almost certainly face additional attacks from the Houthis in Yemen. Hezbollah, even in its weakened state, might be called upon to retaliate as well. But the Houthis are unlikely to be able to generate a major barrage. And Hezbollah's reduced capabilities will limit its impact, as might pressure from the new Lebanese government.

Will Israel respond to Iran's retaliation with more strikes?

Netanyahu said Israeli strikes would continue until Israel is satisfied that the threat of a nuclear Iran is gone. So we may be looking at something more like a campaign, rather than a one-off attack. Whether Israel will then feel the need to respond to Iran's attempts at retaliation is going to depend very much on the level of damage and casualties it sustains. So a successful defense against Iranian missiles could have a deescalatory effect, whereas significant casualties will almost certainly lead Israel to seek to strike Iran again.

Last October, Israel sought to coordinate its response to an Iranian attack with Washington, which gave U.S. President Joe Biden opportunities to shape and limit the Israeli response. But Israel showed little interest in such coordination this time, and Trump may also find it is not worthwhile. This could mean Iran finds it more difficult to move down the escalation ladder.

The conflict is also unlikely to be over even if the Iranian military quickly backs down. Israel should expect an ongoing series of asymmetric attacks, such as cyber operations and terrorist attacks against its embassies, travelers, and businesses.

What is the likelihood that Iran attacks U.S. forces?

Much depends on messaging from the United States. Trump has made clear that Washington was not involved in the Israeli strikes and warned Iran not to target U.S. forces. If Iranian leaders understand that by engaging the United States or others in the region, it faces the risk of a direct U.S. attack that would compound the damage Israel has already caused, it is more likely to limit its response to attacks against Israel. It may well downgrade its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and try to rebuild and further bury and harden its remaining nuclear infrastructure. But Iran may choose not to attack actors other than Israel, in order to keep them out of the war.

Let's say that Iran does attack the United States, prompting U.S. retaliation, or that Washington decides to get directly involved to prevent an Iranian nuclear breakout. How might an American attack on Iran play out?

Some of the assets that would facilitate an American strike are already available. The USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group continues to be deployed to the region. Before a strike, a second carrier strike group might sail toward the area. Additional aircraft, such as fighter squadrons, tankers, and search and rescue helicopters, would likely also be deployed to bases in the region. The United States also has unique capabilities it could employ if it intended to target Iran's deeply buried enrichment facility at Fordow.

How would Iran handle direct United States involvement?

Iran would not absorb American strikes without retaliating. Iran possesses an arsenal of thousands of close-range ballistic missiles and drones that it could launch at American bases in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It used such missiles to attack U.S. forces following Washington's assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, in 2020.



Shiite militia groups in Iraq and Syria, armed with Iranian drones, could fire at U.S. bases as they did for several months following October 7, 2023. They might also target the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Troops and personnel at these locations may need to spend significant periods in shelters. Air defense assets at specific locations could be outnumbered by incoming munitions. There would be a risk of American casualties. The United States would need to press the Iraqi government to prevent Shiite militias from joining the fight, which it has done successfully since mid-2024. American forces would have to be prepared to strike militias that attack them, as they did several times last year. And the United States and regional governments would need to push the Houthis not to resume attacks in the Red Sea. They would need to be prepared to resume strikes if the Houthis resume them. Washington would also need to prepare for asymmetric attacks both in the region and in the United States itself.

Could Iran or its partners decide to attack Arab states, as they have in the past?

The Gulf states will likely condemn the Israeli attack in order to dissuade Iran from hitting their territory and assets. But if the United States gets involved, Iran might well fire close-range ballistic missiles at civilian locations or energy infrastructure in the Gulf states, in order to exact a price for what they would see as complicity with a U.S. attack.

Iran would also consider an effort to shut down the Strait of Hormuz to oil and gas tankers using a naval blockade, sea mines, limpet mines deployed by fast boats, or some combination thereof. Saudi Arabia and the UAE possess significant air defense assets, but all of these countries would still be vulnerable to strikes.

What does this war mean for the future of Iran's nuclear program?

Most estimates suggested Israel, on its own, could set back the Iranian nuclear program by several months. Public reports have estimated that U.S. strikes, meanwhile, could set the Iranian nuclear program back by up to a year. But those timelines assume Iran immediately starts rebuilding, and they do not take into account additional delays that could occur based on economic or political factors. Those estimates also do not account for the impact of deterrence or potential restrikes.

But it is likely that Iran will now make a desperate run to nuclear breakout. Trump, in turn, will be faced with a decision about whether to intervene militarily to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon. That decision will split his advisers and political base, given his long-stated determination to keep the United States out of Middle East wars.

Technology executives, national security analysts, and U.S. officials all seem to agree that the United States must win the AI competition with China. In October 2024, Biden administration National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned that the United States risked “squandering [its] hard-earned lead” if it did not “deploy AI more quickly and more comprehensively to strengthen [the country's] national security.” And in one of its first executive orders, the second Trump administration declared its goal “to sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance.” Washington has pursued a two-pronged strategy in its bid for supremacy: constraining China by restricting the export of key technological components and accelerating domestic innovation on foundational AI models. To achieve the latter goal, both administrations have pursued a program of relatively light regulatory oversight of industry leaders, targeted investment in semiconductors and energy infrastructure, and encouraging the adoption of AI across the federal government, especially defense and intelligence agencies, for uses as varied as investigating outbreaks of food-borne diseases and detecting financial fraud.

So far, these policies have enabled American firms to maintain their lead in market share and model performance over their Chinese counterparts. But Washington cannot and should not expect its lead to last forever. Recent breakthroughs by Chinese AI companies such as DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu, and Tencent suggest that the gap between U.S. and Chinese cutting-edge AI capabilities is narrowing, and that American supremacy in AI is far from assured. Even as it continues to vie for dominance, Washington needs to plan for a possible future in which the United States loses the AI competition to China—or, at the very least, one in which Chinese AI models are as popular globally. 

Preparing for the possibility that the United States will finish second, however, does not mean that Washington is doomed to repeat the failures of the 5G competition, in which the United States has struggled to provide affordable, innovative products as China charged ahead. Rather, by promoting richer frameworks that properly account for the features that make AI most attractive to emerging markets, by making it easier for developers to migrate between models, by building systems that allow users to compare the outputs of competing AI models, and by securely sharing U.S. data with model builders, partners, and allies, Washington can ensure that, even if it is unsuccessful in its bid for global AI supremacy, it will safely benefit from the AI revolution. 

Until the summer of 2024, the United States appeared to have a winning formula for AI dominance. Rapid model innovation emerged from a U.S. ecosystem that consisted of academic research, publications, and talent, private sector capital and development, and extremely light regulatory oversight. U.S. foundational models such as OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini had exhibited significant advancements since 2022, when ChatGPT first took the world by storm. In the past two years, AI tools have reduced instances of “hallucination” (the term used to describe the phenomenon of AI generating false or contradictory information), gained the ability to consume and produce images and sounds, mastered more complex tasks, and demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities. More U.S. tech companies, including Anthropic, xAi, and Meta moved quickly to develop larger models capable of mastering benchmarking tasks such as understanding speech and images, programming, and solving complex scientific problems as fast as they were concocted. As American models demonstrated their speed and mastery, their global market share and international users grew rapidly. 

By the end of 2023, the leading U.S. models were overperforming their Chinese counterparts by double-digit percentage points in response accuracy. But China has quickly closed the gap with a savvy combination of government initiatives such as the Next Generation AI Development Plan, an emphasis on AI education and workforce training, mighty research investment, close coordination between Beijing and the tech industry, and massive public investment in data centers, energy transmission, and semiconductor manufacturing. These efforts helped narrow the gulf between the performance of U.S. and Chinese AI tools on most popular benchmarks to single-digit percentages by the end of 2024. In the last six months, DeepSeek and Qwen have matched the performance of U.S. models, prompting fear that the United States' once commanding lead has evaporated. 

Meanwhile, China has taken the lead in integrating AI into high-tech manufacturing. Xiaomi, which started as a smartphone manufacturer, for example, uses over 700 AI-guided robots in its Beijing factory to produce a new electric vehicle every 76 seconds, on average. AI is widely used in Chinese cities for traffic management, surveillance, and law enforcement, and provincial and municipal governments are experimenting with AI-innovation zones to foster new applications in governance, health, and education. 

Moreover, U.S. export controls have proved less effective as barriers against the acquisition of advanced chips by China than many policymakers and industry analysts expected. Beijing has used shell companies and stockpiled chips to get around the controls and has accelerated its own domestic chip development programs. Chinese firms have also pioneered software development techniques to maximize already available hardware in order to optimize training and inference time and lower overall costs. Whether or not these gains have definitively put China in the lead, it is clear that the days of absolute American AI dominance are over. 

American AI firms may yet retain their global lead on many aspects of building foundational AI models. OpenAI, in partnership with SoftBank and Oracle, announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment project known as Stargate in January, and Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google all continue to invest billions of dollars in startups, AI labs, and talent. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud make up over 60 percent of the global cloud market, a critical resource for building and deploying models, compared with top Chinese provider Alibaba's four percent market share. But the pace of technological innovation that has propelled U.S. companies over the past three years could fall short of China's or prove unsustainable as advancements at the frontiers of AI discovery become increasingly difficult, the United States slips in the global competition for talent, and cuts to federal research funding undermine innovation. Washington should try to prevent this scenario. The White House Office of Science and Technology, for its part, has begun to develop a new national AI Action Plan, which is expected to be released in July. 

Still, policymakers should also plan for a world in which competing AI ecosystems coexist. Fortunately, Washington can find alternative strategies to ensure that the United States benefits from AI progress even if it does not win the innovation competition outright. 

First, the United States should look for new ways to demonstrate the merits of its models to global markets. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, through the AI Safety Institute and industry partners, could promote new evaluation frameworks for foundational AI models. Standard benchmarks mostly focus on raw capabilities such as language understanding, reasoning, and conversation abilities at the exclusion of other metrics—such as the models' transparency, accountability, and accessibility, cost of operation, and the ease with which the models' weights (the “knobs” to fine-tune a model to make accurate predictions) can be modified. New evaluative frameworks that incorporate these measures could be used to appeal to new markets and users, keeping U.S. companies competitive even if their models can no longer consistently outcompete Chinese models on the standard benchmarks.

As more models emerge, users will want to avoid having to decide between (and thus getting locked into) either the United States' or China's current offerings. In this coming world of AI consumer choice, minimizing migration costs between models will become an attractive selling point. The American AI industry can reduce the cost and complexity of transitioning to its models by lowering purchase prices and reducing the amount of software modification, hardware upgrading, and personnel training it takes to migrate between models. And Washington could lead efforts in the International Organization for Standards to standardize the application programming interfaces—the protocols that allow different software programs to communicate and exchange data—of foundational models, which could lower the costs of moving between models and reduce dependence on any one country's AI offerings. If Chinese models do take the lead, giving global users a degree of confidence that they can tap into the benefits of multiple models, as well as switch back to American models if the United States were to become number one once again, would be a wise hedge.



As Chinese (and eventually other) models grow more powerful and penetrate global markets, Washington cannot simply highlight the risks of censorship and espionage and expect U.S. and foreign companies to refuse to adopt them. Instead, U.S. companies must build systems and applications that run on foundational models but mitigate the risks of relying on any one specific model. Incorporating another software layer between applications and foundation models, known as an intermediate abstraction layer, can isolate the downstream systems from the foundational model, making them more independent and resilient. If the foundational model changes in ways that negatively affect the performance of applications or other models running on the foundational model or a new, better foundational model emerges, companies building downstream applications can quickly shift to a different foundational model.

The adoption of Chinese foundational models by U.S. users and companies does create real risks, including vulnerability to incorrect, skewed, exploitative, and even damaging outputs; exposure of sensitive data to a potential adversary; and the threat of service disruptions that could paralyze entire economic sectors. When they do build on foreign foundational models, U.S. companies will need to make sure their downstream applications are resilient against such threats. U.S. firms should build adjudication systems capable of comparing the responses of less powerful but trusted models and untrusted but more powerful models, determining whether a response from the untrusted model is satisfactory, warning users about potential risks, and preventing the use of incorrect responses. Such systems would raise development and maintenance costs and slow down response times as they weigh the competing responses, so U.S. policymakers should prioritize integrating an adjudicating system into the downstream applications that would suffer most from the introduction of unreliable foreign technology, such as medical diagnosis, fraud identification, and traffic control.

Finally, the United States should regulate the types of data U.S. developers and companies share with foreign model builders without defaulting to blanket bans on data transfers. Washington may understandably be wary of sharing U.S. data with China for privacy and national security reasons, but there may be instances in which the economic or societal benefits of fine-tuning a Chinese model with U.S. data outweigh the risks. For example, if a Chinese AI tool emerges that makes medical diagnoses and suggests treatments with far more accuracy than its U.S. counterpart, American hospitals should use the Chinese model even at the risk of sharing individual patient information, or even data from a larger population of patients that could be used to fine-tune the model to the U.S. population. In those instances, U.S. firms can ameliorate the privacy and security risks by data anonymization; data masking, which replaces sensitive data with fake or scrambled data; and differential privacy—mathematical frameworks that allow for the sharing of the data on groups while limiting the sharing of information on individuals.

Washington will want to standardize the new evaluation metrics and to develop guidelines for sharing data with allies and friends. It will also need to provide technical and financial assistance to partners who lack the expertise to migrate between models, as well as build and apply the systems that will adjudicate competing models. 

Washington faces an evolving global AI landscape in which absolute dominance is no longer assured. American policymakers cannot simply rely on jingoistic calls to win the AI race while ignoring the possibility that the country's early lead will not hold forever. Washington should still, of course, attempt to keep its lead. A more responsible—and realistic—strategy would promote policies that help the United State thrive while preparing the country in case it fails to achieve outright dominance. 

Otherwise, Washington will face the worst possible outcome: a superior competitor with increasing economic and military power enabled by AI, and a domestic AI industry unable to keep up, handicapped by its inability to build on Chinese models if necessary. Finishing second is not a death knell for American AI, but refusing to adapt to compete would be.

Last night, the government of Israel decided to roll the dice on a military solution to Iran's decades-long pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. Given the remarkable capabilities of the Israel Defense Forces, the operation could do tremendous damage to the Iranian nuclear program. But then comes the hard part.

Iran has limited options to respond directly. The danger, however, is that Israel has opened a Pandora's box: the worst Iranian response might also be the most likely—a decision to withdraw from its arms control commitments and build nuclear weapons in earnest. Containing those furies over the long term is likely to be the real challenge for both Israel and the United States. If the two parties fail, the Israeli gamble could ensure a nuclear-armed Iran rather than preventing one.

It's very early in this latest battle between Israel and Iran, too soon to know how long the fighting will last or how much damage the Israelis will do. Still, Iran now faces some significant constraints on its ability to fight back, end, or even retaliate against the Israeli campaign.

Iran's first problem is distance, and its second problem is Israel's defenses. Because of both, Teheran has little ability to use its air force against Israel. What's more, with roughly 700 miles of Iraq, Syria, and Jordan separating them, Iran cannot mount a ground attack against Israel—which would be suicidal against the far more competent Israeli army in any event. Consequently, if there is going to be a direct Iranian military retaliation, it will almost certainly be shouldered by Iran's missile and drone forces, which have proved to be of limited capability against Israeli defenses.

Iran's leaders might have learned from the embarrassing fizzles of attempted retaliations against Israel in April and October of last year that another such response will just make them look weaker. But both of those exchanges suggest the opposite: that Iran will feel compelled to respond against Israel, even if only for the sake of honor and to try to impose some cost on Israel for its attack. The Iranians have been working hard to improve their missile and drone capabilities in the intervening months, and there are reports that they have had help from Russia, which might make them believe that they can do better than before. Accordingly, a retaliation using missiles and drones is a very real possibility, although whether it will be one big salvo, several smaller ones, or constant, staggered attacks is hard to say. Israel may have its own aircraft and drones looking for Iranian launchers to try to prevent such attacks and could also be striking known Iranian storage sites.

Whatever the exact approach, it seems unlikely that another missile or drone attack would have much impact on Israel. Israel still has formidable missile defenses, its population is well sheltered, and Iranian munitions have small payloads and are relatively few in number. Even if more Iranian missiles and drones manage to penetrate Israeli defenses this time, they probably would not do much damage or kill many people, especially compared with what the Israeli strikes are likely to do to Iran.



Another option would be a cyber-strike. Iran has worked hard on its cyber-capabilities in recent years and mounted some potent attacks, including against Israel. In the summer of 2023, Iran began shutting down electricity to Israeli hospitals—that is, until Israel began shutting down much larger numbers of Iranian gas stations.

This back-and-forth illustrates the uncertainties on both sides. It's not entirely clear what cyberweapons Iran has up its sleeve or what vulnerabilities it may have discovered in Israel's infrastructure. But the Iranian leadership doesn't know what cyberweapons Israel has up its sleeve or what vulnerabilities it has discovered in Iran's infrastructure. Moreover, Israel has tended to trump Iran in the cyber-realm, and Iran's populace is more unhappy and prone to revolt than Israel's, which could add to Iran's caution.

Although Iran is routinely ranked as a leading state sponsor of terrorism, a terror attack on Israel, especially in the short run, would be equally hard. Israel's counterterror defenses are formidable, and terror attacks, especially large damaging ones, can't be conjured up overnight. They take months of planning, reconnaissance, preparation, and infiltration. Unless Iran has a long-planned terrorist operation that it has been holding in reserve, this, too, would be difficult to implement as a response to the Israeli campaign.

Then there is the prospect of a long-threatened and long-feared Iranian attack on oil exports in the Gulf, or even an effort to close the Strait of Hormuz. This also seems of low likelihood. First, this move would have such an enormous effect on oil prices and the global economy—and through them, on every national economy—that Iran would quickly go from being a sympathetic victim to a dangerous nemesis in the eyes of most other countries. Moreover, despite the fact that the Trump administration did nothing to protect Gulf oil exports from Iranian attack in its first term, closing the Strait of Hormuz would be such a severe threat to oil exports that the U.S. and other Western powers (and conceivably even China) would be virtually certain to use force to reopen the export routes. Although it might take the American military a number of bloody weeks to crush Iran's military forces and reopen the straits, the Iranians do not seem to be under any illusion regarding the ultimate outcome. And Tehran would have to worry that such a reckless threat to the world's economies would convince Washington that the Iranian regime had to be removed. That fear is surely greater with U.S. President Donald Trump—who ordered the death of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020—back in office.

The most threatening possible response from Iran is one that would play out not in the coming hours or days, but over the long term. Tehran could withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which is the legal basis for the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (or JCPOA), announce that it will build nuclear weapons as the only way to deter such “unprovoked” attacks on Iran, and then dare Israel, the United States, and other countries to stop it from doing so.

Iran already has enough highly enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons. This is containerized and believed to be stored at three different locations, and it is unclear whether Israel will be able to get all of it in the ongoing military strikes. Iran also has large quantities of uranium feedstock (called “yellow cake”) that could be enriched to weapons grade. The Israelis (and the U.S. government) believe that they know about all of Iran's functional centrifuge cascades, but the International Atomic Energy Agency believes that Iran has built many more centrifuges, the whereabouts of which are unknown. Even if they are not part of operational cascades, they could be integrated into them fairly easily, and Iran can build still more. Without IAEA inspectors in country to enforce the terms of the NPT and the JCPOA, Israeli and other Western intelligence services may have a very hard time finding new, secret Iranian nuclear sites. It may also have trouble destroying those sites even if they are identified, since Iran will likely harden them even beyond the level of its current facilities.

Discussions of Israeli options for stopping Iran's nuclear program often refer to the 1981 Israeli strike on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor. The mythology of that strike holds that the operation critically set back Baghdad's nuclear program, saving the world from having to deal with a nuclear-armed Saddam Hussein. But in reality, as analysts learned from Iraqi documents and scientists after the 1991 and 2003 wars, Saddam responded by pouring additional resources into his nuclear program, making it many times more dangerous than it had been before the Israeli operation. He likely would have produced an Iraqi bomb sometime between 1992 and 1995 had the Gulf War and the subsequent inspection regime not ended his program.

Accordingly, the real challenge—for Israel, the United States, and any other government intent on preventing nuclear proliferation in the Middle East—is to find ways to prevent Iran from following the path that Iraq did following the Osirak strike. If anything, the situation is more dangerous now than it was then, since Iran's nuclear program is so much more advanced, its scientists so much more knowledgeable, and its nuclear infrastructure so much more capable than Iraq's was in 1981. This creates the Catch-22, in which the best way to prevent Iranian reconstitution would be an aggressive pursuit of a new nuclear deal with Tehran, at precisely the moment when Iran's leadership will be least interested in one given their likely outrage at the Israeli attack. And without such a new deal, Israel may have succeeded in setting the Iranian nuclear program back in the short term—perhaps for a year or two—only to ensure the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran not long thereafter.

            The Trump administration will soon ensure that its 50% steel tariffs, which have threatened to make everything containing steel more expensive, will apply to your next fridge or dishwasher.
    


            The Commerce Department, in a notice set to be published in the federal register Monday, said the recently increased steel tariffs would also apply to consumer appliances that contain steel. Those so-called derivative products will be taxed an additional 50% for the amount of steel they contain, starting on June 23.
    


            Those products will include refrigerators, dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, freezers, ovens, garbage disposals and wire racks.
    


            President Donald Trump's broader tariffs have increased costs for some American manufacturers. Many parts and components are subject to Trump's tariffs, because they have no American-made alternatives – or the alternatives are more expensive than foreign products. And American appliance makers have griped about how competitors can effectively skirt those same tariffs by shipping completed products that aren't subject to the 50% levies.
    


            That's why the administration announced its so-called inclusion process aimed at preventing foreign competitors from getting around those tariffs. In theory, tariffs on imported appliances will make American-made dryers, ovens and other appliances more competitive compared with foreign equivalents, which are often made with relatively inexpensive parts and cheaper labor.
    


            At a US Steel facility in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, Trump announced he would set tariffs on steel imported into the United States at 50%, double their previous rate. He said some companies were skirting the tariffs when they were set at 25%, but he doubted anyone would be able to avoid them after he doubled the rate.
    


            Trump praised his tariffs for saving the US steel industry, claiming American steelmaking would have disappeared if he hadn't acted to impose tariffs. He said all steel would have been foreign-made and factories would have closed.
    


            Although tariffs may have given the moribund American steel business a much-needed boost, they could raise prices on a key ingredient for American construction and manufacturing – two industries Trump has said he wants to support. Spot prices for domestically sourced steel have increased since the announcement of the 25% tariff in March, as American producers haven't had to worry about as much competition from foreign steel.
    


            When Trump imposed some steel tariffs in his first term, US production expanded modestly, but it sent costs rising for cars, tools and machines and, in 2021, shrank those industries' output by more than $3 billion, the International Trade Commission found in a 2023 analysis.
    


            Trump in his first term placed 20% to 50% tariffs on imported washing machines, a levy that American manufacturer Whirlpool initially praised. But the company lamented Trump's steel tariffs, bemoaning the hundreds of millions of dollars in higher costs to make its products. That ultimately hiked the price of an average washing machines by around $90 and created just 1,800 American jobs, total, according to the Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Millions of protesters are expected at ‘No Kings' rallies nationwide as President Trump's military parade takes place on his 79th birthday","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/us/military-parade-protests-trump","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            As a military parade rolls through Washington, DC, on Saturday – President Donald Trump's birthday – millions of Americans are expected to protest in what organizers predict will be the strongest display of opposition to Trump's administration since he took office in January.
    


            More than 1,900 protests across all 50 states are planned through the No Kings movement, which organizers say seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
    


            The mobilization is a direct response to Trump's military parade in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the US Army – which coincides with his 79th birthday.
    


            In recent days, all eyes have been on Los Angeles, where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines, in response to massive protests decrying immigration sweeps – an extraordinary move that protest organizers say has only served to mobilize participants to speak out against authoritarianism.
    


            Demonstrators have since been protesting controversial raids and deportations in cities across the nation, including New York, Seattle, Chicago, Austin, Las Vegas and Washington, DC, while the administration has doubled down on its display of military force against its own citizens.
    


America's migrant workers are terrified to work but unable to stay home



            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has suggested that the order used to federalize the National Guard to Los Angeles could make way for a similar response to protests in other states. And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed the state's National Guard this week ahead of planned protests, including a No Kings event in San Antonio on Saturday.
    


            In Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe activated his state's National Guard on Thursday “as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”
    


            “We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest, but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state,” the Republican governor said in a statement.
    


            Following the Hands Off! and 50501 protests this spring, Saturday's demonstrations won't be the first nationwide rejection of Trump's policies. But organizers expect them to be the largest.
    


            “Even conservative estimates say that 3.5 million people turned out for the Hands Off mobilization in April. That's already 1% of the population of the US,” Ezra Levin, co-executive director of Indivisible, the organization backing the No Kings movement, told CNN in a statement. “No Kings is on track to exceed that by millions more. This is historic.”
    


            Officials have estimated Saturday's parade, which will flaunt 7 million pounds of machines and weaponry through the nation's capital on the president's birthday, could cost up to $45 million. Protest organizers are keeping the planned rallies out of Washington, DC, hoping to pull focus away from the spectacle.
    


            Instead, a flagship rally will be held in Philadelphia – with 60,000 to 80,000 protesters expected to attend Saturday, CNN affiliate KYW said. The Philadelphia Police Department said it is ready for crowds at LOVE Park, the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and Arch Street.
    


            Across the country, No Kings events will take place in all 50 states – including some with dozens of local events planned. More than 200 protest events are expected in California. And organizers expect especially big turnouts in Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte and Chicago, according to the No Kings website.
    


How Trump got the military parade he's always wanted



            Other groups are planning additional protests across the US, meaning the turnout against the Trump administration could be even larger than projected.
    


            On Wednesday evening, No Kings organizers spoke to more than 4,000 people on a Zoom call – many of them local hosts for Saturday's protests – preparing them for the intense weekend ahead.
    


            “If you show up on site, and you feel completely overwhelmed by the numbers – first of all, congratulations,” one organizer said.
    


            The leaders gave advice for the hosts and those serving as “marshals” – people designated to help address safety concerns and keep the peace on Saturday.
    


            Attendees emphasized safety and non-violence while role-playing scenarios with hypothetical characters – for example, a participant frustrated that not enough action is being taken to get the group's message out and a right-wing protestor there to harass attendees.
    


            Among their tips for Saturday: deescalate, empathize, listen, never touch a police officer.
    


            With political tensions rising after controversial ICE raids and the deployment of National Guard members to demonstration sites, many cities are already seeing protest activity ahead of Saturday.
    


ICE scrambles to meet Trump's immigration arrest quotas



            Meanwhile, local and state authorities have been doing their own prep work  – with officials warning violence by protesters this weekend will not be tolerated.
    


            South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who characterized the expected protesters as “radical anti-American groups,” warned that those who attack law enforcement or destroy property will be prosecuted.
    


            In Florida, Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey said peaceful protests are part of democracy, and people are invited to express their opinions. But he said anyone who breaks the law will face consequences.
    


            “If you throw a brick, a firebomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains because we will kill you,” Ivey said, according to CNN affiliate WESH.

            And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said drivers who are threatened won't be held responsible if they hit protesters, CNN affiliate WJXT reported.
    


            “If you're driving on one of those streets and a mob comes and surrounds your vehicle and threatens you, you have a right to flee for your safety,” DeSantis told podcaster Dave Rubin, according to WJXT. “So, if you drive off and you hit one of these people, that's their fault for impinging on you.”
    


            In Chicago, Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson has said his city will protect people's right to assemble while ensuring residents' day-to-day lives aren't disrupted.
    


            In New York City, “The right to protest peacefully is central to our democracy, and the NYPD is committed to ensuring that people can always exercise that right safely,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch posted on X this week as demonstrators in the city protested the Trump administration's immigration actions.
    


            Protest organizers say they have been in touch with local officials ahead of Saturday's events, in an effort to make sure the gatherings run safely and smoothly. The aim, they emphasize, is not violence, but rather to send a clear message to the president on his birthday: “In America, we don't do kings.”

            As the Supreme Court bears down on the most contentious stretch of its annual session, the justices have been taking detours in opinions that reveal policy preferences and simmering grievances.
    


            When Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered excerpts of a recent decision on environmental regulation from the bench, he segued into a zealous policy-driven admonition about government “delay upon delay” and the consequences for America's infrastructure.
    


            “(T)hat in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like,” Kavanaugh went on to write in his opinion. “And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.”

            Days later, when Justice Clarence Thomas joined a unanimous job-bias ruling, he penned a separate opinion that included an extraneous footnote decrying DEI. “American employers have long been ‘obsessed' with ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives and affirmative action plans,” he wrote, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, and referring to a brief from America First Legal Foundation, founded by Stephen Miller, now a top policy adviser to President Donald Trump. “Initiatives of this kind have often led to overt discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority.”
    


            And last week, when Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision giving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security Administration data, she stepped back and juxtaposed lower court judges' handling of Trump litigation with that of the conservative high-court majority.
    


            She variously described the lower court judges as “hard at work”; engaged in “thorough evaluations”; and issuing “well-reasoned interim judgments.” The Supreme Court's conservative majority, on the other hand, “dons its emergency-responder gear, rushes to the scene, and uses its equitable power to fan the flames rather than extinguish them.”
    


            Jackson has also made clear her disdain for the Trump agenda, referring in one case to its “robotic rollout” of a policy cancelling teacher grants.
    


            Policy preferences have long lurked in the background of Supreme Court opinions, despite Chief Justice John Roberts' insistence that the justices, as “umpires,” are concerned with the law, not societal consequences. What stands out these days is the willingness to overtly echo political talking points.
    


            Conflicts on the law, policy and all else among the justices are likely to deepen as they resolve their most difficult cases before a traditional end-of-June deadline. Still to be decided are disputes over state bans on medical care for transgender youths, parents' ability to remove their elementary-school children from LGBTQ-themed instruction, and the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship.
    


            Cases arising from Trump's orders, appealed to the court on its emergency docket rather than the regular oral-argument calendar, will continue beyond this annual session.
    


            The justices often split along ideological and political lines. Conservatives Roberts, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett were named by Republican presidents; the three liberals, Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan were named by Democratic presidents.
    


            Such fault lines emerged in a late May case over Trump's firing of the heads of two independent agencies, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.
    


            The dispute filed on the court's emergency docket, among several flowing from dozens of Trump orders since he returned to the White House on January 20, drew widespread public interest because of the possible impact on the Federal Reserve and the country's economy.
    


            If Trump had the ability to remove leaders at the two independent labor-related boards, he could arguably fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, threatening the longstanding independence of the Fed and destabilizing markets.
    


            In mid-April, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.” He blasted Powell for his measured steps on interest rates and for warnings about Trump's sweeping tariffs.
    


            On Thursday at the White House, Trump again complained about interest rates, called Powell a “numbskull,” but said he was not going to fire him.
    


            Chief Justice Roberts shepherded the court's action in the case, as the majority issued an order that allowed Trump to remove, at least for the time being, the two board members who'd begun the dispute. The majority then specifically added language to exempt the Federal Reserve.
    


            The exception – superfluous to the legal issue at hand – appeared to respond to the political atmosphere and possible criticism that the court's action was endangering the Federal Reserve and US economy.
    


            Justice Kagan called out the majority's move as a reaction to the politics of the day.
    


            In a dissenting opinion joined by the two other liberals, Kagan condemned the majority for favoring “the President over our precedent” regarding the removal of agency heads. (A 1935 case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, limited the president's ability to fire such independent officers.)
    


            “If the idea is to reassure the markets,” Kagan wrote, “a simpler – and more judicial – approach would have been to deny the President's” appeal for immediate relief.
    


            “Because one way of making new law on the emergency docket (the deprecation of Humphrey's) turns out to require yet another (the creation of a bespoke Federal Reserve exception).”

Follow:


            America seems headed to an angry and ugly place.
    


            Inflammatory incidents, rhetoric and dissent unleashed by President Donald Trump's tough immigration crackdown are inexorably building political pressure as a polarized nation barrels into the heat of summer.
    


            Stunning scenes in Los Angeles on Thursday, when Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was manhandled out of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference and handcuffed, epitomized a dark turn taken this week in California.
    


            But there's no sign yet of a path back from the brink before cascading confrontations and protests turn violent or even tragic.
    


            If anything, the crisis is deepening.
    


            The administration, led by a president determined to use every instrument of power — including a tamed Justice Department and the military — to enforce his will, is vowing to go harder, stronger and faster to target undocumented migrants. Even those here legally are not immune. The White House on Thursday told half a million Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans here on humanitarian parole they must return to their unstable, poverty-stricken home countries.
    


            Trump's extremism is now stirring a counter-reaction ahead of a weekend that will see hundreds of “No Kings” demonstrations in cities and towns, and after he warned against protests at a US Army 250th anniversary parade Saturday that will bolster his dictator's schtick on his 79th birthday. A president who pledged to use the military on “the enemy from within” said this week he wants troops “everywhere.”
    


            The political battle is also finally being joined by Democrats, stung into finding a voice and cause after their so far desultory efforts to rebuild after their 2024 election fiasco.
    


            California was already on edge after Trump defied Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and ordered National Guard troops to the city amid protests and then added a contingent of active-duty US Marines. But the television pictures of government security agents restraining Padilla and pushing him to the ground on Thursday afternoon created an instantly iconic snapshot of the national moment.
    


            Some caveats should be noted.  Any time a Cabinet official is in public, especially amid heightened political feeling, there is a concern for their safety. The horrific scenes after Trump survived his first assassination attempt last year remain a fresh national trauma. In the light of such experience, security details often act first and without waiting to establish the full context of a situation. It's perfectly possible Noem's agents didn't immediately recognize Padilla, even though he's one of the state's senators.
    


            “I was there peacefully,” Padilla said later amid fierce dispute over his conduct. “At one point I had a question, and so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room. I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed. I was not arrested. I was not detained.”
    


            Initially, Noem seemed to realize the incident could become a political liability. She explained that the Secret Service had feared Padilla could be an attacker, so they pushed him away. She said his behavior was “not appropriate” but said they'd spoken afterward in what sounded like a civil conversation, even swapping phone numbers.
    


            But the Trump White House never admits fault and always seeks political vengeance. Noem toughened here message when she headed onto Fox News. “This man burst into a room, started advancing towards the podium … he … continued to lunge towards the podium,” she said.
    


            The Homeland Security secretary's comments were quickly backed up by House Speaker Mike Johnson as the GOP launched a full court-press. “When they storm cabinet secretaries in a press conference, I think it's wildly inappropriate behavior, and I think it sends a terrible message in tone for the rest of the country,” said a speaker who helped Trump expunge the record of the January 6, 2021, assault by MAGA supporters on the US Capitol.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who has this week accused Democrats of supporting criminals and rioters and demonized undocumented migrants as pedophiles, wrote on X that Padilla should be “ashamed of his childish behavior.”
    


            In a less fraught time, Padilla might have acted with more discretion and the White House would have worked to mitigate the incident's impact on America's fragile psyche. But this is 2025, five months into Trump's second term.
    


            Whatever precipitated the incident in Los Angeles, Padilla's treatment — after he identified himself, when he was shoved out of the room as he tried to ask a question and then shoved face-first to the ground and handcuffed — was unheard-of.
    


            The racial overtones of California's first Latino senator being put under such duress will become a metaphor for Trump's ruthless deportation policy.
    


            “They use words like ‘lunge' and ‘charge.' He is not an animal; he's a US senator,” California's Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN's Kasie Hunt.
    


            In Washington, Democratic senators rushed to the chamber to exploit the moment. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz warned that his colleague's removal from Noem's briefing was “the stuff of dictatorships.”
    


            Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who has condemned Trump's use of the military in California, warned in a statement: “This is America.  Dissent should not be met with violence.”
    


            Across the Capitol, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Padilla suffered an “assault.” She added, “It's a federal offense to attack a member of Congress. … It shouldn't be anybody in our country to be treated this way.”
    


            Padilla was the latest official to face harsh action for perceived dissent. Trump administration prosecutors have already indicted a Wisconsin judge and a New Jersey Democratic congresswoman in cases arising from the immigration blitz. But the fact his roughing-up was on camera means it could be a powerful political launching pad for Democrats as they step up resistance to the president.
    


            In the initial reaction to Padilla's manhandling, there was just a hint that Democratic senators — part of an always self-reverential body — were most offended that the collective dignity of their august chamber had been affronted.
    


            But the quick and unified effort to frame the incident as an example of an encroaching Trump dictatorship suggests that the party might have found an opening at last.
    


            In some ways, the spectacle was not that different from the kind of on-camera stunt with viral social media potential that Trump has made a signature and that now dominates the populist Republican Party. A televised speech by Newsom this week finally satisfied the cravings of some Democrats for someone, anyone to take the fight to the president. His Senate colleague will never now be forgotten by Democrats after he introduced himself to the rest of the nation with the Thursday afternoon debacle that lit up cable news.
    


            But making a splash is only one of the Democrats' problems.
    


            Padilla's show of force does not necessarily point a way out of the conundrum Trump has set for them, namely that their public condemnations of his deportation plan allow the White House to portray them as soft on securing the border. Perhaps more evidence of administration thuggery could hurt Trump — and convince voters he is overreaching and inhumane. But the White House is still sure it's got the winning political hand on immigration.
    


            Democrats are also no nearer to producing a coherent policy and electoral position that addresses the public's desire to stem illegal immigration while reconciling liberal constituencies within their own political base. The Biden administration's obliviousness to a long-building crisis and public sentiment has given Trump plenty of political cover.
    


            But Thursday's drama poses an even more profound question: Do most Americans — notwithstanding their stark ideological divides — really want to live in a country plagued by ever-worsening conflict and disharmony?
    


            If not, Trump could be vulnerable and his iron-fist approach to immigration could end up serving as a microcosm of a destructive presidency.
    


            For sure, Trump's base responds to his outlandish rhetoric and strongman vibe. But no one would describe the White House's approach as a modulated effort to solve an immigration issue that has been haunting the nation for years. The crisis has confounded every president since at least Ronald Reagan. But while some commanders in chief have tried to solve it, Trump has been deliberately escalating the confrontation at every opportunity, seemingly to incite maximum discord and political stress.
    


            The president and his team argue with some justification that voters chose Trump last November because they were despairing over Biden's negligence at the border. The White House insists that protests cannot be allowed to stop deportations that are needed to keep Americans safe and to deter new waves of migrants that could strain the country's resources, unity and character.
    


            But they are also using the language of tyrants and demagogues as they seek to use the deportations to grab more and more power, to repress their political adversaries and even to threaten the choices of Democratic voters.
    


            During the news conference that was interrupted by Padilla, Noem warned that the federal government was not “going away” from Los Angeles. “We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and burdensome leadership that this Governor Newsom and this mayor placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city.”
    


            Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass are the democratically elected representatives chosen by Californians and the citizens of Los Angeles. Noem's comments only reinforced an impression that Trump and his team view Democratic leaders as illegitimate and blue states as enemies within the US.
    


            Trump's top domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller has spent the week portraying his boss's political opponents as supporting invasions and rebellions by forces outside the United States. “America voted for mass deportations,” Miller wrote in one X post this week. “Violent insurrectionists, and the politicians who enable them, are trying to overthrow the results of the election.”
    


            The country needs no reminder that incitement and extreme political language can provoke violence and threaten the rule of law and the foundational democratic principles of the republic. It happened at the end of Trump's first term.
    


            Historically, presidents have felt a moral imperative to cool political agitation when it threatens to splinter the nation and to heal such estrangements before they provoke strife and threaten life.
    


            Trump's entire political method seems designed to do the opposite.

Follow:


            A federal appeals court late Thursday paused a ruling that required President Donald Trump to return control of members of California's National Guard to the state.
    


            Senior US District Judge Charles Breyer had ruled that Trump unlawfully federalized thousands of members of California's National Guard and must return control of the troops to the state by mid-day Friday. But the order from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals puts that on pause.
    


            Breyer's ruling, nevertheless, is a significant win for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this week after the president called the troops into federal service in the wake of protests in the Los Angeles area over Trump's hardline immigration policies.
    


            “His actions were illegal – both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith,” the judge wrote in his 36-page ruling.
    


            Breyer, of the federal district court in San Francisco, said Trump had not satisfied any of the requirements that must be met in order to call up members of a state's National Guard and that the president had not complied with a procedural aspect of federal law that requires presidents to issue an order “through the governor” when they want to federalize state troops.
    


            “Regardless of whether Defendants gave Governor Newsom an opportunity to consult with them or consent to the federalization of California's National Guard, they did not issue their orders through him, and thus failed to comply with” federal law, he wrote.
    


            The panel of three judges from the 9th Circuit – two Trump appointees and an appointee of former President Joe Biden – said it will hold a hearing Tuesday on the issue.
    


            Trump on Friday morning thanked the federal appeals court.
    


            “If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now. We saved L.A. Thank you for the Decision!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.



            In federalizing the guardsmen, Trump pointed to a provision of federal law that says he can call up a state's troops to suppress a “rebellion.” But Breyer said in his ruling that “the protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion.'”
    


            “Violence is necessary for a rebellion, but it is not sufficient,” Breyer wrote. “Even accepting the questionable premise that people armed with fireworks, rocks, mangoes, concrete, chairs, or bottles of liquid are ‘armed' in a 1903 sense – the Court is aware of no evidence in the record of actual firearms – there is little evidence of whether the violent protesters' actions were ‘open or avowed.'”
    


            The judge added: “Nor is there evidence that any of the violent protesters were attempting to overthrow the government as a whole; the evidence is overwhelming that protesters gathered to protest a single issue – the immigration raids.”
    


            And he was extremely critical of arguments pushed by DOJ that the protests in and around Los Angeles against Trump's immigration policies constituted a rebellion.
    


            “(T)he Court is troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,” he wrote.

            “In short, individuals' right to protest the government is one of the fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment, and just because some stray bad actors go too far does not wipe out that right for everyone,” Breyer said. “The idea that protesters can so quickly cross the line between protected conduct and ‘rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States' is untenable and dangerous.”
    


            The judge also said Trump had violated California's rights under the 10th Amendment, writing that “it is not the federal government's place in our constitutional system to take over a state's police power whenever it is dissatisfied with how vigorously or quickly the state is enforcing its own laws.”
    


            “The federalization of 4,000 members of California's National Guard necessarily prevents Governor Newsom, as the commander-in-chief of his state's National Guard, from deploying them as needed,” Breyer wrote.
    


            Breyer also suggested that having too much firepower on the ground may be making things worse.
    


            “Federal agents and property may actually well be served by de-militarization and a concurring de-escalation of the situation,” the judge wrote.
    


            “Regardless, Plaintiffs and the citizens of Los Angeles face a greater harm from the continued unlawful militarization of their city, which not only inflames tensions with protesters, threatening increased hostilities and loss of life, but deprives the state for two months of its own use of thousands of National Guard members to fight fires, combat the fentanyl trade, and perform other critical functions,” he added.
    


            Attorneys from DOJ had argued during a hearing earlier Thursday that Trump's actions were lawful, pushing back on claims by the state that the president had violated federal law because he didn't involve Newsom in the process of federalizing the troops.
    


            Importantly, Breyer on Thursday did temporarily bar Trump from using Marines for law enforcement activities in California, as the state had requested. He noted that there was dispute between each side over whether both the federalized guardsmen and several hundred Marines deployed to LA would be engaged in such activities.
    


            “The Court does not at this point reach any conclusion on this issue,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration this week provided deportation officials with personal data -- including the immigration status -- on millions of Medicaid enrollees, a move that could make it easier to locate people as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.

An internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, citing legal and ethical concerns. 

Nevertheless, two top advisers to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the dataset handed over to the Department of Homeland Security, the emails show. Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were given just 54 minutes on Tuesday to comply with the directive.

The dataset includes the information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. CMS transferred the information just as the Trump administration was ramping up its enforcement efforts in Southern California. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom 's office said in a statement that it was concerned about how deportation officials might utilize the data, especially as federal authorities conduct immigration raids with the assistance of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles.

“We deeply value the privacy of all Californians,” the statement said. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.” 




U.S. Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the data sharing was legal. He declined to answer questions about why the data was shared with DHS and how it would be used.

“With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said. 

DHS officials did not respond to requests for comment. 

Besides helping authorities locate migrants, experts said, the government could also use the information to scuttle the hopes of migrants seeking green cards, permanent residency or citizenship if they had ever obtained Medicaid benefits funded by the federal government. 

CMS announced late last month that it was reviewing some state's Medicaid enrollees to ensure federal funds have not been used to pay for coverage for people with “unsatisfactory immigration status.” In a letter sent to state Medicaid officials, CMS said that the effort was part of Trump's Feb. 19 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.” 

As part of the review, California, Washington and Illinois shared details about non-U.S. citizens who have enrolled in their state's Medicaid program, according to a June 6 memo signed by Medicaid Deputy Director Sara Vitolo that was obtained by the AP. The memo was written by several CMS officials under Vitolo's supervision, according to sources familiar with the process.

The data includes addresses, names, social security numbers and claims data for enrollees in those states, according to the memo and two people familiar with what the states sent to CMS. Both individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details about the data exchange.

CMS officials attempted to fight the data sharing request from Homeland Security, saying that to do so would violate federal laws, including the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, according to Vitolo's memo. 

“Multiple federal statutory and regulatory authorities do not permit CMS to share this information with entities outside of CMS,” Vitolo wrote, further explaining that the sharing of such personal data is only allowed for directly administering the Medicaid program. 

Sharing information about Medicaid applicants or enrollees with DHS officials would violate a “longstanding policy,” wrote Vitolo, a career employee, to Trump appointee Kim Brandt, deputy administrator and chief operating officer of CMS .

Vitolo and Brandt could not be reached for comment.

The legal arguments outlined in the memo were not persuasive to Trump appointees at HHS, which oversees the Medicaid agency.

Four days after the memo was sent, on June 10, HHS officials directed the transfer of “the data to DHS by 5:30 ET today,” according to email exchanges obtained by AP.

Former government officials said the move was unusual because CMS, which has access to personal health data for nearly half of the country, does not typically share such sensitive information with other departments. 

“DHS has no role in anything related to Medicaid,” said Jeffrey Grant, a former career employee at CMS. 

Beyond her legal arguments, Vitolo said sharing the information with DHS could have a chilling effect on states, perhaps prompting them to withhold information. States, she added needed to guard against the “legal risk” they were taking by giving federal officials data that could be shared with deportation officials. 

All states must legally provide emergency Medicaid services to non-U.S. citizens, including to those who are lawfully present but have not yet met a five-year wait to apply for Medicaid. 

Seven states, along with the District, allow immigrants who are not living legally in the country to enroll — with full benefits — in their state's Medicaid program. The states launched these programs during the Biden administration and said they would not bill the federal government to cover those immigrants' health care costs. 

The Trump administration has raised doubts about that pledge. 

Nixon, the HHS spokesman, said that the state's Medicaid programs for immigrants “opened the floodgates for illegal immigrants to exploit Medicaid – and forced hardworking Americans to foot the bill.” 

All of the states — California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado — have Democratic governors. Due to his state's budget woes, Newsom announced earlier this year he would freeze enrollment into the program; Illinois will also shut down its program for roughly 30,000 non-U.S. citizens in July. 

The remaining states — New York, Oregon, Minnesota and Colorado — have not yet submitted the identifiable data to CMS as part of the review, according to a public health official who has reviewed CMS' requests to the states. 

State health officials from the District, Washington and Illinois did not respond to requests for comment. 

Newsom's office said in its statement that the data sharing has “implications for all Californians, but it is especially concerning for vulnerable communities.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is shifting military resources, including ships, in the Middle East in response to Israel's strikes on Iran and a possible retaliatory attack by Tehran, U.S. officials said Friday.

The Navy has directed the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner, which is capable of defending against ballistic missiles, to begin sailing from the western Mediterranean Sea toward the eastern Mediterranean and has directed a second destroyer to begin moving forward so it can be available if requested by the White House.

American fighter jets also are patrolling the sky in the Middle East to protect personnel and installations, an official said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public or to discuss ongoing operations.

President Donald Trump was meeting with his National Security Council principals Friday to discuss the situation. 

The forces in the region have been taking precautionary measures for days, including having military dependents voluntarily depart regional bases, in anticipation of the strikes and to protect those personnel in case of a large-scale response from Tehran.

Typically around 30,000 troops are based in the Middle East, and about 40,000 troops are in the region now, according to a U.S. official. That number surged as high as 43,000 last October amid the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran as well as continuous attacks on commercial and military ships in the Red Sea by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.




The Navy has additional assets that it could surge to the Middle East if needed, particularly its aircraft carriers and the warships that sail with them. The USS Carl Vinson is in the Arabian Sea — the only aircraft carrier in the region.

The carrier USS Nimitz is in the Indo-Pacific and could be directed toward the Middle East if needed, and the USS George Washington just left its port in Japan and could be directed to the region if so ordered, one of the officials said. 

Then-President Joe Biden initially surged ships to protect Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas that launched the war in Gaza. It was seen as a deterrent against Hezbollah and Iran at the time.

On Oct. 1, 2024, U.S. Navy destroyers fired about a dozen interceptors in defense of Israel as the country came under attack by more than 200 missiles fired by Iran.

Elon Musk's image has lost some of its luster with Republicans since the tech billionaire's messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds. 

Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog “very favorably” compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 




Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation — and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts — may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party. 

“Some things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,” said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to “somewhat favorable.” 

“I liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he's kind of hurting,” said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. “I also don't feel like he matters that much. He's not actually part of the government. He's just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.”

Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between “very” and “somewhat” strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.

Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans' feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump's 2024 election effort. 

After decrying the GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill as “a disgusting abomination,” Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.” 

The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as “very favorable” has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April. 

Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.

Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla “somewhat unfavorable” because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company's owner with the president's agenda.

“I don't favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don't care too much for Tesla,” said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.

While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.

The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority. 

Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort. 

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wrote. “Such ingratitude.” 

Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they “went too far.”

Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world's leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers — notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors. 




Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands. 

Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business. 

And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021. 

“My government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,” Mills said. “I do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.”

Leaders from the world's richest countries will gather for a Group of Seven summit, starting Sunday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump wages a trade war against them. Later in June Trump is scheduled to attend a NATO summit in Europe.

TORONTO (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will arrive Sunday for a Group of Seven summit in a country he has suggested should be annexed and as he wages a trade war with America's longstanding allies.

Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president's increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.

Carney asserted this week that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, imposing tariffs for access to its markets and reducing its contributions to collective security.

Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqué, at the summit's conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.

The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.

Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit's final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqué after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.

The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.




The Group of Seven comprises Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Britain. The European Union also attends as well as other heads of state who are not part of the G7 but have been invited by Carney.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their contentious Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.

Other world leaders will be meeting with Trump both in a group setting and for bilateral talks, which are often precarious as foreign leaders must navigate between placating and confronting him.

“Anything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can't tell. That's Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,” said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.

“It all depends what kind of theater he's going to want to have,” he said.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend and said she expects to have her first in-person meeting with Trump. On his way to Canada, Macron is making a notable stop in Greenland, the semi autonomous Danish territory that the U.S. president has also suggested annexing.

Among the other newcomers are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.

Starmer will meet with Carney on Saturday in Ottawa before flying to Alberta.

Carney also invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite accusations from Canada's national police force that agents of Modi's government were involved in “widespread” violence in Canada.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, was invited but will not attend.

The 2018 G7 summit in Quebec was thrown into disarray after Trump called Trudeau “dishonest” and “weak,” while complaining that he had been blindsided by Trudeau's criticism of Trump's tariff threats at a summit-ending news conference. Trump pulled out of the G7 group statement just as it was released. 

“We weren't too happy because we thought we managed to pull off a pretty good summit,” said Peter Boehm, Canada's deputy minister for the Quebec summit.” The reaction — and I was with Mr. Trudeau at the time — was a bit of disbelief.”

Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders. 

During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea.

“Trump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,” Boehm recalled. “It was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.”

Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.

U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has said that Carney has been quietly holding direct talks with Trump about a trade deal in the lead up to the summit. Separately, top Canadian cabinet ministers have also been in Washington for negotiations in recent weeks.

Trade tensions may be unavoidable. The United States runs trade deficits with all G7 countries except the United Kingdom. In an effort to balance what he describes as America's lopsided trade relations, Trump has imposed 10% import taxes — tariffs — on almost every country in the world. He also announced bigger tariffs, then suspended them, on countries that sell more to the United States than they buy.

“The big X Factor (is) the looming tariffs,” said Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The G7 is supposed to provide global economic governance. And the way the Europeans see it right now is that the country that's the source of major instability in global economic affairs is the United States.''

Trump's trade wars are already threatening the world economy. The World Bank on Tuesday sharply downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year, citing “a substantial rise in trade barriers.''

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend the G7 meeting ahead of this month's NATO summit and has said most U.S. allies in the alliance endorse Trump's demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs.

Carney said this week Canada would meet NATO's current 2% target but seemed to suggest he would not support 5%, saying his goal is to protect Canadians, and not to satisfy NATO accountants.

Law enforcement overseeing security expect large protests but say protesters won't be able to get anywhere near Kananaskis, as access roads to the summit will be closed to the public.

The Mounties say there will be designated G7 demonstration zones in Calgary and Banff, Alberta that will have live audio and video feeds, which will be broadcast to G7 leaders and delegations at the summit. Kananaskis also hosted a G8 summit in 2002.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday urged Iran to quickly reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear program as Israel vowed to continue its bombardment of the country.

Trumped framed the volatile moment in the Middle East as a possible “second chance” for Iran's leadership to avoid further destruction “before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.” 

The Republican president pressed on Iran as he met his national security team in the Situation Room to discuss the tricky path forward following Israel's devastating strikes, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to keep up for “as many days as it takes” to decapitate Iran's nuclear program.

The White House said it had no involvement in the strikes, but Trump highlighted that Israel used its deep arsenal of weaponry provided by the U.S. to target Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz and the country's ballistic missile program, as well as top nuclear scientists and officials.

Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he had warned Iran's leaders that “it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.”

Just hours before Israel launched its strikes on Iran early Friday, Trump was still holding onto tattered threads of hope that the long-simmering dispute could be resolved without military action. Now, he'll be tested anew on his ability to make good on a campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts.




In the aftermath of the Israeli strikes, the U.S. is shifting its military resources, including ships, in the Middle East as it looks to guard against possible retaliatory attacks by Tehran, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

The Navy has directed the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner to begin sailing toward the Eastern Mediterranean and has directed a second destroyer to begin moving forward, so it can be available if requested by the White House.

As Israel stepped up planning for strikes in recent weeks, Iran had signaled the United States would be held responsible in the event of an Israeli attack. The warning was issued by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi even as he engaged in talks with Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.

Friday's strikes came as Trump planned to dispatch Witkoff to Oman on Sunday for the next round of talks with the Iranian foreign minister. 

Witkoff still plans to go to Oman this weekend for talks on Tehran's nuclear program, but it's unclear if the Iranians will participate, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private diplomatic discussions. 

The president made a series of phone calls Friday to U.S. television news anchors to renew his calls on Iran to curb its nuclear program.

CNN's Dana Bash said Trump told her the Iranians “should now come to the table” and get a deal done. And Trump told NBC News that Iranian officials are “calling me to speak” but didn't provide further detail.

Trump also spoke Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron about the evolving situation, and he was expected to call Netanyahu later in the day.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., offered rare words of Democratic praise for the Trump administration after the attack “for prioritizing diplomacy” and “refraining from participating” in the military strikes. But he also expressed deep concern about what the Israeli strikes could mean for U.S. personnel in the region. 

Iran has already fired more than 100 drones at Israel, with both Iraq and Jordan confirming they had flown over their airspace. Israel said the drones were being intercepted outside its airspace, and it was unclear whether any got through.

Trump in the hours before the attack still appeared hopeful in public comments that there would be more time for diplomacy.

But it was clear to the administration that Israel was edging toward taking military action against Iran. The State Department and U.S. military on Wednesday directed a voluntary evacuation of nonessential personnel and their loved ones from some U.S. diplomatic outposts in the Middle East.

Before Israel launched the strikes, some of Trump's strongest supporters were raising concerns about what another expansive conflict in the Mideast could mean for the Republican president, who ran on a promise to quickly end the brutal wars in Gaza and Ukraine. 

Trump has struggled to find an endgame to either of those conflicts and to make good on two of his biggest foreign policy campaign promises. 

And after criticizing President Joe Biden during last year's campaign for preventing Israel from carrying out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump found himself making the case to the Israelis to give diplomacy a chance.

The push by the Trump administration to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear program came after the U.S. and other world powers in 2015 reached a long-term, comprehensive nuclear agreement that limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. 

But Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-administration brokered agreement in 2018, calling it the “worst deal ever.”

The way forward is even more clouded now.

“No issue currently divides the right as much as foreign policy,” Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and an ally of the Trump White House, posted on X on Thursday. “I'm very concerned based on (everything) I've seen in the grassroots the last few months that this will cause a massive schism in MAGA and potentially disrupt our momentum and our insanely successful Presidency.”

Rosemary Kelanic, director of the Middle East program at Defense Priorities, said the job ahead for Trump and his team is to protect U.S. forces who are highly vulnerable to Iranian retaliation.

“Israel's strike on Iran,” Kelanic said, “must not become the United States' war.”

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Michael Madigan's stunning political collapse is expected to culminate Friday when the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history is sentenced on federal bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud convictions tied to a scheme to push legislation in exchange for jobs and contracts for his associates.

The former Illinois House speaker was convicted in February on 10 of 23 counts in a remarkable corruption trial that lasted four months. The case churned through 60 witnesses and mountains of documents, photographs and taped conversations. 

Madigan will appear in U.S. District Court Friday in Chicago, where Judge John Robert Blakey will determine his sentence. 

Federal prosecutors are seeking a 12 1/2-year prison term. Madigan's attorneys are seeking probation, contending the government's sentence would “condemn an 83-year-old man to die behind bars for crimes that enriched him not one penny.”

During a legislative career that spanned a half-century, Madigan served nearly four decades as speaker, the longest on record for a U.S. legislator. Combined with more than 20 years as chairperson of the Illinois Democratic Party, he set much of the state's political agenda while handpicking candidates for political office. More often than not, he also controlled political mapmaking, drawing lines to favor his party.

Meanwhile, prosecutors said, the Chicago Democrat built a private legal career that allowed him to amass a net worth of $40 million.




Madigan was convicted on 10 counts of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and other charges for ensuring approval of legislation favorable to utility giant ComEd in exchange for kickbacks and jobs and contracts for loyalists, including a Chicago alderman seeking a paid job on a state board after retiring from government. 

The jury deadlocked on six counts, including an overarching racketeering conspiracy charge, and acquitted him on seven others.

“Madigan's criminal activity spanned nearly a decade and was particularly egregious because it involved efforts to enrich himself — both by maintaining his political power by securing do-nothing jobs for his political allies and by attempting to line his own pockets with legal business,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing. “In so doing, Madigan served his own personal interests and not the interests of Illinoisans.”

Defense lawyers called the government's recommended sentence “draconian” and, given Madigan's age, a life sentence. They asked Blakey to consider the totality of Madigan's life and work and the need to care for his wife in requesting a sentence of five years' probation, with one year of home confinement, a requirement to perform community service and a “reasonable fine.”

In a video submitted to the court, Madigan's wife, Shirley, asks for a sentence of probation, explaining that Madigan is her caregiver and she would have to seek outside help if he is imprisoned. And, she says, “I'm a part of him.”

“There's some days I keep him going,” Shirley Madigan says on the video. “He keeps me going sometimes, too, but I think that the impact that I have on him has been much, much larger.”

The court received more than 200 letters of support for Madigan, many from constituents, friends, leaders of nonprofits and other organizations that interact with the state. Some noted asking him for help just once. Most lauded him for dedication, integrity or a personal touch. 

“Mike Madigan is a good man who has selflessly done an exceptional amount of good for others,” his lawyers wrote in a separate filing. “He is widely respected for his dedication to honesty and integrity.”

Tried alongside Madigan was his former legislative colleague and longtime confidant, Michael McClain. The jury couldn't reach a decision on any of the six counts against McClain. He was convicted, though, in a separate trial over the ComEd conspiracy last year.

A crowd of anti-ICE protesters gathered outside the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark on Thursday night.

Four migrants escaped from the Delaney Hall ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, on Thursday evening following an apparent disturbance inside the building, a senior Homeland Security official confirmed to Fox News.

""Additional law enforcement partners have been brought in to find these escapees and a BOLO has been disseminated,"" the official said. 

Immigration attorney Mustafa Cetin told NJ.com that around 50 detainees at the private facility pushed down a dormitory wall after becoming agitated when meals were delayed. 

""It's about the food, and some of the detainees were getting aggressive and it turned violent,"" Cetin said. 

He added that his client reported the wall was ""not very strong"" and described detainees hanging bedsheets in what may have been an escape attempt. The client also said he smelled gas during the incident.

By 6 p.m., dozens of officers from the Essex County Sheriff's Office and Newark Police were present, according to Rutgers University-Newark professor Whitney Strub, who posted images of the police presence and said he and others outside the jail ""were all coughing at the same time,"" after being exposed to what they believed was ""some kind of gas,"" NJ.com reported.

At approximately 9 p.m., a group of protesters blocked an SUV from exiting an ancillary gate at Delaney Hall, forcing it to back into the facility.

PIX11 News reported that the escapees were seen running near Turnpike 78 and Delancey Street.

Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka said his office was ""concerned about reports of what has transpired at Delaney Hall this evening, ranging from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees."" 

""This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights. This is why city officials and our congressional delegation need to be allowed entry to observe and monitor, any why private prisons pose a very real problem to our state and its constitution,"" Baraka said in a statement. ""We demand immediate answers and clear communication with the GEO Group and the Department of Homeland Security. We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked.""

The incident comes just two days after Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was indicted on three federal charges stemming from a previous visit to Delaney Hall on May 9. 

McIver was with Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka and others during what was described as an oversight visit. Baraka was initially charged with trespassing, but the charge was later dropped.

Anti-ICE protesters confronted a Trump supporter at a streetlight in downtown Los Angeles just outside City Hall on Thursday, June 12, 2025.

FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is now probing the riots in Los Angeles and California officials' handling of them, Fox News Digital is learning first.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., who chairs the subcommittee on law enforcement, sent letters to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and to the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday.

""The rioters in Los Angeles have committed vicious acts of violence and fearmongering directed at law enforcement and others. They set fire to vehicles and property around the city, and assaulted officers with deadly weapons such as rocks and Molotov cocktails,"" Comer wrote to the DOJ.

""Assaults on law enforcement officers legally executing their orders are reprehensible and those responsible must be dealt with in accordance with the severity of their actions.""

Comer wrote similar letters to Newsom and Bass, accusing them of having ""protested President Trump's action to quell the violence caused by the rioters in Los Angeles, even resorting to falsely blaming him for the actions of violent rioters.""

""You have championed California's sanctuary policies, which prevent local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities. You have also made it clear that you intend to block the objectives of the federal government, and defend aliens, regardless of their immigration status, criminal activity, anti-American views, or incitement to riot,"" the Oversight Committee letter said.

GOP investigators are requesting documentation of any communications between Bass and Newsom regarding the protests, as well as their communications with state, local and federal law enforcement.

Comer is also requesting a staff-level briefing on the demonstrations.

Days of rioting erupted in Los Angeles after Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids resulted in over 100 suspected illegal immigrants being arrested last weekend.

President Donald Trump sent the National Guard into Los Angeles over Newsom's objections. Democrats have accused Trump of needlessly escalating the situation, while the president's GOP allies argued it was a necessary step to quell the violence.

Comer said law enforcement ""were forced to fire pepper spray to disperse crowds and made dozens of arrests,"" blaming the escalation on the rioters.

A federal judge ruled Thursday that Trump must return control of the California National Guard to Newsom, but an appeals court quickly reversed that decision.

The demonstrations in Los Angeles, while severe, are not isolated – activists across the country have sprung up to protest the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.

Fox News Digital reached out to Bass, Newsom and the DOJ for comment.

The Tennessee Highway Patrol released body camera video of its 2022 encounter with illegal immigrant Abrego-Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador's Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT).

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian migrant who was erroneously deported to El Salvador before being returned to the U.S. to face federal prosecution last week, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of human trafficking and conspiracy charges.

Garcia's legal team told U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes on Friday that they have had time to review the indictment, and Garcia understands what he is accused of, before he formally entered the plea, which stems from a 2022 traffic stop.

Abrego Garcia is charged with the trafficking of undocumented migrants, and conspiring with others to do so. 

The criminal case against Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member, comes after a high-profile, protracted legal fight over his deportation and the Trump administration's efforts to delay his return to the U.S., even after the Supreme Court ordered the administration to ""facilitate"" his release earlier this year.

US JUDGE BLASTS TRUMP LAWYERS FOR 11TH-HOUR TACTICS IN MS-13 DEPORTATION CASE

The indictment alleges that Abrego Garica was part of a smuggling ring that helped bring immigrants to the U.S. illegally and smuggle them across the country. According to the indictment, Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators made at least 100 trips between Texas and Maryland between 2016 and 2025, when he was deported.

Special Agent Peter T. Joseph told prosecutors on Friday that he was first assigned to Abrego Garcia's case in April 2025, when he was still detained in El Salvador.

Since then, Joseph said, he has reviewed footage from Abrego Garcia's 2022 traffic stop, which has emerged as the basis of the human smuggling charges.

At the time, Joseph told prosecutors, Abrego Garcia had been driving a vehicle with nine passengers and was pulled over while driving from St. Louis to Maryland with an expired license.

Six of the nine passengers in the vehicle have since been identified as being in the U.S. illegally, Joseph said, adding that one passenger in the van told officers that he was born in 2007, which would have made him just 15 at the time.

Abrego Garcia's legal team has vehemently disputed his alleged status as an MS-13 member, and are expected to contest the effort by U.S. prosecutors to have him detained pending trial.

His case has become a national flashpoint in the broader fight over Trump's hard-line immigration policies in his second White House term.

In a court filing Wednesday night, lawyers for Abrego Garcia urged U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee to release their client from custody while awaiting trial, arguing that the government's grounds for a detention hearing – and his alleged status as an MS-13 gang member – are meritless.

""Mr. Abrego Garcia asks the Court for what he has been denied the past several months – due process,"" his lawyers said, adding that there is no evidence their client is a flight risk, or that he has ""systematically engaged in international travel in the recent past.""

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also disputed his status as a member of MS-13, which was based on allegations made by a confidential informant, according to court documents. The informant had alleged Abrego Garcia belonged to an MS-13 chapter in New York, where he had never lived.

Speaking at a press conference in Nashville before the arraignment, Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, told reporters that yesterday marked three months since her husband was ""abducted and disappeared"" by the Trump administration. 

She said the two were able to speak for the first time on Thursday. 

""Kilmar wants you to have faith,"" Sura said. ""He says to continue fighting, and I will be victorious because God is with us.'""

Sura noted that their son, Kilmar Jr., was currently attending his kindergarten graduation ceremony in Maryland. ""My heart is in Maryland with my kids,"" she said, her voice breaking with emotion. ""But I'm here fighting for my husband, for his dad to come back home.""

Federal prosecutors disputed that and have urged the judge to keep him in custody, saying in a filing of their own that Abrego Garcia ""would have enormous reason to flee"" if he were not immediately detained by ICE. 

100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT

Court documents show the Justice Department filed the charges against Abrego Garcia on May 21 – prompting a flurry of questions as to when the investigation and impaneling of a grand jury would have taken place. 

Abrego Garcia's arraignment in Tennessee comes after his legal team asked a federal judge in Maryland late Wednesday to impose sanctions on the Trump administration for the administration's ""egregious"" and ""repeated violations"" of discovery obligations, according to the filing. 

""The Government's defiance has not been subtle,"" his attorneys told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who had been presiding over a civil case to determine whether the Trump administration complied with her order to ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador.  ""It has been vocal and sustained and flagrant.""

In the filing, Abrego Garica's legal team asked Xinis to impose fines based on a finding of civil contempt, and to compel the government to compel the production of information that they say the administration has improperly withheld, as well as ""investigate the extent of the government's willful noncompliance.""

Xinis has yet to rule on the motion.

Earlier this week, lawyers for the Trump administration told the court that they planned to file a motion to dismiss the case by Monday on ""mootness grounds,"" since Abrego Garcia is now on U.S. soil.

""The lengths the government has gone to resist discovery relating to these core questions raises a strong inference that the government is trying to hide its conduct from the scrutiny of this court, the plaintiffs, and the public,"" Abrego Garcia's team told Xinis on Wednesday. 

""What the government improperly seeks to hide must be exposed for all to see.""

Abrego Garcia's family sued the Trump administration in March after the Salvadoran man, who entered the country illegally around 2012 and was living in Maryland, was abruptly deported to El Salvador in March. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could be deported, just not to El Salvador.

Upon being returned to the U.S. last week, Abrego Garcia was immediately sent to Tennessee to face federal charges related to transporting undocumented immigrants.

Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss another Chinese national being arrested for allegedly smuggling bio weapons in the country and California Governor Gavin Newsom suing President Donald Trump. 

A Russian-born scientist and Harvard University cancer researcher accused of smuggling frog embryos into the United States has been released following four months in federal custody Thursday. 

Kseniia Petrova, 30, was arrested in February after returning from a vacation in France, where she had obtained a package of superfine sections of frog embryos from a laboratory for research. Upon arriving at Boston Logan International Airport, Petrova was questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection regarding the materials. 

""I just want to thank everybody,"" Petrova said on the steps of the federal courthouse in Boston following her release. ""A lot of people started contacting me and sending me letters, and it was a huge support without which I won't be able to survive.""

(REUTERS/Reba Saldanha)

Following the interview, the researcher was informed her visa was being canceled. 

The Department of Homeland Security previously said in a statement posted on social media that Petrova was arrested for ""lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country,"" adding that messages on her phone ""revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them."" 

The Department of Homeland Security and Harvard University did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

In an April interview with The Associated Press, Petrova said she was unaware the samples needed to be declared upon her return and insisted she was not trying to smuggle anything into the country.

Petrova was initially detained by immigration officials in Vermont before being sent to a facility in Louisiana. In May, she was formally charged with smuggling in Massachusetts, with a federal judge in Vermont setting a hearing date on her petition seeking release. 

The federal judge in Vermont later ruled that the actions of the immigration officers were unlawful and that Petrova ""posed a threat to no one."" She was subsequently released from ICE custody but remained in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service due to the smuggling charge. 

On Thursday, Magistrate Judge Judith Dein approved an agreement between federal prosecutors and Petrova's immigration attorney, effectively releasing the researcher but limiting her ability to travel while maintaining custody of her passport. 

""I hear it's sunny,"" Dein told Petrova after her release. ""Goodbye.""

Petrova's colleagues have previously testified on her behalf, telling the court she is conducting valuable research that aids in searching for a cure for cancer. 

Greg Romanovsky, the immigration attorney representing Petrova, said his client has not ""decided whether she wants to stay in the United States yet."" 

""She has offers from different countries around the world, countries that are eager to support the important research that she's doing,"" he said. ""She's weighing her options at the moment, and she's very grateful to be out."" 

Romanovsky did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Under the conditions of her release, Petrova must report any contact with law enforcement – including ICE – to her supervising officer within 24 hours, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Petrova is scheduled to return to court next week for a probable cause hearing regarding the smuggling charge.

Chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports the latest on Israel's attack on Iran from the Pentagon. 

Far-left House Democrats are hammering Israel for its Thursday night strikes on Iran.

Members of the House's progressive ""Squad,"" already critical of Israel's war on Gaza, are denouncing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ""war criminal"" after his government launched attacks on Tehran and surrounding areas.

""Israel has once again bombed Iran, a dangerous & reckless escalation. The war criminal Netanyahu wants to ignite an endless regional war & drag the US into it,"" Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., wrote on X. ""Any politician who tries to help him betrays us all. The American people do not want this.""

Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., claimed Israel would drag the U.S. into war in the Middle East.

""The Israeli government bombing Iran is a dangerous escalation that could lead to regional war. War Criminal Netanyahu will do anything to maintain his grip on power,"" Tlaib wrote.

""We cannot let him drag our country into a war with Iran. Our government must stop funding and supporting this rogue genocidal regime.""

Omar said, ""Regardless of what [President Donald Trump] thinks, Israel knows America will do whatever they want and feels confident about their ability to get into war and have the American government back them up. Israel also knows they can always rely on getting America to protect and serve its needs.""

""Everyone in America should prepare themselves to either see their tax dollars being spent on weapon supplies to Israel or be dragged into war with Iran if this escalates,"" Omar said.

Washington and Tehran have been engaged in talks about a new Iran nuclear deal aimed at reining in the Islamic republic's uranium enrichment.

Trump posted on Truth Social Friday morning that Iran now had a ""second chance"" to come to the table after Israel's strikes.

Democrats, meanwhile, were more concerned.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that he thought Israel's strikes, which it called preemptive, were a bid to scuttle those talks.

""It appears as if this was an attempt by Israel to scuttle Donald Trump's negotiations with Iran. Of course, our preferred pathway here to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is diplomacy,"" Murphy said.

U.S. officials have been warning Iran not to respond to what Israel has said will be a multi-strike operation.

USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by the DOGE subcommittee after Stephanie Turner was punished for refusing to face a trans competitor.

USA Fencing's board of directors voted to amend its current policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites for competitions and a policy that may have prevented the playing of the national anthem at some events. 

The decision comes after months of criticism for punishing a woman fencer who refused to fence a trans opponent, which included scrutiny from federal lawmakers at a congressional hearing in early May. 

The changes were voted into effect at a board of directors meeting on Saturday. 

An official announcement states that USA Fencing ""adopted a streamlined policy that applies criteria prioritizing cost, safety and convenience to every national-event bid across all 50 states."" The new policy ""ensures host cities meet stringent member-safety and cost-efficiency standards.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) holds up maps of the U.S. in front of an alleged screenshot from USA Fencing Board Director Damien Lehfeldt's Instagram during the hearing on ""Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" held by the Department of Government Efficiency Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C. 

Meanwhile, the board's new national anthem policy will go into effect at the 2025 Summer Nationals and will be reviewed annually by the tournament committee.

""On recommendation of the tournament committee, the board adopted a uniform national anthem policy governing all USA Fencing national events,"" the announcement said, adding that the new policy will ""provide consistent, respectful minimum guidance for honoring the flag and anthem across nine annual tournaments.""

Back in December, the board held a vote to play the national anthem at the start of tournaments before ""all NACs and National Championships,"" but it was voted against 8-2 with one abstention.

USA Fencing has provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the new anthem policy. 

""The anthem has always been played at the start of every national tournament. The Board simply wrote that long‑standing practice into policy and added that it will also be played on any U.S. holiday that occurs during an event, such as Independence Day, which falls during our upcoming Summer Nationals,"" the statement red. 

The previous host site policy, which was announced in November 2022, gave preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that ""harm members of LGBTQ communities"" and states that do not ""have laws undermining the reproductive health of women."" 

That policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released a list of states that it intended to ""avoid where possible"" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events.

The states on the ""do not allow"" list were Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas. 

The states on its ""avoid where possible"" list included Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.

The organization now claims it will have events in several of those states over the next year. 

""We merged several overlapping documents into one policy that scores every bid — regardless of state — on cost, safety, and travel convenience. Using this rubric, next season's national events will span nine states including Texas, Missouri, Florida, Utah, Ohio, Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee and Nevada,"" read a statement to Fox News Digital.

The previous policy became one of the organization's biggest points of criticism after fencer Stephanie Turner ignited global backlash against the organization when she recorded a video of her kneeling in protest of a trans opponent during a competition in Maryland in late March. 

USA GYMNASTICS ASSESSING TRANSGENDER INCLUSION POLICY

The footage went viral amid news that Turner was disqualified from the event and dealt a black card for refusing to fence. 

The controversy was then the subject of a federal hearing on May 7. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee's ""Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" saw Turner testify against USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt. 

Lehfeldt took harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers for the organization's transgender inclusion and host site selection policies. 

DOGE Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., called out the organization for its host city policy. 

""In selecting sites for its national fencing events, for instance, the board policy is to avoid states whose laws and policies on LGBTQ rights and abortion it opposes. It uses ‘Equality Maps' to determine which states to blacklist from its competitions, and which to favor,"" Greene said. 

""This ends up favoring a lot of blue states and harming a lot of red ones. So, it creates politically-determined winners and losers — but it has absolutely nothing to do with fencing. And it contradicts USA Fencing's statutory duty as an NGB to 'develop interest and participation throughout the United States' in fencing."" 

USA Fencing also announced that it is preparing to change its current policy that allows trans athletes to compete in the women's category back in April.

""In the event that USA Fencing is forced to change its current stance in accordance with oversight bodies or federal legislation, the new policy states athletes competing in USA Fencing-sanctioned tournaments must compete according to their biological sex,"" the announcement read. 

The proposed updated policy ensures that the women's category ""will be open exclusively to athletes of the female sex."" The men's category ""will be open to all other athletes who are otherwise eligible for competition.""

Iran responded to Israel's airstrike by launching over 100 drones toward Israel on Friday morning.

The drone deployment came as retaliation for Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear program in a military airstrike on Thursday. The preemptive attack centered on “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”

The airstrike was devastating for Iran, which suffered significant casualties among its country's leadership. Several prominent military heads were killed in the strike, including Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Gholam Ali Rashid, a senior Guard commander. Iranian nuclear scientists Fereydoon Abbasi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, a theoretical physicist, were also killed in the attack. 

Iranian state media also reportedly claimed that children were killed in “at least one of the airstrikes.”

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, confirmed the deaths and warned that Israel would endure “severe punishment” as a result of the attack in a series of posts on X. 

“Zionist regime has committed a crime in our dear country today at dawn with its satanic, bloodstained hands,” Khamenei said. “It has revealed its malicious nature even more than before by targeting residential areas.”

“That [Zionist] regime should anticipate a severe punishment. By God's grace, the powerful arm of the Islamic Republic's Armed Forces won't let them go unpunished,” he added. “With this crime, the Zionist regime has prepared for itself a bitter, painful fate, which it will definitely see.”

Israel Defense Forces confirmed the launch of Iran's drones on Friday. It announced it had already begun to intercept some of them and shoot them down. Drones fired from Iran must travel a great distance and take several hours to get to Israel, according to multiple reports.

“The IDF has begun intercepting UAVs fired from Iran, outside of Israeli territory,” an IDF official told CNN.

IDF Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said all of Israel's “defense systems are working to intercept the threats.”

A federal appeals court on Friday denied President Donald Trump‘s bid to rehear his appeal of a jury's verdict that he was liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll and defaming her.

A divided full bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit denied Trump's appeal, upholding the $5 million judgment against him. The appeal to the full court came months after a three-judge panel on the appeals court denied Trump's bid, meaning the final avenue through which the president may appeal the decision is the Supreme Court.

A New York jury found in May 2023 that Trump was liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s and defaming her in 2022 by denying the accusation, awarding her $5 million in damages. The jury did not find him liable for rape, and Trump has maintained that the encounter never occurred.

The petition to the full appeals court alleged that the jury trial was tainted by improper evidence and that it improperly influenced the jury. Trump's lawyers further alleged that the judgment could set a dangerous precedent if allowed to stand.

A concurring opinion filed by Judge Myrna Perez, and joined by Judges Eunice Lee, Beth Robinson, and Sarah Merriam, said there was “no manifest error by the district court” and that Trump's lawyers failed to show “the standard for en banc review” was met.

“Simply relitigating a case is not an appropriate use of the en banc procedure. In those rare instances in which a case warrants our collective consideration, it is almost always because it involves a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel's opinion and appellate precedent,” Perez said.

“The dissenting opinion ignores this rule of restraint. It points to no exceptionally important issues, nocases that actually conflict with the panel's decision, and no persuasive justification for review of this case by the full Court,” Perez added.

Judge Steven Menashi filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Michael Park, expressing concern over the admission of character evidence in the trial against Trump.

“The result was a jury verdict based on impermissible character evidence and few reliable facts. No one can have any confidence that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the normal rules of evidence had been applied,” said Menashi, a Trump appointee.

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS VERDICT FINDING TRUMP LIABLE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT

“Because I would apply the same rules in every case regardless of the identity of the defendant, I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc,” Menashi added.

Trump also appealed a separate defamation ruling against him won by Carroll over the sexual assault claims, in which she won an additional $83.3 million in damages for a denial of the claim Trump made in 2019.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump issued his first response to Israel's strikes against Iran on Friday morning, pressing Tehran to make a deal with the United States “before there is nothing left.”

Israel began launching coordinated strikes against Iranian military and nuclear targets late Thursday evening. Just hours earlier, Trump confirmed to reporters that he had warned Israel not to carry out the planned strikes.

“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,' but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done. I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come – And they know how to use it,” the president wrote on Truth Social early Friday morning. “Certain Iranian hardliner's spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse! There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.”

“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All,” Trump concluded.

In a follow-up post, he said Iran could have a “second chance” at making a deal. 

“Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to ‘make a deal.' They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!” he wrote.

In an interview with ABC News Friday morning, he called the Israeli strikes “excellent” and said there's “more to come.”

The tone of Trump's statement varied noticeably from that of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the highest-ranking administration official to weigh in on the brewing war Thursday night.

“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense,” Rubio wrote. “President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”

Iran suffered heavy losses Thursday night, including Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and multiple nuclear scientists. Tehran also claimed the strikes resulted in several child casualties before launching more than 100 suicide drones in a retaliatory attack against Israel.

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a televised speech following the attack that the offensive could continue for days or weeks.

Trump administration officials have already conducted multiple rounds of negotiations with Tehran on brokering a new nuclear agreement. Led by Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, the U.S. has reportedly offered Iran a proposal that would allow the country to continue its nuclear enrichment program, with American oversight.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

When President Donald Trump won the White House last year for the second time, many Democrats concluded they would need to moderate on a cluster of issues on which they were on the wrong side of public opinion. Chief among them was immigration, after nearly four years of willful neglect at the border had left the party's reputation in tatters.

On the day Trump returned to office in January, the Senate voted 64 to 35 to pass the Laken Riley Act. Named after a 22-year-old woman who was murdered by an illegal immigrant while she was jogging at the University of Georgia, the legislation stiffened penalties on illegal immigrants who commit crimes in the United States and mandated detention for more offenses.

Twelve Democratic senators voted in the affirmative. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), John Fetterman (D-PA), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) all represented battleground states Trump carried. (Ossoff and Warnock also hail from the state where Laken Riley was slain.) Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) came from states where Trump cut the Democrats' margin of victory to single digits. 

Forty-six House Democrats also voted for the bill. “Most Democrats waved the bill off as a political messaging effort last year when Republicans first proposed it,” NPR reported on Jan. 22, saying the vote “marked a sharp shift from recent immigration debates on Capitol Hill.”

Activists were incensed, with one group calling the bipartisan vote “a betrayal” and another denouncing it as “shameful” and “anti-immigrant.” A third advocacy organization complained the new law, which Trump signed nine days into his second term on Jan. 29, “calls for the unjust detention of undocumented people accused of theft-related crimes, as small as shoplifting, and allows state attorneys general to sue the federal government if they believe their states had been harmed by its failure to enforce immigration laws.”  

Democrats seemed finally ready to buck the activists behind their dramatic leftward lurch on immigration. They had just lost 45% of the Hispanic vote, and most Hispanic men, to Trump. But the shift proved short-lived. As protesters rage against Trump in the streets, Democrats are being pushed even further to the left on immigration than they were before losing the election.

The Democrats' new embrace of immigration radicalism is being led by none other than Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who initially seemed desirous of presiding over a pivot back to the center. Newsom attempted a rebrand from symbol of blue-state liberal misgovernment to thoughtful podcaster who was going to get Democrats on the right side of those “80-20 issues” that bedeviled fellow Californian former Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign last year.

Newsom interviewed conservative influencers Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, both deeply ensconced in Trumpworld. He exhorted Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris's running mate, to join him in trying to understand MAGA, even if only to figure out how to defeat the president's political movement. “When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,” Newsom explained to an underwhelmed Walz, later adding that what Bannon says “reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”

That all went up in smoke as quickly as a car on the streets of Los Angeles, as the city was convulsed by violent protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “My understanding is that protesters essentially attempted to barricade ICE inside where they were staging for their raids, which is an activity that has been going on around the country for some time now,” Kyle Shideler, an expert on radical protests with the Center for Security Policy, told the Tablet. But things soon got out of control. 

Newsom sided with the mob and against Trump, who sent in the National Guard and active-duty troops to protect federal buildings and keep the peace. Newsom said it was democracy that was under attack. He seized the anti-Trump opportunity in front of him while projectiles were being hurled at police.

“This isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles,” Newsom said in a video. “This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes.”

“This moment we have feared has arrived,” Newsom warned, harkening back to his party's repeated warnings that Trump posed a unique threat to democracy.

Newsom's comments echoed those of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, whom Joe Biden had passed over for vice president five years earlier. “It makes me feel like our city is actually a test case,” Bass told reporters in a sudden burst of federalism, “a test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state or away from local government.”

This is exactly what many Democrats and Democratic-aligned interest groups want to hear. And Trump has been known to overreach at times, so it is always possible the situation in Los Angeles could evolve, or deteriorate, in unpredictable ways. 

But it wed the Democrats to a series of unpopular positions from which they were trying to disassociate themselves. “Abolish ICE” was a kissing cousin of “defund the police” that even Biden had spent years disavowing, though as president from 2021 to 2025, he did undermine the agency and limit its reach in various ways. Democrats began backsliding on that before the Los Angeles riots commenced.

Like defund the police, joining the anti-ICE protests makes it seem as if Democrats oppose all immigration enforcement. So does advocacy for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, alleged to be a gang member and human trafficker rather than just a simple “Maryland man,” and Emiliano Garduno-Galvez, an arrested LA rioter alleged to have lit and tossed a Molotov cocktail at Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies. 

Democrats were initially emboldened when their position on Abrego Garcia seemed to poll well. But most of those polls appeared to test narrowly whether Trump should obey valid court orders and avoid mistaken deportations, which most people would reasonably want. They did not reference the criminal allegations against him.

The focus of the protests and mainstream Democrats' outrage is supposed to be on hardworking busboys and long-settled grandmothers who have not followed up their immigration violations with subsequent crimes. Some illegal immigrants caught up in the Trump dragnet might otherwise be sympathetic figures, and deportation quotas could lead officials to make occasional mistakes. But these are not the poster children the Democrats have chosen.

“Emiliano Garduno-Galvez is a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who threatened the lives of federal law enforcement officers by attacking them with a Molotov cocktail during the violent riots in Los Angeles,” Department of Homeland Security official Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “These are the types of criminal illegal aliens that rioters are fighting to protect. The Los Angeles rioters will not stop us or slow us down. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Working-class voters have shifted toward the GOP under Trump in part because they don't believe their wages should be undercut by even sympathetic illegal immigrants. Many of them believe people should be deported for violating immigration law, not just using these violations as a pretext for punishing them for breaking other laws, even if most think criminal immigrants should be the top enforcement priority. 

Moreover, it was the mishandling of the border under Biden and Harris that contributed to a hardening of public attitudes on immigration. A recent CBS News poll found that 54% supported Trump's deportations, and a plurality believes they are making the U.S. safer. CNN found a 40-point swing in favor of the Republicans on the issue of immigration among legal immigrants. The RealClearPolitics polling average finds most voters approve of Trump's job performance on immigration, with only Quinnipiac finding net disapproval. 

A 2024 Gallup poll found that 55% wanted to reduce immigration, the highest percentage taking that position since 2001. Only 16% wanted to increase immigration levels. While the results varied, some polls found a plurality to majority support for the mass deportations Trump was promising on the campaign trail.

Biden did not take the most radical position on immigration in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He had opponents who favored decriminalizing border crossings and dismantling some aspects of internal immigration enforcement. But he did call the Obama-era deportations that took place while he was vice president, which were unpopular with progressive Democrats and immigrant activists at the time, “a big mistake.” Once he was in office, at least 8 million illegal immigrants poured across the border. The New York Times described Biden as having presided over “the largest immigration surge in U.S. history.”

After his last State of the Union address, Biden apologized not for mispronouncing Laken Riley's name but for describing her murderer as an “illegal.” No human is illegal, the activists would say. Not even a convicted murderer. 

Although Biden and most Democratic elected officials would never put it this way, the progressive activists who influence the party's decision-making in this area fundamentally do not believe it is legitimate for wealthy, Western countries to enforce immigration limitations meaningfully against poor people of color. This is regardless of how unregulated immigration affects working-class citizens and lawful residents of all races and ethnicities, or what the voters want.

Democrats have not always thought or talked like this about immigration. When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) first ran for president, he told liberal journalist Ezra Klein in an interview that open borders were a libertarian concept harmful to the working class. “No, that's a Koch brothers proposal,” the Vermont socialist said.

The backlash was swift. Vox published an article calling Sanders's “fear of immigrant labor” — remember we are largely discussing illegal immigration here — “wrongheaded” and “ugly.” By 2020, Sanders was listed alongside asterisk candidate former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as one of the two hardest-core ICE abolitionists in that year's Democratic presidential field. “Bernie Sanders was once wary of immigrant workers,” Vox noted approvingly in February 2020. “Now he's on their side.”

“All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,” then-President Bill Clinton said in his 1995 State of the Union address. “The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.”

Clinton went on to mention his immigration reform commission, chaired by a former Democratic Texas congresswoman named Barbara Jordan. But she talked very differently about the issue than today's Democrats do. “Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave,” Jordan said. “The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.”

Even the sainted Barack Obama acknowledged the moral legitimacy of immigration enforcement. While he was accused of cooking the books to make his deportation numbers look higher than they were as president, he did pursue a policy of removing illegal immigrants even if he was mainly trying to build support for “comprehensive immigration reform,” a mixture of enforcement and a mass amnesty for most illegal immigrants already in the country.

“When I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment,” Obama wrote in The Audacity of Hope, published in 2006 before he won the presidency. “When I'm forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.” (Though Obama did preface this with a confession of “nativist sentiments.”)

Obama failed. As president, he was unable to persuade Republicans, especially in the House, to join him in support of amnesty. Many in the GOP felt they had tried this under then-President Ronald Reagan in 1986, and it did not work. The enforcement proved episodic at best, the amnesty was permanent, and illegal immigration increased into the 1990s. (Indeed, some point to this amnesty when they look at the scenes unfolding in California, a reliably Republican state at the presidential level as recently as 1988, now.) 

Left-wing activists were outraged that a Democratic president was the “deporter in chief.” They held placards saying, “No borders, no nations, stop deportations!” While Obama did not go quite that far, he then moved toward legalizing illegal immigrants by executive fiat despite arguing not long before that he lacked the legal authority to do so. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, remains in place today.

The Los Angeles riots, with their Mexican flag-waving and clashes with law enforcement, threaten to radicalize the Democrats beyond the issue of immigration. They are reminiscent of the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the anti-Israel demonstrations that unfolded on college campuses after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.

Until recently, Democrats have treated 2019 and 2020 as a sort of fever dream from which they were trying to awaken. Harris spent most of her abbreviated presidential campaign trying to obscure or walk back positions she took during that period. The excesses of the pandemic and the so-called racial justice movement were regarded as at least somewhat regrettable. 

Trump's popular-vote plurality in an election that was framed as a referendum on democracy itself appeared to catch Democrats off guard. There was not even symbolic opposition to certifying the election results. In the months leading up to his inauguration and for several weeks afterward, Democrats appeared to be weighing accommodation rather than Resistance.

The pendulum soon swung back in the opposite direction, gradually at first and eventually drastically. Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency, the tariffs, and ultimately the deportations deepened progressive anger. Now, it is in full force.

BORDERS VS. BUDGETS: TRUMP ALLIES SPAR OVER SECOND-TERM PRIORITIES 

Trump appears willing to respond in ways he only talked about doing in 2020. Invoking the Insurrection Act if the riots continue to spiral, for example, remains on the table. His allies are already referring to the anti-ICE protesters as insurrectionists. (Though Trump has also signaled a willingness to accommodate certain industries, such as hotels and agriculture, inconvenienced by his immigration crackdown.) This time, voters have rejected the progressive fever dream at the ballot box. It isn't 2020 anymore.

But we could be in for a long summer, nevertheless.

Three blue state governors were on defense for hours on Thursday during a marathon House Oversight Committee hearing where Republicans accused them of reckless immigration policies in their states.

Govs. Tim Walz (D-MN), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Kathy Hochul (D-NY) testified at the high-profile hearing that ran from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a few breaks. There were many fireworks as Republicans grilled their home state governors and even some fireworks between members themselves.

Afterward, Pritzker, who is considered a possible 2028 presidential contender, dismissed the hearing as a waste of time because lawmakers weren't really interested in solutions such as immigration reform.

“This hearing was a demonstration of just how bad this Republican-controlled Congress really is,” Pritzker said. “Again, nothing accomplished. An entire day of just harping on something that, frankly, most of which was false. … I think this entire Republican-controlled Congress is a waste.”

Here are the top takeaways from the hearing. 

Many members, who are eyeing higher offices such as a Senate or gubernatorial run, questioned the witnesses with Republicans laying into the governors and Democrats condemning the Trump administration and the hearing as “unserious.”

Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Mike Lawler (R-NY) grilled Hochul as both House Republicans eye a run for governor in the state where they would seek to unseat Hochul.

“We deserve a governor who stands up for law-abiding New Yorkers,” Stefanik said before an increasingly frustrated Hochul, who repeatedly attempted to condemn the crimes by illegal immigrants.

“These crimes are horrific, I condemn them,” Hochul stated.

“Because of your sanctuary state policies,” Stefanik quipped back. 

Lawler told Hochul after a heated exchange, “New York is better off with you down here and not in the state.” 

“I don't think it's better off with you here,” she responded.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), a top contender for the open Illinois Senate seat, attacked President Donald Trump, saying, “he may not like state law, as we are seeing in California.” 

This hearing comes as protests continue to sweep Los Angeles following Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that happened last week.

Trump has called up the National Guard and activated U.S. Marines to deal with the protests in California, against Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) wishes. Protests against Trump's mass deportation operation carried out by ICE have turned violent at times.

The governors defended Newsom's position that Trump sending in the National Guard to control anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles undermined local law enforcement. Trump also expressed support for Newsom's arrest earlier this week after the governor dared the border czar Tom Homan to arrest him following the National Guard coming in.

The governors said Trump's border czar can “try” to come and arrest them, too.

“If Tom Homan comes to Albany to arrest me, I'll say go for it,” Hochul said.

“I have the highest duty to protect the people of my state, and indeed, if Tom Homan were to come to try to arrest us, me, rather, I can say first of all that he can try,” Pritzker added.

During the hearing, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was shoved out of a Department of Homeland Security press conference in California after he interrupted Secretary Kristi Noem and approached her podium with questions. Security officials, possibly not knowing he was a senator, treated his approach and physical resistance as a threat to the secretary and acted to remove and restrain him. 

Members added the headlines of stories about Padilla into the hearing's official record.

Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ) showed a printout photo of the post on X showing the senator being shoved out and reading the news that he was “forcefully removed from the news conference being held by DHS Kristi Noem.”

Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL) showed the video of Padilla, where Comer then argued that they should show the portion where he approached Noem.

House Oversight acting ranking member Stephen Lynch (D-MA) asked for an investigation into the incident to take place in House Oversight.

Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said, “Mr. Chairman, for the record, he rushed the podium. He was being disruptive.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters that “sitting members of Congress” were “lying about what happened” with Padilla.

Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) got into a screaming match involving House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) when he asked for a point of order to subpoena Noem. Comer told Frost to “shut up,” and Greene then accused Frost of being a “former antifa member.”

“He has been out of order six times, he's trying to get on MSNBC,” Comer said of Frost.

While the hearing was largely focused on immigration, Comer grilled Walz on his vice presidential run with former Vice President Kamala Harris, asking what he knew about former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. 

“Did you ever ask Vice President Harris about former President Biden's … cognitive decline?” Comer asked.

“No, not that I can recall,” Walz said.

Comer pressed Walz on why he wouldn't have asked Harris about Biden's health after the disastrous debate performance against Trump that ultimately led to Biden dropping out of the race.

“I was probably more concerned with my own debate performance than President Biden's, so no,” Walz insisted.

The House Oversight Committee is investigating Biden's health decline and whether his White House aides not only shielded him from the public but also used an autopen to carry out official business without his knowledge. Autopen usage is not uncommon in modern White Houses, and Biden has insisted he was the ultimate decision maker on executive actions and pardons.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) also grilled Walz on the mental decline of Biden while in office and whether Harris talked to him about it. “Not that I can recall,” he said.

BIDEN AIDES LINED UP TO APPEAR BEFORE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN AUTOPEN INVESTIGATION 

Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) questioned Pritzker on an X post made by the governor back in 2017, calling on people to protest against Trump by using the other gender's bathroom. 

As a protest against Trump's rescinding protections for trans kids, everyone should use the other gender's bathroom today! #protecttranskids

“Have you ever considered that women don't want you in their bathrooms?” Gill asked.

Walz was on defense throughout the hearing for previously calling ICE agents “Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo” during a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota Law School, claiming agents were “scooping folks up off the streets” who were being “disappeared.”

Asked to apologize or recant for comparing U.S law enforcement to Nazi's treatment of Jews, Walz refused. But he got an ally in Lynch, the top Democrat at the hearing, who condemned how ICE agents were abducting “peaceful” illegal immigrants from their communities.

“When you compare the old films of the Gestapo grabbing people off the streets of Poland, and you compare them to those nondescript thugs … it does look like a Gestapo operation,” Lynch said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Israel unilaterally conducted a significant military operation targeting Iran's nuclear program on Thursday, hours after President Donald Trump cautioned Israel against one in favor of continuing their diplomatic efforts.Details of the damage Israel inflicted are still being assessed, though an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson called it a “preemptive, precise, combined offensive” and warned Israeli civilians to be prepared for a retaliatory attack.

“Following the State of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the state of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future,” Israel Katz, the defense minister, said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address, “Moments ago, Israel launched operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,” adding, “This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”

Dozens of Israeli fighter jets were involved in what the spokesperson described as “the first stage” of the operation targeting “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”

Iranian state media reported that Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, senior IRGC commander Gholamali Rashid, and nuclear scientists Fereydoun Abbasi and Mohammad-Mehdi Tehranchi were killed in the strikes.

The United States was not involved in the attack, though Israel warned them ahead of time, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He also told Tehran not to attack U.S. troops or bases in the Middle East.

Fearing a possible retaliatory attack, on Wednesday, the State Department evacuated personnel from Iraq, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved the evacuation of military families from undisclosed bases across the region.

On Thursday, before the Israeli strike, Trump warned that an Israeli military operation could happen but held out optimism that the U.S. and Iran could come to a diplomatic solution to capping Iran's nuclear program.

“We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue! My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran. They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon,” he posted on Truth Social.

Republican reactions to the attacks were supportive of the strikes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) wrote minutes after the strikes, “Game on. Pray for Israel,” while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said, “Israel is acting to defend themselves … and we should stand unequivocally with the state of Israel.”

Democratic reactions were less enthusiastic, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saying in a television appearance, “This is deeply disturbing. This has the possibility of spinning entirely out of control,” adding, “We need the administration to negotiate.”

Trump didn't want a strike to compromise a deal. “As long as I think there is agreement, I don't want them going in because I think that would blow it,” Trump said during an event at the White House. “It might help it, actually, but it also could blow it.”

The U.S. and Iran were set to meet this weekend for the sixth iteration of their nuclear negotiations.

Israeli leaders have long sought an opportunity to take out Iran's nuclear program, and viewed it as an existential threat. This was what they viewed as their opportunity to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The IDF spokesperson said, “Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” and that “weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the wider world.”

Hegseth told lawmakers on Wednesday that there “are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon.”

Earlier on Thursday, the Iran's foreign ministry said it would launch a “new uranium enrichment facility in a secure location” and install advanced centrifuges at another enrichment center in response to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors vote in favor of a resolution declaring Tehran was not in compliance with its nonproliferation requirements.

The Iranians have rapidly increased the amount of enriched uranium in their possession, according to a recent report from the IAEA. As of May 17, Iran had amassed about 900 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of almost 50% from their last report issued in February. Getting the uranium from 60% enrichment to 90% enrichment, which the IAEA uses as the benchmark for weapons-grade uranium, would only require “mere steps,” according to Gen. Michael Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command.

It only takes about 55 pounds of 90% enriched uranium to construct a simple nuclear weapon.

“Should the Regime decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it is estimated that current stockpiles and the available centrifuges across several enrichment plants are sufficient to produce its first 25kg of weapons grade material in roughly one week and enough for up to ten nuclear weapons in three weeks,” Kurilla said in his written testimony to Congress this week.

Israel and Iran are enemies, though they have rarely engaged in direct military operations against one another, instead mostly pursuing covert espionage operations. However, that changed in the aftermath of Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that prompted the current instability in the region.

Israel has fought many of Iran's proxies in the region since then, destroying much of Hamas and Hezbollah in Gaza and Lebanon, respectively. The Israelis have also fought against the Houthis in Yemen in a tit-for-tat aerial campaign.

US WARNS ALLIES NOT TO ATTEND TWO-STATE SOLUTION CONFERENCE

Amid the wider conflict, there were two instances in which Iran retaliated directly at Israel, once in April and again in October 2024. Tehran fired dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles at Israel in both cases, the vast majority of which were intercepted. Israel had the help of the U.S. and other allies.

Israel has a multilayered air defense system in place that protects it from a wide range of missiles, but an Iranian response that mirrors the size and scope of the last two attacks poses significant risks for Israel.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The military may start to see itself differently.

The military parade Donald Trump has orchestrated to mark the 250th anniversary of the Army—which happens to be his birthday—is not the first time that tanks have rolled down Constitution Avenue. That happened most recently in June 1991 to celebrate the end of the Gulf War. The speech Trump delivered at Fort Bragg this week is not the first time a president has used active-duty soldiers as a backdrop. That happens all the time. But context is everything, and this president is putting out all the signals that he wants to use the military in a whole new way, or at least new for a thriving democracy.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to staff writer Tom Nichols about how all the pieces fit together: the military parade, the speech at Fort Bragg, and the dispatching of Marines to the protests in Los Angeles.

It's not just that Trump wants to acclimate Americans to the sight of tanks in the streets. It's not just that Trump is signaling to governors that he will use the forces at his disposal to override their wishes. The real problem is how the military may begin to see itself.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: The day after the Trump administration mobilized 700 Marines to respond to immigration protests in Los Angeles and four days before his military parade in the nation's capital, President Trump walked out on a stage to Lee Greenwood's “God Bless the U.S.A.”

[“God Bless the U.S.A.” plays]

Rosin: —and boasted about the crowd size.

President Trump: This is a record crowd. You know you never—you never had a crowd this big. That's an honor. You think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? I don't think so. I don't think so. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong.

Rosin: This is stuff straight out of the Trump playbook. Brag about the crowd size? Check. Mention Biden? Check. Call the media “fake news” and whip up the boos against them?

Trump: Look at them all. Aye yai yai, what I have to put up with. Fake news. (Crowd boos.)

Rosin: Check and check.

Trump: What I have to put up with.

[Music]

Rosin: There were chants of “U.S.A.!” People bought campaign-style merchandise: Make America Great Again hats and chains, and fake credit cards that said White Privilege Card: Trumps Everything.

But the difference this time was that this all happened at a military base: Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. And the crowd was full of active-duty soldiers.

Trump: I was elected, winning all seven swing states, the popular vote by millions and millions of votes, and all counties throughout America by 2,750 to 525. That's what I call a big number.

Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I'm Hanna Rosin.

Presidents have used the military as backdrops before. It's a delicate art. There have also been military parades in the past. But with the timing of it all—deploying Marines and the National Guard, a country very much divided—things feel different. And if it's indeed a delicate art, Trump is not being subtle.

So on the eve of the big parade in Washington—“better and bigger than any parade we've ever had in this country,” as Trump put it—we called up staff writer Tom Nichols, who writes about the military for The Atlantic and has taught for 25 years at the U.S. Naval War College, to help us think this through.

[Music]

Rosin: So this military parade is happening this weekend. It's meant to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday. It also happens to be Trump's 79th birthday, and Trump has said it's going to be better and bigger than any parade we've ever had in this country.

So, Tom, on the one hand, it's just a fancy parade with fireworks and all that. On the other hand, what message are you, who's good at reading military-coded symbols, seeing in this parade?

Tom Nichols: Well, first of all, the military wasn't going to do this parade. So the idea that this just happens to be a military parade that just coincidentally happened on Trump's birthday is nonsense.

Trump has wanted this kind of parade. And this is what he thinks the military does, is throw parades for the commander in chief. And he's doing it while he's sending troops into the streets of an American city, and I'm sure he's more than happy for that split screen to say, you know, These are my guys. This is my Army, my generals, my artillery. And if you screw with me, this is what it looks like in Los Angeles.

Rosin: So you read it as my parade. Like, you read the split screen as necessary to understanding this military parade, not just as some kind of empty symbolism: He likes the look of it. He likes fit troops. Like, it's just aesthetically pleasing to him. That's not all it is, in your mind?

Nichols: No. He obviously loves this stuff. I mean, Trump is, in many ways, very childlike. He likes shiny things and uniforms and big parades, and he's wanted this for a while, but I think he and the other people around him are also more than happy to create a second kind of symbolism here, of: I'm the president. I'm the commander in chief. I can put tanks in the streets anytime I feel like it.

Because remember: He wanted to do this. He was aching to do this kind of stuff during the 2020 protests, and, you know, people in the Pentagon, including his own secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chief[s of Staff] said, This is a bad idea. And he has learned his lesson. He surrounds himself now with people who are never going to tell him that anything is a bad idea.

Rosin: In the lead up to the parade, he gave this speech at Fort Bragg. Now, he's not the first president to give a speech in front of a military crowd. Presidents use the military as a backdrop all the time. What was different about this speech?

Nichols: It wasn't a speech. It was a political rally. He didn't use the backdrop of a military base to say, I'm here to talk about the future military development, the defense department, you know, international relations. He just stood up there in a completely partisan mode, wearing his little red hat, and he encouraged U.S. Army soldiers to join him in a big, partisan hootenanny.

And this actually goes back to your question, Hanna, about what he's thinking about this parade. He very much wants those soldiers to [hear], Remember, I am your only defender. I am the strong man who loves you. America hates you. And that is poisonous. It is a repudiation of everything that people from George Washington to George Marshall to Brent Scowcroft to others have always stood for in serving this country, either in civilian roles or as military leaders.

That's how other countries fall into civil war and chaos and mayhem, is that the military becomes—when you politicize the military, the military becomes an independent actor. And it says, There's Republicans. There's Democrats. There's rural. There's city. And there's us. And we are an interest group. And we are an independent group with an independent say in who runs this country. And you don't want the military saying, Oh, the election next year? That'll be interesting, but we get a veto.  Rosin: Right. So it's not just about Trump having an army or military that he can manipulate. It's about the military starting to see itself as an independent actor.  Nichols: Absolutely.

Rosin: I'm trying to imagine—actually, I don't want to get distracted, but I am trying to imagine—what it would be like for the citizens of Washington to watch tanks roll down their street. It's kind of a profound image.

Nichols: Well, especially at a time like this, I mean, context is everything. And when Donald Trump has been walking around like a wannabe dictator, talking about the military as his personal muscle, the symbolism of rumbling a tank down Constitution Avenue is, you know—I mean, look: These people know exactly what they're doing. They know the images they're creating.

And part of the goal here is—and I think that this is true in Los Angeles, and I think it's true with the Washington parade—Trump and his people want to acclimate Americans to the sight of the U.S. military in their streets, which is one of the most un-American things, going all the way back to the Founders, who had a deep suspicion of a standing army.

We honor the people who serve in our military. We value them. We cherish them. But no, we don't want them driving Humvees, you know, through the streets of D.C. every day.

Rosin: Yeah, it's a really good point. I've obviously seen National Guard in the streets before, but seeing tanks in D.C. streets while, on the other coast, Marines are being deployed in Los Angeles has a very different feeling.

Nichols: I think it feels wrong, and in part because, you know, part of the protection of American freedom is embedded in our system of federalism so that your local police are answerable to your local government, which in turn can be superseded by your state police, who answers to your state government. And if things really get tough, you have a National Guard of your fellow citizens, your neighbors, your friends who are then answerable, as well, to the governor.

You should have to go through a whole bunch of blown circuits before you get to the United States military being in the streets of our own country, in part not just because it's such a violation of everything from, you know, George Washington onward. I mean, this whole thing with the parade is something I think that would make the father of the American Army, George Washington, ill. But it's also something that we avoid because it really is—you know, for conservatives who talk about not wanting to have a dictatorial central government, they're acting like they really want a dictatorial central government.

And when you talk about the Army. You know, you're saying, State, local, county, government—none of that matters. The only real power in this country is right here in the White House in this one man. And it's also a bad idea because the military itself hates these missions. And that's good—you want a military that doesn't like domestic-policing missions.

Rosin: Right. Well, speaking of bypassing local authority, this is all happening against the backdrop of Trump sending the National Guard and troops to Los Angeles to deal with the protests against ICE raids, which Trump has called “lawless” and “an invasion.” And Governor Gavin Newsom says he didn't ask for help and said the L.A. police could handle them. Why do you think he sent the troops then?

Nichols: Specifically to show that Gavin Newsom is not in charge of the state of California, and that Karen Bass is not in charge of the city of Los Angeles. It's a very dramatic way of saying, All power in this country belongs to me, Donald Trump, and if I see something in Los Angeles I don't like, I don't care who the people of California elected—they mean nothing—I'm going to call out the Army because I can, and I want to establish that I can.

[Music]  Rosin: After the break, how to engineer a crisis—and how to counter it.

[Break]

Rosin: He does use the phrase “liberate Los Angeles,” but I'm still not clear what it serves him. Why there? And you said he saw things that he didn't like. At least as Gavin Newsom puts it and reports from Los Angeles, they weren't especially violent. They didn't get out of control. It wasn't a situation that the L.A. police could not handle, at least according to Gavin Newsom. So what is it that he's trying to do or accomplish? What's the symbolism? What does it mean?

Nichols: Oh, you know, Trump has a genius for picking the right fights. Remember: His goal has nothing really to do with Los Angeles or California. The strategy here is: Let's go to a blue state. Let's go to one of the bluest cities in the blue states. Let's totally humiliate people that the American right really hates. And let's do it in a place where our narrative that America is under foreign invasion, which allows me to invoke these old laws, Alien Acts, and so on in response to an invasion—let's go do it in the one place where I can count on the local population to do their part by cosplaying as exactly the kind of, you know, foreign-invasion force that I need them to play.

They will play their role. And if there was any place they're going to do it, it's going to be in Los Angeles.

Rosin: Right. So maybe it's an example of what people always say about Trump, that he can engineer his own reality. I mean, he can stage the theater and then walk into it.

Nichols: When I taught strategy—there's an expression we use when we're talking about when you're trying to plan your operations and your opponent isn't particularly adept. We call that a “cooperative adversary.” And Trump went someplace where he knows he has a cooperative adversary.

Rosin: Right. So in his speech on Tuesday, Newsom said, “It's time for all of us to stand up.” He left it vague what he meant by that, but that's what he said. You wrote a couple of what I thought were chilling sentences directed at the protesters, telling them not to provoke the soldiers. What you wrote was, “You will not be heroes. You will be pretext.” What do you mean by that? Pretext for what?

Nichols: A bigger crackdown, and for legislative action by these Republicans to say, Yeah, go ahead. We won't stop you if you want to invoke the Insurrection Act. The American people on both the right and the left, unfortunately, especially on the fringes, have—I think what George Will wisely once called—a “hunger for apocalypse,” a kind of aching for drama, where they want to feel like they're part of a big tableau of a big adventure movie with a Hans Zimmer score.

And Trump knows that. He has a great instinct for theater. He has a great instinct for what will trigger his opponents, and going to Los Angeles with the Army was just a very clever thing to do. And one of the things that you see that sometimes humiliates authoritarians is when they say, There are terrible things happening, and people say, I was at work today. Everything seems fine to me. 

Rosin: Yeah. Our writer Anne Applebaum wrote about this, that when there's a kind of a lull in the action or even a downturn in support, there's a need to engineer a crisis. And she's suggesting maybe this, what's happening in L.A. now, is the engineering of a crisis, to kind of whip that theater back up again.

Nichols: It's absolutely what he's doing. And he's thinking ahead. Another of our colleagues, David Frum, made the point that this is a dress rehearsal. He's going to look for opportunities, perhaps even during voting, where he's going to say, Oh, I see irregularities. I see problems. I see people saying they are being harassed at the polls, and by then, he will have gotten us used to, you know, in this kind of “boiling the frog” approach. He will have us used to the president just running roughshod over the governors and sending in the Army.

Rosin: So if Americans have an appetite for this kind of drama, what do you think would be an effective way to counter this, what you call, authoritarian tendency?

Nichols: Well, that's the thing. People on social media get mad at me and I say, Well, have you considered voting? Because people say, Well, I voted. Yes, but have you voted at the local and state level? There are things you can do. You can register people to vote; you can donate to organizations that are fighting this in court.

And I think the courts—and I've written about this, the courts—have become the last line of defense, and I think they're actually doing well. And I think one of the reasons Trump is doing all this is because he's been losing so consistently. He's trying to figure out a way to short-circuit the boring drudgery of the legal process that keeps working against him.

So, you know, my answer is, look—the Founders were great believers in stoicism. I believe there are times to go into the streets, but if the president is laying a gigantic trap, don't walk into it.

Rosin: Tom, thank you so much for joining me.

A short story

You can see the buttes and mesas easily—see them from the road. But to see them in all their glory, you have to walk a ways off the asphalt. That's true for the rest of it as well: the dried riverbeds, gullies, hoodoos, and hogbacks. The sky you can see from anywhere, but go farther into the land and it becomes bluer, deeper, and the whole shebang becomes just stupidly scenic, like something a cartoon roadrunner would paint to outwit a cartoon coyote.

Meaning death might lurk behind every vista.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

My father and I used to go out there together. The “together” being a concession to my mother, a concession granted bitterly and retributed upon me in various ways. He would hunt. Desert mule deer, mostly. He didn't say much to me on those trips. No life lessons. It was mostly us tramping around, him shooting, animals dropping, me bearing dumb witness.

Out among arroyos, beneath the steepled skies …

That line came to me once on such a trip.

On that particular outing, Dad had been worse off than usual, and when our car wove into the lot and stuttered into park, he listed over, hat falling. I listened to the dash beep for a full minute before I turned the key from the passenger side. The engine pinged a while. And when it was clear that he wasn't waking up anytime soon, I got out and walked off into the scrub alone.

I walked and walked. The buttes came into focus. Up closer, they were ribbed, like a bunch of lady-giants gathering in their skirts (and I thought of that line, about “the giants” and their “skirts,” then too).

Anyway, back on that hike of mine, I was intent—as I often was as a teenager—on trying to write something, in this case about the sanctity of the landscape I was then toiling through. And by the time the sun was all the way up, I was sitting on a rock in the shadow of one of those behemoth formations, still trying to tie together those themes. I couldn't make the poem work.

Yet that day, on my own, without my dad's oppressive squint, and without the silence-splintering gunshots, the world opened itself up before me, and though I couldn't wrangle that poem into anything usable, I was just full of metaphor.

As the sun moved, I moved with it, and I came eventually all the way up to touch that great butte, where I plopped down again. Ate my lunch. Drank most of the powdered tea. Saw clouds complete a full passage across the sky. The shadow receded. I kept having to move to stay inside it.

I wrote some more.

After a while, out in the scree, it occurred to me that if Dad hadn't woken up, he'd be frying in the car, maybe dead. So I put my notebook away, gathered myself up, and went back. I was panting and half dead myself by the time I got to the lot.

Car was gone.

I walked home beside the highway—took the whole rest of the day, into evening, to get there—tee tied above my charred brow, canteen empty, head swimming, hot metal shrieking past.

That night I had to sleep in a full tub, and the pain of those burns didn't subside for a long while.

After my father lost the ranch, he took whatever job he could find, landing finally on insurance, meaning he sold it. Sold policies to dry cleaners, quick-service food operations, down-market rodeos, strip clubs, pool-maintenance firms, bowling alleys, lube joints, moving companies, wrecking crews, pawnshops, lumberyards, sewage-removal units, taxidermists, pest-control outfits, massage parlors, go-cart tracks, gas stations, brick-facers, laser-tag arenas, drive-ins, that place that sells local shit on Interstate 23 (meteorites, Native memorabilia, petrified wood), the Motel El Rancho, the barbers and the ladies'-hairdo spots, spirit vendors, pet groomers, general contractors, karate dojos—that is, whatever small-business interests managed to stick it out through the long drought and downturn, the same one that forced him off his land.

He did not love his new life, it's safe to say, as it is safe to say that risk assessment and liability were not the subjects of his childhood dreams. Horses and cattle were, and the thwarting of those dreams—the daily defeat of unattainable desires—accounted for much of the serious mean he had on him (the drink accounted for the rest), and by the time I was 10, he could be red-faced and despicable all the way from breakfast through bed. We never saw him for dinner, but sometimes after, when I was already tucked in, I'd hear that stammering tread, and wince. His unpleasantness was rank, a herd in the parlor, trampling and snorting, squeezing the rest of us into tight spaces, or straight out of the room.

Then the next drought. And the next slump. Everything blighted, including those local concerns, and so too the selling of insurance. Money, always a hardship for us, became a desperate need, and notices began appearing—first in the mail and then on the door—at the new place we rented in town. Then came the death of my mother's sister back East from cancer in her uterus, with her parents following not long after. And next, one result of the mounting losses, came my mother's discovery of Christ.

This was completely out of nowhere, and calamitous. Calamitous for two reasons, one of which was that it drove a wedge between her and me, as though she had newly birthed—and then favored—a whole other son. Soon after, she ceased reading books, once her daily bread: gave up reading them to herself, and reading them to me, her (true) son, just as she gave up all of those wonderful and various words she tendered to me for my benefit. Impassive. Wan. Burnish. Epitaph. Susurration. Cumulative. Staccato. All language, that is, that wasn't dictated by the Lord in his book.

She also ceased using that sweet, teaching voice of hers, and spoke to me instead with a disappointed-sounding voice, as if I was beyond hope.

When had I got beyond hope? I thought.

I had already begun to recognize that when she spoke to me in that new delivery of hers, she was not in fact speaking to me at all, but to those, generally, who had not seen, and never would see, the holy light (a company of the condemned, which also included the squirrels, the detergent, the porch, the desert, the sky, the dead).

The second calamity was that her newfound path antagonized my father, who had always stored up and slung his trademarked nastihoods at the faithful, taking their ways and manners as a personal affront, as if they were leveling accusations. And so he would spout off about those who would collude in mockery of him:

—Hell's better than church.

Just as Mom became “raised up,” his degradation metastasized into true hate, and he became even more “lowered down.” Barely seemed possible then, though by now, at my age, I've seen that there's always room in a body for more poison to drink.

He started to appear in all kinds of places where he had no business being. He was found in the town dump. He was found asleep in a parked bus he had broken into. Once, inside the car wash, the one with the colorful, riffling little flags. They were about to turn the machines on—the hard, hot bristles; that steaming rubber octopus—when someone saw him lying down there.

Several times he passed out in a public park and quite a few times ended in lockup.

On some of these occasions, we were the ones who found him. Those were the lucky times.

Mom always cleaned him up after, her expression strangely more satisfied than ever—a look of blushing fulfillment as she scoured him from top to bottom in the tub.

And so we maintained. Maintained through that whole year, until the new minister took over at the church on Holland, a church that my mother was then just beginning to attend. That's what finally did it for us. Or started to, anyway.

We found out about the new minister on a day Dad and I had come home early from hunting. My father had expended all his rounds into the dirt and air, having missed every living thing, missed because the sun was too fierce, Dad too unsteady. He was already in a dark state on the drive home, and I was treated to short bursts of well-rehearsed invective about who exactly should be blamed for his ill fortune, his conclusions on this matter having nothing to do with himself, but rather focused on a blurry band of cutthroats, teat-suckers, and layabouts who fully intended to rob him blind of everything he loved, owned, and, most importantly, was owed—him being owed everything from his rifle to his undershorts, his commemorative-coin collection, his bolo, his brown liquors, his slurs and spurs, his Tiparillos, his gasoline, his hamburger sandwiches, his lawn chair, his pomade, the hitch in his stride, the music that sprang up in his Pontiac mid-twang as soon as he turned the key, his drawl, his self-reliance, that famous mustache of his, his pocket change, his confetti of lottery tickets, the deed on the old ranch.

At heart, this “owed to him” was mostly (what he saw as) his position at the top of the pile, this bit coming in direct contravention of another lecture of his, concerning the importance of initiative, an initiative he never showed a lick of himself (a lecture I would entitle “Get-Off-Your-Ass,” or, often, “Where's-My-Fucking-Beer?”), and why anyone as train-wrecked and delinquent as my dad should be owed a single cent for his lousiness was hard to square. But of course I never said anything as he went on and on and on until we pulled in the driveway. And as we entered the house on that day, I heard the muted cadence of pleasant conversation, a thing as strange to hear—as out of place in my home—as the sound of an ocean suddenly lapping gently at the front yard.

The minister was sitting down to a soda with my mother in our kitchen.

Or rather, he was rising quickly as we entered—in the manner in which polite men might, when caught out alone with a woman. Pushing his chair away, backing up a tick. He even stuck his hands up and pumped his palms, smiling, as if to say, Whoa there.

—I'm Reverend Monroe. I was just telling Eileen about our new ministry.

I thought to wonder if I'd ever seen a Black man in our house before, but looking at one standing there, I became damned sure I had not.

Dad looked perplexed, truly taken aback. The world took a breath.

—Come join us, my mother said, patting the seat beside her.

But my father's look had shifted. And he was suddenly, dangerously amused.

He gave a dry laugh and said:

—It's so kind of you to look in after my wife.

—James was just telling me about his work overseas, said my mother, overly quick.

—James? said my dad, eyes of slits.

I felt then the release of something bitter and cold, a hazardous vapor—like the liquid nitrogen from a coolant truck.

I spun around without anyone even noticing. Went out the front door, and the wind closed it behind me such that I involuntarily jumped over the three steps down to the pavement. I started off east.

I found myself at my best friend Dill's. We spent our afternoons out in the culvert those days, living on jerky, throwing rocks at other, bigger rocks. Clinging to railway trestles and feeling that thunder above. Dill and I ended up going to the mini-mart for bottle rockets and snappers and then went to the parking lot to expend our ordnance. I wasn't home again until the evening. When I did get there, I headed upstairs.

My father's voice cannoned out at me from the living room.

—Where is your ma? it said, and I knew this as demand, not question.

I searched the house, and then went back into the darkening streets and visited the neighbors, but she wasn't anywhere. I came home—empty-handed—and luckily Dad was asleep on the couch, his back hunched away from the entrance. I took off my shoes and finally got to my room.

The next day, I learned that Mom had been at the clinic in town. Dad was, as usual, God knows where. But there was Mom, back in the kitchen, humming something and wiping down a counter. She turned and I saw.

A week later, she returned to that church on Holland. This was willfully unwise. But it was an expression of hope, and at least someone in that disfigured family of mine was drawn to consecrated places.

Of course there was an aftermath. Another one. A bigger one. And I have decided to let that all happen offstage and I certainly don't intend to continue making a big federal-style case out of it. Except for one aspect of the smacking-around (Mom's, mine), which is this: the overdeveloped sympathy that I feel for Dad, a prime example of my ability (or need) to inhabit the shoes of another, even the shoes of the antagonist, though such shoe-borrowing can be kleptomania, a disease.

Now, I'm not saying I forgive. No. I am sure I do not. But anger and resentment do not prohibit my exploring my father's corroded heart and finding in myself, if not love, then some understanding of the hateful engine that drove him.

And so, despite the unseemliness I feel around it all (which, given that I am a card-carrying commiserative, must seem odd, but believe me when I say I do worry that these stories of my youth are too maudlin, even for me, a very duke of mawkishness), I will tell some more (if only a little).

Only one more instance, and this was when Dad hit me in front of Mom, and because of Mom, and I did not hit back, and how that—as it were—set a tone.

I was slightly older then—must have been around 17. I had been spending an increasing amount of time out of the house, for the usual reasons, those being Dad, and one day had been invited out by my teen associate Marvin Grosvenor, whose cousin had a car we could borrow to drive with Dill to the dog track over in Coolidge.

We did that.

Spent the day at the dogs, lost some money, won some, and lost it again, and after, we went to the culvert to shoot our mouths off and shotgun beers.

I came home pretty late, which wasn't a thing as Dad was out and Mom had choir practice. But the following morning, the phone rang, and I could hear through the floorboards the indistinct sound of my mother's voice, and as the pauses between her speaking became longer, and the pitch dropped to something lower and more serious, I began to fret. When I came downstairs, she told me that Marvin's mother had called. Turned out the car we'd taken had not belonged to Marvin's cousin, but had been Mrs. Grosvenor's own—that it had not been so much borrowed as hijacked, and that Marvin, when confronted with evidence of his crimes, had spilled the beans on me and Dill, not just for the joyride but also for the gambling, the beers. The total rat. And as I stood there under the kitchen's exceedingly bright lights, captive to a litany of my transgressions, I considered the notion that I'd rather be slapped around than see my mother so dispirited.

—Shame on you, is what she said.

And I felt it.

That hot shroud of shame.

Still, I found myself saying then, as fatigue and hangover began to encroach upon reason, as if someone else had got hold of my vocal cords (and shame-heat being so proximate to anger-heat):

—It's none of your business, Mom.

(Shame: redoubled.)

At that moment, Dad walked in.

—What'd you just say to your mother?

—Nothing.

—Wasn't nothing.

—Didn't mean it.

My mother made some small noise.

—Fuck no, he said to her, and she did not say or do a thing.

Then, turning toward me and stepping up closer, he whispered:

—What you got, boy?

I looked at the floor, saying, quietly as I could:

—…

And the fist hit me on the right cheek.

When I got to my feet again, the thing of it was—not pain but—the feeling I had experienced of skin on skin. What I mean to say here is that the punch was shattering, yes, like all the others—I don't think he ever touched me except to hit me—but shattering because of how intimate this one was. I had smelled his breath and seen the individual bristles on his chin, the marbling of his eyes, the birthmark on his brow. It felt (I am embarrassed to say it) almost romance-like. A shared secret.

Skin on skin. The rough, hairy ridge of that man's knuckles meeting my smooth cheek.

He swung again, but I had put my arm up by then, and so it was more of a glancing thing, and then a grapple, which increased our congress to an unbearable level as I could feel the ambient warmth coming off him, his scent and sweat, hear his heavy snorts (and I wonder now if he felt what I felt in that moment: that beneath his fury were the dim traces of other, kinder embraces. I doubt it, but I know now that such belligerence-judo is always a kissing cousin to a tenderness-judo, and so it is with some men, and so it has always been, and so it always will be, and anyhow).

I pushed away and stood up fully.

—You want more? he said, but gasping.

I realized at that moment—with the fast and fierce intelligence of a cornered animal—that if I were to punch back, I would score a few hits of my own, more than a few, and good ones, as I was by then big and strong enough, which I think he, in that wild moment, clocked as well, because he looked even angrier then, squared up as if he could have well and truly killed me. And I believe he could have (and maybe would go so far as to say definitely would have) had there been something to swing at me then, anything at all instead of his bare hands. And I don't mean the extension cord or that belt he favored, but if he had:

… a coffee mug or a beer bottle or a pipe or the bronze statue on our mantel of the man riding the bucking horse, a regional insurance award that he had won—way back somehow and against all reason—or one of the two table lamps, or a claw hammer, or a chair, or a leg from a chair, or the TV remote, or one of his two guns, or a kettle, or the fire poker, or the phone receiver, or a loose doorknob, or a tire iron, a paperweight, a letter opener, a kitchen knife, a bowling ball, a rake, that old rail spike he kept as a memento of a prelapsarian age, a rolling pin, a crowbar, a baseball bat, a broom handle, a can of soup …

That is: I used to do such an inventory of the house, tracking items in it according to their potential use as weaponry. But though I could see him look around quick (milk carton, dish towel, cigarette pack), he had nothing at hand, and so I was able to duck and slip around him and be out of the kitchen before anything more could happen, him shouting hellfire after me, though I know now that I ran not because I didn't think I could take him, but because I could have, and I needed that whole sick, combative closeness to end.

I ran, landing back up among the buttes and mesas.

So that was grievous and lousy, seriously so, and I do not forget how grievous and lousy it was. And it was several years later when I received that automated message on my machine that went:

To this day I do not know how exactly it went down for him, as I had not cared to inquire.

But now I do wonder. And I imagine a hard end for Dad there, given the setting, and I think about how, in my nightmares, the eyes of my father became the frantic ones of those destroyed deer, and I feel bad, but then again, he earned his end—all of us are our own arsonists of the world—and so with regard to him, I rarely reproach myself for those moments of ill will and nasty thinking.

But still, still: It should also be said that I am, occasionally, reminded of the way back—when the suit and tie were still new to my father. Memories of kindnesses, strewn like a scant handful of seed. Memories of the view from his shoulders. A sing-along. Before life roughed him up. When he still dressed for the office. Those moments actually happened.

They stopped, of course, but at first he would teeter between the loving and the violent, and even exhibited the two overlapping, in that he might cry as he pulled out that extension cord and called for me. I still don't know who his tears were supposed to be on behalf of, but I think of them as a prime example of the thin boundaries between feelings, how they can come together, like anger and shame, and feed on one another.

That day of (what was to be) his final attempt on me, I heard my mother's voice as I ran from the house, and I looked over my shoulder, and caught through the diminishing doorway a momentary sight of him, red-faced but also: wet-eyed … and these eyes have become almost like an emblem of the whole event, a sign for it, the thing it strangely comes wrapped in. That is, when I think back on it all, wincing, I dwell upon his wet eyes.

Those wet eyes, though, I'll think. Those wet eyes.

Il Foglio editor Claudio Cerasa believes the chatbot should be treated like a colleague.

For more than 20 years, print media has been a bit of a punching bag for digital-technology companies. Craigslist killed the paid classifieds, free websites led people to think newspapers and magazines were committing robbery when they charged for subscriptions, and the smartphone and social media turned reading full-length articles into a chore. Now generative AI is in the mix—and many publishers, desperate to avoid being left behind once more, are rushing to harness the technology themselves.



Several major publications, including The Atlantic, have entered into corporate partnerships with OpenAI and other AI firms. Any number of experiments have ensued—publishers have used the software to help translate work into different languages, draft headlines, and write summaries or even articles. But perhaps no publication has gone further than the Italian newspaper Il Foglio. For one month, beginning in late March, Il Foglio printed a daily insert consisting of four pages of AI-written articles and headlines. Each day, Il Foglio's top editor, Claudio Cerasa, asked ChatGPT Pro to write articles on various topics—Italian politics, J. D. Vance, AI itself. Two humans reviewed the outputs for mistakes, sometimes deciding to leave in minor errors as evidence of AI's fallibility and, at other times, asking ChatGPT to rewrite an article. The insert, titled Il Foglio AI, was almost immediately covered by newspapers around the world. “It's impossible to hide AI,” Cerasa told me recently. “And you have to understand that it's like the wind; you have to manage it.”



Now the paper—which circulates about 29,000 copies each day, in addition to serving its online readership—plans to embrace AI-written content permanently, issuing a weekly AI section and, on occasion, using ChatGPT to write articles for the standard paper. (These articles will always be labeled.) Cerasa has already used the technology to generate fictional debates, such as an imagined conversation between a conservative and a progressive cardinal on selecting a new pope; a review of the columnist Beppe Severgnini's latest book, accompanied by Severgnini's AI-written retort; the chatbot's advice on what to do if you suspect you're falling in love with a chatbot (“Do not fall in love with me”); and an interview with Cerasa himself, conducted by ChatGPT.



Il Foglio's AI work is full-fledged and transparently so: natural and artificial articles, clearly divided. Meanwhile, other publications provide limited, or sometimes no, insight into their usage of the technology, and some have even mixed AI and human writing without disclosure. As if to demonstrate how easily the commingling of AI and journalism can go sideways, just days after Cerasa and I first spoke, at least two major regional American papers published a spread of more than 50 pages titled “Heat Index,” which was riddled with errors and fabrications; a freelancer who'd contributed to the project admitted to using ChatGPT to generate at least some portions of the text, resulting in made-up book titles and expert sources who didn't actually exist. The result was an embarrassing example of what can result when the technology is used to cut corners.

With so many obvious pitfalls to using AI, I wanted to speak with Cerasa to understand more about his experiment. Over Zoom, he painted an unsettling, if optimistic, portrait of his experience with AI in journalism. Sure, the technology is flawed. It's prone to fabrications; his staff has caught plenty of them, and has been taken to task for publishing some of those errors. But when used correctly, it writes well—at times more naturally, Cerasa told me, than even his human staff.



Still, there are limits. “Anyone who tries to use artificial intelligence to replace human intelligence ends up failing,” he told me when I asked about the “Heat Index” disaster. “AI is meant to integrate, not replace.” The technology can benefit journalism, he said, “only if it's treated like a new colleague—one that needs to be looked after.”



The problem, perhaps, stems from using AI to substitute rather than augment. In journalism, “anyone who thinks AI is a way to save money is getting it wrong,” Cerasa said. But economic anxiety has become the norm for the field. A new robot colleague could mean one, or three, or 10 fewer human ones. What, if anything, can the rest of the media learn from Il Foglio's approach?



Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.



Matteo Wong: In your first experiment with AI, you hid AI-written articles in your paper for a month and asked readers if they could detect them. How did that go? What did you learn?



Claudio Cerasa: A year ago, for one month, every day we put in our newspaper an article written with AI, and we asked our readers to guess which article was AI-generated, offering the prize of a one-year subscription and a bottle of champagne.



The experiment helped us create better prompts for the AI to write an article, and helped us humans write better articles as well. Sometimes an article written by people was seen as an article written by AI: for instance, when an article is written with numbered points—first, second, third. So we changed something in how we write too.



Wong: Did anybody win?



Cerasa: Yes, we offered a lot of subscriptions and champagne. More than that, we realized we needed to speak about AI not just in our newspaper, but all over the world. We created this thing that is important not only because it is journalism with AI, but because it combines the oldest way to do information, the newspaper, and the newest, artificial intelligence.



Wong: How did your experience of using ChatGPT change when you moved from that original experiment to a daily imprint entirely written with AI?



Cerasa: The biggest thing that has changed is our prompt. At the beginning, my prompt was very long, because I had to explain a lot of things: You have to write an article with this style, with this number of words, with these ideas. Now, after a lot of use of ChatGPT, it knows better what I want to do.



When you start to use, in a transparent way, artificial intelligence, you have a personal assistant: a new person that works in the newspaper. It's like having another brain. It's a new way to do journalism.



Wong: What are the tasks and topics you've found that ChatGPT is good at and for which you'd want to use it? And conversely, where are the areas where it falls short?



Cerasa: In general, it is good at three things: research, summarizing long documents, and, in some cases, writing.



I'm sure in the future, and maybe in the present, many editors will try to think of ways AI can erase journalists. That could be possible, because if you are not a journalist with enough creativity, enough reporting, enough ideas, maybe you are worse than a machine. But in that case, the problem is not the machine.



The technology can also recall and synthesize far more information than a human can. The first article we put in the normal newspaper written with AI was about the discovery of a key ingredient for life on a distant planet. We asked the AI to write a piece on great authors of the past and how they imagined the day scientists would make such a discovery. A normal person would not be able to remember all these things.



Wong: And what can't the AI do?



Cerasa: AI cannot find the news; it cannot develop sources or interview the prime minister. AI also doesn't have interesting ideas about the world—that's where natural intelligence comes in. AI is not able to draw connections in the same way as intelligent human journalists. I don't think an AI would be able to come up with and fully produce a newspaper generated by AI.



Wong: You mentioned before that there may be some articles or tasks at a newspaper that AI can already write or perform better than humans, but if so, the problem is an insufficiently skilled person. Don't you think young journalists have to build up those skills over time? I started at The Atlantic as an assistant editor, not a writer, and my primary job was fact-checking. Doesn't AI threaten the talent pipeline, and thus the media ecosystem more broadly?



Cerasa: It's a bit terrifying, because we've come to understand how many creative things AI can do. For our children to use AI to write something in school, to do their homework, is really terrifying. But AI isn't going away—you have to educate people to use it in the correct way, and without hiding it.



In our newspaper, there is no fear about AI, because our newspaper is very particular and written in a special way. We know, in a snobby way, that our skills are unique, so we are not scared. But I'm sure that a lot of newspapers could be scared, because normal articles written about the things that happened the day before, with the agency news—that kind of article, and also that kind of journalism, might be the past.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Baby Boomers' Luck Is Running Out","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/baby-boomers-aging-trump/683150/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

After a lifetime of good fortune, the generation has become vulnerable at exactly the wrong moment.

At the core of every joke about Baby Boomers lies a seed of jealousy. Unlike younger generations, they have largely been able to walk a straightforward path toward prosperity, security, and power. They were born in an era of unprecedented economic growth and stability. College was affordable, and they graduated in a thriving job market. They were the first generation to reap the full benefits of a golden age of medical innovations: birth control, robotic surgery, the mapping of the human genome, effective cancer treatments, Ozempic.

But recent policy changes are poised to make life significantly harder for Baby Boomers. “If you're in your 60s or 70s, what the Trump administration has done means more insecurity for your assets in your 401(k), more insecurity about sources of long-term care, and, for the first time, insecurity about your Social Security benefits,” Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School, told me. “It's a triple threat.” After more than half a century of aging into political and economic trends that worked to their benefit, the generation has become particularly vulnerable at exactly the wrong moment in history.

Perhaps the biggest threat to Boomers in the second Trump administration is an overhaul of Social Security, which provides benefits to nearly nine out of 10 Americans ages 65 and older. In an emailed statement, Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote, “I am fully committed to upholding President Trump's promise to protect and strengthen Social Security. Beneficiaries can be confident that their benefits are secure.” But in February, DOGE announced plans to cut Social Security staff by about 12 percent and close six of its 10 regional offices; a quarter of the agency's IT staff has quit or been fired. Social Security's long-term outlook was already troubled before Trump, and these drastic reductions make the understaffed agency even less equipped to support those who rely on it. Shutting down field offices means seniors can't get help in person; less staffing means longer wait times when they call and more frequent website crashes. “When you add hurdles, or cause a slowdown in terms of processing claims, you see losses in terms of benefits,” Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told me. In fact, shutdowns of field offices during the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic corresponded with decreased enrollment in both Social Security and Social Security Disability Insurance, which is available to Americans under 65 who can no longer work for physical or mental reasons.

Social Security cuts will most hurt low-income Boomers, who are the likeliest to rely on benefits to cover their whole cost of living. But even those with more financial assets may depend on Social Security as a safety net. “It's important to understand that many seniors, even upper-income seniors, are just one shock away from falling into poverty,” says Nancy J. Altman, the president of Social Security Works, an organization that advocates for expanding the program. As a whole, seniors have more medical needs and less income than the general population, so they're much more financially vulnerable. If you're comfortably middle-class in your early 60s, at the height of your earning potential, that's no guarantee that you'll remain comfortably middle-class into your 70s. In the next few years, Boomers who face more medical bills as they stop working might find, for the first time in their life, that they can't easily afford them.

Middle-income seniors are also likely to feel the impact of a volatile market. “They tend to have modest investments and fixed incomes rather than equities, so the type of wealth that will erode over a high-inflation period,” Laura D. Quinby, who studies benefits and labor markets at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, told me. After Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on all imported goods in April, the three major stock indexes dropped 4 percent or more. They've since recovered, but the erratic market—whipped around by Trump's shifting proclamations about tariffs—scares many middle-class Boomers, who are watching their retirement savings shrink.

In the near future, older Americans might find themselves paying more for medical care too. Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” which has passed in the House but awaits a vote in the Senate, would substantially limit Medicare access for many documented immigrants, including seniors who have paid taxes in the United States for years. The bill would also reduce Medicaid enrollment by about 10.3 million people. Although Medicaid is for people with limited incomes of all ages, it supports many older Americans and pays for more than half of long-term care in the U.S. Most seniors require some sort of nursing home or at-home medical care; one study found that 70 percent of adults who live to 65 will require long-term services and support.

Read: The GOP's new Medicaid denialism 

That support may soon be not only more expensive, but harder to come by. The long-term-care workforce is disproportionately made up of immigrants, so the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is likely to reduce the number of people available to take care of seniors—and increase how much it costs to hire them. “If you have no money, you'll be on Medicaid in a nursing home, and that's that. But if you're trying to avoid that fate, you're now going to run through your money more quickly and be more vulnerable,” Morrissey said.

Seniors with some financial security are more likely to live long enough to contend with the diseases of old age, such as Alzheimer's and dementia. The Trump administration has cut funding for promising research on these diseases. “Going forward, you'll find less treatments reaching fruition,” Thomas Grabowski, who directs the Memory and Brain Wellness Center at the University of Washington, told me. For now, the UW Memory and Brain Wellness Center, where Grabowski works on therapies for Alzheimer's, has stopped bringing in new participants; as time goes on, he said, they'll have to tighten more. (Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email that the cuts to research funded by the National Institutes of Health are “better positioning” the agency “to deliver on medical breakthroughs that actually improve Americans' health and wellbeing.”)

Changes at the UW Memory and Brain Wellness Center could have dramatic effects on current patients, including Bob Pringle, a 76-year-old who lives in Woodinville, Washington. In April, he started getting infusions of donanemab, an anti-amyloid medication approved by the FDA last year. The drug doesn't cure Alzheimer's; it's designed to slow the disease's progression, though the utility of donanemab and other Alzheimer's drugs remains controversial among experts. Pringle, for one, has found donanemab helpful. “With the medication, my decline is a gentle slope, rather than a rapid decline,” says Pringle, whose mother died of Alzheimer's and whose sister lives in a memory-care facility. “You're always hopeful that somebody with a bigger brain than you have is working on a cure, and the medication gives us some time until then,” Bob's wife and caretaker, Tina Pringle, told me. “But right now, because of the funding cuts, our outlook is grim.”

The unknowability of the future has always been a scary part of getting older. The enormous upheaval that the Trump administration has created will only magnify that uncertainty for Boomers. After a historical arc of good fortune, their golden generation has to contend with bad timing.

Younger generations, including my own, shouldn't gloat, though: Cuts to Social Security and a halt to medical research could well worsen the experience of aging for generations to come. Younger Americans will likely grow old under challenging conditions too. Unlike the Boomers, we'll have plenty of time to get used to the idea.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Fox News Vets Are Taking Over America's 250th Birthday Party","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/america-250th-birthday-party-fox-news/683167/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 15:59:00 GMT","

The celebration is supposed to be nonpartisan, but is turning into an arm of Trump's White House operation.

Just four months ago, the Fox News host Steve Doocy gave a social-media send-off to his young producer Ariel Abergel, who had announced that he was leaving the network. Alongside a montage of the two traveling through Iowa, Doocy reminisced about their three years together and affectionately razzed Abergel as “Ari the driver.”

Now Abergel, who finished college in 2021 and is in his mid-20s, finds himself in a much—much—bigger producing job: He's been tasked by President Donald Trump with overseeing the nation's 250th birthday celebration as executive director of America250. The congressionally authorized festivities, which kick off tomorrow with a Washington parade to honor the Army, are backed by more than $100 million in expected congressional appropriations and are supposed to be a nonpolitical, nonpartisan affair. But Abergel's new role has prompted concerns even from some Trump loyalists, as well as a backlash among participants who worry that his installation portends a bid by Trump to channel the patriotism surrounding the nation's semiquincentennial into a celebration of himself.

Abergel's operation helped fundraise for Trump's speech on Tuesday at Fort Bragg, where the president denounced his political rivals before a backdrop of active-duty troops. The group is also planning a 250th Kickoff Celebration on July 4, at which Trump plans to announce the fulfillment of two campaign promises: plans for a Great America State Fair in 2026, and a new, federally backed Patriot Games to celebrate American sports. At both events, as well as tomorrow's parade, which falls on Trump's 79th birthday, top donors have been promised a “dedicated VIP experience,” according to documents we obtained.

Trump and his advisers are eager to use the nation's 250th anniversary to highlight the various ways that, in their view, his administration is making America great again. The president considers the semiquincentennial part of a rolling celebration that he will oversee, a White House official told us. In Trump's expansive view, the events also include the 2026 FIFA World Cup—which the United States is hosting, along with Canada and Mexico—and the 2028 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles.

Listen: The real problem with Trump's parade

Much like tomorrow's parade for the Army, celebrations for the Marines and Navy are being planned for this fall, when they, too, turn 250. A New Year's Eve–style ball drop in Times Square is also being discussed for July 4, 2026—celebrating the Declaration of Independence turning 250, people familiar with the planning told us.

A list of new donors to the effort was announced this week and is filled with corporations whose leaders have sought to ingratiate themselves with the president—Ultimate Fighting Championship, Coinbase, Amazon, and Oracle, to name a few. Their tax-deductible donations do not go to Trump's political committee, or the Republican Party, but to America250 Inc., a nonprofit group that was established in 2019 by a bipartisan, congressionally authorized commission that Abergel now runs.

On paper, the nonprofit represents the whole country, without any political agenda beyond patriotic celebration. It is backed by an America250 congressional caucus, with a bipartisan group of more than 280 members from the House and Senate. But in practice, the group has been functioning in recent weeks as an arm of Trump's White House operation. Administration officials say that is appropriate because the Biden administration put its stamp on the early planning for the 250th celebration, and the White House was long expected to select the organization's executive director.

Others, however, disagree. Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from New Jersey, said in a statement emailed to us that Trump's leadership has been making decisions without informing or seeking the consent of the bipartisan commission that oversees America250. Watson Coleman, a member of the commission, said that she intended to “fight” to return the group to its nonpartisan purpose, and that tomorrow's parade was “being run under the banner of America250 without advance notice to, or consent from, the members of the Commission.”

“America250's mission is to ‘engage, educate, and unite,'” Watson Coleman said in the statement. “That mission has been hijacked by Donald Trump. It is unfortunate that what was meant to unite the country and honor its history has been twisted into yet another scheme for his own personal gain.”

Abergel, who interned for Trump during his first term and worked briefly in first lady Melania Trump's office, has hired another recent college graduate, Aidan Golub, as his chief of staff, according to Golub's LinkedIn account. He has brought over others from Fox News to help the organization, and added top campaign advisers to Trump, including the fundraiser Meredith O'Rourke, events planner Justin Caporale, and senior adviser Chris LaCivita. The former Fox News host Monica Crowley, who now serves as chief of protocol for the United States, has been appointed the “principal media representative” of America250. Several vendors who had been working on preparations for next year, meanwhile, have been fired.

An administration official familiar with the operation told us that Abergel helped plan large public events for Fox News when he worked there and is well qualified for the job. “He is taking something and fixing it,” this person said, after requesting anonymity to discuss internal matters at America250. “He is bringing in the best of the best.”

“Ari and the team have brought a fresh perspective to our programming that helps us connect with Americans across the country,” Rosie Rios, the chair of America250, who served as U.S. treasurer under President Barack Obama, told us in a statement. “As we approach America250, it's critical that our efforts remain bi-partisan and reach our goal of engaging 350 million Americans.”

Not all people familiar with the operation agree that Abergel is the best pick for the job. “He's not necessarily doing anything bad, and he's a super-nice guy and wants to do a good job,” another person familiar with the arrangement told us. “But the idea he'd be put in charge of this is kind of insane.”

The full scope of the changes at the group has not been made clear. A list of America250 “ambassadors”—including the musicians Gloria Estefan and Lance Bass, and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown—has been pulled off its website for reasons that have not been explained, while photos of Trump have been added in recent weeks. Meta was included on the website as an America250 donor earlier this spring and then removed; a Meta spokesperson said the company is not a donor. Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama remain honorary co-chairs of America250 with former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. Obama's spokesperson declined to comment on changes at the group.

America250 was involved in fundraising for Trump's campaign-style rally Tuesday at Fort Bragg. Before the event, military authorities at the base vetted the troops who were going to sit behind Trump, ensuring that they had passed background checks, had presentable uniforms, and were in good physical shape, according to a military spokesperson. Some jeered and booed as Trump attacked the “fake news” media, derided former President Joe Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom, called Los Angeles a “trash heap,” and described the protesters around the country who object to his immigration policies as a “foreign invasion.”

A vendor of pro-Trump merchandise was given a space near the rally site in what amounted to a violation of base rules. “The Army does not endorse political merchandise or the views it represents,” Colonel Mary Ricks, a spokesperson for the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, said in a statement. “The vendor's presence is under review to determine how it was permitted and to prevent similar occurrences in the future.”

Trump named Justin Caporale, who produced rallies for Trump's campaign, to be “the executive producer for major events and public appearances” for “my outside operation” in a December 31 social-media post. Caporale's firm was involved in staging the Fort Bragg event, and will produce tomorrow's parade, people involved told us. Although the XVIII Airborne Corps facilitated the entry of local dignitaries and other VIP guests of the military for Tuesday's event, that was unrelated to any VIP donors invited by the White House as part of the “VIP experience” for donors to America250, an individual familiar with the matter told us.

They referred further questions to Caporale's firm, Event Strategies Inc., which did not respond to a request for comment.

“There will be catcalls and detractors that will try to make this political,” LaCivita told us. “But the mission is to activate and include 350 million Americans in celebration of America's 250th birthday.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

These titles are great tools for anyone trying to navigate new opportunities, new places, or new phases of life.

A well-lived life isn't always a perfectly navigated one. Many days will evoke the feeling of choppy waters and, just as common, being completely adrift. These rudderless moments can come after joyful milestones, such as graduations and weddings, or they might be driven by unwanted changes—a breakup, for instance, or the loss of a job. Whether such pivots are expected or not, they might send us off into the unknown, make us wonder what comes next, or have us turning to others for advice. Trusted friends or mentors can help—but so can books, which can offer huge amounts of wisdom from authors we'll never meet.

When the right book finds you at exactly the right time, it can change the course of your life. A perceptive memoir or a relatable novel can shift your perspective on the troubles you're facing, or even illuminate a new way out of the doldrums. The seven titles below helped guide me during times of transition, and they're great tools for anyone trying to navigate new opportunities, new places, or new phases of life.



How to Write an Autobiographical Novel, by Alexander Chee 

This exquisitely written essay collection is, on its face, about living a writer's life, but its true concern is self-discovery, invention, and—perhaps most important—reinvention. In these chronologically organized essays, Chee loses and finds himself again and again. As a student in a foreign-exchange program, he locates an unusual sense of belonging; later, as a queer activist in the Bay Area during the height of the AIDS crisis, he discovers his voice at a time of tremendous loss. Taken together, the essays celebrate the cumulative experiences of being alive, and, from the wise distance of Chee's 50s, argue that detours and even missteps only make life richer. I didn't discover this book until I was past 40, but I can imagine what a beacon it might have been to me if it had been around when I was just starting my adult life.

The Seat of the Soul, by Gary Zukav 

Few transitions are quite as jarring as going from full-time student to working adult. After years of having school define the rules of play—where to live, what to do with your days, what to dream of—the graduate is suddenly faced with a host of independent, anxiety-provoking decisions to make, quickly. No book could be a better companion at this time than Zukav's guide to taking control of your own life. The author takes an analytical approach to spiritual growth. First, he examines how humankind has evolved into a species aware of external power; then he moves to the possibility that we can each harness our own, unique internal power, specifically by understanding consequences and aligning our actions with our intentions. Along the way, Zukav explores ideas about human potential and karmic cycles of reincarnation. His beliefs aren't universally appealing (though both Jay-Z and Oprah are fans), but they are sincere. Even if the reader doesn't fully subscribe to his worldview, his end point is a place many of us wish to reach. Through developing a sincere process of considering our motivations and goals before we make decisions, we can, Zukav promises, find ourselves in more fulfilled, less anxious lives.



A Visit From the Goon Squad, by Jennifer Egan

Egan's rightly lauded collection of linked stories found its way into my hands just as I was crawling out of a midlife mess in which I was making a lot of questionable choices. The book drops in on a highly populated world revolving around the music business, and for obvious reasons, I found myself drawn to the endearingly disastrous producer's assistant Sasha. Paradoxically, her story gave me a tremendous sense of hope that, regardless of my mistakes in the moment, everything would be okay in the end. We first meet her as a 20-something living in New York who steals a wallet while on a date. We see her teenage years as a runaway sex worker in Europe, watch her as a misanthropic college student, and ultimately glimpse her as a content and loving mother, living in California and channeling her love of music and curiosity into her children as well as artwork of her own. Sasha's life, like mine—and like all of ours—is full of low moments, but while those times shape us, they don't need to define us.

The Autobiography of Malcolm X, by Alex Haley and Malcolm X  

At moments when I've felt lost in the world, I've repeatedly turned to this account of a life as a political and religious awakening. The early facts are familiar: Malcolm Little was born to a poor Black family in Nebraska. His father was suspiciously murdered and his mother committed to a psychiatric institution while he was a child. Little ventured East, got involved in organized crime, and was eventually sent to prison, where he joined the Nation of Islam and rose to become a national, and then global, face of the civil-rights movement. But X's memoir is especially valuable for how it relates lesser-known, more personal milestones: He dwells, for instance, on the way a pilgrimage to Mecca caused a shift in his relationship with Islam; next to radical passages about embracing identity on your own terms and rejecting the conditions of an oppressor are self-interrogating studies of our boundless capacity to change both our life and our belief systems. X's account is a fantastic and inspiring primer on examining our past steps, recognizing when they are no longer working for us, and using that sense of discomfort to find something new—and ideally more fulfilling.



The Red Car, by Marcy Dermansky 

This taut, speedy novel is a delightful reminder that messy living can make for interesting lives and that, sometimes, interventions of fate are actually what get us where we need to be. Dermansky tells the story of a woman named Leah who is bequeathed a red sports car by an old co-worker. Despite having the kind of husband who makes dinner every night at home, she unexpectedly sets off, alone, from Queens to retrieve it in California. Leah's inheritance becomes the inciting incident in a series of events that unravel her life: Her trip awakens a latent violence in her husband and an invigorating independent streak in her. Every moment with the red car seems to take her further away from what she perceived was her neatly charted course but closer, in the most exciting way, to a different kind of fulfillment.

Kitchen Confidential, by Anthony Bourdain

Often, the first steps in illustrious careers are unglamorous, modest, or even incongruous. When you're at the beginning, you can easily feel that things aren't moving fast enough, or begin to suspect that you'll be stuck in that early stage forever. Bourdain got his start as a dishwasher in a watering hole in Provincetown, Massachusetts, for instance, because he was generally broke and needed beer money—but the job gave him the passion and the skills he would need to make a living as a chef in several celebrated restaurants. This clever, dishy memoir recounts that journey; it's also what launched his lauded second act as an author and a journalist. Reading Kitchen Confidential today, with Bourdain's legacy in mind, is a great reminder that it's possible to overcome your early circumstances, no matter how modest, if you know yourself, stay curious, and commit to learning along the way.



Sex and the City, by Candace Bushnell

Before they became the show of the same name, Bushnell's columns in the pink pages of The New York Observer documented, with light fictionalizations, the sex and social lives of New York's ambitious and powerful—and her own, though she frequently disguised her run-ins as the affairs of her “friend,” the character Carrie Bradshaw. In this volume of collected Observer columns, most of them focused on Carrie, Bushnell reveals herself to be a sage of power and social capital, an expert on relationships and how they can be used to build careers, accumulate social clout, and stomp on feelings. For anyone with a sense of ambition, whether you're moving somewhere new or settling down where you already are, her work is both an entertaining read and an instruction manual for how even the most casual acquaintanceships can transform your life. Cultivating them intentionally, Bushnell implicitly argues, can turn even the biggest metropolis into a small town where your next opportunity (or at the very least a good party) is just a conversation or two away.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","Donald Trump is building a strange new religious movement","https://www.vox.com/politics/416042/religion-politics-trump-christian-nationalism-liberty-maga","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

The old “religious right” is gone. The new one is weirder — and harder to fight.

For over six decades, the “religious right” in America was boomer “Christian nationalism,” straight out of The Handmaid's Tale. It was about “keeping God in the schools” and the National Prayer Breakfast. It was traditionalist, mindful of theology, and, well, theocratic, which is to say it wanted to take the standards of a religious tradition and apply them to the secular law. They wanted the books of Scripture to replace the statute books.

But President Donald Trump is trying to create a new religious right, one that is not just illiberal but fundamentally different and opposed to traditional religion as we've known it. The faith of the MAGA movement is not one in which the state conforms to the church, but one in which the church is bent to the will of the strange beast that is American nationalism — the belief that the American project is an exercise in freedom and prosperity like the world has never known, but also the sole possession of those who are white, heterosexual, and unquestioningly loyal to the nation.

It's a model of church-state relations that has less in common with post-revolutionary Iran, where an Islamic cleric known as the supreme leader and his council of religious jurists preside over government, and more in common with Soviet (and arguably contemporary) Russia, where the Russian Orthodox Church is subject to the whims of the Kremlin, acting as everything from propaganda tool to spy center.

This is the displacement of the trappings of religion with America First alternatives. It's not coherent in a religious sense. It's coherent in a political sense.

This is evident from the members and mission of Trump's new Religious Liberty Commission, as well as its three advisory bodies of religious leaders, legal experts, and lay leaders. The commission is tasked with preparing a report on the history and current state of religious liberty in America. 

By contrast, Trump's three immediate predecessors maintained an Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to advise on how faith-based organizations and the government could collaborate on issues like human trafficking, climate change, or global poverty. Called “Community Initiatives” under Bush, this model reflected the church coming to the aid of the state to address issues arising from the collective moral failings of secular society.

Trump abolished this office at the beginning of his second term. His new plan — the commission charged with producing an “official account” of American religious liberty past and present — is not only unprecedented in American history; it is the product of a very different view of the church-state relationship. In this formulation, faith is not a balm for the moral ills of a nation. Here, the United States, its history and institutions, is the means by which religion can sustain itself. And therefore religious institutions prosper or fail in proportion not to their own morality or faithfulness but to the extent to which America is “American” enough.

In another era, it might be possible to see this new model of engaging religious leaders as a mere accident and the commission as harmless pandering, a bone thrown to conservative religious voters who turn out election after election for Republican candidates. But it is much harder to see the commission and advisory boards as harmless pandering in the current political climate, when the concept of “religious liberty” has become increasingly weaponized. “Religious liberty” has been used by bakers to deny wedding cakes to gay and lesbian couples, by pharmacists to deny women the morning-after pill, and by ER nurses to refuse a Covid-19 vaccine. In a transformation that began when segregationists invoked their religious freedom as a defense against racial equality during the civil rights movement, religious liberty is now a dog whistle for opposition to social progress.

This strategy was one of the founding tactics of the old religious right, a tactic it shares with this new religious movement. But the MAGA religious right has taken this strategy to a new level. And this new movement is far more complex. If we believe that these ideological architects are simply “conservative Christians” or even “Christian nationalists” in the old vein, we are fundamentally misreading both the religious character of the MAGA movement and its broader ideological and practical aims. If, however, we perceive and understand the difference, we are much better situated to combat the radical remaking not just of American religion but of America itself. 

Nothing makes this new religious movement more clear than a quick survey of whom Trump has appointed to serve. Of the 39 appointments made to the Religious Liberty Commission and its related advisory boards, not a single mainline Protestant is among them. 

Instead, the board is dominated by evangelicals. Evangelicals' emphasis on personal salvation, biblical literalism, and emotive worship made them much more popular among America's least wealthy and least educated, in contrast to the more theologically flexible mainline Protestants who once dominated the country's political and cultural elite. These differences also made the evangelicals naturally more politically conservative than their mainline counterparts. The evangelicals on the commission are joined by conservative Catholics, Orthodox Jews, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of America, and Dr. Ben Carson, who is a Seventh-Day Adventist. Significantly, two of the three Muslims appointed by Trump, are white, American converts to the faith.

These are both inclusions and omissions that would have been unthinkable a generation ago, when American civic religion — that is, the collective and largely unspoken religious values of a nation — was dominated by the mainline denominations while Catholics, Jews and Muslims remained on the periphery. That's not to say that this exclusion was a good thing. But who is invited to the table does tend to reveal the values of the people and nation doing the inviting. The reign of mainline Protestants and WASPs reflected a certain set of principles about both religion and politics: moderation in religion and a separation of church and state in politics that not only maintained the neutrality of the government but also the independence of the churches. Not surprisingly then, as the old religious right rose to power, their enemies included not only secular liberals but also the mainline churches by whom they had long felt belittled.

The simple explanation for the omission of mainline Protestants now is that these denominations and their members have become more progressive and are simply too liberal for Trump. They are “victims” of the sensibility, good education, and pragmatism that defined them for generations and then lured them leftward. But this is only part of the truth. High-profile splits among Episcopalians and Methodists, as well as the existence of deeply conservative mainline churches like the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, demonstrate that there are still plenty of socially and politically conservative mainline Protestants in America, even if they are now a minority within their own tradition (which might also be said of politically conservative Jewish Americans). These religious and political conservatives would seem like natural allies to include in a coalition interested in traditional religion and traditional society. Moreover, the evangelical leaders of this new coalition might, in theory, be far more comfortable with a fellow Protestant Christian than with a Muslim, a Jew, or even a Catholic. And yet, they have been excluded.

The old American civic religion is dead. Instead, we are confronted with a cross-faith coalition united not by theology, but by a shared sense of cultural siege. This coalition has manifested not only in the Religious Liberty Commission, but on podcasts, in rallies, and in a growing number of organizations. Trump even touted the alliance in his now-infamous Madison Square Garden rally on the eve of the 2024 election. This is not to say that the traditions included are themselves devoid of theological content or that every member of these traditions is part of the new coalition. That is clearly not true. But the individuals and institutions entering this coalition are willing to put aside theological concerns, even subsume them completely, in the interest of the coalition's nation-building project. 

This project, born from that shared sense of threat (largely around issues of gender, sexuality, and race), is not, as they would have you believe, a concerted effort to return society to some earlier state. Trump 2.0 has made clear that it is seeking to reshape America in unprecedented ways. That's the opposite of being traditional and conservative. The goal of the new movement is to radically transform American life and society. 

While the religious right of the 1980s and 1990s was political because of their theology, this is a group doing the opposite: constructing a theology that fits their politics. Take, for example, the defense by evangelical leaders of Trump's sexual transgressions. Trump's sins are excusable because he is a messianic figure, they say, sent not to save our souls but America. It's not coherent in a religious sense. It's coherent in a political sense.

Another excellent example is Ismail Royer, one of the three Muslims Trump has appointed to do the commission's work. To begin with, Royer might be the first member of a presidential advisory board to have served prison time for crimes stemming from his connection to a terrorist organization. That's right, Royer served over a little over a decade in federal maximum-security prison after having been convicted of helping people travel to Pakistan to train with Lashkar-e-Taiba, an Islamist militia that aims to unite the whole of Kashmir with Pakistan and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the US government. He has certainly turned over a new leaf since his release. 

You can't counter this kind of movement the same way you would more traditional “believers.”

Today, Royer works as the director of the Islam and Religious Freedom Action Team for the Religious Freedom Institute, an organization that applies the American right's strategy of invoking religious liberty both at home and abroad. Royer has been an outspoken supporter of the plaintiffs in Mahmoud v. Taylor, a recent Supreme Court case that will decide if parents can opt students out of reading books with LGBTQ+ themes on the grounds of religious freedom. The irony of a man who did prison time for recruiting young people to a terrorist organization being concerned about kids reading Heather Has Two Mommies aside, Royer has actually developed a pretty interesting view of the relationship between religion and American politics, telling the Middle East Forum, “America is a Christian country. … It was founded in Christian principles…I would like to see a restoration of those principles.” These are principles he infers from “classical civilization,” which has long been code within far-right circles for draconian views about race, gender, sexuality, and the like. This both gives us some insight into Royer's meaning and suggests none of these people have actually read any Catullus.

He also penned a 2018 op-ed for the Washington Post titled “Muslims Like Me Don't Have Theological Beef with Evangelicals. It's the Prejudice Against Us That's the Problem” in which he recounts how “at home” he and his wife felt at the anti-abortion Washington March for Life among “fellow believers.” He also bemoans the greater welcome Muslims have received on the American left, arguing it has caused American Muslims to abandon hardline positions on issues like sexuality. Of course, Royer ignores that, as a white man, he is in the minority (in a way that matters) among American Muslims. 

But he is also making a fairly innovative argument: In claiming he wants to restore Christian principles and complaining against Muslims being welcomed by the left, he says theology doesn't matter; only politics does. Because in the end, America (not God) — and specifically America as it is imagined by the MAGA movement and Trump — is the source of liberty and human flourishing. With respect to the things that matter most to him, Royer does have more in common with the evangelicals at the March for Life than he does with those Muslims whom he mourns being “secularized” by the tolerance of the left. It appears that Royer shares a political vision of America with those evangelicals and does not care about sharing a theological vision with Muslims. 

Royer might become fast friends with fellow commission member Eric Metaxas. Raised Greek Orthodox, Metaxas has existed in a sort of denominational gray area for the whole of his adult life. He attended an Episcopal Church in Manhattan (where he served in the vestry) and has written bestselling biographies of the two most famous Lutherans ever: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Luther himself. But he is now comfortably described as an “evangelical intellectual.” All suffice to say, Metaxas probably doesn't care all that much about the deep theological issues that have divided Christendom. What he cares about is politics.

Metaxas is much more worried about feminism erasing women, warning against the Covid vaccine, and partnering with the messianic rabbi (Kirt) Schneider to get the rainbow back. And like Royer, Metaxas sees the America of MAGA's dreams as a bulwark against these perceived threats to the social order, as he suggested in a truly bizarre exchange with Michael Flynn. In the same exchange with Flynn, it becomes clear that, like Royer, Metaxas believes first and foremost in America, whose preservation and protection must take precedence over all other concerns.

This movement seeks power not to preserve a spiritual order or influence their own or anybody else's afterlife but to reshape society in the here and now. This is the only world they really care about. In fact, one of the most shocking differences between the old religious right and the MAGA religious right is how little the afterlife comes up. Where Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and Pat Buchanan never ceased talking about the threat of eternal punishment, both for individuals and the nation, these new guys never bring it up. They are, for all intents and purposes, metaphysical atheists, occasionally invoking vague theological language only because it still holds cultural sway. 

What the new religious right has built has more in common with the Roman Imperial Cult than the tent revivals of early America. Like the ancient pagan religion of the Roman state, the focus is on the power and fertility of the nation, currently demonstrated by the prevalence of pronatalism in the MAGA movement. Think about the concerns about medical treatment rendering trans kids infertile. Now compare that to the religious right's response to the AIDS crisis. Jerry Falwell called AIDS “God's punishment” for gay sex, but he did not frame the problem with gay sex as its non-procreative nature. For Falwell, gay sex was wrong because it was unbiblical; the absence of reproduction wasn't the issue. There is even more stark a contrast when we look at abortion. While the old religious right focused on condemning abortion as unnatural and murderous, parts of MAGA appear to be more concerned about how abortion access might affect birth rates. 

Finally, there's the seemingly endless celebrations of the state and its power. In the brief time since he returned to office, Trump has planned a military parade and established two new holidays. Now, with the commission, he has ordered a hagiographic recounting of the nation's history, placing the story of the country within a sacred narrative by official channels. That is big imperial cult energy (and if you don't believe me, read the “Aeneid”). This is the displacement of the trappings of religion with America First alternatives.

All this should matter to anyone who wants to stop them. First, you can't counter this kind of movement the same way you would more traditional “believers.” Combating the religious right in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s was in many ways as simple as pointing out hypocrisy and holding leaders to the same standards they held others. And it worked. Many of the figures of the old religious right have simply been shamed from public life, making way for their new, more pernicious, replacements.

But MAGA is pretty impervious to shame. You can't just appeal to theological humility or scriptural counterpoints. And you can't rely on their own sense of conscience. What animates them is political utility.

If we understand how the MAGA religious movement is different from the old Christian nationalists, those who wish to combat Trump and his ilk might find some new allies. All of those traditionalist conservative believers — the Latter-day Saints, the conservative mainline Protestants, Catholic bishops without Instagram — might be the key to taking down the Church of MAGA. This doesn't mean that progressives have to agree on everything or anything or even like them. But it does mean recognizing that the enemy of your enemy might be your political frenemy, especially when they are alarmed for different but equally serious reasons. 

Many traditional conservative believers remain committed to some basic moral architecture, to rules that bind even their leaders, and to a God who ultimately cannot be manipulated. The administration's draconian immigration policy is now disquieting some evangelicals, concerned about co-religionists who have sought refuge in America from real religious persecution. And the Trump administration's pronatalist advocacy for IVF has many conservative Christians, including conservative Catholics, on edge. These groups may not like the world as it is, but they don't like the world MAGA's new civic cult seeks to build either. And in this light, they may wish to fight it out on the old terms. If progressives can make the idea of the last war appealing, there is hope for a viable coalition.

Trump and MAGA have declared a religious war, not just against secularism or progressive forms of religion, but also against traditional religion that refuses to serve their radical vision for the world. This is not a theocracy in the making. This is not The Handmaid's Tale. It's something newer, stranger, and much more difficult to fight: religion of nation and identity disguised in the trappings of familiar faiths.

 We won't defeat it with scripture or appeals to conscience. We'll need to name it, unmask it, and forge unexpected alliances with those who (whatever their doctrine) still believe in a higher power than Donald Trump.

﻿The tech right saw in Trump what they wanted to see, but it wasn't actually there

I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I don't know anyone who says they voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or 2020. I know, on the other hand, quite a few who voted for him in 2024, and quite a few more who — while they didn't vote for Trump because of his many crippling personal foibles, corruption, penchant for destroying the global economy, etc. — have thoroughly soured on the Democratic Party.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

It's not just my professional networks. While tech has generally been very liberal in its political support and giving, the last few years have seen the emergence of a real and influential tech right. 

Elon Musk, of course, is by far the most famous, but he didn't start the tech right by himself. And while his break with Trump — which Musk now seems to be backpedaling on — might have changed his role within the tech right, I don't think this shift will end with him. 

The Bay Area tech scene has always to my mind been best understood as left-libertarian — socially liberal, but suspicious of big government and excited about new things from cryptocurrency to charter cities to mosquito gene drives to genetically engineered superbabies to tooth bacteria. That array of attitudes sometimes puts them at odds with governments (and much of the public, which tends to be much less welcoming of new technology). 

The tech world valorizes founders and doers, and everyone knows two or three stories about a company that only succeeded because it was willing to break some city regulations. Lots of founders are immigrants; lots are LGBTQ+. For a long time, this set of commitments put tech firmly on the political left — and indeed tech employees overwhelmingly vote and donate to the Democratic Party. 

But over the last 10 years, I think three things changed. 

The first was what Vox at the time called the Great Awokening — a sweeping adoption of what had been a bunch of niche liberal social justice ideas, from widespread acceptance of trans people to suspicion of any sex or race disparity in hiring to #MeToo awareness of sexual harassment in the workplace. 

A lot of this shift at tech companies was employee driven; again, tech employees are mostly on the left. And some of it was good! But some of it was illiberal — rejecting the idea that we can and should work with people we profoundly disagree with — and identitarian, in that it focused more on what demographic categories we belong to than our commonalities. We're now in the middle of a backlash, which I think is all the more intense in tech because the original woke movement was all the more intense in tech. 

The second thing that changed was the macroeconomic environment. When I first joined a tech company in 2017, interest rates were low and VC funding was incredibly easy to get. Startups were everywhere, and companies were desperately competing to hire employees. As a result, employees had a lot of power; CEOs were often scared of them. 

Things started changing when interest rates rose and jobs dried up (relatively speaking). That profoundly changed the dynamics at companies, and I have a suspicion it made a lot of people resentful of immigration levels that they'd been fine with when they, too, were having no trouble getting hired. And in the last few years, the tech world has become convinced that AI is happening very, very soon, and is the biggest economic story of our lives. If you wanted to prevent AI regulation, Silicon Valley reasoned, you should vote Republican.

The third was a deliberate effort by many liberals to go after a tech scene they saw as their enemy. The Biden administration ended up staffed by a lot of people ideologically committed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's view of the world, where big tech was the enemy of liberal democracy and the tools of antitrust should be used to break it up. Lina Khan's Federal Trade Commission acted on those convictions, going after big tech companies like Amazon. Whether you think this was the right call in economic terms — I mostly think it was not — it was decidedly self-destructive in political terms.

So in 2024, some of tech (still not a majority, but a smaller minority than in the past two Trump elections) went right. The tech world watched with bated breath as Musk announced DOGE: Would the administration bring about the deregulation, tax cuts, and anti-woke wish list they believed that only the administration could?

The answer so far has been no. (Many people on the tech right are still more optimistic than me, and point at a small handful of victories, but my assessment is that they're wearing rose-colored glasses to the point of outright blindness.) 

DOGE was a complete failure at cutting spending. The administration did not actually break from Khan's populist approach to the FTC. It blew up basic biosciences research, and is scaring off or outright deporting the best international talent, which is badly needed for AI in particular. 

It's killing nuclear energy (which is also important to AI boosters) and killing exciting next-gen vaccine research. Musk is out — so is his pick to run NASA. It's widely rumored that Stephen Miller is running things at the White House, and his one agenda appears to be turning all federal capacity toward deportations at the expense of every single other government priority. 

Some deregulation has happened, but any beneficial effects it would have had on investment have been more than canceled out by the tariffs' catastrophic effects on businesses' ability to plan for the future. They did at least get the tax cuts for the rich, if the “big, beautiful bill” passes, but that's about all they got — and the ultra-rich will be poorer this year anyway thanks to the unsteady stock market. 

The Republicans, when out of power, had a critique of the Democrats which spoke to the tech right, the populist right, the white supremacists and moderate Black and Latino voters alike. But it's much easier to complain about Democrats in a way that all of those disparate interest groups find compelling than to govern in a way that keeps them all happy. 

Once the Trump administration actually had to choose, it chose basically none of the tech right's priorities. They took a bad bet — and I think it'd behoove the Democrats to think, as Trump's coalition fractures, about which of those voters can be won back.

David French on Donald Trump's breakup with the Federalist Society.

Late last month, approximately 1 billion news cycles ago, an obscure federal court made President Donald Trump very, very mad.

The US Court of International Trade ruled unanimously on May 28 that the massive tariffs Trump imposed after taking office again are illegal. That ruling was suspended the next day by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the tariffs will be allowed to remain in effect pending a ruling (arguments are scheduled for late July).

But the appellate court's decision didn't soothe Trump. He took to Truth Social on May 29 to post a 510-word screed attacking the judges on the Court of International Trade, before turning his ire toward a more surprising candidate — Leonard Leo, the most important person in the conservative legal movement.

“I was new to Washington, and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges,” Trump wrote, reminiscing about his first term. “I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real “sleazebag” named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.”

This breakup surprised many commentators. But not David French.

“If you're familiar with how the conservative legal movement has interacted with MAGA, you have seen this coming for a while,” French, a New York Times columnist, lawyer, and onetime member of the Federalist Society, told Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram. “You knew this was coming after 2020. Because in 2020, after Trump had really stocked the federal judiciary with an awful lot of FedSoc judges and justices…none of them, zero of them, helped him try to steal the election.”

French spoke with Today, Explained about the origins of the (other) big, beautiful breakup and what it means for the Trump administration and the future of the federal judiciary. Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Federalist Society?

I am not now, but I have been a member of the Federalist Society. I was a member of the Federalist Society either all three years of law school or the first two years of law school. But it was also a very different time. I think the Federalist Society at the law school at that time, when we would have meetings, maybe 10 or 12 people would show up. Things have changed.

One of the most conspicuous changes is that FedSoc has become an enemy of the president of the United States.

From [2020] forward, you began to see this drifting apart between FedSoc and MAGA. When Trump comes back into office and he doubles down on being Donald Trump, all of this became very, very predictable. Because if the Trump administration's argument dovetailed with their originalist legal philosophy, they would rule for it. But if it was just simply Trump's lawless demands, they were going to reject it. 

And Trump is baffled by this distinction. He's baffled by it because congressional Republicans haven't drawn this line at all. When Trump's demands conflict with conservative principles, they will yield to Trump's demands every time. And the judges and justices have taken the opposite tack to such an extent that Republican-nominated judges have ruled against Trump about 72 percent of the time, which is remarkably close to about the 80 percent or so of the time that Democratic-appointed judges have ruled against Trump.

You mentioned a whole host of issues where FedSoc judges have perhaps not given Trump what he wanted. Does the one that finally tips Trump off to go for it on Truth Social surprise you?

It doesn't, because what really set him off was striking down tariffs. To the extent that Trump loves a policy, he loves tariffs. The Court of International Trade struck it down, and it was pointed out to him that one of the judges on the Court of International Trade that struck down the tariffs was appointed by him. He had been ranting about judges in general. Now he got specific with Leonard Leo; he got specific with the FedSoc. People like me who'd been watching this for a very long time were not wondering if this was going to happen. We were just wondering what was going to be the tipping point: Was it going to be a Supreme Court case? Was it going to be an appellate court? It turns out it was the Court of International Trade that brought us to this moment.

Leonard Leo did not author a decision from this court. Why is he mad at Leonard Leo?

Leonard Leo has long been a key figure in the Federalist Society and was very much a part of the first Trump administration, working closely with the administration to put forward judges.

For a long time, Trump looked at his judicial nominations and waved them like a flag to the American conservative public saying, look what I did. But the more the American conservative public started loving Trump as Trump, versus Trump as what policy wins he could deliver, the less he started waving these other ideological flags, and the more it became all about him. And so this meant that this marriage was going to be temporary almost from the beginning, unless FedSoc capitulated. And if you know anything about FedSoc and the people who belong to it, and the people who've come up as judges, I knew they weren't going to capitulate. It's a very different culture from political conservatism.

Do you think Donald Trump didn't realize that?

I don't think he realized that at all. He's had this entire history politically of when Republicans disagree with him, they either fall in line or they're steamrolled. And so it's so interesting to me that he actually began that Truth Social rant that lacerated Leonard Leo and the FedSoc with this question: What's going on? Why is this happening? 

And I totally understand his bafflement. Because all of the political people had surrendered, or almost all of them. And so when he turns around and these judges and justices just keep ruling against him, you can understand why he would take that as, “What's going on here? I don't get this. I don't understand this. I've been assured that these were good judges.” And so that's where you get to that real tension.

Do you think this rift with the Federalist Society will affect how he appoints judges going forward?

The short answer to that question is yes. The longer answer to that question is heck yes. A lot of people were worried about this because they were thinking, Okay, Trump 1.0: He has General Mattis as his secretary of defense. Trump 2.0: He has Pete Hegseth. You can do this all day long. The Trump 1.0 early nominations — sound, serious, establishment conservatives. Trump 2.0 — often MAGA crazies. The question was, “Is this same pattern going to establish itself in Trump 2.0 on judges?”

And then he appointed to the Third Circuit Emil Bove, this DOJ enforcer of his who was responsible for the effort to dismiss the Eric Adams case. He's nominated him for the Third Circuit, and a lot of people are now saying, “Oh, now that's your harbinger right there.”

Right now the conservative legal movement is not what it was then. It is fractured in many of the same ways that the political Republican world has fractured. And so there's a lot more MAGA lawyers now. There are a lot more MAGA wannabe judges now. And so I do think you're going to see Trump tilting in that direction pretty dramatically. The interesting thing about this is that it might impact the retirement decisions of senior Republican-nominated judges. A lot of these guys who are now old enough to retire were appointed by Reagan or Bush, so you have a layer of Bush-appointed judges who might be reaching that age of retirement, and they may not want to be replaced by some sort of MAGA figure.

An Air India flight bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad on Thursday morning.

241 people on the plane were killed in the crash, with one passenger surviving, Air India said.

The Associated Press reported that a doctor identified the survivor as Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national from Leicester.

Amit Shah, India's home minister, said he was being treated in a hospital.

""We received the good news that one passenger survived. I have personally met this survivor.""

Videos seen across social media appear to show Ramesh walking away from the wreckage.

Ramesh's brother, Nayan Kumar Ramesh, told BBC News that he ""has no idea how he survived.""

US President Donald Trump called the crash ""one of the worst in aviation history"" at a press conference on Thursday.

Data from Flightradar24 showed the Boeing 787 Dreamliner reaching an altitude of 625 feet before the signal ended. It crashed into a medical college about a mile south of the runway.

Minakshi Parikh, the dean of the college, said at least five of its students were killed after the plane hit a dining facility during lunchtime, The New York Times reported.

A mayday call was issued, but there was no response from the cockpit to air traffic controllers, India's directorate general of civil aviation said. Officials are still investigating the cause of the crash.

There were 169 Indian citizens, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian on Flight 171, the airline said. The DGCA said there were also 10 cabin crew and two pilots on the flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it was leading a team of US investigators who were traveling to assist Indian authorities with an investigation into the incident. British investigators also said they were sending a team to India.

The Hindustan Times reported that one of the aircraft's two black boxes, which records data relating to the flight, was recovered from the wreckage.

The plane, registered as VT-ANB, was first delivered to Air India in January 2014. It had flown to Ahmedabad from India's capital, New Delhi, earlier in the day, and had flown to Paris, Melbourne, Frankfurt, and Tokyo in the past week.

Thursday's incident is the first total loss of a 787 since the model entered service in 2011.

Boeing's CEO Kelly Ortberg said he had been in touch with Air India and that a Boeing team was standing by to support the investigation.

""Our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected in Ahmedabad,"" he said.

The tragedy marks the first fatal crash of Boeing's Dreamliner aircraft.

Boeing stock fell sharply Thursday, ending the day down almost 5% to trade at $203.75.

Morgan Stanley analysts said the event ""derails the positive momentum on Boeing's stock,"" which had gained about 25% this year.

Air India's CEO, Campbell Wilson, said in a video statement that the airline's teams are ""working around the clock"" to support passengers, crew, their families, and investigators.

He said that while he understands people want to know more information, ""anything we report must be accurate and not speculative.""

""We owe that to everyone involved,"" he added.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X: ""The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us. It is heartbreaking beyond words. In this sad hour, my thoughts are with everyone affected by it. Have been in touch with Ministers and authorities who are working to assist those affected.""

Images appeared to show the jet's landing gear had not been retracted.

Alastair Rosenschen, an aviation consultant and former British Airways pilot, told Sky News: ""If the gear was still down, then that would suggest that something is untoward.""

The crash comes at a testing time for Air India, which has been overhauling its operations since the Tata Group acquired the formerly state-owned carrier in 2022.

A year later, it ordered 470 aircraft worth $70 billion at list prices. The new jets, with much more modern seats, are a distinct upgrade from the older planes that make up the bulk of its fleet — although supply-chain constraints have hindered deliveries.

Alan Tan, an aviation law professor at the National University of Singapore, said in a Thursday LinkedIn post that the crash will likely be the ""costliest insurance claim in Indian aviation history.""

He said India was not a party to international conventions that protect ground victims in plane crashes, so compensation and insurance claims for ground victims in the Air India crash would have to be dealt with under Indian domestic law.

Insurance claims for victims on board would be based on the 1999 Montreal Convention, which established that airlines would be liable for the death or injury of passengers.

Tan told BI that Air India and Boeing both have their work cut out for them to restore confidence with the public, and there would be an immediate hit to customer perception, particularly for Air India.

""But as other leading airlines facing crises have shown, these are not insurmountable. Transparency and accountability in investigations and consistent messaging to the public will hopefully reduce the risks of a media spectacle,"" he said.

The Trump administration is proposing oil refiners blend more biofuels into gasoline and diesel next year while seeking to discourage the use of imported supplies.

The plan unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday would require refiners to mix a record 24.02 billion gallons of biofuels into conventional diesel and gasoline. That would be almost 8% higher than 2025, but short of what some oil companies and biofuel producers were seeking.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Rather than destroy or even delay Iran's emergence as a nuclear power, Israel's war risks bringing it closer.

Benjamin Netanyahu's gamble in attacking Iran may backfire without the support of US bunker-busting bombs against its nuclear facilities.

Photographer: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images 

There are three immediate questions to answer about the war that Israel has started with Iran, all of which lead to the most important of all: Can this achieve Israel's stated goal of ensuring, once and for all, that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon?If it can, then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to launch Israeli jets against a much larger nation of close to 90 million people would, depending on the nature of the targets struck and level of civilian casualties, be justified on both strategic and moral grounds. The destruction of Israel is a declared policy of the regime in Tehran and one it's been acting on for decades. There's no doubt, despite denials, that Iran's uranium enrichment program is designed to produce weapons-grade fuel; it's practically there, with a growing stockpile concentrated to 60%, a level far beyond any conceivable civilian use. So, even though Israel has a nuclear deterrent of its own, as a tiny “one-bomb” country it can't take the risk of allowing such a hostile power to also have one.But whether the air strikes can indeed succeed is a very big “if.” It's more likely that Israel can do no more than delay Iran's nuclear program by a few years. And if that's the case, it becomes impossible to justify the certain bloodshed and unknowable consequences of starting this war, because it would at best gain no more than the diplomacy it displaced. Both the abandoned 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and any agreement that might realistically have come out of US-Iranian talks that were due to resume on Sunday would do as much — only without loss of life, or the risk to regional stability and global markets.So, in trying to unpick what Israel's military action can achieve, the first of my three questions is: Why now? Netanyahu has for years been trying to persuade the US to help him take out Iranian nuclear fuel enrichment sites. Yet he chose the early hours of Friday morning to go it alone.One clear reason is that Iranian air defenses have been severely degraded over the past year. So, too, has the potential for retaliation that Iran built up over decades by arming both Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and Hamas, in Gaza, with missiles. Those changes in the strategic environment have created a window to attack at much lower risk to both the Jewish state and its pilots than in the past. And it's an opportunity that won't, as Netanyahu has correctly said, last forever.A second reason is equally clear and much more disturbing: The personal political interests of the Israeli prime minister. The belief that Netanyahu has been dragging out and expanding the war in Gaza for selfish reasons is now widely held within Israel, let alone outside. Conflict keeps him in power by avoiding a government collapse. It also puts off an inevitable post-war inquiry into the extraordinary failures of security and policy that allowed Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist rampage to succeed on his watch.It's unlikely to be a coincidence that Netanyahu's decision to attack has come just days after he and his cabinet narrowly survived a vote of no-confidence in the Knesset, and at a time when the broad popular support he once enjoyed for continuing the fight in Gaza has evaporated. A conflict with Iran promises to again rally Israelis around the flag in ways that his policies in Gaza no longer do. Motives matter. They can drive decisions that otherwise wouldn't be made.Another vital question is whether Netanyahu's plan for success in the war he's started is predicated on drawing in the US. I don't have access to classified information, or a direct line to the Israeli prime minister's calculations. But the consensus among military analysts has long been that Israel can do only limited damage on its own; to succeed, it needs the 15-ton bunker-buster bombs that only America has.These weapons are thought essential because Iran's most advanced centrifuge cascades for enriching uranium are buried 60 to 90 meters (197 to 295 feet) under a mountain at Fordow, about an hour's drive south of Qom, home to the Islamic Republic's most important seminaries. Iran has been building an even deeper facility to replace the surface one at Natanz, an hour further south.

We know from the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based IAEA, that neither Fordow nor an above-ground Iranian nuclear center at Isfahan were among the 100 initial targets attacked by 200 Israeli jets on Friday. Nor was there any sign of radiation leaks at the Bushehr nuclear power plant or the largest enrichment site, at Natanz. This makes sense. The first priority for any complex bombing campaign would be to neutralize air defenses and reduce Iranian options for retaliation, by hitting missile bases and the commanders who would coordinate their use. The primary targets should come later.Whether Donald Trump allows the US to become the proverbial dog wagged by an Israeli tail may well now rely on Netanyahu's biggest gamble of all, which concerns the third question: How will Ayatollah Ali Khamenei choose — or be able — to respond.As of Friday morning, Iran's Supreme Leader had authorized the launch of about 100 long-range drones against Israel, most if not all of which appear to have been shot down. In a statement, Khamenei pledged revenge against the Jewish State, both now and over a long future, so there's more to come. He didn't, however, mention the US. That was in stark contrast to Iranian warnings before the attack, which had pledged to hit America's personnel and Arab allies in the Gulf should any attack occur.Khamenei no doubt understands that any such action would draw US forces into the fight. So too would a retaliation against Israel that targets civilian centers. So, whether through caution or lack of capacity to do more by conventional military means, Khamenei may not force Trump to involve US forces. That risks leaving Israel to conduct a weeks-long campaign of air strikes against hardened uranium enrichment sites that may not succeed.Out of the same caution, Khamenei may also avoid any dramatic public gesture such as declaring Iran's withdrawal from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Either way, the stakes are now extraordinarily high and the outcome for Israel is uncertain. Iran already announced an acceleration to its enrichment program in response to a mere vote of censure by the IAEA last week. So it seems probable that, rather than back down, the regime in Tehran will now seek to build a nuclear arsenal as fast as it can.The risk to Netanyahu is that Khamenei can walk this tightrope between hitting back hard enough that he isn't damaged at home by appearing weak, but not so hard as to draw in the US and its bunker-busting bombs. If he can pull that off, then Israel's attack could backfire spectacularly, even while showing its continued technological and military superiority. Rather than destroy or even delay Iran's emergence as a nuclear power, there's a danger that this war of choice brings it closer.

In this article

For the better part of a decade, Amazon has been trying to carve it's way into the U.S. health-care market, through billions of dollars worth of acquisitions, big-name hires and high-profile partnerships. It's been a slog at times, and the company's long-term strategy hasn't always been clear.

Following a series of executive departures, Amazon is now restructuring its health business, telling CNBC that Amazon Health Services will be divided into six new units, with a goal of creating a simpler structure.

As part of the effort, the company has tapped a number of longtime Amazon leaders and elevated some One Medical executives to oversee the divisions. Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services told CNBC in an interview that the company has been working on the overhaul for the past several months. 

""Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively,"" Lindsay said in a video chat. ""One of the problems we're trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that's common in healthcare."" 

Amazon said it hasn't conducted broad layoffs as part of the changes.

The reorganization comes after Amazon lost several senior health leaders in recent months. Dr. Vin Gupta, who joined in 2020 and served as chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, left in February, followed by Trent Green, whose last day as CEO of Amazon's primary care chain One Medical was in April.

Aaron Martin, vice president of health care at Amazon, announced internally last month that he plans to leave his role. Dr. Sunita Mishra, Amazon's chief medical officer, also departed in May. 

Mishra and Martin's departures have not been previously reported, and neither responded to requests for comment. Amazon doesn't plan on naming a new CEO of One Medical following Green's departure.

Martin, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a memo to staffers that he'll remain at Amazon ""for a while"" to help with the transition.

""I then plan to take some time off this summer and hang out with my wife and my kids, finally get a cover band going in Nashville, and then possibly do something new,"" Martin wrote in the memo, which was shared with CNBC.

Amazon has for years been on a mission to crack the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care industry, which is notoriously complex and inefficient.

While it had long served providers and others in health care with its cloud-based technology, Amazon's first big splash directly into the market came in 2018 with the the acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million. Two years later, it launched its own offering called Amazon Pharmacy.

The company then bought One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2023, among its largest acquisitions ever, giving Amazon access to a chain of brick-and-mortar primary care clinics and a robust membership base.

There have been some major setbacks. The company shuttered its telehealth service, Amazon Care, in 2022. That came a year after it disbanded Haven, the joint health-care venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. The announcement of Haven in 2018 sent shockwaves through the medical world, pushing down shares of health-care companies on fears about how the combined muscle of leaders in technology and finance could wring costs out of the system.

In the areas where Amazon continues to operate, competition is fierce and, in the case of primary care, margins are very slim.

PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen, who left Amazon in 2022, recently launched a new health-care marketplace called General Medicine that will compete with Amazon. Mishra confirmed to STAT News that she advised the nascent startup. Amazon declined to comment on whether Mishra's involvement with General Medicine was related to her departure. 

Lindsay characterized the recent departures as part of the natural evolution of Amazon's health business. He added that there's ""no shortage of depth of talent"" within his organization.

""We're a fast-evolving organization because the opportunity is so big,"" Lindsay said.

Under its new structure, Amazon Health Services will be focused around the six groups, or what the company calls ""pillars."" 

Amazon declined to share financial figures for its health business, but Lindsay said it is seeing ""very strong growth"" across the offerings.

One Medical went public in 2020, and it was still losing money when it was bought by Amazon. At the end of 2022 in its last quarter as a standalone entity, it reported a net loss of $101.1 million on revenue of $272.4 million.

Since joining Amazon, One Medical has been working to open new offices in states including New Jersey, New York and Ohio. 

Amazon said in January of 2024 that its pharmacy business ""doubled the number of customers"" it served in the past year, though it didn't share specific figures. The company is opening pharmacies in 20 new cities this year, and about 45% of U.S. customers will be eligible for same-day medication delivery.

""If we can make one thing a little bit easier for a lot of people, we'll save them a lot of time, a lot of money, and some lives,"" Lindsay said. ""And if we stack these changes up over time, it'll feel like a reinvention.""

President Donald Trump on Friday lost his latest effort to overturn a civil jury verdict holding him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and then defaming her when she went public with her claims decades later.

A majority of judges on the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York rejected Trump's request for that court's full bench to rehear his challenge to the verdict. It is one of two defamation-related verdicts that Carroll obtained against the president.

The denial came six months after a three-judge panel on 2nd Circuit upheld a 2023 Manhattan federal jury's verdict, which ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages.

Two judges on the 2nd Circuit — both of whom were nominated by Trump to that bench —  dissented from Friday's decision not to grant him a so-called en banc rehearing of his appeal.

Trump could ask the Supreme Court to hear his appeal, but that court is not obligated to do so.

A spokesman for Trump's legal team suggested the president would take that step, saying that the ""Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax"" will ""continue to be appealed.""

""President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he is focusing on his mission to Make America Great Again,"" the spokesman said in a statement.

Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, said, ""E. Jean Carroll is very pleased with today's decision.""

""Although President Trump continues to try every possible maneuver to challenge the findings of two separate juries, those efforts have failed. He remains liable for sexual assault and defamation,"" Kaplan said.

Both this lawsuit and the other suit filed by Carroll relate to her claim that Trump defamed her in statements denying her 2019 allegation that he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the 1990s.

Carroll's first suit in Manhattan federal court, which related to comments that Trump made about her in 2019, ended with a January 2024 verdict in her favor. Jurors in that case awarded her $83.3 million in damages from Trump for defaming her.

A panel of 2nd Circuit judges is scheduled to hear oral arguments on June 24 in Trump's appeal of the verdict in that case.

On Wednesday, the appeals court denied a request from Trump's attorneys to delay those arguments until the court decides whether the United States can replace Trump as the defendant in that case on the grounds that he is president.

Carroll sued Trump again in 2022, for battery and defamation, after New York passed a law that temporarily allowed people to file claims of sexual assault for alleged incidents that occurred outside the normal statute of limitations.

That case, which was the subject of Friday's decision by the 2nd Circuit, included claims about the incident in the store and Trump's statements about the writer in 2022.

In his written dissent arguing that the full 2nd Circuit should have reheard the appeal, Judge Steven Menashi said the three-judge appeals panel that upheld the jury's verdict ""sanctioned striking departures"" from legal precedent ""to justify the irregular judgment in this case.""

Menashi wrote that Manhattan District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the trial of Caroll's lawsuit, excluded key evidence, allowing her attorneys to  more easily argue that Trump's comments met the legal standard for defamation.

The dissent also disputed Kaplan's interpretation of legal rules that allowed ""stale witness testimony about a brief encounter that allegedly occurred forty-five years earlier."" 

That testimony came from Jessica Leeds,  a woman who told jurors that during an encounter with Trump on an airplane, he ""grabbed [her] with his hands, tried to kiss [her], grabbed [her] breasts, and pulled [her] towards him,"" the dissent noted.

Menashi was joined in his dissent by Judge Michael Park. Both judges were appointed to the circuit by Trump in 2019, during his first term in the White House.

Four other 2nd Circuit judges pushed back on Menashi and Park, writing that the ""dissenting opinion would have us stray far from our proper role as a court of review.""

Those judges said that an en banc rehearing is almost always granted to resolve ""a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel's opinion and appellate precedent.""

""The dissenting opinion ignores this rule of restraint,"" they wrote.

Two of the three circuit court judges who rejected Trump's effort to overturn the verdict in December filed a separate statement endorsing the majority's view that ""the criteria for en banc rehearing have not been met.""

Those judges, Denny Chin and Susan Carney, responded at length to Menashi's arguments.

""Even on his own terms, our dissenting colleague fails to explain why any purported error warrants a retrial or full court review,"" Chin and Carney wrote.

Iran will not participate in the sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States scheduled for this weekend, Iranian state television said Friday on the heels of Israeli airstrikes against Iran.

The talks were expected to take place on Sunday in Muscat, Oman.

""We are still hoping for talks,"" a U.S. official said Friday morning.

But the Times of Oman reported that the Oman News Agency and Iranian state television have said the talks were suspended until further notice.

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier Friday urged Tehran to reach a nuclear deal ""before there is nothing left,"" hours after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran.

The Jewish state says its offensive targeted Tehran's nuclear program. 

Close Israeli ally and weapons supplier Washington says it was briefed on the hostilities but did not participate.

Iranian media reported the airstrikes hit Tehran and Natanz, which houses a key nuclear facility. As of Friday morning, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted, and ""no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.""

""I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,"" Trump said on his Truth Social media platform.

He added that he warned Tehran that ""the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.""

The commander in chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), Hossein Salam, was killed during the onslaught, Iranian state media reported. Israel's Defense Ministry said most of the top brass of the IRGC died in the attack. CNBC could not independently verify this report.

Circumstances ""will only get worse,"" but further bloodshed could still be prevented, Trump said. ""Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.""

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the first Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal during his first presidential mandate, imposing a spate of wide-spanning and economically debilitating sanctions against Tehran at the time.

The U.S. president has been steadfast in pursuing a new deal over Iran's nuclear program since returning to the White House, stressing he favored an agreement. Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran have yet to bear fruit on this count, however, with Tehran accusing Washington of not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium for what it says are peaceful purposes.

A fresh round of U.S.-Iran nuclear deal negotiations were scheduled for Sunday in Oman. Iranian officials have been cited by state media saying they will not be attending.

Other world leaders have broadly urged restraint as Iran and Israel navigate the conflict, amid Tehran's pledge to retaliate.

Markets are currently watching whether the rekindled hostilities between archrivals Iran and Israel, which have been simmering since direct fire was last exchanged in 2024, will embroil the broader oil-rich Middle East region.

In this article

Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS made their U.S. public market debut on Friday, opening at $13.65 a share.

The opening trade values the company at roughly $30 billion, outstripping rival Tyson Foods' market cap of about $19.82 billion.

JBS is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""JBS,"" a day later than initially expected. The company said it couldn't conclude certain operational procedures in time to debut on Thursday. Its stock was delisted from the Sao Paolo Exchange in Brazil a week ago as part of the dual-listing plan.

Since its founding more than seven decades ago, JBS has grown to become the world's largest meatpacking company. Last year, the company reported net revenue of $77.2 billion and net income of $2 billion, according to regulatory filings.

JBS operates a sprawling business worldwide, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S. and Australia. The company also owns more than 80% of Pilgrim's Pride, the U.S. poultry giant.

JBS's U.S. listing is more than 15 years in the making. The company's U.S. subsidiary first announced plans to go public in 2009, but the move never came to fruition after two postponements. Then, in late 2016, the company said it would have a U.S. initial public offering as part of a broader reorganization strategy. But months later, the Brazilian government began investigating corruption in the meatpacking company — including among JBS and its top executives.

J&F Investimentos, the holding company that owns a controlling stake in JBS, paid a $3.2 billion fine in 2017 to settle bribery charges. Former chair Joesley Batista and his older brother CEO Wesley Batista, the company's top shareholders and the sons of its founder, managed to avoid prison sentences by cooperating with prosecutors. The Batistas and J&F settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 for roughly $27 million.

The Batistas exited J&F in the wake of the scandal. However, they returned to the company's board last year after being acquitted of insider trading charges.

More recently, in October, the Brazilian government fined JBS for buying cattle that were allegedly illegally raised in protected land in the Amazon.

The company's history of corruption and bribery allegations led to opposition to its U.S. listing from lawmakers on the both sides of the aisle, making it look unlikely that regulators would grant their approval.

After President Donald Trump's reelection, JBS's subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride donated $5 million to his inaugration committee, making it the single largest donor. In a statement to CNBC at the time, the company said it had a ""long bipartisan history participating in the civic process"" and looked forward to working with the new administration.

The SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April. JBS shareholders approved the move by a narrow margin the following month.

World leaders are calling for restraint after Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Iran early Friday morning, in an escalation of regional tensions.

Israel has said that the strikes were targeting Iran's nuclear program. Leading nuclear scientists and high-ranking military officials were killed in the strikes, according to Iranian media.

While the U.S. did not partake in the strikes, President Donald Trump was briefed on them beforehand.

""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. Washington, which has been carrying out negotiations to reach a new nuclear agreement with Tehran, has previously said it would prefer a brokered deal to an armed offensive.

As of the latest, Iran has launched around 100 drones toward Israeli territory that the Jewish state was working to intercept, according to an Israeli military spokesperson. A state of emergency was declared in Israel.

The attacks raised concerns about the potential for broader clashes and hostilities in the region that is already facing instability and conflict along the embattled Gaza Strip.

On Friday, Trump said on the Truth Social media platform that he had previously warned Iran of the strength of U.S. military equipment ""and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.""

He also urged Iran to make a nuclear deal ""before there is nothing left,"" suggesting that future strikes could be more intense.

Elsewhere, U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer said that the reports of strikes were ""concerning"" and called on those involved to ""step back and reduce tensions urgently.""

""Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy,"" he said in a post on X.

British Foreign Minister David Lammy also said that any further escalation was ""a serious threat to peace & stability in the region and in no one's interest.""

The French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Noël Barrot, struck a similar tone on Friday, also calling for ""all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any escalation likely to compromise regional stability.""

In a social media post, Barrot also noted that France had previously shared concerns about Iran's nuclear program.

""We reaffirm Israel's right to defend itself against any attack,"" he said according to a CNBC translation. Barrot added that it was essential to ease tensions through diplomatic channels, and that France was committed to contributing to this.

German chancellor Friedrich Merz echoed this sentiment in a series posts on social media platform X, saying Germany was ready to influence the conflicting parties with all available diplomatic tools.

""We affirm that Israel has the right to defend its existence and the safety of its citizens. We call on both sides to refrain from steps that could lead to a further escalation and could destabilize the entire region,"" he said, according to a CNBC translation.

""The goal has to remain that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons,"" Merz added.

In Asia, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said he condemned Israel's attack, warning that it could further destabilize the region.

""Malaysia calls on Israel's partners – especially those with influence and leverage – to apply maximum pressure to halt further aggression,"" he said in a post on social media platform X.

China's ministry of foreign affairs also called for de-escalation efforts and offered to help with any such efforts, according to a CNBC translation of a state media report.

Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that it condemned Israel's strikes and that unprovoked attacks of sovereign United Nations members were ""categorically unacceptable,"" according to a Google translation.

Elsewhere, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that ""the situation in the Middle East is dangerous.""

""Diplomacy remains the best path forward, and I stand ready to support any diplomatic efforts toward de-escalation,"" she added in a post on social media platform X.

A spokesperson for United Nations General-Secretary António Guterres meanwhile said that the U.N. chief condemned ""any military escalation in the Middle East"" and called for ""maximum restraint.""

""He is particularly concerned by Israeli attacks on nuclear installations in Iran while talks between Iran and the United States on the status of Iran's nuclear programme are underway,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Numerous leaders from the Middle East region also shared reactions, as markets watch on for the possibility of a widening conflict.

Saudia Arabia's foreign ministry said it denounced ""the blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran, which undermine its sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms.""

Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran have repeatedly been strained over geopolitical issues and rivalry around oil, but the two countries re-established ties in 2023.

The United Arab Emirates also condemned Israel's strikes ""and expressed its deep concern over the ongoing escalation and its repercussions on regional security and stability,"" according to a statement by the country's foreign ministry.

""The UAE emphasized the need to resolve disputes through diplomatic means rather than confrontation and escalation, and called on the United Nations Security Council to take urgent and necessary measures to achieve a ceasefire, and to reinforce international peace and security,"" it said.

The UAE is one of a handful of Arab nations to have established partial of full diplomatic relations with Israel.

Elsewhere, the Qatari foreign ministry called the attacks ""a blatant violation of Iran's sovereignty and security, as well as a clear breach of international law and its established principles.""

Turkey meanwhile said that ""Israel must immediately cease its aggressive actions that could lead to broader conflicts."" In a statement from its foreign ministry, Ankara, which has been vocally critical about the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu in the past, reiterated that it did ""not want to see any more bloodshed and destruction in the Middle East.""

As tensions surge following Israeli strikes on Iran, fears have resurfaced that the Tehran could retaliate by targeting one of the world's most vital oil arteries — the Strait of Hormuz. 

The Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Any move to block it would ripple through energy markets.

However, market watchers believe a full-scale disruption of global oil flows by closing the waterway is unlikely, and might even be physically impossible.

There really is ""no net benefit"" that comes with impeding the passage of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, especially given how Iranian oil infrastructure has not been directly targeted, said Ellen Wald, President of Transversal Consulting. She added that any such action would likely trigger further retaliation.

She also warned that any major spike in oil prices caused by a closure could draw backlash from Iran's largest oil customer: China.

""China does not want the flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf to be disrupted in any way, and China does not want the price of oil to rise. So they're going to bring the full weight of their economic power to bear on Iran,"" Wald explained.

China is the number one importer of Iranian oil, reportedly accounting for over three-quarters of its oil exports. The world's second-largest economy is also Iran's largest trade partner.

""Their friends will suffer more than their enemies … So it's very hard to see that happening,"" said Anas Alhajji, managing partner at Energy Outlook Advisors, adding that disrupting the channel could be more of a bane than a boon for Tehran, given how most of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route.

""It's not in their interest to cause problems because they will suffer first.""

Iran in 2018 threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz when tensions spiked following the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions. Prior to that, another major threat reportedly came in 2011 and 2012, when Iranian officials, including then–Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, warned of a potential closure if the West slapped further sanctions on its oil exports over its nuclear program.

The Strait of Hormuz, which is 35 to 60 miles (55 to 95 kilometers) wide, connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.

The idea of shutting the Hormuz waterway has been a recurring rhetorical tool but never been acted upon, with analysts saying that it's simply not possible.

""Let's be real about the Strait of Hormuz. First of all, most of it is in Oman, not in Iran. Number two, it's wide enough that the Iranians cannot close it,"" said Alhajji.

Similarly, Transversal Consulting's Wald noted that although many ships pass through Iranian waters, vessels can still traverse alternative routes via the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

""Any blockade of the Strait of Hormuz will be a 'last resort' option for Iran and likely contingent on a military engagement between U.S. and Iran,"" said  Vivek Dhar, Commonwealth Bank of Australia's director of mining and energy commodities research.

RBC Capital Markets' Helima Croft suggested that while there could be some disruption, a full-scale blockade was unlikely.

""It is our understanding that it would be extremely difficult for Iran to close the strait for an extended period given the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. Nevertheless, Iran could still launch attacks on tankers and mine the strait to disrupt maritime traffic,"" said Croft, head of global commodity strategy and MENA research at RBC.

U.S. President Trump has warned of possible military action if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program break down, but it is uncertain whether these threats are meant to raise the stakes of U.S.-Iran talks or simply to increase pressure at the negotiating table, said Dhar. 

Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes on Iran early Friday morning local time, claiming the attacks were aimed at facilities linked to Tehran's nuclear program.

According to Iranian state media, the strikes killed Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, along with Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

While a closure of the strait remains highly unlikely, the escalating conflict has prompted some to consider even the faint possibility.

""[Closing the strait] is kind of an extreme scenario, although we are in an extreme situation,"" said Amena Bakr, head of Middle East and OPEC+ insights at Kpler.

""So that's why I'm not putting that option completely off the table. We need to consider it.""

Crude futures jumped as much as 13% after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran early Friday. Global benchmark Brent futures were up 6.5% at $73.88 per barrel as of 4.30 p.m. Singapore time, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate was trading 6.7% higher at $72.57 per barrel.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran launched more than 100 drones toward Israeli territory Friday morning after Israel's overnight missile strike on the country killed at least three of its senior military leaders.

""We can now confirm that the Chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Commander of the IRGC and the Commander of Iran's Emergency Command were all eliminated in the Israeli strikes across Iran,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said.

""Iran launched approximately 100 UAVs towards Israeli territory, which we are working to intercept.""

Rocket sirens sounded in northern Jordan as Jordan's state media reported the country intercepted several Iranian drones in its airspace.

Israel's attack on Iran, which it said was targeted at nuclear enrichment facilities, came just days before U.S. and Iranian officials were set to attend a sixth round of nuclear deal talks. It was the largest attack on the Islamic Republic since the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.

Iranian state news agency Tasnim on Friday afternoon local time reported a fresh wave of Israeli strikes on a military airport in the northwestern city of Tabriz. Around the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump made his first comments on the attacks in a post on Truth Social, urging Iran to reach a deal ""before it's too late.""

""I gave Iran the opportunity to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest terms, 'Just do it.' But no matter how hard they tried, and how close they got, they just couldn't do it,"" Trump wrote.

He added: ""Now everyone is dead, and it's only going to get worse but there is still time to stop this slaughter – before the next attacks, which are expected to be even more brutal. Iran must reach a deal. Just do it, before it's too late. God bless you all!""

News of the strikes sent oil prices surging as much as 13% before paring gains, with global benchmark Brent crude surpassing $78 a barrel at one point.

Asian and European stocks fell, as investors rushed into safe havens amid fear of a wider war in a region that accounts for one-third of the world's oil supply. Dow futures were down around 500 points at 6:35 a.m. ET.

Brent crude was last trading around $75.38 per barrel at 6:35 a.m. ET, up 8.5%, with U.S. WTI trading at $74.11 per barrel, up about 9%.

In televised remarks Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the opening strikes on dozens of Iranian sites as ""very successful,"" saying ""we struck the senior command, we struck senior scientists that advance development of nuclear weapons, we struck nuclear installations.""

He also made it clear that his country will continue to attack Iran ""until the threat is removed,"" and said that Israelis may have to spend ""far longer periods in shelters than we were accustomed to until now.""

All eyes are now on the next moves by Iran and the United States, particularly whether the U.S. will get involved in this conflict. The U.S. State Department has stated it was not involved in Israel's overnight strikes on Iran, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the actions unilateral and urging Iran not to target U.S. interests or personnel in the region.

Tehran does not see it that way. Iran's Foreign Ministry warned it would hold Washington responsible for the consequences of Israel's actions.

Trump is expected to attend a meeting of the National Security Council scheduled for 11 a.m. Eastern time.

Friday's strikes and the Iranian response are likely just the beginning in a rapid cycle of escalation, according to regional analysts.

""My sense is, from what we can tell in this early hour — and the assessment of the damage is going to have to go on for days — is that this is probably still the opening salvo,"" Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa practice at Eurasia Group, told CNBC.

A fresh round of U.S.-Iran nuclear deal negotiations was scheduled for Sunday in Oman. Iranian officials have been cited by state media saying they will not be attending.

""If Iran does not come back to the negotiating table, as the U.S. has already called on it to do ... then I think, and I fear, that Israel will have to take successive rounds of action to take out what's left of Iran's nuclear program,"" Maksad said.

The strikes took place just one day after the IAEA Board of Governors — the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog — passed a resolution declaring Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in nearly 20 years.

In posts on social media platform X, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a heavy response to Israel's attacks.

""That [Zionist] regime should anticipate a severe punishment. By God's grace, the powerful arm of the Islamic Republic's Armed Forces won't let them go unpunished.""

He wrote in a separate post: ""In the enemy's attacks, several commanders and scientists have been martyred. God willing, their successors and colleagues will carry on with their duties without delay.""

It is not yet known how and to what extent Iran will be able to deploy its arsenal of ballistic missiles and network of regional armed proxies in its efforts at retaliation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Dollar rallies amid safe-haven rush after Israel strikes Iran","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/13/safe-haven-rush-begins-after-israel-strikes-iran.html","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 06:53:35 GMT","



The U.S. dollar finally rallied on Friday — after trading around a three-year low the previous day — as investors moved into safe-haven assets following a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iran.

The scale of the attack, which marks a major escalation of conflict in the region, took markets by surprise, pushing up the price of the dollar and other assets thought to offer protection in times of heightened volatility.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major peers, was last seen 0.2% higher on Friday, trading around 98.11.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had launched a ""targeted military operation"" against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program. Iran said it launched around 100 drones targeting Israel in retaliation.

""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,"" Netanyahu said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the attack on Israel was ""unilateral"" and made without U.S. support. ""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,"" Rubio said in a statement.

The dollar's role as a safe-haven trade was reaffirmed by its rise against both the Swiss franc and Japanese yen — both usually considered safe-haven assets — by 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. Investors flee to safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty to protect their money from volatility and find stability when risk assets tumble.

ING currency strategists said news of the strikes had offered ""the oversold and undervalued dollar a catalyst for a rebound.""

However, they noted that, in normal circumstances, they would have expected the dollar's rebound to be even larger off the back of a ""negative shock"" in stocks and bonds.

""But USD's traditional correlations have disappeared of late, and it's likely that the 1.5% drop in S&P 500 futures is doing more to cap gains,"" they added in a note.

Looking ahead, the ING strategists said the depth and length of the Middle East conflict — and its impact on oil prices — were what investors were watching.

""The risks now point more definitively towards a prolonged period of tension, in contrast to recent episodes. And we think this could continue to take some pressure off the dollar,"" they wrote.

Prior to the strikes, it seemed like nothing could stem the dollar's slide, which had been exacerbated by policy uncertainty sparked by the Trump administration. Expectations of sooner-rather-than-later interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve were also a key driver of dollar weakness, as rate cuts push a currency lower.

On Thursday, the dollar index hit its lowest level since late March 2022.

It comes against a backdrop of widespread shorting of the U.S. dollar — with investors betting the currency is set to fall further. A survey by Bank of America, published Friday, showed that although dollar shorts are considered the most crowded trade, ""conviction in short USD remains largely intact.""

While rising geopolitical tensions underpinned safe-haven flows back into the dollar, revitalizing hopes that the currency will hold the low end of its multi-year trading range, that's not the only factor behind its latest rebound, Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial told CNBC.

""Surging oil prices introduce upside risk to inflation, prompting reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts this year, which further strengthens the dollar's bid,"" the firm's chief technical strategist said.

Oil and gold were also front-of-mind for investors on Friday.

Gold — another classic safe-haven asset — hit an almost two-month high on news of the strikes, although pared some gains as the morning progressed. Spot prices of the metal were up 1.2% at $3,423.69. Gold futures for August delivery were 1.3% higher at $3,447.30.

""The news has led to significant fears about an escalation and a wider regional conflict,"" Deutsche Bank strategists said of the Israeli strike in a note early Friday. ""The effects of the attack have cascaded across global markets, with a strong risk-off move for several asset classes.""

Some of the early market reaction had pared back somewhat by mid-morning London time, however, with Rabobank economist noting that it was looking ""really quite restrained.""

U.S. Treasury prices rose earlier in the morning, pushing yields lower. Yields on the 30-year, 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes were higher later in the day, however.

European stocks were traded lower, meanwhile, with U.S. stocks also falling.

The most dramatic market reaction was seen in oil, as investors worried about retaliation from Iran and potential oil supply disruption. Crude futures jumped as much as 13% following the airstrike, but came off those highs as the morning progressed.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate was trading 5.7% higher at $71.87 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent surged5.5% to $73.20 per barrel.

A number of global airlines had already suspended flights to Israel amid the country's strikes on the Gaza strip, and rising tensions in the Middle East.

In this article

Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang told employees in a memo on Thursday that he's leaving for Meta, confirming reports from earlier in the week about his departure and a large investment from the social networking company. 

Meta is pumping $14.3 billion into Scale AI as part of the deal, and will have a 49% stake in the artificial intelligence startup, but will not have any voting power, a Scale AI spokesperson said.

""As you've probably gathered from recent news, opportunities of this magnitude often come at a cost,"" Wang wrote in the memo that he shared on X. ""In this instance, that cost is my departure. It has been the absolute greatest pleasure of my life to serve as your CEO.""

Scale AI is promoting Jason Droege, the chief strategy officer, to the CEO role. Droege was previously a venture partner at Benchmark and an Uber vice president.  

A small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta as part of the agreement, Wang wrote.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed that the company has finalized its ""strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI.

""As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts,"" the spokesperson said. ""We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks.""

Meta's big bet on Wang fits into CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to bolster his company's AI efforts amid fierce competition from OpenAI and Google-parent Alphabet. Zuckerberg has made AI his company's top priority for 2025, but has grown increasingly frustrated with his team, particularly as Meta's latest version of its flagship Llama AI models received a tepid response from developers, CNBC reported earlier this week.

Although Zuckerberg has traditionally placed long-standing employees into high-ranking position, he decided that the outsider Wang would be better suited to oversee AI initiatives deemed crucial for the company.

Scale AI counts a number of Meta rivals as customers, including Google, Microsoft and OpenAI. Meta is one of Scale AI's biggest clients.

The Scale AI spokesperson said that Meta's investment and hiring of Wang will not impact the startup's customers, and that Meta will not be privy to any of its business information or data. 

WATCH: Meta's one of AI's leaders, not a laggard.

India, like many countries, is grappling with Beijing's restrictions on rare earth element (REE) exports — and it wants to develop its own domestic supplies. Experts say it could become an important alternative to China in the sector, but will require much more public and private investment.

In recent weeks, the world has been facing a rare earths shortage in light of curbs from China. Auto manufacturers across India, the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Germany have been affected. 

In response, Indian officials are evaluating how Indian Rare Earths (IREL), a government-owned company, can be leveraged to increase REE production, sources told CNBC-TV18.

The report comes just days after India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports of rare earth elements a ""wake-up call"" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative. 

Geoffrey Pyatt, senior managing director of critical minerals at McLarty Associates and former U.S. assistant secretary of state for energy resources from 2022 to 2025, echoed the commerce minister's statements. 

""This is both a wake-up call and an opportunity for us to deepen U.S.-India collaboration on an issue important to future economic competitiveness,"" he told CNBC. 

Beijing recently signaled plans to ease controls, and U.S. President Donald Trump has said that a trade deal with China that includes a resolution on rare earths is ""done."" But China's control of rare earth exports was not a new policy, with gradual restrictions of international sales occurring over the past two years. 

The recent shortage has further highlighted the country's dominant position in REEs: It produces roughly 60% of the world's supply and processes almost 90%, which includes materials imported from other countries. 

That gives Beijing considerable leverage over a supply of minerals crucial for various modern technologies, including robotics, clean energy, batteries and military equipment.

It's important to note, however, that rare earths are not rare in nature. While China has the largest deposits of REEs at 44 million tons, India also has a substantial amount at 6.9 million tons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That gives it the world's third-largest share of reserves behind that of Brazil, as per the agency's records.

India also has nearly 35% of the world's beach and sand mineral deposits, which are significant sources of important rare earths, according to a recent report from EY.

Given those considerable reserves, India is ""poised to play a key role in building a more diversified global rare earths supply chain,"" Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC. 

However, in order to use REE reserves, countries need the ability to mine and extract raw materials, as well as the capacity and technology to process and refine them for final use.

So far, India is lacking in advanced separation and refining technology, especially compared with China, the U.S. and Japan, said Abhijit Kulkarni, partner at EY Parthenon, noting that India so far contributes less than 1% of global REE production.

Other challenges India faces is a lack of specialized technical expertise in REE mining and processing as well as poor infrastructure in India's mining regions, he added.

As part of efforts to change that, India launched the National Critical Mineral Mission in 2025. The initiative aims to develop an effective framework for REE self-reliance in the face of China's restrictions and other threats posed to the geographically concentrated supply chain.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 the Indian government is also considering private sector collaboration with IREL. Among the options being considered are government incentive schemes and capital subsidies aimed at encouraging local mining and processing.

According to Kulkarni, a lack of private sector participation in India's REE space, in particular, has stifled innovation and scalability. Working in its favor, however, is booming domestic demand across technology sectors including electric vehicles, electronics and defense.

""This dual factor makes India both a potential supplier and consumer, which encourages government and industry investment into building domestic capabilities,"" he said.

India is already in the process of completing several domestic REE projects, including a IREL rare earths magnet plant.

""India will not be able to replace China's position in the market, but it can certainly play an important role in providing a new source of rare earths,"" CSIS' Baskaran said. 

In the meantime, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said India is also searching for alternative REE sources outside China. 

A delegation of Indian auto industry representatives is also gearing up for a China visit in an attempt to expedite their imports of rare earth magnets, according to local reports citing industry sources.

A court battle over the late singer Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate has highlighted the growing litigation over the trillions of dollars in wealth being passed down to spouses and families, experts said.

Jimmy Buffett's widow, Jane Buffett, filed a petition last week in a Los Angeles court to remove her co-trustee, Richard Mozenter, from the marital trust created to support her after the singer's death in 2023. Jane Buffett, who married Jimmy in 1977, alleged that Mozenter has been ""openly hostile and adversarial"" toward her and has refused to give her details on the trust and its financials. She alleged Mozenter is collecting ""excessive fees"" of $1.7 million a year and that he's mismanaging the trust assets, projecting income of only $2 million, implying annual returns of less than 1%.

Mozenter has filed his own lawsuit in Palm Beach County, Florida, alleging that Jane has been ""completely uncooperative"" in his efforts to manage the trust. He said Jane has interfered in business decisions, refused to meet with Mozenter and breached her fiduciary duties by ""acting in her own interest.""

The case has put a spotlight on the estate plans and business empire left by Jimmy Buffett, the singer famous for hits like ""Margaritaville,"" ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" and other breezy, beach-vibe hits. Along with his song catalogue, Buffett left homes, cars, planes and a multimillion-dollar stake in his brand business.

Buffett planned carefully for the afterlife. His will, first written more than 30 years ago and amended in 2017 and again in 2023, directed that most of his assets be placed in a marital trust for Jane. The trust was created ""for the wife's sole benefit of her lifetime,"" according to legal filings. The three children they shared — Savannah, Delaney and Cameron — are the so-called remainder beneficiaries of the marital trust, which means they will receive any remaining assets left after Jane's death.

Jimmy Buffett also called for a co-trustee to manage the trust with Jane. He appointed Mozenter, an accountant who had also been his business manager and financial advisors for 30 years, as co-trustee.

The assets Buffett left were substantial. A successful businessman and entrepreneur, Buffett built a brand empire and merchandising business that far surpassed his song rights and touring. According to the filings, the assets in the estate included $34.5 million of real property; $15 million of equity in a company called Strange Bird Inc., which held Buffett's interest in various planes; $2 million in musical equipment; $5 million in vehicles; and $12 million in other investments.

One of the largest assets is Buffett's stake in Margaritaville, the chain of restaurants, bars, hotels and merchandising that commercialized the Buffett lifestyle. According to the filings, Buffett's equity in Margaritaville was estimated at $85 million, held though JB Beta. Margaritaville currently has 30 restaurants and bars, 20 hotels, and vacation clubs, casinos, cruise ships and merchandise.

Soon after Jimmy's death, however, the relationship between two co-trustees soured. In her complaint, Jane Buffett said Mozenter refused to provide her with basic financial information about the trust. He ""belittled, disrespected, and condescended Mrs. Buffett"" in response to her request for information, she said. She said his fees of $1.7 million a year to manage the trust were ""enormous."" When she asked for her projected income from the trust, Mozenter continued to delay. Finally, after she enlisted the help of her friend Jeff Bewkes, the former Time Warner chief, Mozenter provide her with an estimate of $2 million a year.

According to Jane's complaint, Mozenter acknowledged that Margaritaville had paid distributions of $14 million over the previous 18 months. Yet he declined to make future projections. ""Based on that analysis, Mr. Mozenter told Mrs. Buffett that the Marital Trust's income would not cover her annual expenses and advised that she could 'consider adjustments,'"" according to her complaint.

Trust lawyers said the case is part of a growing wave of lawsuits related to inheritances and trusts. Over $100 trillion of wealth is expected to be passed down from older generations to spouses and families over the next 25 years, according to Cerulli Associates. More wealth being passed down means more litigation, since families often fight over who gets what.

The Buffett case has reflected a different, but equally common, source of disputes: dueling trustees. Estate attorneys said Buffett could have made Jane the sole beneficiary as well as the sole trustee. Yet he chose to have Mozenter as co-trustee to help manage and direct the trust.

Mozenter said that during his lifetime, Jimmy ""repeatedly expressed his concerns regarding Jane's ability to manage and control his assets"" and was ""very careful to create the trust in a manner that precluded Jane from having actual control over the trust."" He added, ""This fact has made Jane very angry.""

Attorneys said appointing a co-trustee is common. Sometimes the inheritor is ill-equipped to handle the wealth or asset. Sometimes they'd rather leave the details to someone else. Whatever the reason, tensions between the beneficiary and co-trustee often erupt into full-blown hostility.

""These cases almost all turn on the exact same issue,"" said Keith A. Davidson, with Albertson & Davidson LLP. ""You've got a beneficiary who doesn't feel like they're getting enough information and doesn't feel like they have any say. And you have a trustee who is being too paternalistic, and they feel like they can give out information what they want. That's a recipe for disaster.""

Emotions run especially high when one of the trustees is a spouse.

""Imagine you're married to Jimmy Buffett for 47 years, you have a say in how you're spending your money and what you're doing and all that goes away overnight,"" said Stewart Albertson, also with Albertson & Davidson LLP.

Since the lawsuits were filed in different states, courts will first have to decide where the case will be heard. After that, a judge will start arguments and ultimately decide a path forward. Attorneys said judges have typically sided with the outside trustee (in this case Mozenter). Yet increasingly, they have been siding with spouses — which could mean Mozenter is removed.

More likely, attorneys said, a judge will determine that the relationship between Mozenter and Jane is unworkable and name a new, professional or corporate trustee from a trust company or bank to replace them both.

""My guess is a judge is likely to put in someone as a professional fiduciary,"" said Alex Weingarten, managing partner of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP's Los Angeles office and chair of its entertainment litigation practice. ""That would allow the fiduciary to get in and figure out what's going on. It's not what she wants, but it would give credence to her argument.""

Attorneys said Mozenter's $1.7 million fee isn't necessarily excessive, since trustee fees can sometimes be as high as 1% or more of the assets each year. As for the return of $2 million a year on $275 million being proof of mismanagement, attorneys say many of the assets in the trust, like real estate, planes and cars, don't produce income and cost money to maintain. So the actual returns on income-producing assets could be higher.

Still, attorneys said the Buffett case offers two important lessons for families planning wealth transfers. First, they said wealth holders should communicate the plans for their estates before they die so no one is surprised. If Buffett had explained the co-trustee roles to both Jane and Mozenter, perhaps tensions would have been minimized.

""Jimmy did good planning, in that he set these trusts up,"" Davidson said. ""But he didn't think about how this was actually going to play out."" He also could have added a ""removal right"" in the trust to allow Jane to more easily remove Mozenter if she wished.

The second lesson is that friends or business associates don't always make good trustees. While today's wealthy often name a trusted friend to a family trust, the trustee may have a different relationship with the beneficiary and can see themselves as carrying out the wishes of the descendant — which is not the job of a trustee.

""In terms of problem cases, the ones we see, they rarely involve professional trustees,"" Albertson said. ""It's almost always somebody who's a friend. That tends to be the worst. Your role is to follow the trust terms.""

A federal appeals court late Thursday blocked a lower court judge's order instructing President Donald Trump to return control of 4,000 California National Guard troops that he had federalized to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer had ruled that Trump's action was ""illegal,"" but stayed his order from taking effect until 3 p.m. ET on Friday to allow the Trump administration to appeal his decision.

The administration promptly did just that, asking the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to block Breyer's ruling from taking effect.

The 9th Circuit, in temporarily granting that request, scheduled a hearing for Tuesday. A three-judge panel of the appellate court will consider arguments then on whether to extend a stay of Breyer's order, or allow his ruling to take effect.

Trump, over the past week, federalized 4,000 members of the California Guard and mobilized another approximately 700 U.S. Marines to respond to protests in Los Angeles against federal immigration enforcement actions in that city.

Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's takeover of the Guard without the consent of the governor, the first time in U.S. history a president had taken such an action under the special provision that Trump invoked.

Breyer's order came hours after a hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where he sharply questioned lawyers for the federal government on Trump's rationale and authority for the move.

At one point, the judge said, ""We live in response to a monarchy,"" noting that there is a difference between the president and King George III, the British monarch on the throne at the time of the American Revolution.

""At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the President followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions. He did not,"" Breyer wrote in his order.

""His actions were illegal — both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,"" the judge wrote. ""He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.""

Breyer said that none of the three conditions required for Trump's federalization of the Guard under a certain federal statute existed, namely the U.S. having been invaded or in danger of being invaded; a ""rebellion"" against the federal government; or the president being unable to execute U.S. laws.

""The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of 'rebellion,' "" Breyer wrote.

And he said that ""regardless"" of the outcome of California's lawsuit against the administration, Trump's federalizing of the Guard without the consent of Newsom ""alone threatens serious injury to the constitutional balance of power between the federal and state governments.""

""And it sets a dangerous precedent for future domestic military activity,"" Breyer added.

Breyer scheduled a hearing for June 20, where lawyers for the federal government will be asked to argue why the judge should not issue a more lasting preliminary injunction against Trump's action. It is not clear if that hearing will proceed as planned now that the appeals court has intervened.

Trump on Friday morning reacted to the appeals court's stay.

""The Appeals Court ruled last night that I can use the National Guard to keep our cities, in this case Los Angeles, safe,"" Trump wrote in a social media post. ""If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now. We saved L.A. Thank you for the Decision!!!""

Newsom on Thursday night praised Breyer's ruling before it was paused.

And his office tweeted a video showing the ""Death Star,"" built by the evil Empire in the ""Star Wars"" movie series, exploding in space after it was attacked by forces of the Rebel Alliance.

""The court just confirmed what we all know — the military belongs on the battlefield, not on our city streets,"" Newsom said in a post on X.

""This win is not just for California, but the nation,"" Newsom wrote. ""It's a check on a man whose authoritarian tendencies are increasing by the day. End the illegal militarization of Los Angeles now, @realDonaldTrump.""

""History is watching.""

Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran early Friday morning local time, targeting locations it said were related to Iran's nuclear program, sparking market fears of a wider conflict.

Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces and the country's most senior military official, was killed during the strikes, alongside the commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, Iranian state media reported.

The Israeli airstrikes also targeted and killed two of Iran's leading nuclear scientists, Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, according to Iranian news outlets.

Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, pledged to avenge the attacks.

""With this crime, the Zionist regime has brought a bitter and painful fate upon itself, and it will certainly face it,"" he said in a statement.

Iranian media outlets reported multiple fatalities in the capital city, Tehran, along with airstrikes on the city of Natanz, which is home to a key nuclear facility. As of Friday morning, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted, and ""no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.""

Also hit were targets in the city of Khandab, where a heavy water nuclear reactor is located, and Khoramabad, the site of a ballistic missile base.

Iran has launched around 100 drones toward Israeli territory in retaliation, an Israeli military spokesperson said, which Israel is working to intercept.

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the nation: ""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.""

The country's Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency shortly after the strikes began and warned people that ""a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future.""

The United States did not participate in the military operation, but U.S. President Donald Trump was briefed beforehand, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement, noting that, ""Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense.""

Trump approved the withdrawal of some American personnel from the Middle East earlier this week, noting the region ""could be a dangerous place"" and stressing that the U.S. would prefer to negotiate a deal on nuclear enrichment than see a military strike.

Tehran has meanwhile accused Washington of not being serious in its engagement and not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium for what it insists are peaceful purposes.

On Friday morning, Trump said he previously warned Iran that the ""United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.""

Urging Tehran to cement a nuclear deal, he added, ""Certain Iranian hardliner's spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!"" 

It remains to be seen whether Iran and Israel will press ahead with further escalation. Historically at odds, the two sides have both ramped up war rhetoric and hostilities since the terror attack carried out by the Tehran-backed Palestinian group Hamas in Israel in October 2023. The Jewish state has repeatedly accused Iran of proxy interventions against it through Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi factions.

Tensions last boiled over late last year, when Iran and Israel briefly launched direct missile strikes on each other's territories, but ultimately backed down from full-our war.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged both sides to ""show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford.""

Oil prices soared amid fears of a broader regional war and concerns over the supply outlook in the crude-rich Middle East region.

Investors also turned to safe havens — which are thought to offer protection in times of heightened volatility — as the scale of the attack took markets by surprise. Gold hit an almost two-month high on the news, and U.S. Treasury prices also rose. U.S. stock futures fell, meanwhile, with Dow futures down 580 points.

Smaller, less liquid tokens such as Solana and Cardano led a decline in cryptocurrencies as financial markets shifted toward safety after Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear targets.

Bitcoin, which accounts for more than 60% of the digital asset world's market value, was little changed at around $105,600 after earlier dropping as much as 3%. Solana and Cardano were off by roughly 4%, after slumping as much as 8% and 6.7%, respectively. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

 A crypto executive says if Sharplink Gaming were to announce its planned mega-Ether buy tomorrow, it could “light the match to reignite the stock.” 

Shares in sports betting platform Sharplink Gaming tumbled 73% in after-hours trading on Thursday after filing to register a large volume of shares for potential resale as the firm is soon to bet big on Ether.

However, Sharplink Gaming chairman Joseph Lubin, who is also CEO of blockchain software firm Consensys, said that market watchers had misinterpreted the filing. 

Lubin said in a post on Wednesday that “some are misinterpreting” Sharplink's Form S-3 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registers the potential resale of nearly 58.7 million common shares.

Lubin reiterated that it is registering for the “potential resale” of shares, not an actual sale. “This is standard post-PIPE procedure in tradfi, not an indication of actual sales,” Lubin said.

The filing comes as the company prepares for a significant Ether (ETH) purchase as part of its newly announced Ethereum-based treasury strategy.

Shares in Sharplink Gaming (SBET) closed Thursday trading down 12.25% at $32.53 and plunged a further 73% after hours to under $8 on the filing, according to Google Finance.

It has since slightly recovered and is down 67.6%, trading at $10.55, at the time of publication.

Consenys' general counsel Matt Corva said that the filing “doesn't reflect anyone's sales, which may or may not ever happen, I have no idea. But it's a basic filing.” 

Corva said the news was already revealed two weeks ago, and “this is the official statement saying yes, SBET sold those shares to investors, and they count.” 

On May 30, Sharplink Gaming said that it plans to sell up to $1 billion in common shares, with most of the proceeds intended to acquire ETH, just days after it said it was taking on an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy.

Lubin clarified that neither he nor Consensys had sold any shares. Consenys recently led Sharplink Gaming's $425 million funding round for the Ethereum treasury strategy.

BTCS Inc. CEO Charles Allen commented that the filing understandably triggers panic among existing shareholders. “This creates a prisoner's dilemma: everyone rushes to sell before the others do — a classic race to the bottom,” he said.

Allen suggested the firm could reverse those losses by announcing their anticipated $1 billion Ether purchase tomorrow. “If they played cards right would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1b of ETH purchases — which could light the match to reignite the stock,” Allen said.

“They may have played it brilliantly,” he said.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices have dipped as escalating geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran has triggered a risk-off sentiment in the cryptocurrency markets. The top three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are extending their losses heading into the weekend, with the price action suggesting further correction in BTC, ETH, and XRP.

Bitcoin price failed to retest its all-time high of $111,980 following a sharp rally on Monday and declined slightly until Wednesday. It continued its correction on Thursday, closing below the daily support at $106,406. At the time of writing on Friday, it extended its losses and hovers around its 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $102,447.

If BTC closes below its 50-day EMA at $102,447, it could extend the decline to retest its psychological important level of $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) slips below its neutral level of 50, reading 45, indicating bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also displayed a bearish crossover on Thursday, issuing sell signals and indicating a downward trend.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC recovers, it could extend the recovery to retest its daily level of $106,406.

Ethereum price failed to find support around the upper consolidation level of $2,724 on Thursday and declined by 4.65%. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades down 6%, resting at its lower consolidation boundary of $2,461.

If ETH continues its correction and closes below its 50-day EMA at $2,410, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $2,000.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating bearish momentum. Additionally, the MACD indicator also displayed a bearish crossover on Thursday, issuing sell signals and indicating a downward trend.

ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH finds support around its lower consolidation boundary at $2,461, it could extend the recovery to retest its upper consolidation boundary at $2,724.

XRP price closed below its 50-day EMA level at $2.25 on Thursday and declined 3.55% that day. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to trade down by 3.5% at around $2.11.

If XRP continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $1.96.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 40, below its neutral level and points downward, indicating strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the two lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart coil around each other, indicating indecisiveness among traders. If the MACD flips a bearish crossover, it will give a sell signal and further support the bearish thesis.

XRP/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if XRP recovers, it could extend to retest its 50-day EMA at $2.25.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Ethereum faced intense selling pressure earlier today as geopolitical tensions flared following Israel's attack on Iran, shaking global markets and triggering risk-off behavior across crypto. The sudden spike in volatility pushed Ethereum away from its recent highs, as it retraced after failing to break above the critical $3,000 resistance level. This marks a pivotal moment for ETH, which had shown strong momentum in recent sessions before being hit by the broader market downturn.

Despite the sharp correction, top analyst Quinten Francois remains optimistic. He pointed to the ETH/BTC pair, which continues to look strong relative to other assets. According to Francois, this pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a pattern that often precedes a breakout to the upside if support holds. With Bitcoin holding near its range highs, Ethereum's performance against BTC could serve as a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market.

Now, Ethereum stands at a crossroads. A bounce from current levels could renew bullish momentum and re-establish the $2,800–$3,000 range as the launchpad for higher prices. But failure to hold support may trigger another wave of downside pressure. All eyes are on ETH/BTC as markets brace for what comes next.

Ethereum Holds Key Level Against BTC

Ethereum has been leading the crypto market with impressive strength since April, posting a remarkable surge of over 100% from its lows near $1,400. This steep recovery highlights Ethereum's growing momentum, positioning it as a potential frontrunner in triggering the next altseason. The asset's consistent performance above key support levels and its resilience during market dips have renewed bullish sentiment, with traders increasingly focusing on ETH as the key asset to watch.

Many analysts believe Ethereum could be the spark that reignites capital rotation into altcoins. Its breakout from a month-long range, combined with increasing DeFi activity and improving on-chain metrics, has added to the bullish case. However, caution remains. Ongoing geopolitical tensions—particularly the recent escalation between Israel and Iran—are injecting volatility into global markets, including crypto. These developments have disrupted otherwise promising technical setups across the board, leading to uncertainty and risk-off sentiment.

Quinten Francois commented on the current climate, noting that “some charts don't look good, others are holding on by a thread.” However, he singled out the ETH/BTC pair as a relative strength signal, stating that it “still looks good.” This pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a structure that, if defended, could pave the way for a continuation of ETH's dominance over Bitcoin.

In this environment, Ethereum's performance—especially relative to BTC—could determine the broader market's next phase. If ETH/BTC holds and breaks higher, the door opens for a full altseason run. But a failure to hold could reinforce caution and signal a pause across the crypto market. For now, Ethereum remains the most important chart to watch.

ETH Faces Sharp Rejection After Tagging Range Highs

Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test after a strong rejection near the $2,830 resistance level. The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the highlighted supply zone between $2,700 and $2,830, where sellers stepped in aggressively. This resulted in a sharp breakdown that sliced through the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) on the 4-hour timeframe, now positioning ETH around $2,512.

What's more concerning is the spike in volume during the breakdown. This confirms the strength behind the move, signaling panic among bulls and potential distribution by short-term holders. ETH is now holding just above a previous support zone from early June, but the current setup suggests uncertainty and risk of further downside.

Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,600–$2,620 area soon, the next likely target could be the $2,400 level, where the next strong demand cluster sits. However, if bulls defend current prices and manage a quick recovery back above the SMAs, this recent move could be interpreted as a liquidity sweep before continuation.

Crypto prices have plunged in the wake of Israel's airstrikes on Iran, with major altcoins taking significant hits and liquidations passing $1 billion, as markets braced themselves for Iran's response.

Ethereum has tanked 7.8% over the past 24 hours to $2,533, according to CoinGecko, while XRP dropped 3.9% to $2.13 and Solana 8.4% to $145. The best-performing assets in the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are both stablecoins holding their peg to the U.S. dollar—never a good sign.

As a result, according to CoinGlass, $1.16 billion worth of liquidations have swept the crypto market. Leading the way is Bitcoin with $449.95 million of liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $301.92 million, and Solana at $53.46 million. The vast majority of these liquidations were long positions.

Predictors on Myriad shifted their stance on more long Bitcoin positions being liquidated on Saturday, June 14 to over 55.8%—a notable move from the near 50% odds that predictors gave the market on Thursday afternoon.

(Disclosure: Myriad Markets was created by DASTAN, the parent company of Decrypt and Rug Radio.)

Israel launched a large-scale airstrike against Iran in the early hours of Friday, with government officials claiming the country was targeting nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iranian state media outlets have reported several casualties, including civilians and senior officials. 

“The Zionist regime will regret its action today,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian tweeted, announcing a “special meeting” set to take place on how to respond. Meanwhile, Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of possible missile and drone attacks in response from Iran.

The crisis could also impact on the chances of a nuclear deal being struck between Iran and the United States, with predictors on Myriad now giving odds of just 4.7% for a positive outcome in the talks.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio quickly confirmed after the Israeli strikes that the U.S. was “not involved,” urging Iran not to attack U.S. personnel.

The price of Bitcoin has also declined, though not as sharply as altcoins, falling 2.2% on the day to $104,976.

The broader cryptocurrency market risk-off sentiment, as Israel confirms attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, triggers a wave of profit booking among top coins, leading to Bitcoin (BTC) edging lower by nearly 2% at press time on Friday. With the market leader under pressure, the top altcoins Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have declined by nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, while XRP (XRP) has recorded a 6% drop during the same period. 

As the crypto market trades in the red, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Ethena (ENA), and Lido DAO (LDO) rank the chart with a pullback of nearly 20% in the last 24 hours. 

Bitcoin trades in the red on Friday at press time, briefly dropping under $103,000 to $102,664. With the third consecutive bearish candle, BTC erases the recovery earlier this week and is down nearly 2% so far this week.

Bitcoin marks a short-term recovery as it bounces off the high-demand zone, marked in a green band, above $102,000 and the rising 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,458. This creates a minor shadow in the intraday candle, projecting recovery chances later in the day. 

 The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicates a failed bullish reversal, as it reverses from its signal line without crossing above it. With the resurgence of bearish histograms, the indicator suggests a pullback phase is underway. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 steps under the halfway level indicates a loss in bullish momentum. As RSI edges lower towards the oversold zone, it warns of further downside. 

A daily close under the 50-day EMA at $104,458 could violate the support zone above $102,000. In such a case, sidelined investors could find an entry opportunity with $100,372, the 30-day lowest trading price, as the next immediate support. 

BTC/USDT daily price chart.

However, a recovery later in the day, as Bitcoin upholds the 50-day EMA, could result in a consolidation move before taking a recovery run towards the all-time high of $111,980. 

Fartcoin marks its third consecutive bearish day, reversing from Wednesday's high at $1.53. Crossing below its 50-day EMA at $1.13, the meme coin is down by over 10% to $1.09 at press time on Friday. 

The momentum indicator suggests a sharp surge in bearish momentum as the RSI at 45 drops below the halfway line and the MACD nears crossing below its signal line. 

The immediate support lies at $0.92, marked by the low on May 7, if it breaks below the $1 psychological support level.   

FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart.

A reversal above $1.36 will nullify the downfall and could result in a surge towards the Wednesday high at $1.53. 

Ethena prolongs the lower high trend with the recent reversal from $0.37 on Wednesday. With an over 20% drop in the last three days, ENA tests the support level at $0.28, marked by a low last Thursday. 

The momentum indicators on the daily chart show a similar bearish momentum surge to other coins. The MACD indicator drops below its signal line while the RSI at 41 nears the oversold zone. 

A closing below $0.28 could test the lowest 30-day trading price at $0.25. 

ENA/USDT daily price chart.

A reversal above $0.30 could pause the steep correction, potentially leading to a sideways trend. 

LDO fails to close above the $1 psychological resistance level despite the breakout of a long-awaited resistance trendline in the daily chart. Closing below the 50-day EMA, the altcoin retests the broken trendline. 

The MACD indicator drops towards its signal line for a bearish crossover as the bullish histograms decline. The RSI indicator drops under the halfway level at 44, projecting a sudden decline in bullish momentum. 

If the downtrend extends, it could test the $0.74 support level marked by a low on May 6.

However, a reversal above could trend towards the $1 psychological level.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Smaller, less liquid tokens such as Solana and Cardano led a decline in cryptocurrencies as financial markets shifted toward safety after Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear targets.

Bitcoin, which accounts for more than 60% of the digital asset world's market value, was little changed at around $105,600 after earlier dropping as much as 3%. Solana and Cardano were off by roughly 4%, after slumping as much as 8% and 6.7%, respectively.

Total liquidation of crypto bets over the last 12 hours was $106.5 million on Friday in New York, with $44 million and $63 million in long and short positions closed respectively, according to data compiled by Coinglass.

Israel launched strikes across Iran early Friday, targeting nuclear facilities and killing top military commanders, in a major escalation against its chief adversary that risks sparking a broad war in the Middle East.

“Crypto is reacting negatively to news of Israel strikes in Iran, in line with major risk assets,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect to see technical support around $101,000, but geopolitical news will drive price action from here in the short-term.”

Stocks fell while investors rushed to the safety of havens such as Treasuries in the immediate aftermath of the strikes. Crude oil jumped more than 9% while gold also rose. Bitcoin's initial drop raised more questions on the digital currency's claim as a safe haven against inflation and geopolitical turmoils.

Bitcoin's decline shows that while it has “occasionally traded as a macro hedge, in moments of acute risk like this one, particularly involving kinetic military conflict, liquidity is prioritized over narrative,” said Sean McNulty, derivatives trading lead of APAC at digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX Ltd. “Traders raise cash, rotate into dollars, and reduce leveraged or volatile exposure.”

Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, said in a note that “a further deterioration in risk sentiment” is likely ahead of the weekend.

 Blockchain can reshape sports analytics as a secure, open and verifiable source of truth for performance data. From elite leagues to fantasy sports, blockchain breaks down data silos, ensures real-time accuracy and embeds trust in the sports ecosystem. 

Opinion by: Tristan Thompson, chief content officer and lead advisor, TracyAI

In sports, data shapes nearly every decision, from trade deals and scouting reports to fantasy leagues and fan debates. In 2025, however, the systems that collect and distribute that data are broken. Stats are often inconsistent, delayed or siloed behind closed APIs. 

The result? Athletes don't own their performance data. Fans don't trust what they see. And billions of dollars ride on numbers that can't always be verified in real time.

Blockchain can fix that. Not by turning every athlete into a tech founder but by offering the one thing sports data desperately needs: a verifiable source of truth that's open, tamper-proof and accessible on equal terms.

Sports data largely relies on centralized, opaque systems that lack immediate transparency and verifiable authenticity. This fragmented approach creates significant vulnerabilities. 

Teams and fans are often forced to rely on delayed, unverifiable data, placing trust in systems vulnerable to manipulation and errors. Deloitte's recent 2025 Sports Industry Outlook emphasizes growing concerns around data integrity, revealing that nearly 40% of professional sports organizations reported challenges related to data accuracy, verification delays and manipulation risks. These shortcomings affect every layer of the game: fans, players, coaches and even team GMs — where accurate, real-time data can mean the difference between winning and losing.

The data integrity issues affect the front office and ripple across every layer of the game. From coaching adjustments and player prep to the real-time analysis fans rely on, competitive success increasingly depends on analytics that are accurate, current, and accessible. Yet many tools used across the ecosystem still depend on outdated, siloed systems, where even basic stats can be delayed or inconsistent across platforms.

Blockchain technology offers a robust solution to these challenges by providing real-time, immutable and independently verifiable data records. Blockchain ensures each piece of data, whether a player's performance metrics, biometric scans or real-time match statistics, is securely logged and permanently unalterable.

Formula One recently adopted blockchain-enhanced analytics systems to verify and distribute real-time telemetry data, significantly improving data reliability and fan engagement. This real-world use case illustrates blockchain's growing role in securing data streams across elite sports environments, making information more transparent and instantly accessible to performance analysts and fans.

To put it simply, it's all about access. Ironically, although players generate this data, they rarely control how it's used in other sports. 

Vendors strike exclusive data deals worth millions, while athletes see none of it. A UK-based legal initiative, Project Red Card, backed by over 400 footballers, is actively challenging this status quo under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In every sport, there's tension between the “data guys” and the purists who trust their eyes. Even those traditional voices — pundits, analysts, and fans — don't get to interact with the full data stack, which paints a very telling picture.

Nowhere is the inconsistency of sports data felt more directly than in fantasy sports. With over 62.5 million users in the United States alone, fantasy has gone from niche to mainstream. The rise of traditional platforms and a new generation of blockchain-native fantasy applications mirrors this growth. 

Most fantasy platforms still rely on closed, fragmented data sources, like league-restricted APIs, third-party aggregators or proprietary scoring engines. These systems are often delayed, paywalled or inconsistent across apps, creating frustration for users and a lack of trust in the numbers that shape their experience.

The rapid rise of blockchain-native sports fantasy games signals a shift, not just in gameplay mechanics or reward systems, but in how users expect data to be managed.

It begs the question: Is the uptick in user adoption driven solely by novel reward models like tokenized assets and digital collectibles, or are users increasingly valuing blockchain infrastructure's transparency and traceability? As that expectation grows, so does the pressure on platforms to deliver visibility and fairness that traditional systems can't match.

Blockchain solves a pain point that fantasy players, both casual and competitive, feel every day. Recording every stat immutably and making that data accessible in real time across all interfaces, blockchain removes the guesswork and gives users a level playing field. 

Blockchain's value gives athletes and fans a stake in the data itself, and yet, the ones who depend most on accurate data, players, coaches and GMs, are left guessing or confined to using third-party tools that minimize core data sets.

LaLiga's partnership with CoinW further illustrates this growing trend toward blockchain integration, focusing specifically on improving fan experiences and trust through blockchain technology.

Decentralizing access to sports data, LaLiga is helping to set a new precedent, one where blockchain-backed analytics are viewed as the foundation for how professional sports organizations engage with fans and manage information. We will likely see more leagues, federations and governing bodies exploring the same technology. 

As expectations around transparency and real-time access rise, blockchain is positioning itself as the infrastructure layer capable of meeting that demand; thus, it's unsurprising that Web3 infrastructure is already reshaping how sports data is analyzed and consumed.

Data is no longer just something we consume — it's something we compete with. Coaches, fantasy players, analysts and front offices seek an edge. That edge depends on consistency, accuracy and fairness. Currently, the system falls short in all three areas.

Blockchain won't change the game itself, but it can fix the broken system that delivers the data behind it, benefiting the sporting world for the better.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doubling down on its investment in blockchain intelligence technology, along with other investigative platforms. According to a notice of intent on a government procurement website, the Department of Homeland Security component aims to buy more technology from TRM Labs, which focuses on crypto risk management but also offers a bevy of forensics services for government clients. ICE this week also posted an intent to sole source similar technology from Chainalysis, which comes amid a series of planned purchases for other digital forensics tools. Both Chainalysis and TRM Labs have myriad contracts with federal agencies, including the FBI, the State Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. In posting its intent to single source both TRM and Chainalysis technology, ICE is indicating there is no other provider that could reasonably provide the same services.

Executives from high-tech firms Meta, OpenAI and Palantir are joining the Army Reserve at the rank of lieutenant colonel to serve in Detachment 201, a new “Executive Innovation Corps,” the service announced Friday. The move is the latest push by the department to tap into capabilities and know-how from Silicon Valley and the commercial sector. The new corps “brings top tech talent into the Army Reserve to bridge the commercial-military tech gap” and is “designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation,” the Army stated in a press release. On Friday, the service is set to swear-in Meta's chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI's chief product officer Kevin Weil, Palantir's CTO Shyam Sankar and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab who was previously OpenAI's chief research officer.

                    Multi-utility NFTs expand on the functionality of collectible NFTs serving as rewards, security access and UX interfaces. Learn more. 
                

We all watched: most of us with slight disbelief, some even jumped in, when the NFT market exploded with profile pictures (PFPs) of apes, punks and pixel art. For a brief moment, to a select group, they represented status, access and identity in the digital world. But the hype faded pretty fast, begging the question: What's next for NFTs?

A solid answer emerged, and I think we can all agree that NFT utility is a meaningful proposition.

Multi-utility NFTs expand on the function of early NFT releases. NFTs now have the capability to be community tools operating as a security token that offers future governance rights and early access to integrations, in addition to revenue sharing. NFTs are also being used as the user experience layer of Web3.    

Communities quickly tired of speculative assets that do little more than decorate a wallet or signal membership. The next generation of NFTs isn't about flexing — it's about function. People want tokens that do something. They should unlock real value for the holder.

NFTs are not dying — they're maturing. As the space evolves, tokens that do nothing are being replaced by those that unlock something.

 

The nascent NFTs generally offered three main features:

Because NFTs use blockchain technology, this creates a tamper-proof record of who owns the asset. This ensures the provenance and authenticity of items. Yes, someone could copy/paste your JPEG, but only one Web3 wallet can demonstrate ownership. From digital art to collectibles, or, if backed by a solid audit layer, even real-world goods, can be verified, helping to combat counterfeiting and fraud.

NFTs are often issued in limited quantities, introducing scarcity. By controlling supply, creators can make assets more desirable and potentially more valuable, similar to how limited-edition physical items are prized by collectors.

From the outset, it was clear that NFT projects were focused on fostering active communities by offering holders exclusive benefits, such as access to special events, private groups, or unique experiences. This sense of belonging and direct engagement with creators or brands is a major draw for many NFT-as-JPEG enthusiasts.

Over time, more and more utility has been added to these on-chain JPEGs to the point they bear little resemblance to their distant ancestors. 

Pudgy Penguins is a great example of a community-based project that went beyond the flex. Holders of the Pudgy NFT received significant airdrops, most notably the PENGU token. For example, in December 2024, each holder was given 1.7 million PENGU tokens, which at peak resale value could be worth over $100,000 per NFT. 

Pudgy Penguins embraced a multi-utility approach evolving beyond being a collectible-plus gang, blending financial rewards, community engagement, physical goods and gaming — all within a single NFT ecosystem.

And that's only the start. More NFTs have emerged offering meaningful utility. What's particularly interesting is that when revenue share becomes part of the utility set, then NFTs start to look a lot more like shares.

For example, NodeOps recently launched UNO, a utility NFT designed to unlock rewards, perks and access to decentralized compute infrastructure. UNO holders didn't just buy a JPEG, they invested in a security token. This means that, should the cloud compute business continue to be revenue-positive, they will extract a revenue share every quarter. Furthermore, given that this is a multi-utility NFT, the holders get boosted incentives, future governance rights, and early access to integrations across partner protocols — those perks common to the old guard NFTs.

This initiative is now closed, with the NFT no longer available to buy, but the community response was enthusiastic. It's clear that developers, compute providers, and compute consumers weren't in it for another collectible. They need credentials and benefits they can use in the real (and virtual) work they do every day.

Most importantly for NodeOps, fundraising by selling an NFT side-stepped having to publicly list a token in the troubled market conditions they faced (those being a 21 percent drop in the crypto market cap over the previous quarter. And by locking the NFT to the minting wallet for a year, the NFT's price was protected from the current economic headwinds to gamble on a brighter future.

Utility NFTs are more than just functional tokens. They blur the line between front-end UX and back-end logic, acting as both identity, access, and reward mechanisms in one portable object. Utility NFTs are evolving into smart, user-centric interfaces — they're becoming the user experience layer of Web3. 

More on BlockchainIs Crypto Finally Headed in the Right Direction?

 

Over the next year, I believe we'll see more and more projects releasing NFTs that offer real-world value, not just loyalty points and early access, but access to revenue. NFTs are starting to look a lot more like owning a share than a JPEG.

PFPs had their moment, and they will always have their fans, but the dominant narrative is shifting. Utility is no longer a “nice to have.” It's the default expectation. More than that, I think the era of defining what “type” of utility an NFT offers may already be over: here's to a new era of the multi-utility NFT.","{'href': 'https://builtin.com', 'title': 'Built In'}","cryptocurrency"

In essence, the project is tied to the TAC community and aims to strengthen the connection between Ethereum-based decentralised applications and Telegram's growing Web3 user base. 

The non-transferable tokens feature artwork of ‘TACMAN,' an icon frequently used by the TAC community. According to representatives from the project, the collection is intended for early contributors and developers working to expand Ethereum's open-source infrastructure into Telegram's platform environment. 

Each SBT is priced at 30 TON, or roughly USD 100. The tokens follow the soulbound token model, which has been promoted by Ethereum's co-founder as a method for building verifiable digital identity on-chain. Unlike typical NFTs, these tokens cannot be traded or resold, and they remain permanently tied to the original wallet.

 



 

Whitelist registration for the release opened on 10 June 2025. The first phase of the drop begins on 17 June, during which 2,000 minting slots will be allocated. The second phase will offer 8,000 tokens via a public allowlist in a first-come, first-served format. Distribution will take place through Getgems, a prominent NFT marketplace operating on TON. A limit of one token per wallet will be enforced across both phases. 

SBT holders will gain access to future activities and features determined by the community, although specific details of these initiatives have not been disclosed. 

The launch comes in the context of growing activity in Telegram-linked NFT ecosystems. Recent figures show Telegram Gifts reaching over USD 1.8 million in daily volume, with several collections recording notable increases in market value. Project officials suggest this backdrop is helping to drive engagement across both TON and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) applications integrated into Telegram's interface.

[Podcast Column] What is Central Bank Digital Currency?

The first 8-episode series of Waseda University's English podcast “Rigorous Research, Real Impact” is currently streaming for free on Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube.



In this column we will introduce an excerpt from episode 5 “Central Bank Digital Currencies from a Japanese Legal Perspective” which features Professor Takashi Kubota (Waseda Law School). Here he clarifies what central bank digital currency (CBDC) is and examines the reasons why it remains relatively unknown in Japan, with suggestions for what can be done to increase awareness.

You can read the full transcript by clicking the above episode banner.

Thank you very much for the question. And central bank digital currency (CBDC) is, as you said, the digital form of a fiat currency or legal tender such as US dollar or JPY, denominated banknotes and coins.

General currencies include three types. One is crypto assets such as Bitcoin, which is issued by the private sector and not linked to legal tender, generally. And the second one is stablecoin such as Tether, issued by the private sector also, and their prices stabilize by linking them to legal tender or crypto assets or algorithms.

And the third one is the CBDC, such as the Chinese digital renminbi, issued by the central bank, which is the digitalization of legal tenders.

So, there are four reasons for the low CBDC awareness.

First, the slow penetration of digital payments compared to other countries. Second, the limited public relations and consumer education. Third, a lack of media coverage, and fourth, [it's a] complex concept.

According to Article 26 of the Constitution, Japanese citizens have the right to education. Financial education has already been offered in junior high and high schools, but digital currencies are rarely taught, as the BOJ (Bank of Japan) has played a central role in financial education. The BOJ should properly educate the public about crypto assets and CBDC.

Japan can increase CBDC awareness by first, a public awareness campaign using media about what CBDC is with schools and communities; second, consumer pilots and simulations to give them first-hand experience with CBDC; third, financial literacy program about using CBDC; and fourth, public consultations to incorporate consumer opinions on CBDC.


Professor Takashi Kubota

Professor Kubota has been teaching at the Waseda Law School since 2004. Prior to that, he worked for eight years at the Bank of Japan and taught as an associate professor at Nagoya University. Professor Kubota has served as an advisor to the government of Japan through his positions on a number of committees, including the Strategic Committee on International Promotion of Japanese Law and the Japanese Law Translation Committee. 

Professor Kubota was educated at the University of Tokyo (LL.B. in 1990, LL.M. in 1993), Harvard Law School (LL.M. in 1996) and Osaka National University, where he received a Ph. D. in International Public Policy in 2003. His research interests include international finance, international business law, cyber law, and negotiation.

The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, known as the GENIUS Act, setting it up for a final floor vote in the coming days.

The legislation aims to regulate the roughly $238 billion stablecoin market, per CoinDesk data, creating a clearer framework for banks, companies and other entities to issue the digital currencies.

The bill has bipartisan support, as well as criticism from both parties, making its fate in the Senate uncertain. 

Here's what to know about what's included in the bill and how it could impact investors — even those who don't hold crypto.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar, which makes it less volatile than other cryptocurrencies tend to be. 

The currency is used in a number of ways, including for payments and futures trading. Since they're also more predictable than regular crypto tokens, traders also use stablecoins ""to sit out times of volatility or market downturns,"" says Nic Puckrin, a crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau.

""Stablecoins are also being used increasingly in emerging markets, like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, to hedge against monetary instability, as well as for cheap cross-border payments,"" he adds. 

""The use cases are very broad, and new ones are emerging all the time.""

Ultimately, the GENIUS Act could make stablecoins more mainstream by bolstering trust in the currency and encouraging more competition in the market, Puckrin says.

""Right now, [the stablecoin market] is, for all intents and purposes, a duopoly. The market is nearly entirely dominated by Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT,"" Puckrin says.

Since the bill will create a clear pathway for banks and other entities to begin issuing stablecoins, ""we'll likely see a flood of them rush into the market at the start,"" he says.

Big banks are gearing up to create their own coins. And while they may not all be successful, Puckrin says they will give consumers more options to find a stablecoin and issuer that works best for their needs.

Proponents say it will help safeguard investors and regulate the stablecoin market by ensuring issuers have the reserves needed to give stablecoins their value. 

""If we fail to act now, not only will these benefits slip away — we will also fall behind in global competitiveness,"" Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), who introduced the bill, said in the Senate on Wednesday. ""Without a regulatory framework, stablecoin innovation will proliferate overseas — not in America!"" 

Puckrin agrees stablecoin regulation could be a boon for the U.S. and its position in the global economy.

""Congress has also realized that instead of threatening the U.S. dollar, stablecoins can help cement its global dominance, because 99% of stablecoins are pegged to USD,"" he says. ""With the dollar struggling to maintain its role in the global economy, the GENIUS Act could just be the thing that saves it.""

Some supporters acknowledge the bill isn't perfect, but think it's better than not having regulation on stablecoins at all.

""The general outlook is that [the bill] will do better than anything that is currently happening,"" says Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of blockchain security firm Lionsgate. 

""It's a step in the right direction for everyone. There are ways to make it better. There are ways to make everything better. But this is the first one. Let's give it a try, and it will ripple in many ways.""

Critics of the GENIUS Act argue it compromises crypto's decentralization and could enable corruption, such as officials favoring specific stablecoins under new regulations.

""We need guardrails that ensure that government officials aren't openly asking people to buy their coins in order to increase their personal profit or their family's profit,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore), who opposed the current version of the bill, said during Wednesday's session. 

""Where are those guardrails in this bill? They're completely, totally absent.""

Some critics also say the bill gives too many entities the ability to create new stablecoins which could make enforcement of the regulation standards more difficult.

""As long as issuers are clearly following the rules and regulations, more competition in the stablecoin landscape is both welcome and necessary,"" Puckrin says.

During the GENIUS Act's passage through the House, some members sought to attach amendments, including proposals from the Credit Card Competition Act. The latter, introduced in 2023 but previously stalled, aimed to boost credit card payment competition by requiring issuers to allow more than two networks (beyond mainly Visa and Mastercard) to process transactions.

Some legislators saw enough similarities between the credit card and stablecoin marketplaces to justify adding the CCCA to the GENIUS Act, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) nixed that plan, fearing the CCCA's inclusion could cost votes in favor of the larger bill. 

Still, the GENIUS act could impact retailers outside of crypto, Puckrin says.

""We'll likely see stablecoins increasingly adopted as a digital alternative to the U.S. dollar, so banks, fintechs and merchants will be forced to offer stablecoin payment options,"" he says. ""Eventually, payment networks like Visa and Mastercard will have to do so as well, which will lead to lower fees. The CCCA proposals are an inevitable evolution of the GENIUS Act. It will just take a little longer if it isn't written into law.""

Walmart and Amazon are actively exploring the issuance of their own stablecoins, a move that could upend the traditional payments ecosystem and potentially save these retail giants billions in transaction fees, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that other large multinationals, including Expedia Group and major airlines, are also considering similar initiatives, signaling a potential shift in how high-volume merchants handle payments in the U.S.

Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged one-to-one to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar — have gained traction as a means of storing value and facilitating crypto transactions. For merchants, the appeal is clear: bypassing legacy card networks could reduce interchange fees and accelerate settlement times, especially for cross-border transactions.

The timing of these deliberations is closely tied to the legislative progress of the GENIUS Act, which is poised to become the nation's first comprehensive stablecoin law. The bill, which recently cleared a key Senate procedural vote by a 68-30 margin, aims to establish clear rules for dollar-backed stablecoins, requiring them to be fully reserved and subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. Proponents, including bill sponsor Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN), argue that the GENIUS Act will protect consumers, spur innovation, and strengthen the U.S. dollar's global standing.

However, the bill has become a flashpoint for broader debates over financial regulation. More than 120 amendments have been proposed, including provisions unrelated to stablecoins, such as credit card fee caps and presidential trade powers. Those additions could turn the legislation into a battleground for the future of payments. Notably, Walmart has lobbied for an amendment to introduce more competition in the credit card sector, reflecting merchants' longstanding frustration with card network fees.

PYMNTS coverage highlights that the GENIUS Act would require stablecoin issuers to maintain robust capital and liquidity buffers, comply with anti-money laundering standards, and submit regular reserve attestations. The GENIUS Act's fate remains uncertain, with a final Senate vote expected soon and House consideration to follow. Meanwhile, the digital asset sector is closely watching whether regulatory clarity will unleash a new wave of merchant-led innovation — or introduce fresh systemic risks.

As the regulatory landscape evolves, the prospect of Walmart, Amazon, and other major retailers launching stablecoins underscores the urgency for banks, FinTechs and payment providers to adapt to a rapidly changing digital economy.

Blockchain is reshaping education, with universities offering specialised programmes to meet growing demand for skills in decentralised finance, tokenomics and crypto innovation

Bybit Fintech

Cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche interest to a mainstream feature of the global economy. As blockchain enters finance, logistics, healthcare and governance, companies in the fintech, consulting and cybersecurity sectors – along with traditional banks – will need experts in the technology.

Education institutions worldwide are now offering dedicated programmes on blockchain technology, meaning students no longer have to study computer science to find courses in blockchain fundamentals, tokenomics, smart contract development or decentralised finance. The skills that learners gain from these courses extend beyond simply knowing about digital assets and decentralised structures.

More people want blockchain education

Tokenomics now appears in business school curricula, economics programmes and law courses. It points out how closely digital assets are connected to innovation and the future global market. With these programmes growing in popularity, educators are starting to track market indicators and trends, such as the BTC price, as a helpful exercise for their students.

Specialised degrees, certificates and research centres for blockchain are increasingly common, demonstrating a firm focus on academic research. They offer training in programming smart contracts and using crypto wallets, as well as in the economics, rules and moral questions of decentralised systems.

Students are also learning about governance decentralisation, what makes different consensus protocols unique, and what happens to economies when centralised currency authorisation is no longer required. These aren't just theories – they are important parts of the fast-evolving industry that future professionals will influence.

Organisations take the lead

Several universities have started leading in blockchain education. Undergraduate students can find electives and those interested in master's programmes can learn about cryptocurrencies. Some institutions also allow students to gain knowledge through online courses and earn certificates remotely. Universities are also partnering with blockchain businesses, arranging crypto hackathons and establishing start-up incubators for beginner blockchain companies.

The relationship between blockchain and financial innovation is especially important to business schools. MBA students are being introduced to decentralised finance in their studies. In many universities, discussing Web 3.0 startups and their innovation potential is a norm in labs and accelerator programmes. In addition to learning about blockchain, students can use it to start the next group of technology-driven companies.

Blockchain literacy as a new essential skill

As blockchain is adopted in more mainstream fields, knowing how to use decentralised systems will be essential. Educational bodies know that blockchain's effects will extend beyond tech and finance. It is expected to play a role in every sphere, supporting agriculture in managing supply chains and securing healthcare data. Because of this, new programmes have appeared that bring together students in law, engineering, economics and policy to explore blockchain from their own fields.

Students are graduating ready to incorporate blockchain and decentralised approaches into their fields of interest. Smart contracts, decentralised applications and updated regulations are now all possible because training is available to support these areas.

Applications and real-world use

In addition to educating the next generation of blockchain experts, academic institutions are developing research and ideas for the blockchain industry. More universities are conducting and publishing research on blockchain capacity, cryptocurrency trading and how decentralisation benefits society.

More frequent partnerships with private organisations are also happening. Firms working with blockchain are investing in research centres, sponsoring student efforts and employing graduates from such programmes. The involvement of industry means teaching is timely and aligned with what employers seek.

Institutions are introducing their own tokens for campus use, testing blockchain ID systems for students and trying DAO systems to govern student councils. This technology makes educational spaces a place to experiment with blockchain.

A modern and creative revolution in education

Introducing cryptocurrency and blockchain education in colleges and universities is an essential change to our future education system. It means that people see blockchain as more than a fad; it is transforming the methods we use for establishing value and trust in the new digital space.

As programmes in this field expand, they will produce trained professionals and influence the systems, rules and inventions that advance the field of decentralisation. Those learning about blockchain today might design the future of money systems, government methods and standard technology rules.

Special purpose education reflects a shift in how academia prepares to lead change in the crypto field.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doubling down on its investment in blockchain intelligence technology, along with other investigative platforms. According to a notice of intent on a government procurement website, the Department of Homeland Security component aims to buy more technology from TRM Labs, which focuses on crypto risk management but also offers a bevy of forensics services for government clients. ICE this week also posted an intent to sole source similar technology from Chainalysis, which comes amid a series of planned purchases for other digital forensics tools. Both Chainalysis and TRM Labs have myriad contracts with federal agencies, including the FBI, the State Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. In posting its intent to single source both TRM and Chainalysis technology, ICE is indicating there is no other provider that could reasonably provide the same services.

Executives from high-tech firms Meta, OpenAI and Palantir are joining the Army Reserve at the rank of lieutenant colonel to serve in Detachment 201, a new “Executive Innovation Corps,” the service announced Friday. The move is the latest push by the department to tap into capabilities and know-how from Silicon Valley and the commercial sector. The new corps “brings top tech talent into the Army Reserve to bridge the commercial-military tech gap” and is “designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation,” the Army stated in a press release. On Friday, the service is set to swear-in Meta's chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI's chief product officer Kevin Weil, Palantir's CTO Shyam Sankar and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab who was previously OpenAI's chief research officer.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made a significant and surprising decision to publicly drop some crypto-related rule recommendations that were made when Gary Gensler was Chair. The news has sparked a range of heated reactions in the cryptocurrency world. Many people see it as a step towards a regulatory climate that is more open to new ideas and creativity.

The SEC's withdrawal includes several well-known measures that have raised concerns in the digital asset market. One of the rules that was thrown out was Exchange Act Rule 3b-16, which tried to modify the meaning of the word “exchange” to encompass a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as front-end interfaces, automated market makers, and even certain blockchain-based chat groups.

Another proposal that was pulled back focused on crypto custody. It originally said that investment advisers had to employ “qualified custodians,” who are regular banks or other financial organizations. Critics stated that this restriction would have kept many crypto-native companies from offering custody services, which could have limited investor choice and innovation.

Also taken out were ideas like cybersecurity disclosures and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk management. These would have made it harder for investment firms and tech-driven platforms in the crypto area to follow the rules.

These changes to the rules show that more people realize that the current regulatory framework, when applied to decentralized technology without discrimination, might hinder innovation and push crypto development to other countries.

The withdrawal aligns with the SEC's changing position under its new leadership. The Commission seems to be taking a more balanced approach since Gary Gensler left. This approach takes into account the distinctive structure and function of crypto technology. 

This includes a fresh focus on working together with people in the sector and the need to encourage growth within a framework that is both controlled and flexible. Instead of making broad guidelines that some said were not consistent with DeFi or blockchain innovation, the SEC is now showing that it is open to changing how it regulates.

Many people are happy that these measures are being rolled back, but this doesn't mean that regulatory scrutiny is over. The SEC is still taking action against people who break the law, and people who work in the market are still expected to follow the rules.

However, some are seeing this step as a promise to make more rules in the future that include input from the public, clearer rules, and techniques that are better suited to the nature of digital assets and decentralized networks.

Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) are considering issuing their own stablecoins in the United States, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. 

These corporate digital tokens, pegged to the U.S. dollar or other government-backed currencies, could dramatically reduce merchant fees and speed up payment settlements, disrupting the dominance of traditional financial institutions.

The move is contingent on the passage of the Genius Act, a proposed regulatory framework for stablecoins that recently passed a key procedural step in Congress. If passed, it could pave the way for large companies to adopt or issue stablecoins as an alternative to existing payment rails.

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,540.95 tumbled more than 7% over the past 24 hours, falling from a session high of $2,770.56 to as low as $2,477.71 before recovering slightly to $2,536 at press time. 

The sharp decline came amid a broad risk-off move across global markets following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military infrastructure — a major escalation in Middle East tensions that caught investors off guard.

According to a report by CNBC, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes were part of a “targeted military operation” against Iran's nuclear and missile programs. Iran responded by launching around 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation. While the United States denied direct involvement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that America's priority was protecting its regional forces.

In response to the rising geopolitical risk, investors fled into traditional safe-haven assets. The U.S. dollar rallied 0.6% on Friday morning, reversing a three-year low from the previous day. Gold also surged to near a two-month high, while oil futures spiked as much as 13% before paring gains. The dollar's strength was particularly notable as it outperformed other safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc and Japanese yen.

Market strategists noted that the conflict's depth and duration—especially its impact on oil — would shape investor behavior going forward. ING analysts said the dollar's rebound was significant, even if more muted than expected. Meanwhile, Bank of America's survey showed that traders remained heavily short the dollar, though conviction in that trade had not yet collapsed.

ETH's sharp move lower aligned with similar risk-asset weakness seen across equities, bonds, and commodities. While prices have steadied above the $2,530 level for now, volatility is likely to remain elevated as traders digest the unfolding geopolitical situation.

Volatility in crypto markets is rising, but smart money is clustering around some major tokens with booming onchain ecosystems.

Crypto markets wobbled on Thursday as traders reacted to renewed military action in the Middle East, with Israel's reported airstrikes on Iran prompting a broader risk-off move.

But while bitcoin BTC$105,231.46 and major assets dipped in early Asian hours, majors such as XRP XRP$2.14 and Solana's SOL SOL$146.30 are still seeing tailwinds from institutional narratives, analysts say.

XRP, currently trading around $2.10, is drawing attention for its growing footprint in corporate treasuries.

More than $470 million worth of XRP buying pressure is being earmarked by firms such as Webus International (at $300 million), VivoPower (at $121 million), and Wellgistics ($50 million), opined Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research.

“The surge in corporate XRP treasuries signals a growing institutional embrace of XRP for its low-cost, high-speed payment capabilities,” Lee said in a note to CoinDesk.He added that pending legal clarity and ETF speculation could push XRP as high as $5 by mid-2025, though risks remain.

Solana, meanwhile, is benefiting from solid network fundamentals and ETF demand. The token has climbed to around $165, buoyed by over $1.2 billion in Q1 application revenue and rising open interest in futures markets, suggesting renewed confidence among both retail and institutional players.

If current momentum holds, SOL could rally to $200–$250, with upside to more than $300, Lee shared.

Late Thursday, DeFi Development Corporation revealed plans to raise up to $5 billion through an equity line to boost its Solana treasury. The company had earlier withdrawn a Form S-3 filed with the SEC, which contained its plan to raise $1 billion to acquire SOL.

Bitcoin BTC$105,231.46 substantially added to earlier losses, slumping to as low as to $103,162 as Israeli forces bombed nuclear and military targets in Iran, including in the capital Tehran, before recovering somewhat to trade 2% lower than 24 hours ago. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country attacked Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile sites to ""roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,"" and that the strikes will continue until the threat is removed. 

The attack followed hours after the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was not complying with restrictions on enriched uranium for the first time in two decades. NBC reported that Israel was considering a strike following the IAEA's statement. U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that the he would prefer a deal with Iran and an attack could lead to a ""massive conflict.""



On Polymarket, bettors were unsure about the chance of a strike taking place with the likelihood of Israeli action against Iran by July being priced in at under 30 cents.

The attacks were first reported by Axios with Al-Jazeera later confirming that explosions were heard in Tehran.

European stocks fell, with the Euro Stoxx 50 Index losing 1.4% and the FTSE 100 dropping 0.7%. U.S. stock index futures are lower by about 1.4% across the board on the news. 

Moving higher are bond prices, gold and oil. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped 2 basis points to 4.32% while gold futures added 1% to $3,436 per ounce. Crude oil futures soared as much as 9% and were recently trading about 5.6% higher.

The U.S. dollar is gaining against the euro and British pound, but losing ground versus the yen and Swiss franc.

 Under Pompliano's leadership, ProCapBTC would reportedly seek to raise $750 million in equity and convertible debt as part of a merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1. 

Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is reportedly in talks to launch a new Bitcoin-buying vehicle that will seek to raise $750 million.

Pompliano is expected to become CEO of ProCapBTC, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that is set to merge with the publicly traded blank cheque vehicle Columbus Circle Capital 1, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

Under Pompliano's leadership, which is still under discussion, ProCapBTC would seek to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt as part of a merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, backed by the Cohen & Company investment bank.

According to the FT's sources, the ProCapBTC deal could be announced next week, but its terms have not yet been finalized.

Columbus Circle Capital 1 is a blank check company formed with the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange and purchase, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar combination with one or more businesses.

In May 2025, Columbus Circle raised $250 million in an initial public offering sponsored by Cohen & Company Capital Markets (CCM), a division of Cohen & Company's broker-dealer subsidiary, JVB Financial Group.

Cohen & Company is a publicly traded investment bank listed on the New York Stock Exchange, focused on expanding the range of capital markets and asset management services. 

The bank has been active in the crypto and digital asset industry over the past few years, providing audits, tax and advisory services related to crypto assets, initial coin offerings, decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens and digital asset exchanges.

The news follows Pompliano's leadership of ProCap Acquisition, a fintech-focused SPAC that debuted on the Nasdaq in April.

ProCap's shares (PCAPU) started trading soon after its upsized IPO closed on May 21, raising $250 million in gross proceeds through the sale of 25 million units at $10 per unit.

PCAPU shares have seen a notable spike in June, surging from $10.60 on June 1 to $11.40 on Tuesday. The stock closed at $11.30 on Thursday, according to data from TradingView.



Pompliano had not confirmed the reported SPAC merger on social media by publishing time. Cointelegraph approached Pompliano for comment regarding the merger but had not received a response by the time of publication.

 Oil price talk leads macro analysis amid Middle East tensions, but whether Bitcoin will suffer as a result is up for debate as traders see a BTC price comeback. 

Key points:

Bitcoin recovers from a trip below $103,000 with markets on edge over the Israel-Iran conflict.

Oil steals the show on the day, but analysis is far from unanimous on the outlook.

BTC price predictions see the rebound persisting, shaking off the likelihood of further losses.

Bitcoin (BTC) bounced past $105,000 around the June 13 Wall Street open as markets awaited cues from the Israel-Iran conflict.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD staging a modest rebound after dipping to $102,816 on Bitstamp.

Geopolitical tensions had sparked snap losses across crypto and stocks overnight, while oil soared and gold hit two-month highs.

Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index were down around 1% on the day at the time of writing.

Reacting, crypto commentators had mixed opinions over how a resurgent oil price might impact Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

“Oil up. Gold up. Bitcoin down,” crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano wrote in part of an initial response on X.

Pompliano recalled earlier episodes in the Middle East tensions while predicting that BTC would eventually benefit.

“Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours in that situation. Will be interesting to see what happens here,” he concluded.

Popular analytics resource Bitcoin Macro saw oil's gains as potentially being short-lived.

“Oil might have significant move down after this. So far it looks clear that they aren't and won't be targeting Iran's oil facilities,” part of its own X material stated. 

In October last year, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, argued that a sea change in the Middle East would fuel both oil and BTC price action.

“Bitcoin is stored energy in digital form. Therefore, if energy prices rise, Bitcoin will be worth more in terms of fiat currency,” he said at the time.

Among traders, short-term perspectives on BTC/USD remained optimistic.

Popular trader CrypNuevo noted that the price had returned to the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), a trend line functioning as support since late April.

“I think we're good for more upside as long as we manage to hold the $100k psychological support level,” he told X followers.

Fellow trader Crypto Caesar predicted that Bitcoin would “recover soon,” calling the overnight lows a “double bottom level.”

“Nice bounce thus far & lack of follow through lower,” trader Skew continued on the topic.

 Retail giants Walmart and Amazon are reportedly evaluating digital currencies to streamline e‑commerce and boost cross‑border transactions. 

Update June 13, 10:30 am UTC: This article has been updated to include a section on the GENIUS Act.

Walmart and Amazon are reportedly mulling plans to issue their own US dollar-backed stablecoins for customers, signaling wider institutional stablecoin adoption amid improving regulatory clarity in the United States.

The two retail giants are mulling the development of brand-specific stablecoins, according to people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

While neither of the companies confirmed the stablecoin plans, a stablecoin payment system for either could divert billions in cash flow from their banking partners.

Amazon reported $638 billion worth of annual revenue in 2024, with global e-commerce sales reaching about $447 billion for the platform, Statista data shows.

Walmart's global e-commerce sales surpassed $100 billion in 2023, accounting for 17.8% of the company's yearly total sales, it reported in August 2024.

A stablecoin-based payment rail would offer faster and cheaper transactions, helping such large companies save billions in banking fees. 

Global e-commerce giant Shopify has already confirmed plans to integrate USDC (USDC) payments for its users before the end of 2025, Cointelegraph reported on Friday.

Cointelegraph has approached Amazon and Walmart for confirmation on their stablecoin launch plans.

The stablecoin issuance plans of the shopping giants will likely hinge on the outcome of a key piece of legislation, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.

The bill aims to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws, which may bolster institutional stablecoin adoption in the world's largest economy.

The US Senate advanced the GENIUS Act in a 68–30 vote on Thursday, with Majority Leader John Thune urging members of Congress to support the bill.

Most senators, including several Democrats, voted to invoke cloture for the bill, setting it up for debate and a full floor vote before potentially sending it to the House of Representatives for further consideration.

Firms linked to financial giants like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have also reportedly discussed a potential joint stablecoin launch.

DTCC Digital Assets also sees stablecoins as the “perfect” financial instrument for real-time collateral management, which could modernize and simplify the financial system, according to a pilot study reported by Cointelegraph on May 15.

This New Map of Nearby Stars May Solve a Cosmic Mystery

A near-complete census of our interstellar neighborhood hopes to answer how stars, brown dwarfs and rogue planets form throughout the universe

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

Newborn stars set gas clouds aglow in this mosaic of images from the James Webb Space Telescope. This is the star-forming region NGC 1333, located some 960 light-years from Earth; a census of stars much closer to our solar system is revealing new details about how this and other stellar nurseries across the universe manufacture stars.

I don't think it's overly poetic to say that stars are how we know the universe.

When we look out at the night sky, stars are overwhelmingly what we see—thousands of them, ranging from Sirius, the brightest in the night sky, to ones so dim they are known by mere catalog designations instead of names.

And for every star we can see by eye in our sky, telescopes can see millions more. Astronomers study them to understand the shape, size, structure, history, and fate of our galaxy and use them to gauge the distances and behavior of other galaxies. Even when studying exoplanets, we need to understand their host stars to make sense of these alien worlds. The heavier elements making up our planet and even our body were forged in stars long ago, and our own sun is a star, of course—so in a very real sense, to study stars is to study ourselves.

Yet for all that, some basic questions about stars remain unanswered. While we have a pretty decent grasp of how individual stars are born, there are still gaps in our knowledge of their statistics en masse.

One of my favorite unanswered questions concerns the most fundamental properties of stars as a group, which is how different kinds are born out of a gas cloud. Say you have a giant gas cloud that is busily manufacturing stars. As a percentage, how many of them will be like the sun? How many will be feeble red dwarfs, how many will be massive blue beasts, and how many will be so low in mass that they will straddle the line between a true star and a planet? The mass of a star—how much matter is in it—determines most of its properties, including its temperature, color, brightness, evolution and even its destiny, so this is something astronomers are very keen to understand. Understanding stars' distribution in our galaxy tells us about the galaxy itself, much like poring over the contents of a construction kit offers insights about the finished product and the way it's assembled.

The “initial mass function” is the technical term for this unresolved question of stellar demographics. And in theory, it's not too hard to answer: just observe a bunch of stars, determine their masses and then figuratively put them into the proper box.

In practice, though, it's very difficult indeed. Massive stars are bright and easy to spot. We can't, however, see small, dim ones if they are very far away—which means our cosmic census of low-mass stars is largely limited to whatever happens to be relatively near our solar system. Still, given time, these stars mix pretty well throughout the galaxy, so we can assume such fainter stellar next-door neighbors are representative of the galaxy at large.

Still, to give you an idea of just how hard this undertaking is, after millennia of astronomical observations, the first nearly complete tally of all stars out to a distance of about 65 light-years only appeared—in 2024! Published by a huge team of astronomers, the paper, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal, is a sprawling description of the Herculean effort involved.

Performing the survey in the first place required using several space- and ground-based astronomical observatories. The European Space Agency's Milky Way–mapping Gaia mission was chief among them, and it pinned down key data for most of the bright stars within the requisite 65 light-years. For lower-mass stars, which shine brightest in infrared, Gaia's observations were augmented by data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Such stellar dim bulbs are critical for determining the lowest-mass end of the initial mass function. Brown dwarfs, which are objects of intermediate mass between planets and stars, give off essentially no visible light and can only be detected in the infrared. The first brown dwarfs were only found in the 1990s. And in general, these objects are so dim that even nearby ones can elude detection. Luhman 16 is a binary brown dwarf system just 6.5 light-years from the sun—the third closest system to us—yet was only discovered in 2013.

After carefully teasing out the details of objects confirmed to be within the 65 light-year region, the study team found a total of approximately 3,000 stars and 600 brown dwarfs. Right away this is a remarkable finding. I'm used to thinking on much larger spatial scales, so finding 3,600 objects within a mere 65 light-years of the sun is more than I'd have guessed. Mind you, our Milky Way galaxy is a flat disk 120,000 light-across, which is roomy enough for hundreds of billions of stars and other celestial citizenry.

The astronomers were careful to note that their survey wasn't complete at the low-mass end, either. Brown dwarfs cooler than about 325 degrees Celsius are so faint that our current technology can't directly see them beyond about 50 light-years. Also, some brighter brown dwarfs may still be hiding in crowded parts of the sky, such as the star-rich disk of the galaxy. There could also be smaller binary companions to some stars that have gone undiscovered.

What that means is that some brown dwarfs have likely been undercounted, which is actually pretty problematic for trying to determine the full range of object masses spawned in galactic gas clouds. Think of it this way: if you smash a rock with a hammer, you're likely to get one or two big pieces, a dozen or two midsize ones, hundreds of small chunks and thousands or tens of thousands of tiny grains. If you don't count all the grains, you can't really know how the size of the debris is distributed.

Still, this new, best-yet census of our interstellar neighborhood does extend our understanding of the initial mass function. Before, it wasn't clear if objects had a mass cutoff at the lower end. We know that gas clouds in stellar nurseries have to form clumps that collapse under their own gravity and that these clumps become stars. Is there a limit to how small a clump can be to collapse? Possibly, but until brown dwarfs were discovered and counted, we weren't sure they could even form like stars do. What the census finds is that the number of objects formed generally increases as mass decreases, as expected, much like the debris distribution from a hammer-struck rock. But the census does reveal some quirks: the tally of objects flattens out a bit as mass descends from the stellar regime to brown dwarfs but then starts rising again at lower, more planetary-scale masses. Does it flatten out again at some lower mass, such as around a few times that of Jupiter? That's for future telescopes to determine.

Still, this survey is a big step forward. Extrapolating it to the Milky Way and other galaxies will help us understand how galaxies behave—and how they change their behavior over time, churning out different mixes of stars as they age. The confidence we have in our scientific knowledge depends on each link in the chain, so the better we determine the initial mass function, the better we will comprehend the universe.

Quantum Computers Simulate Particle 'String Breaking' in a Physics Breakthrough

Physicists are a step closer to using quantum computers for simulations that are beyond the ability of any ordinary computers

By Davide Castelvecchi & Nature magazine 

The Aquila magneto-optical trap in QuEra's facilities.

Subatomic particles such as quarks can pair up when linked by ‘strings' of force fields — and release energy when the strings are pulled to the point of breaking. Two teams of physicists have now used quantum computers to mimic this phenomenon and watch it unfold in real time.

The results, described in two Nature papers on June 4, are the latest in a series of breakthroughs towards using quantum computers for simulations that are beyond the ability of any ordinary computers.

“String breaking is a very important process that is not yet fully understood from first principles,” says Christian Bauer, a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California. Physicists can calculate the final results of particle collisions that form or break strings using classical computers, but cannot fully simulate what happens in between. The success of the quantum simulations is “incredibly encouraging,” Bauer says.

Each experiment was conducted by an international collaboration involving academic and industry researchers — one team at QuEra Computing, a start-up company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and another at the Google Quantum AI Lab in Santa Barbara, California.

The researchers using QuEra's Aquila machine encoded information in atoms that were arranged in a 2D honeycomb pattern, each suspended in place by an optical ‘tweezer'. The quantum state of each atom — a qubit that could be excited or relaxed — represented the electric field at a point in space, explains co-author Daniel González-Cuadra, a theoretical physicist now at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid. In the other experiment, researchers encoded the 2D quantum field in the states of superconducting loops on Google's Sycamore chip.

The teams used diametrically opposite quantum-simulation philosophies. The atoms in Aquila were arranged so that the electrostatic forces between them mimicked the behaviour of the electric field, and continuously evolved towards their own states of lower energy — an approach called analogue quantum simulation. The Google machine was instead used as a ‘digital' quantum simulator: the superconducting loops were made to follow the evolution of the quantum field ‘by hand', through a discrete sequence of manipulations.

In both cases, the teams set up strings in the field that effectively acted like rubber bands connecting two particles. Depending on how the researchers tuned the parameters, the strings could be stiff or wobbly, or could break up. “In some cases, the whole string just dissolves: the particles become deconfined,” says Frank Pollmann, a physicist at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Garching, Germany, who helped to lead the Google experiment.

Although simulating strings in a 2D electric field could have applications for studying the physics of materials, it is still a long way from fully simulating high-energy interactions, such as those that occur in particle colliders, which are in 3D and involve the much more complex strong nuclear force. “We do not have a clear path at this point how to get there,” says Monika Aidelsburger, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Munich, Germany.

Still, the latest results are exciting, and progress in quantum simulation in general has been “really amazing and very fast,” Aidelsburger says.

Last year, Bauer and his LBNL colleague Anthony Ciavarella were among the first teams to simulate the strong nuclear force on a quantum computer. Approaches that replace qubits with qudits — which can have more than two quantum states and can be more realistic representations of a quantum field — could also make simulations more powerful, researchers say.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Empty spaces in the dark only appear to be complete voids. Even intergalactic space (in the absence of dust particles) has a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. Now, simulations that sound like they belong in a sci-fi movie have shown that light can—at least, in the quantum realm—be created out of nothing. Welcome to the quantum vacuum.

How can a beam of light materialize out of thin air without even the tiniest motes of dust swirling around? Well, quantum field theory answers this by suggesting that even in regions of space where there is absolutely nothing physical, there are fleeting electromagnetic particles and waves that come and go. Through a series of 3D digital simulations (using software known as OSIRIS), a team of physicists at the University of Oxford—led by Zixin Zhang—found that extreme laser beams can disturb other particles introduced into that field and rearrange them into something else.

Zhang and her team were able to virtually create a phenomenon predicted by quantum physics known as vacuum four-wave mixing. It is thought that when this occurs, two or three interacting wavelengths can create one or two more wavelengths without anything extra being added. Previous studies hypothesized that processes which were intense enough could polarize or possibly even break down the vacuum itself. When three powerful laser pulses joined forces in the simulations, they polarized pairs of electrons and positrons in the vacuum, which act both like particles and waves (in quantum terms). Polarization causes a wave to vibrate in a particular direction relative to where it is coming from.

“The quantum vacuum is filled with energy fluctuations from which virtual electron-positron pairs arise,” Zhang said in a study recently published in Physics Communications. “The presence of these virtual particles creates non-linearities in vacuum that interact with high power laser pulses propagating through, altering their properties.”

Birefringence was another exotic phenomenon produced by the experiment. When light passes through electromagnetic fields with considerable strength, it can experience a shift in polarization because the light bent in two different ways. In the physical world, birefringent materials are often used to make polarizing prisms, which have applications ranging from microscopy to photography. In the recent simulation, vacuum birefringence occurred because the polarization of electrons and positrons changed when they passed through through the laser beams. 

These weren't just any lasers, either—they were petawatt lasers. Multi-petawatt lasers such as Romania's Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) can blast double laser beams at 10 petawatts each. A petawatt is 1015 watts, or about 10,000,000,000,000 standard lightbulbs of power). 

While the electrons and positrons in the simulations would normally be impossible to observe, this recent simulation has shown that zapping them with lasers could change that fact. This opens a portal into testing out some extremely weird physics beyond a computer screen, and it might someday be possible to explore exotic shapes and pulses in laser beams.  

Especially once we bring the next wave of petawatt lasers online. The upcoming Central Laser Facility in the UK will have a main beam that can operate on the order of 20 petawatts and get an assist from eight additional, less energetic beams. And the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, plans to take it even further—its EP-OPAL project will generate two 25-petawatt beams, and one of its first experiments will deal with four-wave mixing that scatters photons.

“Looking ahead, the solver could be applied to studying interactions of novel pulse shapes […] and tightly focused beams,” the Oxford team said. “The simulation results can complement existing theoretical work and provide benchmarks for future high-power laser experiments.”

The forerunners of dinosaurs and crocodiles in the Triassic period were able to migrate across areas of the ancient world deemed completely inhospitable to life, new research suggests.

In a paper published in Nature Ecology and Evolution on June 11, researchers from the University of Birmingham and University of Bristol have used a new method of geographical analysis to infer how these ancestral reptiles, known as archosauromorphs, dispersed following one of the most impactful climate events the Earth has ever seen, the end-Permian mass extinction.

The first archosauromorphs, some resembling modern reptiles and many times smaller than familiar dinosaurs, were previously believed to only survive in certain parts of the globe due to extreme heat across the tropics, viewed by many paleontologists as a dead zone, in the earliest Triassic.

By developing a new modelling technique based on landscape reconstructions and evolutionary trees, the team of researchers have been able to discover clues about how these reptiles moved around the world during the Triassic period, following the mass extinction where more than half of land-based animals and 81% of marine life died.

The archosauromorphs that survived the extinction event rose to prominence in Earth's ecosystems in the Triassic, leading to the evolution of dinosaurs. The team now suggest that their later success was in part due to their ability to migrate up to 10,000 miles across the tropical dead zone to access new ecosystems.

Dr Joseph Flannery-Sutherland from the University of Birmingham and corresponding author of the study said:

""Amid the worst climatic event in Earth's history, where more species died than at any period since, life still survived. We know that archosauromorphs as a group managed to come out of this event and over the Triassic period became one of the main players in shaping life thereafter.

""Gaps in their fossil record have increasingly begun to tell us something about what we weren't seeing when it comes to these reptiles. Using our modelling system, we have been able to build a picture of what was happening to the archosauromorphs in these gaps and how they dispersed across the ancient world. This is what led us to call our method TARDIS, as we were looking at terrains and routes directed in space-time.

""Our results suggest that these reptiles were much hardier to the extreme climate of the Pangaean tropical dead zone, able to endure these hellish conditions to reach the other side of the world. It's likely that this ability to survive the inhospitable tropics may have conferred an advantage that saw them thrive in the Triassic world.""

""The evolution of life has been controlled at times by the environment,"" says Professor Michael Benton from the University of Bristol, senior author of the study, ""but it is difficult to integrate our limited and uncertain knowledge about the ancient landscape with our limited and uncertain knowledge about the ecology of extinct organisms. But by combining the fossils with reconstructed maps of the ancient world, in the context of evolutionary trees, we provide a way of overcoming these challenges.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Brain-computer interface restores real-time speech in als patient","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250612081317.htm","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 04:27:41 GMT","

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed an investigational brain-computer interface that holds promise for restoring the voices of people who have lost the ability to speak due to neurological conditions.

In a new study published in the scientific journal Nature, the researchers demonstrate how this new technology can instantaneously translate brain activity into voice as a person tries to speak -- effectively creating a digital vocal tract.

The system allowed the study participant, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to ""speak"" through a computer with his family in real time, change his intonation and ""sing"" simple melodies.

""Translating neural activity into text, which is how our previous speech brain-computer interface works, is akin to text messaging. It's a big improvement compared to standard assistive technologies, but it still leads to delayed conversation. By comparison, this new real-time voice synthesis is more like a voice call,"" said Sergey Stavisky, senior author of the paper and an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Neurological Surgery. Stavisky co-directs the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab.

""With instantaneous voice synthesis, neuroprosthesis users will be able to be more included in a conversation. For example, they can interrupt, and people are less likely to interrupt them accidentally,"" Stavisky said.

Decoding brain signals at heart of new technology

The man is enrolled in the BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health. His ability to communicate through a computer has been made possible with an investigational brain-computer interface (BCI). It consists of four microelectrode arrays surgically implanted into the region of the brain responsible for producing speech.

These devices record the activity of neurons in the brain and send it to computers that interpret the signals to reconstruct voice.

""The main barrier to synthesizing voice in real-time was not knowing exactly when and how the person with speech loss is trying to speak,"" said Maitreyee Wairagkar, first author of the study and project scientist in the Neuroprosthetics Lab at UC Davis. ""Our algorithms map neural activity to intended sounds at each moment of time. This makes it possible to synthesize nuances in speech and give the participant control over the cadence of his BCI-voice.""

Instantaneous, expressive speech with BCI shows promise

The brain-computer interface was able to translate the study participant's neural signals into audible speech played through a speaker very quickly -- one-fortieth of a second. This short delay is similar to the delay a person experiences when they speak and hear the sound of their own voice.

The technology also allowed the participant to say new words (words not already known to the system) and to make interjections. He was able to modulate the intonation of his generated computer voice to ask a question or emphasize specific words in a sentence.

The participant also took steps toward varying pitch by singing simple, short melodies.

His BCI-synthesized voice was often intelligible: Listeners could understand almost 60% of the synthesized words correctly (as opposed to 4% when he was not using the BCI).

Real-time speech helped by algorithms

The process of instantaneously translating brain activity into synthesized speech is helped by advanced artificial intelligence algorithms.

The algorithms for the new system were trained with data collected while the participant was asked to try to speak sentences shown to him on a computer screen. This gave the researchers information about what he was trying to say.

The neural activity showed the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The researchers aligned those patterns with the speech sounds the participant was trying to produce at that moment in time. This helped the algorithm learn to accurately reconstruct the participant's voice from just his neural signals.

Clinical trial offers hope

""Our voice is part of what makes us who we are. Losing the ability to speak is devastating for people living with neurological conditions,"" said David Brandman, co-director of the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab and the neurosurgeon who performed the participant's implant.

""The results of this research provide hope for people who want to talk but can't. We showed how a paralyzed man was empowered to speak with a synthesized version of his voice. This kind of technology could be transformative for people living with paralysis.""

Brandman is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery and is the site-responsible principal investigator of the BrainGate2 clinical trial.

Limitations

The researchers note that although the findings are promising, brain-to-voice neuroprostheses remain in an early phase. A key limitation is that the research was performed with a single participant with ALS. It will be crucial to replicate these results with more participants, including those who have speech loss from other causes, such as stroke.

The BrainGate2 trial is enrolling participants. To learn more about the study, visit braingate.org or contact [email protected].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists warn of bat virus just one mutation from infecting humans","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250612081312.htm","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 05:06:00 GMT","

A group of bat viruses closely related to the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be one small mutation away from being capable of spilling over into human populations and potentially causing the next pandemic.

A recent study published in the journal Nature Communicationsexamined an understudied group of coronaviruses known as merbecoviruses -- the same viral subgenus that includes MERS-CoV -- to better understand how they infect host cells. The research team, which included scientists at Washington State University, the California Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina, found that while most merbecoviruses appear unlikely to pose a direct threat to people, one subgroup known as HKU5 possesses concerning traits.

""Merbecoviruses - and HKU5 viruses in particular - really hadn't been looked at much, but our study shows how these viruses infect cells,"" said Michael Letko, a virologist at WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine who helped to spearhead the study. ""What we also found is HKU5 viruses may be only a small step away from being able to spill over into humans.""

During the past two decades, scientists have cataloged the genetic sequences of thousands of viruses in wild animals, but, in most cases, little is known about whether these viruses pose a threat to humans. Letko's lab in WSU's Paul G. Allen School for Global Health focuses on closing that gap and identifying potentially dangerous viruses.

For their most recent study, Letko's team targeted merbecoviruses, which have received limited attention apart from MERS-CoV, a zoonotic coronavirus first noted in 2012 that is transmitted from dromedary camels to humans. It causes severe respiratory disease and has a mortality rate of approximately 34%.

Like other coronaviruses, merbecovirusesrely on a spike protein to bind to receptors and invade host cells. Letko's team used virus-like particles containing only the portion of the spike responsible for binding to receptors and tested their ability to infect cells in the lab. While most merbecoviruses appear unlikely to be able to infect humans, HKU5 viruses - which have been found across Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East - were shown to use a host receptor known as ACE2, the same used by the more well-known SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. One small difference: HKU5 viruses, for now, can only use the ACE2 gene in bats, but do not use the human version nearly as well.

Examining HKU5 viruses found in Asia where their natural host is the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus), the researchers demonstrated some mutations in the spike protein that may allow the viruses to bind to ACE2 receptors in other species, including humans. Researchers on another study that came out earlier this year analyzed one HKU5 virus in China that has already been documented to have jumped into minks, showing there is potential for these viruses to cross species-barriers.

""These viruses are so closely related to MERS, so we have to be concerned if they ever infect humans,"" Letko said. ""While there's no evidence they've crossed into people yet, the potential is there -- and that makes them worth watching.""

The team also used artificial intelligence to explore the viruses. WSU postdoctoral researcher Victoria Jefferson used a program called AlphaFold 3 to model how the HKU5 spike protein binds to ACE2 at the molecular level, which could help provide a better understanding of how antibodies might block the infection or how the virus could mutate.

Up until this point, such structural analysis required months of lab work and specialized equipment. With AlphaFold, Jefferson generated accurate predictions in minutes. The results matched those recently documented by a research team that used traditional approaches.

Letko noted the study and its methods could be used for future research projects and aid in the development of new vaccines and treatments.

The research was funded through a research project grant from the National Institutes of Health. Jefferson's work was supported by an NIH T32 training grant.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New MIT study reveals how biofilms help stop microplastic build-up","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250613013823.htm","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 09:54:31 GMT","

The accumulation of microplastics in the environment, and within our bodies, is an increasingly worrisome issue. But predicting where these ubiquitous particles will accumulate, and therefore where remediation efforts should be focused, has been difficult because of the many factors that contribute to their dispersal and deposition.

New research from MIT shows that one key factor in determining where microparticles are likely to build up has to do with the presence of biofilms. These thin, sticky biopolymer layers are shed by microorganisms and can accumulate on surfaces, including along sandy riverbeds or seashores. The study found that, all other conditions being equal, microparticles are less likely to accumulate in sediment infused with biofilms, because if they land there, they are more likely to be resuspended by flowing water and carried away.

The open-access findings appear in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, in a paper by MIT postdoc Hyoungchul Park and professor of civil and environmental engineering Heidi Nepf. ""Microplastics are definitely in the news a lot,"" Nepf says, ""and we don't fully understand where the hotspots of accumulation are likely to be. This work gives a little bit of guidance"" on some of the factors that can cause these particles, and small particles in general, to accumulate in certain locations.

Most experiments looking at the ways microparticles are transported and deposited have been conducted over bare sand, Park says. ""But in nature, there are a lot of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, and when they adhere to the stream bed they generate some sticky things."" These substances are known as extracellular polymeric substances, or EPS, and they ""can significantly affect the channel bed characteristics,"" he says. The new research focused on determining exactly how these substances affected the transport of microparticles, including microplastics.

The research involved a flow tank with a bottom lined with fine sand, and sometimes with vertical plastic tubes simulating the presence of mangrove roots. In some experiments the bed consisted of pure sand, and in others the sand was mixed with a biological material to simulate the natural biofilms found in many riverbed and seashore environments.

Water mixed with tiny plastic particles was pumped through the tank for three hours, and then the bed surface was photographed under ultraviolet light that caused the plastic particles to fluoresce, allowing a quantitative measurement of their concentration.

The results revealed two different phenomena that affected how much of the plastic accumulated on the different surfaces. Immediately around the rods that stood in for above-ground roots, turbulence prevented particle deposition. In addition, as the amount of simulated biofilms in the sediment bed increased, the accumulation of particles also decreased.

Nepf and Park concluded that the biofilms filled up the spaces between the sand grains, leaving less room for the microparticles to fit in. The particles were more exposed because they penetrated less deeply in between the sand grains, and as a result they were much more easily resuspended and carried away by the flowing water.

""These biological films fill the pore spaces between the sediment grains,"" Park explains, ""and that makes the deposited particles -- the particles that land on the bed -- more exposed to the forces generated by the flow, which makes it easier for them to be resuspended. What we found was that in a channel with the same flow conditions and the same vegetation and the same sand bed, if one is without EPS and one is with EPS, then the one without EPS has a much higher deposition rate than the one with EPS.""

Nepf adds: ""The biofilm is blocking the plastics from accumulating in the bed because they can't go deep into the bed. They just stay right on the surface, and then they get picked up and moved elsewhere. So, if I spilled a large amount of microplastic in two rivers, and one had a sandy or gravel bottom, and one was muddier with more biofilm, I would expect more of the microplastics to be retained in the sandy or gravelly river.""

All of this is complicated by other factors, such as the turbulence of the water or the roughness of the bottom surface, she says. But it provides a ""nice lens"" to provide some suggestions for people who are trying to study the impacts of microplastics in the field. ""They're trying to determine what kinds of habitats these plastics are in, and this gives a framework for how you might categorize those habitats,"" she says. ""It gives guidance to where you should go to find more plastics versus less.""

As an example, Park suggests, in mangrove ecosystems, microplastics may preferentially accumulate in the outer edges, which tend to be sandy, while the interior zones have sediment with more biofilm. Thus, this work suggests ""the sandy outer regions may be potential hotspots for microplastic accumulation,"" he says, and can make this a priority zone for monitoring and protection.

The work was supported by Shell International Exploration and Production through the MIT Energy Initiative.

Using advanced single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and a widely used preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease, researchers from Mass General Brigham and collaborators at SUNY Upstate Medical University have identified specific brain cell types that responded most to exercise. These findings, which were validated in samples from people, shed light on the connection between exercise and brain health and point to future drug targets. Results are published in Nature Neuroscience.

""While we've long known that exercise helps protect the brain, we didn't fully understand which cells were responsible or how it worked at a molecular level,"" said senior author Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD, a neuroscientist and leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute and the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Now, we have a detailed map of how exercise impacts each major cell type in the memory center of the brain in Alzheimer's disease.""

The study focused on a part of the hippocampus -- a critical region for memory and learning that is damaged early in Alzheimer's disease. The research team leveraged single-nuclei RNA sequencing, a relatively new technologies that allow researchers to look at activity at the molecular level in single cells for an in-depth understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's.

The researchers exercised a common mouse model for Alzheimer's disease using running wheels, which improved their memory compared to the sedentary counterparts. They then analyzed gene activity across thousands of individual brain cells, finding that exercise changed activity both in microglia, a disease-associated population of brain cells, and in a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA), newly discovered by the team, which are cells associated with blood vessels in the brain. Furthermore, the scientist identified the metabolic gene Atpif1 as an important regulator to create new neurons in the brain. ""That we were able to modulate newborn neurons using our new target genes set underscores the promise our study,"" said lead author Joana Da Rocha, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow working in Dr. Wrann's lab.

To ensure the findings were relevant to humans, the team validated their discoveries in a large dataset of human Alzheimer's brain tissue, finding striking similarities.

""This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies,"" said Nathan Tucker, a biostatistician at SUNY Upstate Medical University and co-senior of the study. ""Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment.""

Researchers at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research and the University of Texas at Austin have identified a form of molecular motion that has not previously been observed. When what are known as 'guest molecules' - molecules that are accommodated within a host molecule - penetrate droplets of DNA polymers, they do not simply diffuse in them in a haphazard fashion, but propagate through them in the form of a clearly-defined frontal wave. ""This is an effect we did not expect at all,"" points out Weixiang Chen of the Department of Chemistry at JGU, who played a major role in the discovery. The findings of the research team have today been published in an article in the prestigious journal Nature Nanotechnology. The new insights are not only fundamental to our understanding of how cells regulate signals, but they could also contribute to the development of intelligent biomaterials, innovative types of membranes, programmable carriers of active ingredients and synthetic cell systems able to imitate the organizational complexity of the processes in living beings. Molecular wave patterns instead of conventional diffusion

It is usually the case that molecules are distributed throughout liquids by means of simple diffusion. For instance, if you add a blue dye to a glass of water, the dye gradually disperses in the liquid, forming soft, blurry color gradients. However, the observed behavior of guest molecules in DNA droplets is quite different. ""The molecules move in a structured and controlled manner that is contrary to the traditional models, and this takes the form of what appears to be a wave of molecules or a mobile boundary,"" explains Professor Andreas Walther from JGU's Department of Chemistry, who led the research project.

The research team used droplets made up of thousands of individual strands of DNA, structures that are also known as biomolecular condensates. What is of particular interest in this connection is the fact that the properties of the droplets can be precisely determined with the help of the DNA structures and other parameters, such as the concentration of salts. Moreover, these droplets have their counterparts in biological cells, which are able to employ similar condensates to arrange complex biochemical processes without the need for membranes. ""Our synthetic droplets thus represent an excellent model system with which we can simulate natural processes and come to better understand them,"" emphasizes Chen. Into their droplets, the researchers introduced specially designed 'guest' DNA strands that are able to specifically recognize the inner structure of the droplets and bind to them. According to the team, the intriguing motion of the guest molecules, that they have now detected for the first time, is in part attributable to the way that the added DNA and the DNA present in the droplets combine on the basis of the key-and-lock principle. This means that the surrounding material becomes less dense and no longer fixed in place, so that swollen, dynamic states develop locally. Chen adds: ""The well-defined, highly concentrated front continues to move forward in a linear fashion over time, driven by chemical binding, material conversion and programmable DNA interactions. Something that is completely new when it comes to soft matter.""

 New basis for understanding cellular processes 

The findings are not only relevant to providing us with a better understanding of the physics of soft matter, but also to improving our knowledge of the chemical processes that occur in cells. ""This might be one of the missing pieces of the puzzle that, once assembled, will reveal to us how cells regulate signals and organize processes on the molecular level,"" states Walther. This would also be of interest when it comes to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which proteins migrate from cell nuclei into the cytoplasm, forming condensates there. As these age, they transform from a dynamic to a more stable state and build the problematic fibrils. ""It is quite conceivable that we may be able to find a way of influencing these aging processes with the aid of our new insights, so that, over the long term, an entirely new approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases could emerge,"" concludes Walther.

Pig embryo at 33 days. Pig embryos with human heart cells have survived for 21 days.Credit: Daniel Sambraus/Science Photo Library

Researchers have reported growing hearts containing human cells in pig embryos for the first time. The embryos survived for 21 days, and in that time their tiny hearts started beating. The findings were presented this week at the annual meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Hong Kong.

Scientists developing human–animal chimaeras grow human cells in animal embryos, with the aim of one day generating animals with human organs that can be transplanted into people. This could provide a way to address the global shortage of organs for transplantation.

One approach to developing chimaeras involves creating animal embryos that lack some of the genes needed to produce a specific organ, such as the heart. Human stem cells are then injected into the embryos, with the hope that the human cells — rather than those of the animal – will form that organ. Several groups have used this method to grow human muscle and blood-vessel cells in pig embryos.

Pigs are a suitable donor species because the size and anatomy of their organs are comparable with those of humans, says Lai Liangxue, a developmental biologist at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led the latest work. Lai's team has previously grown early-stage human kidneys in pig embryos that survived for up to a month in pregnant sows. He wanted to see whether similar results were possible for the heart.

In their study, which has not been peer-reviewed, Lai and his team reprogrammed human stem cells to bolster their ability to survive in a pig, by introducing genes that prevent cell death and enhance cell growth. They then generated pig embryos in which two specific genes that have key roles in heart development were knocked out. A handful of human stem cells were introduced into the pig embryos at the morula stage, soon after fertilization — a point at which the embryo consists of a ball of about a dozen cells that are rapidly dividing. The embryos were then transferred to surrogate pigs.

The team found that the embryos grew for up to 21 days, after which they did not survive. Lai says it's possible the human cells disrupted the function of the pig hearts.

When the researchers took a closer look at the embryonic hearts, they found that they had grown to the equivalent size of a human heart at that stage of development — the size of a fingertip — and were beating, says Lai. The human cells could be identified because they had been tagged with a luminescent biomarker and were glowing, he adds.

Metrics details

A recent article makes a claim with far-reaching implications for neuroscience, technology, and society: that the human brain is subject to an information processing ‘speed limit' of 10 bits per second. Although this speed limit appears to hold for high-level cognitive functions, we argue that unconscious processing for real-time control of movement, which occupies a majority of neurons in the central nervous system and accounts for most of the information throughput of humans, substantially exceeds this limit.

Metrics details

Carbynes, characterized by their radical and carbene attributes, possess three non-bonding electrons and have garnered substantial scientific interest. The high reactivity and complex hybridization of valence orbitals in carbynes have impeded the isolation of free carbon(I) species. Carbodicarbenes are divalent carbon(0) species with two electron lone pairs, which are in principle capable of losing an electron to generate a radical cation carbon(I) species containing three non-bonded electrons, similar to the frontier orbital of a carbyne without a vacant orbital. Here we describe the isolation of a crystalline cation radical carbon(I), [1-CDC]•+, prepared by a single-electron transfer between a carbodicarbene and a nitroaromatic compound to generate a stable radical ionic pair. Electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography with quantum chemical analysis show that the unpaired electron of [1-CDC]•+ resides in the p(π) atomic orbital of the secondary carbon with some delocalization to the N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Exploring the reactivity of this carbon(I) radical cation revealed its capacity to mediate a variety of C–O and C–C cross-coupling reactions with electron-deficient aryl halides. These findings not only expand the understanding of carbon(I) radical chemistry but also potentially open new avenues for radical methodologies in organic synthesis and catalysis.

Metrics details

Most megaherbivores in the Americas went extinct around 10,000 years ago, presumably disrupting the long-distance seed dispersal of large, fleshy-fruited plant species. The neotropical anachronism hypothesis, proposed by Janzen and Martin, suggests that large fruits evolved in response to past selective pressures from now-extinct megafauna. While this explains many key adaptations of ‘megafaunal fruit' plants, it lacks robust palaeoecological evidence. Here we use a multiproxy approach that provides evidence of frugivory by the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis. Using a machine learning model that reveals the extinction effects of these megafaunal dispersers in modern ecosystems, we show how losing seed dispersal interactions increased the extinction risk of megafaunal fruit plants in regions across South America lacking smaller surrogate dispersers. Our results imply that current ecosystems may undergo further functional changes under continuing anthropogenic pressures.

Cincha

It seems like totes don't want to work these days. They're floppy, allergic to moisture, and too cool to carry actual stuff. They went vegan, then minimalist, then micro. Finding the best totes for travel shouldn't be harder than finding your gate. You want something spacious, wipeable, and tough enough to survive TSA.

These are the best totes for travel. They don't collapse under pressure, don't mind getting dirty, and, most importantly, carry your baggage (emotional or otherwise). We've schlepped them through airports, overstuffed them with travel essentials, and wedged them under seats.

For more travel bags, check out our guides to the Best Metro Totes, Best Laptop Backpacks, and Best Toiletry Bags.

Next Up

I'll be testing the Metro Tote from Monos, the Travel Tote from Béis, and the Suncatcher Daytripper Carryall Tote from Sidney Baron.

Away

Away

For business travelers and solo flyers who pack light, the Away Everywhere Tote is the one-bag solution for back-to-back meetings, red-eye flights, and weekend getaways. Made from water-resistant nylon and accented with leather trim, it was clearly designed by someone who knows the realities of travel: fumbling through security lines, sprinting to trains, dodging coffee spills. It's fashionable enough for client dinners and durable enough to store in the overhead bin or under your seat.

The dimensions are dialed in to meet most airlines' personal item requirements, and it comes in a variety of low-key tones, from coastal blue to clay pink. A full top zipper keeps your essentials secure. There's a trolley sleeve that slides over a rolling luggage handle (though be warned: it looks like the exterior zip pocket, which has caused me more than one accidental drop). Inside, a padded sleeve cradles up to a 16-inch laptop and multiple interior pockets—plus a handy key clip.

Just know this: There's no dedicated water bottle pocket, which feels like a strange omission in 2025.

L.L. Bean

L.L. Bean

L.L. Bean's Field Tote is all grit and no gimmicks: a thick, double-layered polyester shell, burly double-stitched seams, and handles that feel industrial. Inside, a thermoplastic lining shrugs off moisture, mud, and mystery goo with wipe-clean ease. It's not fully leakproof, but it's close, and that makes it perfect for hauling damp beach towels, snow-crusted boots, or a post-workout fit.

It's a single, cavernous compartment, with no fussy pockets. There's an open-top version, but we love the zip-top model for travel. WIRED director Michael Calore tested the extra-large, 53-liter version, and it's massive enough for a week's worth of produce, a couple half-gallon cartons of oat milk, and a 12-pack of hard kombucha if you're also planning on going grocery shopping during your vacation.

Longchamp

Nordstrom

Longchamp

If you're shopping for a travel tote that's as stylish as it is packable, the Longchamp Le Pliage Xtra M is a jet-setter's dream. This updated model of the best-selling Le Pliage is ideal for slipping under the seat in front of you or sightseeing through a new city. The rich leather trim and nylon body complement most outfits, and it comes in eight sophisticated shades (though the cognac brown is a standout). Spacious enough to hold your in-flight must-haves—laptop, snacks, passport, and an extra layer—and it stays pretty compact and lightweight. Best of all, it folds flat, so it's easy to tuck in your luggage.

Cincha

Cincha

This vegan leather bag is deceptively huge. The base is 7.5 inches deep, so while it doesn't look that big in pictures, it holds an astonishing amount of stuff—I've packed enough clothes in it for a full weekend trip. I usually have concerns about vegan leather cracking and breaking with use, but Cincha's soft pebbled fabric does not look or feel obviously plastic. It has stood up to several months of use being tossed in and around car trunks without getting scuffed or cracking.

It has two (two!) mesh water bottle holders in the interior, a laptop sleeve that holds a 13-inch laptop, and three interior pockets (one that zips shut). There is one exterior zip pocket that fits my iPhone for easy access. As far as carrying options go, it has two grab handles, two hidden fabric shoulder straps that tuck away into zip pockets, and my favorite accessory—two loops for the separate travel belt so you can strap it to the rest of your luggage. However, it is more than 2 pounds heavier than a Longchamp Le Pliage, so this is strictly for when you can sling it around on top of your carry-on. —Adrienne So



Cuyana (16-inch)

Cuyana (Laptop Sleeve)

The Cuyana System Tote is a modular gear-hauler that shape-shifts with your itinerary. Designed to outlast the churn of fast fashion, this travel tote starts minimal, but the genius lies in its add-ons. A laptop sleeve or insert organizer creates a structure on the go, with dedicated slots for your computer, water bottle, and other work essentials.

Instead of stitched-on straps prone to failure, the System Tote's handles are cut directly from its leather body, minimizing points of wear. The main compartment snaps shut rather than zips, something to know if you're the spill-averse type. The Classic Easy Tote ($298) offers a zippered alternative.

Modularity extends to accessories: A System Flap Bag insert doubles as a clutch or in-bag organizer, and a detachable, adjustable strap (also available in a wide model) converts the tote into a crossbody, perfect for hands-free airport sprints if you're unintentionally trying out airport theory.

BaubleBar

Baublebar (Medium)

Baublebar (Large)

What sets BaubleBar apart is its playful personalization. Your chosen icons (up to six depending on the size) are embroidered directly onto the canvas tote. The process is super user-friendly, with predesignated spots to help you visualize your picks. Choose from zodiac signs, cutesy foods, initials, and more. Just note that it's a final sale, so be sure of your design before ordering.

Inside, you'll find a roomy main compartment with a small interior pocket and key loop. The large size fits everything you need for a beach day trip, and the medium and small options are better for light shopping or city exploring. It closes with just a snap button, which isn't the most secure for crowded areas. The quality of the playful embroidery makes it a fun choice for travel.

I recently took this versatile and large tote from Topo Designs to Colorado for a long weekend as a stand-in for my ski boot bag (yes, Arapahoe Basin is still open!) after using it all winter to haul my curling gear to the club. The main compartment, which zips closed, is big enough for ski boots, gloves, and the like, and there's plenty of room to stash socks or other gear in the side pockets. Come July, this tote will make the perfect bag for my cook kit on a summer camping road trip. When you have a tote this stylish and durable the question is not whether it's coming on the trip but what you're going to use it for. —Martin Cizmar

“No, this is not an elaborate April fool”. This is how WIRED first reported on the Dyson Zone at the end of March 2022. The Zone was a wild reimagining of an established product type—a big, bulky pair of headphones with an integrated air-purification mechanism that presented rather unfortunately like a high-tech gimp mask. A solution to a problem no consumer seemed willing to acknowledge existed in the first place.

Worse was to follow. December 2022: “Dyson's hellish-looking air-purifying headset will cost $950.” And in May 2023, our review made liberal use of words like “embarrassing”, “troubling” and “derision,” and suggested the reviewer felt like “a Fisher Price Batman villain” while wearing them. “You can finally buy this bizarre, head-mounted contraption—but for pity's sake, don't”.

Zone marked the first time Dyson's chief engineer (and son of James) Jake Dyson had been project lead for a product since he folded Jake Dyson Products into the Dyson portfolio. At the time, he was bullish about the Zone's chances: “After six years in development, we're excited to deliver pure air and pure audio, anywhere.” Since then, Dyson has gone eerily quiet on promoting the Zone, and now your chances of acquiring a pair are close to nil.

In the United States, everyone from SportPursuit to Best Buy is out of stock, and retailers show no sign of doing anything about the situation. At the time of writing, Walmart's website reckons there is one pair left throughout the entirety of the retail giant. In the UK, meanwhile, retailer John Lewis is unequivocal: “We will not receive more stock of this item”.

In fact, it seems the only place where you can still buy the Dyson Zone is at Dyson.com—and even here, the product is far from front and center. Should you find yourself able to navigate to the relevant page, you'll have to scroll down a long way to get to an image of the headphones with their air-purification muzzle attached. Indeed, “black sheep” seems a reasonable enough way to describe the Zone's position in the Dyson product family.

In an exclusive interview, WIRED sat down with Jake Dyson, who was disarmingly open about the fate of the Zone. So it seemed only right to discuss the Zone's fallout, look at Dyson's altogether more successful (and de facto replacement model) OnTrac headphones, and, considering that Jake's first swing for the company has turned out to be such a high-profile miss, find out Dyson's future plans in the audio world.

Jake Dyson at the 2023 London launch of the now discontinued Zone, a project he spearheaded.

“[With the Zone] we thought we could bring something better to the table than what's currently out there,"" says Jake Dyson. ""You get pure delivery of undisturbed air, and join that with headphones because you have to wear it on your head. So combine the two, you make it a more attractive proposition … there's added value. It brings a bit of fun and spirit to the product. And, of course, the visor is detachable—it can be something you wear in your hour of need, and then take it off and you've got an audio headset.”

But it is this leap with the air-purifying Zone that many could not quite fathom: “You've got to wear it, so let's make it headphones.” What made Dyson go there in particular? And, moreover, when it became clear this would be such a hard ask, many brands would rethink things—yet Dyson plowed on anyway.

“I'll be completely honest, quite often we work in an obsessive nature,"" says Jake. ""We want this product. We want to make this thing. Sometimes before actually evaluating what the market response might be. And the market didn't exist. So you've got to take those risks.”

Those risks are thrown into stark relief when you consider the market response to Zone. A product that is only two years old, yet you seemingly can't buy it anywhere now apart from on Dyson's site. Has Dyson quietly killed the Zone?

“First thing: Zone was completely ahead of its time,"" says Jake. ""It's solving a problem that is quite niche—the amount of people that are neurotic about air pollution, that want to solve that problem, and are willing to spend an amount of money; coupled with the fact that it's headphones, means your market is small. We have sold thousands. And we still have the tooling—but we've stopped manufacturing it. We haven't thrown the tools away. It's something we believe will come around in the future. It's a brilliant product.”

It's worth noting at this point that, outside of Dyson, the Zone isn't universally regarded as being a brilliant product. According to one major retailer in the US, “most people read it as a gimmick or another Google Glass–type product. For price, aesthetic, and performance, the space already has highly compelling offers from brands established as experts. Why would Dyson want to do ‘that' when what it is good at is ‘this'”?

Alan Sircom, editor of globally respected Hi-Fi+ magazine, goes even further. “The Zone is too odd, in my opinion. Anything that reminds people of wearing masks during Covid is dead in the water. I'd forgotten about it—that's how little market penetration Dyson has [with the Zone].”

Dyson, of course, is a privately owned company and consequently not obliged to release any information regarding the success (or otherwise) of the Zone. But Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint, doubts anyone can be happy with its performance.

Zone prototypes map the internal development of the air-purifying headphones.

“Zone was the result of six years of modeling and testing, of making maybe dozens of tooling models. Even if you just assume a team of 10 people, working on this project for six years, you're talking about a lot of expense,” Lam says. “Sound tuning is expensive, prototype testing is very expensive. It's hard to calculate exactly, but I'm sure it will have cost tens of millions of dollars. And the result is a product with no revenue, no profit margin, and no visibility. I haven't seen a single pair being worn in Hong Kong.”

And Hong Kong is not the only Asian territory where the anecdotal evidence for Zone is uninspiring, despite the fact that Dyson is a revered brand name in Asia, with huge presence. No major retailer can help you. At the Gain City Megastore, which at 11 stories is Singapore's largest consumer electronics retail store, they're not in stock. At e-Earphone, Japan's largest headphone retailer, they're not available either.

Yodobashi is the world's largest chain of electronics stores, but when WIRED visited the Kyoto branch recently the Dyson Zone was conspicuous only by its absence—and this is an electronics store with a “wireless headphones” department that has a footprint comfortably larger than that of the average Japanese apartment.

Dyson launched its OnTrac regular over-ear noise-canceling headphones with no wider innovative/unnecessary/bizarre (reader's choice) functionality in July 2024, just over a year after the Zone. And as a way of entering the market with a product that doesn't actively scare people, and of competing with established brands on a like-for-like basis, it looks like a sensible move.

Certainly, our review of the OnTrac discusses the excellent noise-canceling, the nicely balanced sound, and the interesting industrial design. We gave them an 8 out of 10, along with a coveted “WIRED Recommends” badge—a far cry from the Zone's rating, and quite the turnaround. Jake is justifiably proud of them. Also, the move from Zone to OnTrac shows a definite path despite the poor fortunes of Dyson's first swing at audio.

“We've learned a lot of lessons. It would be stupid not to take things further in audio,"" says Jake. ""Looking at other headphones out there, they all just look the same: black plastic, not very nice forms. Aesthetically, there's something deeply missing in terms of headphones. We thought we could achieve the best noise-canceling out there, and also bring something more interesting in terms of design. Engineer a beautiful product, bring customization, and more of a fashion element.”

As OnTrac has clearly sold significantly more than Zone, does Dyson consider Zone to be a product that didn't work, and OnTrac one that did? “[We've sold] ten-fold [more]—and we launched OnTrac last July, although you could say September was when it came to life. It normally takes about six months before people realize there's something there. OnTrac worked. [As for the Zone] we never deem anything to be a failure, because we always learn something.”

To affirm this point, Jake Dyson says that OnTrac is not merely the same headphones as Zone but with the fan system removed. “We've taken the advancement of the noise-canceling and enhanced it even further,” he says. “We've increased the software capability, so the range of sound, from the treble to the bass, is expanded.”

Compared to the polarizing Zone, Dyson's OnTrac headphones have supposedly been a relative success.

If WIRED knows anything about the market for premium wireless over-ear headphones, though, it's that the space is crammed with products from profoundly well-regarded brands—brands that have won their credibility through decades of experience in many areas of the audio market. Dyson, which is starting from a base of just about zero (if you accept that the relative success of OnTrac balances out the catastrophe of Zone), will need to establish a reputation for audio excellence pretty fast if it's going to compete.

The impressive and numerous customization options for OnTrac are a start (and more are on the way), but in the area of the market in which Dyson seems determined to compete, thoughtful industrial design is a minimum. Reputations are won and lost in every department: sound quality, obviously, and the standard of active noise-cancellation, ergonomics, extended functionality, and headline technologies are all important, too. It is a sad fact that many brands with greater audio chops than Dyson have floundered.

That's not to say Dyson can't make it happen, though. The company will have taken a lot of learning away from its (ultimately fruitless) N526 electric car project—and let's not overlook the fact that Dyson is a brand that usually gets where it intends to go. The company's hits hugely outweigh its misses—and there seems no reason to assume the combination of engineering expertise and sheer persistence that has made James Dyson a billionaire is about to desert the brand any time soon.

And perhaps most importantly of all, the whole Zone experience has led Jake Dyson to an extremely important realization—at least when it comes to headphones: “One of the things we've learned is obviously people really do bloody care about what it looks like when it's on your head.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Chatbot Tool Pays Users $50 a Month for Their Feedback on AI Models","https://www.wired.com/story/yupp-chatbot-pays-users-ai-model-feedback/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

To show off how easy it is for users to earn money by using his new chatbot platform, Pankaj Gupta offers to cash out $1 worth of Yupp credits, sending it to me over Venmo or PayPal. I'm talking with Gupta in the WIRED office during a prelaunch demo of Yupp, which comes out of stealth mode today. Journalistic ethics forbid accepting gifts from sources, so I politely decline. He proceeds to send it over PayPal to his Stanford alumni email.

Gupta is the CEO of Yupp, which is free to use and available globally. The website looks similar to other generative AI tools like ChatGPT. There's a prompt box, a way to attach files, and a log of past conversations.

The main difference is that every time users ask Yupp a question, they'll see two answers, generated by two different models and displayed side by side. Yupp routes prompts to a pair of large language models, choosing from a pool of over 500 models that includes products from leading US generative AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as international releases, like models from Alibaba, DeepSeek, and Mistral.

After looking over the two answers, users pick the response they like best, then provide feedback explaining why. For their effort, they earn a digital scratch card with Yupp credits.

""You're not being employed, but you can make a little bit of money,” says Gupta. In my testing, the Yupp credits on the scratch cards typically ranged from zero to around 250, though they occasionally went higher. Every 1,000 credits can be exchanged for $1. Users can cash out a maximum of $10 a day and $50 a month.

Not sure where to start while testing this web app, I turned to the range of prewritten topics flickering beneath Yupp's prompt bar, which spanned from news topics, like David Hogg leaving the Democratic National Committee, to ideas for image-creation prompts, like generating a crochet-looking surfer. (Yupp's models can generate text or images.) I eventually chose to have the bots explain different perspectives on the current Los Angeles protests.

I was interested in how it would pull from news reports and other sources to generate the analysis about a political issue. Yupp notified me that generating this answer would cost 50 of my 8,639 Yupp credits; users have to spend credits to make credits on Yupp.

It generated two answers, one from Perplexity's Sonar, on the left side, and one from an “AI agent” for news built by Yupp, on the right. AI agents are buzzy right now; they're basically task-based AI programs that can perform a string of simple operations on your behalf when given a single prompt.

The output based on Perplexity's model answered the question citing five online sources, including CBS News and a YouTube video uploaded by the White House titled “Third-World Insurrection Riots on American Soil.” The other answer, generated by the news agent, cited twice as many sources, including the socialist magazine Jacobin and MSNBC.

In addition to having more sources, the answer on the right side included more context about what Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass has been doing. I clicked the button saying I preferred that generation and gave my feedback, which Yupp anonymizes before aggregating.

A shiny card resembling a lottery scratcher ticket popped up afterward, and I used my mouse to scratch it off. I got a measly 68 credits for that feedback, not exactly a windfall. But since I spent 50 credits to run the prompt, it put me up by 18 credits.

After about an hour of messaging with the chatbot about different topics and giving my feedback on the models, the total points accrued equaled about $4. The cash-out options include PayPal and Venmo, but also cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Crypto and stablecoin allow us to instantly reach anywhere in the world,” Gupta says.

While I didn't earn much money, the free outputs did include answers generated by newly released models that are often locked behind subscription paywalls. If someone wants to use a free chatbot and doesn't mind the friction of providing feedback as the web interface flips between models, Yupp could be worth trying out.

During the demo, Gupta asked Yupp where the WIRED office was located. Both models spit out wrong answers initially, though subsequent tries got it right. Still, he sees the side-by-side outputs as potentially helpful for users who are concerned about AI-generated errors, which are still quite prevalent, and want another point of comparison.

“‘Every AI for everyone' is kind of our tagline,” says Gupta. “We have organized all the AI models we can find today.” Yupp's website encourages developers to reach out if they want their language or image model added to the options. It doesn't currently have any deals with AI model builders and provides these responses by making API calls.

Every time someone uses Yupp they are participating in a head-to-head comparison of two chatbot models and sometimes getting a reward for providing their feedback and picking a winning answer. Basically, it's a user survey disguised as a fun game. (The website has lots of emoji.)

He sees the data trade-off in this situation for users as more explicit than past consumer apps, like Twitter—which he's quick to tell me that he was the 27th employee at and now has one of that company's cofounders, Biz Stone, as one of his backers. “This is a little bit of a departure from previous consumer companies,” he says. “You provide feedback data, that data is going to be used in an anonymized way and sent to the model builders.”

Which brings us to where the real money is at: Selling human feedback to AI companies that desperately want more data to fine-tune their models.

“Crowdsourced human evaluations is what we're doing here,” Gupta says. He estimates the amount of cash users can make will add up to enough for a few cups of coffee a month. Though, this kind of data labeling, often called reinforcement learning with human feedback in the AI industry, is extremely valuable for companies as they release iterative models and fine tune the outputs. It's worth far more than the bougiest cup of coffee in all of San Francisco.

The main competitor to Yupp is a website called LMArena, which is quite popular with AI insiders for getting feedback on new models and bragging rights if a new release rises to the top of the pack. Whenever a powerful model is added to LMArena, it often stokes rumors about which major company is trying to test its new release in stealth.

“This is a two-sided product with network effects of consumers helping the model builders,” Gupta says. “And model builders, hopefully, are improving the models and submitting them back to the consumers.” He shows me a beta version of Yupp's leaderboard, which goes live today and includes an overall ranking of the models alongside more granular data. The rankings can be filtered by how well a model performs with specific demographic information users share during the sign-up process, like their age, or on a particular prompt category, like health-care-related questions.

Near the end of our conversation, Gupta brings up artificial general intelligence—the theory of superintelligent, humanlike algorithms—as a technology that is imminent. “These models are being built for human users at the end of the day, at least for the near future,” he says. It's a fairly common belief, and marketing point, among people working at AI companies, despite many researchers still questioning whether the underlying technology behind large language models will ever be able to produce AGI.

Gupta wants Yupp users, who may be anxious about the future of humanity, to envision themselves as actively shaping these algorithms and improving their quality. “It's better than free, because you are doing this great thing for AI's future,” he says. “Now, some people would want to know that, and others just want the best answers.”

And even more users might just want extra cash and be willing to spend a few hours giving feedback during their chatbot conversations. I mean, $50 is $50.

The China National Space Administration has shared the first image from its Tianwen-2 probe, which is en route to Kamo‘oalewa, a near-Earth asteroid.

The image was captured by a camera onboard the probe, which is currently more than 3 million kilometers from Earth, and shows one of its wings with its solar panels deployed. It is also the first glimpse the CNSA has offered of its space probe, which launched on May 29 on a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Zeyuan Town, China. The design of Tianwen-2's panels is similar in appearance to those on Lucy, NASA's space probe that is exploring asteroids floating near Jupiter. These serve to meet the power demands required for the trip.

Tianwen-2's mission is to land on the surface of Kamo‘oalewa, collect samples, and return to Earth. The spacecraft is scheduled to land on the asteroid's surface in July 2026. Before then, it will spend several months studying Kamo‘oalewa from a safe distance, to determine its sampling area, before proceeding with landing maneuvers, a particularly difficult task given the asteroid's low gravity.

Once the samples have been collected, Tianwen-2 will travel back to Earth and send its samples down to the surface in a capsule, before then attempting to use Earth's gravity as a slingshot to head toward 311P/PanSTARRS, an unusual-looking asteroid beyond Mars that has some of the characteristics of a comet, including visible tails. Tianwen-2 is expected to conduct this mission until 2035.

Kamo‘oalewa is one of Earth's seven known quasi-moons—objects that appear to be orbiting our planet, but which aren't actually gravitationally bound to Earth, and are actually asteroids circling the sun in an orbit similar to Earth's.

Discovered in 2016 by astronomers at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii, Kamo‘oalewa—whose name means “oscillating celestial object” in Hawaiian—is located approximately 4.65 million kilometers from our planet, 12 times further away from Earth than the moon. Kamo‘oalewa is estimated to be roughly 40 to 100 meters in diameter, has maintained its current orbit for 100 years, and will probably maintain it for 300 more.

It's hoped that Tianwen-2 can solve the mystery of Kamo‘oalewa's origin. One theory is that it's a chunk of rock that broke off from the moon millions of years ago. The sampling mission will help multiple scientific investigations into the composition of rocky celestial bodies, as well as aid scientists in the search for clues about the formation of the solar system.

Observational evidence and modeling suggest that Kamo‘oalewa has been orbiting the sun for millions of years, albeit with an unstable trajectory. A direct exploration of this asteroid could, in addition, expand knowledge about nearby celestial objects that might potentially pose a threat to Earth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Here's What Federal Troops Can (and Can't) Do While Deployed in LA","https://www.wired.com/story/what-marines-national-guard-can-cant-do-la-protests/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 13:48:21 GMT","

For the first time in decades, active-duty US Marines are rolling into Los Angeles—not for disaster relief or training drills, but to guard federal buildings during a protest crackdown that legal experts say threatens long-standing limits on military power at home.

The deployment, announced by President Donald Trump on Monday, involves more than 700 Marines from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division, based at Camp Pendleton and Twentynine Palms. Mobilized under Title 10 orders, the Marines have been commanded to protect federal property and personnel from mounting protests over aggressive immigration raids and neighborhood sweeps. It is a rare and forceful use of federal military power on US soil.

The mobilization follows Trump's June 7 order that federalized as many as 4,000 California national guardsmen, overriding the objections of state officials and igniting a high-stakes legal fight.

A US district judge on Thursday ordered Trump to return control of the guardsmen to the state of California, saying the takeover was unlawful, only likely to inflame tensions in the city, and had deprived the state of resources necessary “to fight fires, combat the fentanyl trade, and perform other critical functions.” The injunction was quickly stayed, however, by a federal appeals court, pending a hearing next week.

Protests began Friday in Westlake, an immigrant-heavy neighborhood near downtown LA, where residents rallied in response to sweeping ICE raids that targeted day laborers outside local businesses. Demonstrators marched, held signs, and chanted for several hours before tensions escalated after police declared an unlawful assembly and advanced on the crowd. LAPD officers and federal agents deployed a range of crowd control weapons, including batons, tear gas, pepper spray, and flash-bang grenades. Reports from journalists and observers describe nonviolent protesters—and members of the press—being struck by rubber bullets and stun devices during the crackdown.

Widespread protests are expected in LA and at some 2,000 other locations around the US this weekend.

While the president holds broad emergency powers, legal scholars say that without invoking the Insurrection Act—a statute that permits domestic troop deployments only in cases of a rebellion or civil rights violations—federal law sharply limits what active-duty forces can do. Marines may not act as a posse comitatus, or function as law enforcement. They're barred from arrests, surveillance, and crowd control, and may only support police in narrowly defined ways, according to Defense Department rules.

Pentagon directives governing “civil disturbance operations” reinforce these limits. Federal troops are prohibited from arresting civilians, searching property, and collecting evidence. They may not conduct surveillance of US persons. That includes not just individuals but vehicles, locations, and “transactions.” They may not serve as undercover agents, informants, or interrogators. Unless a crime is committed by a service member or on military property, Title 10 forces are likewise banned from engaging in any kind of forensics for the benefit of civilian police—unless they are willing to put in writing that such evidence was obtained by consent.

That said, there are numerous scenarios in which the military can provide assistance to police, including by giving them “information” obtained “in the normal course” of their duties, unless applicable privacy laws prohibit it. Military members can also provide police with a wide variety of assistance so long as it's in a “private capacity” and they're off duty. Additionally, they can provide “expert advice,” so long as it doesn't count as serving a function core to civilian police work.

The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment; however, a staff member in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy confirmed for WIRED by phone the current set of policies under which deployed federal troops must operate.

There is one major caveat to the military's restrictions. During an “extraordinary emergency,” military commanders may take limited, immediate action to prevent massive destruction or to restore critical public services, but only so long as presidential approval is “impossible” to obtain in advance. And while military personnel are naturally expected to maintain order and discipline at all times, under no circumstances are they required to stand down when their lives, or the lives of others, are in immediate danger.

Still, enforcement of these rules in the field is far from guaranteed. Legal experts warn that adherence often varies in chaotic environments. Trump administration officials have also demonstrated a willingness to skirt the law. Last week, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem asked the Pentagon to authorize military assistance in conducting arrests and to deploy drone surveillance, according to a letter obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle—a move experts say directly contradicts standing legal prohibitions.

At a press conference on Thursday, Noem stated the federal government was on a mission to “liberate” Los Angeles from “socialists” and the “leadership” of California governor Gavin Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass. US Senator Alex Padilla, who represents the citizens of California, was forcibly removed from the press conference after attempting to question Noem. Outside the press conference room, federal agents forced the senator to the ground, where he was temporarily placed in handcuffs.

Unlike the National Guard, which is well trained for domestic crowd control, active-duty Marines generally receive relatively little instruction in handling civil unrest. Those who do typically belong to military police or specialized security units. Nonetheless, the Marine Corps has published footage online showing various task forces training with riot-control tactics and “nonlethal” weapons. Constitutional concerns do not arise, however, when Marines face off against foreign mobs—such as in civilian zones during the Afghanistan war or on the rare occasion protesters breach the perimeter of a US embassy. And wartime rules of engagement are far more lenient than the rules of force by which Marines must adhere domestically.

In a statement on Wednesday, US Northern Command, which oversees military support to nonmilitary authorities in the contiguous 48 states, confirmed the Marines had undergone training in all “mission essential tasks,” including “de-escalation” and “crowd control.” They will reportedly be accompanied by legal and law enforcement experts.

Constitutional experts warn that deploying military forces against civilian demonstrators blurs the line between law enforcement and military power, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for unchecked presidential authority. The risk deepens, they say, if federal troops overstep their legal bounds.

If lines are crossed, it could open a door that may not close easily—clearing the way for future crackdowns that erode Americans' hard-won civil liberties.

Data-labeling company Scale AI confirmed on Friday that it has received a “significant” investment from Meta that values the startup at $29 billion. The startup also said its co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is stepping down from his role to join Meta and help the bigger company with its AI work.

Reports indicate that Meta invested about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the startup, which produces and labels data that's used to train the large language models that underpin a significant portion of generative AI development.

Meta confirmed the investment. “Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI. As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts. We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson for Meta told TechCrunch.

Jason Droege, Scale's current chief strategy officer, will hop in as interim CEO. Scale AI noted that Meta's investment will be used to pay investors and shareholders, as well as to fuel growth. The company emphasized that it remains an independent entity. Wang will continue at the data-labeling firm as a director on its board.

As my colleague Max Zeff wrote on Wednesday, this investment is a way for Meta to improve its AI efforts as its rivals Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic rush ahead, and the social media company's own AI model releases trail the competition. Plus, according to data by SingalFire, the company lost 4.3% of its top talent to other AI labs last year.

For the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that's used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.

Scale AI raised $1 billion last year from investors including Amazon and Meta at a valuation of $13.8 billion.

Nvidia doesn't think the U.S. will backpedal its chip export restrictions to China anytime soon. 

The chipmaker is so convinced of that fact that it's not going to include the Chinese market in its revenue and profit forecasts, CEO Jensen Huang told CNN on Thursday.

Huang said he's not counting on the Trump administration reversing its chip export controls and that it would be a nice “bonus” if they did.

The Trump administration introduced licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 chips, the most advanced AI chip it could sell to China, in April. In its first-quarter results, the company said these restrictions would result in an $8 billion hit to its revenue in the second quarter.

When contacted about this development, a Nvidia spokesperson pointed to remarks Huang made about China on the company's Q1 earnings call.

At Y Combinator's Spring 2025 Demo Day on Wednesday, nearly every presenting startup had something to do with AI — they're either developing AI agents or creating tools to facilitate their development. 

Indeed, several founders seem to be taking a page out of the playbook of several successful AI startups: About half a dozen startups were presenting variations of “Cursor for X.” For example, Den is building a “Cursor for knowledge workers,” and Vesence is on its way to make a “Cursor for lawyers.”

It wasn't all only about AI, though. We noticed several startups are working on robotics, which seems to be having a bit of a revival at the moment. 

Below are some of the startups that caught both investors' and our attention.

What it does: SEO for LLMs

Why it's a fave: How people search for content is changing, with folks using various AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity to find content. Understandably, brands need to find a way to increase their visibility on these platforms. Anvil claims it helps brands measure, optimize, and increase their presence on these AI tools.

What it does: Builds 3D chips

Why it's a fave: Transistors aren't getting smaller as fast as they used to, so Atum's founders propose the best new way to put more transistors on a chip, and therefore increase processing power, is to stack them in three dimensions. Investors told me that Atum's vision is so revolutionary that the company has a chance to become the next Nvidia.

What it does: Automates enterprise software implementation

Why it's a fave: The startup says prominent software vendors like SAP, ServiceNow, AWS, and Box have already reached out to use Auctor's solution themselves and potentially for help with integrating software at customer sites.

What it does: AI copilot for solopreneurs

Why it's a fave: Cactus says people who run businesses all by themselves are often too busy to pursue new opportunities. The startup claims its AI bot can take off some of the load by answering calls and accepting payments on your behalf.

What it does: Cursor for enterprise knowledge workers

Why it's a fave: Investors told me this is one of the hottest companies in the batch. Den promises its AI agents can replace Slack and Notion, enabling a company's employees to interact and share information with software tailored to each enterprise's specific needs. 

What it does: Automates customer operations with AI

Why it's a fave: Eloquent says its AI bots can help customers of financial services companies do things like automatically unfreeze bank accounts or add drivers to car insurance policies. In other words, Eloquent promises an end to long waits for human customer service. The startup claims financial companies can deploy its AI near instantly without needing to involve internal engineering teams.  Eloquent has already raised “a large seed round,” Tugce Bulut, the startup's co-founder and CEO said on the TBPN podcast.  

What it does: Tooling for evaluation and reinforcement learning

Why it's a fave: Evaluating all the new AI tools for quality is snowballing into a big, difficult problem. LLM Data Company says it can help with its own LLMs that can evaluate the quality of an AI agent, and it's already working with customers, including Perplexity.

What it does: AI-powered Bloomberg terminal

Why it's a fave: “Terminals are dashboards and not thinking tools,” says Amandeep Singh, co-founder of Scalar Field. While the startup's AI agents won't “think” for you, it claims they can manipulate financial data with more flexibility than existing financial tools. 

What it does: The open-source AI agent builder

Why it's a fave: Sim Studios wants to do for AI agents what Figma did for design: make them incredibly easy to build. Sim Studios users, including customers Epiq, Mercore, and the U.S. Department of Defense, have built AI agents for critical functions such as data transformations, real-world event simulations, and deep research.

What it does: Quantum accelerated AI servers to speed up AI training and inference

Why it's a fave: While a fully functioning quantum computer may still be years away, the industry has been making progress. What caught my eye about Sygaldry is that its co-founder and CEO is Chad Rigetti, who founded and took his company public via a SPAC in 2021.

What it does: Vibe coding to build applications

Why it's a fave: Investors who saw a demo of Vybe building apps told me that it can create all sorts of cool tools. One person I talked to even called it a “clear winner” of the batch.

Meta just made a $14.3 billion bet on data-labeling company Scale AI, but it's not a traditional takeover: Meta's taking a 49% stake in the company and adding Scale's co-founder Alexandr Wang to its team.

The move signals Meta's growing urgency to keep up in the AI race, even if its strategy for competing with heavyweights like OpenAI and Google is still a little confusing.

Today, on TechCrunch's Equity podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha break down the deal, dig up an interview from Kirsten's archives featuring Wang's early predictions for AI, and ask whether Meta's really buying a game-changer or just adding a well-connected dealmaker to its roster at a time when its own AI ambitions are falling further and further behind.

Take the article's example ""send today's schedule to my boss John Doe"" where the product isn't entirely guarded by the Plan-Then-Execute model (injections can still mutate email body).But if you combine it with the symbolic data store that is blind, it becomes more like:    ""send today's schedule to my boss John Doe"" -->
    $var1 = find_contact(""John Doe"")
    $var2 = summarize_schedule(""today"")
    send_email(recipient: $var1, body: $var2)

`find_contact` and `summarize_schedule` can both be quarantined, and the privileged LLM doesn't get to see the results directly.It simply invokes the final tool, which is deterministic and just reads from the shared var store. In this case you're pretty decently protected from prompt injection.I suppose though this isn't that different from the ""Code-Then-Execute"" pattern later on...

i think basically all of them involve reducing the ""agency"" of the agents though - which is a fine tradeoff - but i think one should be aware that the Big Model folks dont try to engineer any of these and just collect data to keep reducing injection risk. the tradeoff of capability maxxing vs efficiency/security often tends to be won by the capabilitymaxxers in terms of product adoption/marketing.eg the SWE Agent case study recommends Dual LLM with strict data formatting - would like to see this benchmarked in terms of how much of a perfomance an agent like this would be, perhaps doable by forking openai codex and implementing the dual llm.

  These patterns impose intentional
  constraints on agents, explicitly 
  limiting their ability to perform 
  arbitrary tasks.

That's a bucket of cold water in a lot of things people are trying to build. I imagine a lot of people will ignore this advice!

The problem with prompt injection is that the attack itself is the same as SQL injection - concatenation trusted and untrusted strings together -  but so far all of our attempts at implementing a solution similar to parameterized queries (such as system prompts and prompt delimiters) have failed.


reply



Long ago I encountered a predecessor's ""web scripting language"" product... it worked based on repeatedly evaluating a string and substituting the result, until it stopped mutating. Injection was its lifeblood.As much as it horrified me, in retrospect it was still marginally more secure than an LLM, because at least it had definite (if ultimately unworkable) parsing/escaping rules, instead of statistical suggestions.

> There is a growing consensus in theoretical physics that spacetime is not a primitive notionThat's a very strong statement. I'm not sure what the actual distribution of views on spacetime is, but there certainly isn't a consensus on that matter. If I wanted to establish credibility, I wouldn't open a paper with such a dubious claim.Second, Pauli matrices are highly relevant to space (see: Dirac spinors; but also, they can be used for quaternions—i.e., rotations in 3D). Using Pauli matrices to argue that we live in a 1+3 spacetime feels, at the very least, like a circular argument.

As a total tangent: it would be interesting to have an LLM-based modality, like a browser extension, where a user could highlight academic concepts in a pdf and drill down. Academic writing, by convention and necessity, is terse and references prior literature, sometimes opaquely. So getting up to speed in the literature takes significant effort.

If I understand correctly, it kinda happened the other way around. First the Pauli matrices were introduced to explain unexpected degrees of freedom in experimental observations; then the term ""spin"" was proposed because the operators related to each other in the same way as classical angular momentum operators.

Altman, Bezos, and Musk say they want to save humanity by creating superintelligent AI. Journalist and astrophysicist Adam Becker reveals how these fantastical visions conceal a darker agenda.

“The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” the famed computer scientist Alan Kay once said. Uttered more out of exasperation than as inspiration, his remark has nevertheless attained gospel-like status among Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, in particular a handful of tech billionaires who fancy themselves the chief architects of humanity's future. 

Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and others may have slightly different goals and ambitions in the near term, but their grand visions for the next decade and beyond are remarkably similar. Framed less as technological objectives and more as existential imperatives, they include aligning AI with the interests of humanity; creating an artificial superintelligence that will solve all the world's most pressing problems; merging with that superintelligence to achieve immortality (or something close to it); establishing a permanent, self-­sustaining colony on Mars; and, ultimately, spreading out across the cosmos.

While there's a sprawling patchwork of ideas and philosophies powering these visions, three features play a central role, says Adam Becker, a science writer and astrophysicist: an unshakable certainty that technology can solve any problem, a belief in the necessity of perpetual growth, and a quasi-religious obsession with transcending our physical and biological limits. In his timely new book, More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley's Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity, Becker calls this triumvirate of beliefs the “ideology of technological salvation” and warns that tech titans are using it to steer humanity in a dangerous direction. 

“In most of these isms you'll find the idea of escape and transcendence, as well as the promise of an amazing future, full of unimaginable wonders—so long as we don't get in the way of technological progress.”

“The credence that tech billionaires give to these specific science-fictional futures validates their pursuit of more—to portray the growth of their businesses as a moral imperative, to reduce the complex problems of the world to simple questions of technology, [and] to justify nearly any action they might want to take,” he writes. Becker argues that the only way to break free of these visions is to see them for what they are: a convenient excuse to continue destroying the environment, skirt regulations, amass more power and control, and dismiss the very real problems of today to focus on the imagined ones of tomorrow. 

A lot of critics, academics, and journalists have tried to define or distill the Silicon Valley ethos over the years. There was the “Californian Ideology” in the mid-'90s, the “Move fast and break things” era of the early 2000s, and more recently the “Libertarianism for me, feudalism for thee”  or “techno-­authoritarian” views. How do you see the “ideology of technological salvation” fitting in? 

I'd say it's very much of a piece with those earlier attempts to describe the Silicon Valley mindset. I mean, you can draw a pretty straight line from Max More's principles of transhumanism in the '90s to the Californian Ideology [a mashup of countercultural, libertarian, and neoliberal values] and through to what I call the ideology of technological salvation. The fact is, many of the ideas that define or animate Silicon Valley thinking have never been much of a ­mystery—libertarianism, an antipathy toward the government and regulation, the boundless faith in technology, the obsession with optimization. 

What can be difficult is to parse where all these ideas come from and how they fit together—or if they fit together at all. I came up with the ideology of technological salvation as a way to name and give shape to a group of interrelated concepts and philosophies that can seem sprawling and ill-defined at first, but that actually sit at the center of a worldview shared by venture capitalists, executives, and other thought leaders in the tech industry. 

Readers will likely be familiar with the tech billionaires featured in your book and at least some of their ambitions. I'm guessing they'll be less familiar with the various “isms” that you argue have influenced or guided their thinking. Effective altruism, rationalism, long­termism, extropianism, effective accelerationism, futurism, singularitarianism, ­transhumanism—there are a lot of them. Is there something that they all share? 

They're definitely connected. In a sense, you could say they're all versions or instantiations of the ideology of technological salvation, but there are also some very deep historical connections between the people in these groups and their aims and beliefs. The Extropians in the late '80s believed in self-­transformation through technology and freedom from limitations of any kind—ideas that Ray Kurzweil eventually helped popularize and legitimize for a larger audience with the Singularity. 

In most of these isms you'll find the idea of escape and transcendence, as well as the promise of an amazing future, full of unimaginable wonders—so long as we don't get in the way of technological progress. I should say that AI researcher Timnit Gebru and philosopher Émile Torres have also done a lot of great work linking these ideologies to one another and showing how they all have ties to racism, misogyny, and eugenics.

You argue that the Singularity is the purest expression of the ideology of technological salvation. How so?

Well, for one thing, it's just this very simple, straightforward idea—the Singularity is coming and will occur when we merge our brains with the cloud and expand our intelligence a millionfold. This will then deepen our awareness and consciousness and everything will be amazing. In many ways, it's a fantastical vision of a perfect technological utopia. We're all going to live as long as we want in an eternal paradise, watched over by machines of loving grace, and everything will just get exponentially better forever. The end.

As DOGE throws out the rule book for government tech, it's time we plan for the worst—and look to each other for courage and support.

The other isms I talk about in the book have a little more … heft isn't the right word—they just have more stuff going on. There's more to them, right? The rationalists and the effective altruists and the longtermists—they think that something like a singularity will happen, or could happen, but that there's this really big danger between where we are now and that potential event. We have to address the fact that an all-powerful AI might destroy humanity—the so-called alignment problem—before any singularity can happen. 

Then you've got the effective accelerationists, who are more like Kurzweil, but they've got more of a tech-bro spin on things. They've taken some of the older transhumanist ideas from the Singularity and updated them for startup culture. Marc Andreessen's “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” [from 2023] is a good example. You could argue that all of these other philosophies that have gained purchase in Silicon Valley are just twists on Kurzweil's Singularity, each one building on top of the core ideas of transcendence, techno­-optimism, and exponential growth. 

Early on in the book you take aim at that idea of exponential growth—specifically, Kurzweil's “Law of Accelerating Returns.” Could you explain what that is and why you think it's flawed?

Kurzweil thinks there's this immutable “Law of Accelerating Returns” at work in the affairs of the universe, especially when it comes to technology. It's the idea that technological progress isn't linear but exponential. Advancements in one technology fuel even more rapid advancements in the future, which in turn lead to greater complexity and greater technological power, and on and on. This is just a mistake. Kurzweil uses the Law of Accelerating Returns to explain why the Singularity is inevitable, but to be clear, he's far from the only one who believes in this so-called law.

“I really believe that when you get as rich as some of these guys are, you can just do things that seem like thinking and no one is really going to correct you or tell you things you don't want to hear.”

My sense is that it's an idea that comes from staring at Moore's Law for too long. Moore's Law is of course the famous prediction that the number of transistors on a chip will double roughly every two years, with a minimal increase in cost. Now, that has in fact happened for the last 50 years or so, but not because of some fundamental law in the universe. It's because the tech industry made a choice and some very sizable investments to make it happen. Moore's Law was ultimately this really interesting observation or projection of a historical trend, but even Gordon Moore [who first articulated it] knew that it wouldn't and couldn't last forever. In fact, some think it's already over. 

These ideologies take inspiration from some pretty unsavory characters. Transhumanism, you say, was first popularized by the eugenicist Julian Huxley in a speech in 1951. Marc Andreessen's “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” name-checks the noted fascist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and his futurist manifesto. Did you get the sense while researching the book that the tech titans who champion these ideas understand their dangerous origins?

You're assuming in the framing of that question that there's any rigorous thought going on here at all. As I say in the book, Andreessen's manifesto runs almost entirely on vibes, not logic. I think someone may have told him about the futurist manifesto at some point, and he just sort of liked the general vibe, which is why he paraphrases a part of it. Maybe he learned something about Marinetti and forgot it. Maybe he didn't care. 

I really believe that when you get as rich as some of these guys are, you can just do things that seem like thinking and no one is really going to correct you or tell you things you don't want to hear. For many of these billionaires, the vibes of fascism, authoritarianism, and colonialism are attractive because they're fundamentally about creating a fantasy of control. 

OpenAI's Sam Altman claims AI will deliver an ""Intelligence Age,"" but tech breakthroughs alone can't solve global warming.

You argue that these visions of the future are being used to hasten environmental destruction, increase authoritarianism, and exacerbate inequalities. You also admit that they appeal to lots of people who aren't billionaires. Why do you think that is? 

I think a lot of us are also attracted to these ideas for the same reasons the tech billionaires are—they offer this fantasy of knowing what the future holds, of transcending death, and a sense that someone or something out there is in control. It's hard to overstate how comforting a simple, coherent narrative can be in an increasingly complex and fast-moving world. This is of course what religion offers for many of us, and I don't think it's an accident that a sizable number of people in the rationalist and effective altruist communities are actually ex-evangelicals.

More than any one specific technology, it seems like the most consequential thing these billionaires have invented is a sense of inevitability—that their visions for the future are somehow predestined. How does one fight against that?

It's a difficult question. For me, the answer was to write this book. I guess I'd also say this: Silicon Valley enjoyed well over a decade with little to no pushback on anything. That's definitely a big part of how we ended up in this mess. There was no regulation, very little critical coverage in the press, and a lot of self-mythologizing going on. Things have started to change, especially as the social and environmental damage that tech companies and industry leaders have helped facilitate has become more clear. That understanding is an essential part of deflating the power of these tech billionaires and breaking free of their visions. When we understand that these dreams of the future are actually nightmares for the rest of us, I think you'll see that senseof inevitability vanish pretty fast.

There are lots of things that we'd like to improve about our laptops and computers. Memory is a big one for a lot of us, and so is general performance. However, one that's a little easier to overlook and forget about is the number of USB ports you've got. You don't have to suffer through that though, you can just buy more if you know how.

See at Amazon

There are a few devices that'll do that for you, but a really good one is this HP USB-C Dock, which can turn one USB-C port into 11 different ports, making it really easy to use more accessories. This means you can do more creative tasks, add more webcams, or just fill them with play-dough if you want to. Don't do that though. Anyway, this awesome device is currently 54% off, which means it's down to just $105 at the moment.

This device is incredibly easy to use, and it's highly compatible. In essence, as long as you've got a Thunderbolt-enabled device, you can plug it into a USB port and you'll immediately add a huge number of extra slots to whatever you're using it with. You get not only extra USB ports, but also two DisplayPorts, one HDMI port, and one gigabit Ethernet port as well. You get all of that from a device that's just 5 inches by 5 inches too, which means it'll work whether you've got limited desk space, or you're using it on the go while you commute.

This is pretty much the perfect device for anyone who commutes but needs more ports, or those who want more things attached to their PC but can't afford a proper upgrade for whatever reason. It's just really convenient, and it also makes these ports a lot easier to get to than they are normally. After all, we've all suffered at the hands of the USB ports on the back of our PC at some point, right? Well, with this thing plugged in, you don't have to deal with that, you can access a bunch of essential ports on your desk without having to get a load of dust and all the random things your cats drag around on you.

We'd recommend acting quickly if you're hoping to get your hands on this though, as we're not expecting the 54% discount to last very long. That means the price will go up from the $105 sale price back to the normal $230 price if you wait too long.

Fecal transplants have emerged as a potential treatment for a wide range of conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, and even depression. These so-called poop transplants have understandably received a lot of attention, but new research casts a bit of a wet blanket over the practice.

The procedure involves taking microbes from the poop of a healthy person and transferring them into a patient's colon. This should restore balance to their gut microbiome, but according to a study published June 6 in the journal Cell, transplanted microbes may colonize the wrong parts of the digestive system. This can result in long-lasting unintended health consequences, the researchers warn.

“I think it's a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn't willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn't be there,” said lead author Orlando “Landon” DeLeon, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, in a statement.

DeLeon led a team of researchers through a series of experiments on mice to determine how fecal matter transplants affect different parts of the intestine. The mice were separated into three groups. One received microbes from the jejunum (the middle part of the small intestine), the second received microbes from the cecum (a pouch that connects the small intestine to the colon), and the third received a standard fecal transplant from the colon.

Each part of the digestive system contains uniquely adapted microbiota. The researchers wanted to see if the microbes would stick to their respective niches once inside the mice. In fact, they found that each of the transplants successfully colonized the full intestinal tract, creating regional gut “mismatches” that lasted for up to three months after the procedure. 

Microbes that colonized parts of the gut where they didn't belong triggered metabolic changes in these intestinal regions, with the potential to affect a patient's health and behavior. The researchers observed changes in the mice's eating habits, activity, and energy expenditure following the transplants. They also documented changes in gene activity associated with immune function, which in turn led to changes in liver metabolism. Most surprising was the manner in which these foreign microbes altered gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining to make the mismatched gut region more suitable for them.

“It's like they're engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,” DeLeon said.

To determine whether these mismatches could occur in actual fecal transplant patients, he and his colleagues conducted additional tests using human tissue samples. Results showed that transplanted gut bacteria can colonize parts of the human digestive system where they don't naturally belong.

“If we're designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits,” DeLeon said. For example, the findings suggest it may be safer to use microbes retrieved from all the parts of the digestive system, according to the researchers.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only recommends fecal transplants for treating repeated infections of Clostridium difficile, or C. diff. This bacterium—which can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms—most commonly sickens hospital patients who have been treated with antibiotics. Fecal transplants have proven to be highly effective for treating these infections, and those results have encouraged researchers to investigate other applications for this procedure. 

A wave of new research suggests that fecal transplants could treat conditions that go beyond the gut. Indeed, studies have found that this procedure could benefit patients with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and more. 

DeLeon's findings suggest that doctors need to better understand the risks of fecal matter transplants before this treatment can be used for diseases other than C. diff. He plans to keep investigating how different microbes affect each part of the intestine and explore ways to restore altered regions to their original state. 

This study shows that when it comes to gut microbes, location really matters. Getting the right bugs in the right place could unlock the full potential of fecal transplants.

These wireless earphones may look very much like AirPods or Galaxy Buds at first glance, but they're obviously distinct products. But with a record low price tag of just $21, currently discounted by 86% from a typical $160 price on Amazon, these represent a compelling trade-off for whoever is willing to sacrifice wireless audio quality but without a huge expense outlay.

While you should not expect the premium finish or advanced features of higher-priced companies, these earbuds have been highly rated with a 4.7 out of 5-star rating and nearly 10,000 units sold in a single month. For this price, it is hard to find a better bargain in the market today.

See at Amazon

On the technical front, these wireless earbuds are powered by Bluetooth 5.4 technology which offers seamless pairing, reduced latency and a steadier connection over a range of 15 meters. While this latest version of Bluetooth enhances the experience itself, it also extends battery life which is a crucial aspect for a user who uses earbuds throughout the day. The earbuds themselves deliver up to 8 hours of playback at 80% volume and the charging case provides an impressive total of 40 hours of playtime.

These earbuds feature a 13mm vibration diaphragm and AAC/SBC audio codec for deep bass and clear, detailed sound. They also have their Hi-Fi stereo sound boosted by ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) technology that uses four microphones to eliminate background noise and wind noise when making calls. They thus qualify as suitable bets for hands-free calling in even louder environments or while outdoors.

The earbuds come with uncomplicated touch controls so that you can play/pause music, answer/terminate a call, skip songs and even activate voice assistants like Siri without putting your hands on your phone. The charging case features a dual LED display that shows the remaining battery level for both the earbuds and the case, so you're never caught off guard by a dead battery.

They also have the IP7 certification for water resistance which means they can withstand immersion into water one meter deep for 30 minutes. This implies that they can be used while exercising, running, or even in the rain. They have an ergonomic shape that forms a snug, secure fit on most ears, and the light material that they are made of makes them tolerable for extended use. The fit is tight enough for active wear so you don't need to worry about them coming off while you work out or make your daily commutes.

If you're searching for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds at a decent price point, don't miss this deal.

Nearly 10 years ago, scientists observed ripples in spacetime created by the collision of two black holes that took place 1.3 billion years ago. The first direct detection of gravitational waves opened up an entirely new way of seeing the universe, allowing us to observe a once invisible side of the cosmos. Today, the ability to track the frequencies produced by the most notable events that shape our surrounding cosmos is at risk due to drastic budget cuts targeting a breakthrough observatory.

In late May, the U.S. administration released a so-called skinny budget that highlighted the proposed funds allocated to NASA and the National Science Foundation in 2026. As part of several monstrosities committed against ongoing science programs, the proposed budget would gut the funding for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) by 39.6%. The budget request allocates $29 million instead of $48 million for LIGO, and shuts down one of its two interferometers.

The twin interferometers are situated 1,865 miles apart (3,002 kilometers), with one facility in Washington State and another in Louisiana. The enormous research facilities operate in unison as a single observatory designed to detect gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime that travel at the speed of light.

Unlike other telescopes, LIGO is blind. It detects gravitational waves by measuring incredibly small distortions in spacetime. Using its laser interferometers, it splits a laser beam into two and sends each of them down two long vacuum-sealed arms. The beams travel back and forth through each arm, bouncing between precisely configured mirrors. Each beam monitors the distance between the mirrors and detects tiny changes caused by gravitational waves, which can stretch space in one direction and compress it in the other. The lasers can discern movements between their mirrors with an accuracy of 1/10,000th the width of a proton.

Researchers from Caltech and MIT, with funding and oversight from the National Science Foundation, completed construction of LIGO—one of the world's most sophisticated scientific observatories—in 1999. Scientists spent years searching for gravitational waves and coming up empty. Finally, on September 14, 2015, the observatory began picking up the signal of its first gravitational waves. The groundbreaking detection provided scientists with a brand new way of observing the universe, allowing them to trace the waves back to events that had long remained hidden in the cosmos. Gravitational waves are caused by the merger of black holes, the collision of neutron stars, and asymmetric supernovae. Some may have also been produced in the early universe, moments after the Big Bang.

Three researchers behind LIGO's discovery were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for their role in the detection of gravitational waves: physicists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne. These ripples in spacetime were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, and could only be confirmed decades later. The first discovery was confirmed because the signal was observed by both LIGO detectors. Since then, the twin LIGO interferometers—sometimes in coordination with the Virgo observatory in Italy—have detected hundreds of additional gravitational wave signals.

Gravitational waves produce a high-pitched chirp when translated to audio, beginning at a low frequency. The two interferometers, and sometimes three, need to work in unison to confirm these faint signals. If one of LIGO's twin interferometers is shut down, as is suggested by the proposed budget, researchers would have trouble distinguishing between a black hole collision and a nearby seismic tremor, according to Science.

The field of gravitational waves is only just getting started thanks to the twin LIGO detectors. Killing off one of the laser interferometers would hinder our newfound ability to listen in to the soft ripples of spacetime that echo through the cosmos.

UPDATE 6/12: As it turns out, AMD's Helios has 72 GPUs, not 128 GPUs. Updating the story to reflect changes.AMD gave a preview of its first in-house designed rack-scale solution, Helios, at its Advancing AI event on Thursday. The system is set to be based on the company's next-generation EPYC 'Venice' processors, will use its Instinct MI400-series accelerator, and will rely on network connections featuring the upcoming Pensando network cards. Overall, the company says that the flagship MI400X is 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, which is a remarkable progress given that the MI400X will be released about three years after the MI300X. 

When it comes to rack-scale solutions for AI, AMD clearly trails behind Nvidia. This is going to change a bit this year as cloud service providers (such as Oracle OCI), OEMs, and ODMs will build and deploy rack-scale solutions based on the Instinct MI350X-series GPUs, but those systems will not be designed by AMD, and they will have to interconnect each 8-way system using Ethernet, not low-latency high-bandwidth interconnects like NVLink.

The real change will occur next year with the first AMD-designed rack-scale system called Helios, which will use Zen 6-powered EPYC 'Venice' CPUs, CDNA 'Next'-based Instinct MI400-series GPUs, and Pensando 'Vulcano' network interface cards (NICs) that are rumored to increase the maximum scale-up world size to beyond eight GPUs, which will greatly enhance their capabilities for training and inference. The system will adhere to OCP standards and enable next-generation interconnects such as Ultra Ethernet and Ultra Accelerator Link, supporting demanding AI workloads.

 ""So let me introduce the Helios AI rack,"" said Andrew Dieckman, corporate VP and general manager of AMD's data center GPU business. ""Helios is one of the system solutions that we are working on based on the Instinct MI400-series GPU, so it is a fully integrated AI rack with EPYC CPUs, Instinct MI400-series GPUs, Pensando NICs, and then our ROCm stack. It is a unified architecture designed for both frontier model training as well as massive scale inference [that] delivers leadership compute density, memory bandwidth, scale out interconnect, all built in an open OCP-compliant standard supporting Ultra Ethernet and UALink."" 

From a performance point of view, AMD's flagship Instinct MI400-series AI GPU (we will refer to it as to Instinct MI400X, though this is not the official name, and we will also call the CDNA Next as CDNA 5) doubles performance from the Instinct MI355X and increases memory capacity by 50% and bandwidth by more than 100%. While the MI355X delivers 10 dense FP4 PFLOPS, the MI400X is projected to hit 20 dense FP4 PFLOPS. 

Overall, the company says that the flagship MI400X is 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, which is a remarkable progress given that the MI400X will be released about three years after the MI300X. 

""When you look at our product roadmap and how we continue to accelerate, with MI355X, we have taken a major leap forward [compared to the MI300X]: we are delivering 3X the amount of performance on a broad set of models and workloads, and that is a significant uptick from the previous trajectory we were on from the MI300X with the MI325X,"" said Dieckman. ""Now, with the Instinct MI400X and Helios, we bend that curve even further, and Helios is designed to deliver up to 10X more AI performance on the the most advanced frontier models in the high end.""

The new MI400X accelerator will also surpass Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, which is currently ramping up, in terms of compute performance. However, when it comes to comparison with Nvidia's next-generation Rubin R200 that delivers 50 dense FP4 PFLOPS, AMD's MI400X will be around 2.5 times slower. Still, AMD will have an ace up its sleeve, which is memory bandwidth and capacity (see tables for details). Similarly, Helios will outperform Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra-based NVL72 and Rubin-based NVL144. 

However, it remains to be seen how Helios will stack against NVL144 in real-world applications. Also, it will be extremely hard to beat Nvidia's NVL576 both in terms of compute performance and memory bandwidth in 2027, though by that time, AMD will likely roll out something new.

At least, this is what AMD communicated at its Advancing AI event this week: the company plans to continue evolving its integrated AI platforms with next-generation GPUs, CPUs, and networking technology, extending its roadmap well into 2027 and beyond.

Enabling zettascale AMD-based AI cluster.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will be among the first hyperscalers to deploy AMD's latest Instinct MI350X-series GPUs as well as its Pensando Pollara 400GbE network interface card, which is the industry's first Ultra Ethernet-compliant NIC, AMD disclosed at its Advancing AI event. The announcement comes as the Ultra Ethernet Consortium this week published Specification 1.0 of the Ultra Ethernet technology designed for hyper-scale AI and HPC data centers. 

Systems featuring AMD's Instinct MI350X-series GPUs as well as Pensando Pollara 400GbE NICs will be broadly available at OCI and possibly other cloud service providers in the second half of this year, according to the company. The Pensando Pollara 400GbE network cards will be particularly handy for Oracle, which plans to broadly deploy AMD's latest AI GPUs and build a zettascale AI cluster with up to 131,072 Instinct MI355X to enable its customers to train and inference AI models at a massive scale. 



AMD's Pensando Pollara 400GbE NICs — just like other Ultra Ethernet-compliant network hardware — are designed for massive scale-out environments containing up to a million AI processors or GPUs and promise an up to six times performance boost for AI workloads. AMD claims that its Pollara 400GbE card offers a 10% higher RDMA performance compared to Nvidia's CX7 and 20% higher RDMA performance than Broadcom's Thor2 solution. In addition, UEC 1.0 features like efficient load-balancing, selective retransmission, and path-aware congestion control can further improve RDMA performance by 25% compared to traditional RoCEv2. 

The Pensando Pollara 400GbE NIC is based on an in-house designed specialized processor with customizable hardware that supports RDMA, adjustable transport protocols, and offloading of communication libraries. The NIC can intelligently split data streams across multiple routes to avoid bottlenecks and dynamically reroute traffic away from overloaded network paths to ensure consistent throughput across large-scale GPU deployments. 

In addition, AMD's Pollara 400GbE card features failover technology that rapidly detects and bypasses the connection to preserve high-speed GPU-to-GPU links. Such capabilities are crucial for maintaining cluster utilization and reducing latencies in environments with tens of thousands of interconnected accelerators.



While Oracle will be the first big hyperscaler to deploy AMD's Pollara 400GbE NICs (as it will probably own the largest AMD Instinct MI355X-based cluster), other companies that plan large-scale AMD Instinct deployments will follow soon, popularizing adoption of Ultra Ethernet gear. The cards are currently shipping to interested parties.

Another Rosetta 2 holdout gone


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Valve just released a Steam Client Beta that runs on Apple Silicon. The company announced on the Steam Community website that both the Steam Client and the Steam Helper now run natively on Apple Silicon. This move will improve Steam's performance on Apple computers, especially as it removes the additional overhead for Rosetta 2.

Valve also has no choice but to create a native version for Steam, especially as Apple is largely sunsetting Rosetta 2 after macOS 27. The company made the announcement this week at WWDC 25, where it also said that macOS Tahoe will be the last OS update for Intel Macs, some five years after the company released the first Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Air.

That means most apps designed for x86 systems will no longer work with macOS, unless their developers create a version that runs natively on Apple Silicon. The company said it will only retain a few portions of Rosetta to run older games that are no longer updated by their developers.

This update means that Steam will have better performance, improving the gaming experience on your macOS device. Notably, it's also the only public Arm version of Steam going. However, it doesn't mean that you can now start playing Windows-only games on your Apple computer. You still need emulation tools if you want to run x86 Windows games on your Mac.

Despite that, this change is slowly making Apple devices more conducive for gaming. The company wants to capture a bigger slice of the computer gaming pie with its ecosystem approach, but the limited number of titles (compared to the vast library of Windows games) and the relative price of Apple computers versus gaming PCs make it harder for gamers to switch over, despite the performance that Apple silicon delivers.

The phasing out of Rosetta 2 might disappoint a few users, but it is high time that developers start building apps specifically for Apple Silicon. After all, it's already been five years since the first M1 chip arrived on the MacBook Air, and relying on a translation layer is certainly holding back the hardware from performing at its maximum potential.

If you want to upgrade the Steam client on your macOS device, open the Steam app, go to Steam > Preferences… In the Steam Settings window, go to Interface, then click on the dropdown menu beside Client Beta Participation and choose Steam Beta Update. This will restart Steam and download the updated version (Steam Version: 1749753892 or higher) that natively runs on Apple Silicon. To confirm the update, look for Steam in the Activity Monitor — the Kind column should say Apple.

Nevertheless, it is a popular little project, fielding lots of stars, forks, issues raised, and pull requests.

GitHub has hit an illustrious milestone with the publication of the one billionth repository this week. Whether by chance or design, Aasish Pokhrel from Nepal earned the honor of publishing the billionth nugget of code shared on the platform. Unfortunately, it's ‘sh*t.' That isn't a snarky comment, or our judgment regarding the code, the repo is simply the word ‘sh*t.'



Despite its minimal content, the ‘sh*t' repo seems extremely popular within the GitHub developer community. At the time of writing, there have been 73 pull requests made, 147 forks, 188 issues raised, and the project earned 2.1K stars from the community.

The issues raised and pull requests sections are, as you might expect, full of… witty comments on Aasish Pokhrel's code. Some issues raised include ""this code is sh*t,"" ""experiencing trouble pushing,"" and even a request for ""macOS support.""

GitHub.com/AasishPokhrel/sh*t's pull requests section is also littered with devs asking for regional translations, emoji support, and more.

Pokhrel definitely hit the jackpot with his ‘sh*t' repo, and we have to wonder whether there will be any worthy follow-through. The Nepalese developer currently has 20 repositories under his name, primarily containing HTML and CSS code. Shortly before ‘sh*t' they published the even pithier ‘yep,' a one-star project which seems to have been overlooked by the GitHubbing throng.



GitHub is a hugely popular platform for developers to collaborate on code and manage software projects on the web. It was built on the foundations of Git, a distributed version control system for developers, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to support the development of the Linux kernel.

Founded in 2008, then bought out for $7.5 billion by Microsoft just a decade later, GitHub has become a cornerstone for modern collaborative coding. There are over 100 million developers, ranging from hobbyists to enterprises, using the platform. We frequently report on new and undiscovered gems on GitHub. Today's ‘sh*t' might be new, but it isn't really a gem.

The attack sounds unbelievably hard to pull off. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new theoretical air-gap attack dubbed SmartAttack has been cooked up by researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the NegevBeer Sheva, Israel, proposing that smartwatches could be leveraged as receivers for ultra-sonic covert communication in air-gapped systems, highlighting an emerging threat to the networks.

As per the paper, air-gapped systems are generally considered secure due to their physical isolation from external networks, a measure used to prevent unauthorized access and cyberattacks. Air-gapped systems take different forms, including actual physical isolation or 'logical' isolation, where the segregation is implemented using other means such as encryption.

The paper, authored by Mordechai Guri, PhD (Head of Offensive-Cyber Research Lab), focuses on the former physical implementation of air-gap security. He describes smartwatches as ""an underexplored yet effective attack vector,"" and in the paper proposes a new method that uses smartwatches as a receiver for ultrasonic covert communication in air-gapped environments.

According to the abstract, the method uses the built-in microphone of a smartwatch to capture covert signals in real time, specifically ultrasonic frequencies ranging from 18 to 22 kHz. According to the paper, extensive experimentation demonstrates that the attack can successfully transmit data over distances up to and possibly beyond 6 meters, with data transfer rates of 50 bits per second.

Despite the theoretical threat, any such attack would be enormously difficult to pull off. An adversary would still need to infiltrate the secured network and implant malware; to that end, the research cites previous incidents where air-gap networks have been compromised by supply chain attacks, insider threats, or infected removable media.

Implanted malware would remain dormant or operate stealthily, gathering sensitive information such as keystrokes, encryption keys, biometric data, or user credentials. The information is then modulated onto ultrasonic signals, broadcast at an inaudible frequency via the computer's speakers so as to evade human detection.

The more you read the paper, the more it starts to sound like a discarded Mission: Impossible plot. That's because the attack also requires a compromised smartwatch belonging to an employee or visitor with access to the secure environment. The paper envisions using extensive smartwatch connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, or even email, to achieve this.

Once compromised, the smartwatch malware monitors its environment for incoming ultrasonic signals using its microphone. Even with malware in place on both the air-gapped network and the requisite smartwatch, ultrasonic data exfiltration is limited by factors such as position, signal reception, and strength, notably because a smartwatch is worn on the wrist and as such tends to move more or less constantly.

Despite the exceedingly high barriers to pulling off such an attack, the paper takes the threat seriously enough to propose mitigations. Obvious measures include prohibiting the use of smartwatches and similarly capable audio devices in air-gapped network environments, while other more sophisticated measures extend to deploying ultrasonic monitoring systems, using ultrasonic jamming, and even integrating ultrasonic firewalls within computers used in such networks.

 June 13, 2025  

The exponential rise of our aging population. The pandemic. The explosion of GLP-1s. It's a trifecta that's making muscle — and the serious implications of not having enough of it — part of a larger health conversation.

Yet when I recently asked my 65-year-old mom whether her doctor had ever talked to her about resistance training or protein intake, I was surprised to hear that the topic wasn't coming up. (And for the record: My parents' doctor has always been an attentive, caring, and in-the-know practitioner.) 

“Muscle span” and “strength span” aren't just trendy new buzzwords being used to shill protein powder on Instagram. A growing body of research has strengthened the case for the unique and protective benefits of building and maintaining muscle mass over your lifespan.

“Because of the importance of muscle, both as a functional organ and as a metabolic organ, muscle depletion (or low muscle mass) is an independent predictor of poor health outcomes,” said Carla Prado, PhD, RD, director of the Human Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Sure, you say, it's true and makes sense, but try motivating unmotivated patients to strength train. Exercise adherence is historically one of the biggest challenges. (Roll out the standard stat that fewer than a quarter of Americans get the recommended two strength-training sessions per week, according to the CDC.)

So let's talk about muscle — as a reminder and motivator — and while looking good at the beach takes up a lot of oxygen in that conversation, the plain truth is what muscle does on the inside is more important than what people see on the outside.

Skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body by mass, taking up 30%-50% of our total body mass depending on age, sex, and fitness level. It's not slacking off, either. While its performance benefits are obvious, skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ with wide-reaching effects on the body — from metabolic function, hormonal regulation, and disease prevention.

One of the most important roles it plays is in glucose metabolism. Skeletal muscle regulates more than 75% of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, helping control glucose and lipids while reducing the risk for metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. (Conversely, the loss of muscle mass — particularly as we age — leads to reduced glucose clearance from the bloodstream, increasing the risk for metabolic disorders.)

Muscle mass is a heavy hitter when it comes to our daily calorie burn, too. Our resting energy expenditure is the biggest piece of the metabolic puzzle, with the thermic effect of food and the energy expenditure from exercise playing far smaller supporting roles. And while the energy used by our brain, skin, and internal organs doesn't vary a ton, the calories tied to muscle metabolism can shift the equation considerably.

Case in point: The average muscle mass of a young, healthy man ranges from 35 to 50 kg (77 to 110 lbs). An elderly woman? Maybe 13 kg (29 lbs). That means the energy released per day as a result of muscle protein synthesis can range from 485 calories per day (in the muscular young man) to 120 calories per day (in an active elderly woman). A 365 calorie difference.

Researchers stress that even small differences in lean mass — say, 10 kg (22 lbs) —translates to a 100-calorie difference in energy expenditure per day, which if held consistent comes out to a little over 10 pounds of fat mass per year.

“Muscle is truly valuable and we need to be figuring out how to maintain it as much as we can throughout our lives,” said Board-Certified Family Medicine Doctor (and viral social media influencer) Mikhail Varshavski. 

The problem? Adults reach peak muscle mass levels somewhere between our 20s and 40s — before it begins to progressively decline. On average, humans lose 0.5% of their skeletal muscle mass per year in their 40s, 1-2% after age 50 years, and approximately 3% per year after age 60 years.

Without proper nutrition and exercise interventions, this progressive loss of muscle mass and strength with age — better known as sarcopenia and dynapenia — can have massive consequences.

We're not talking about struggling to screw a lid off a jar, walk up a flight of stairs, or show off our wash-board abs, either. Sarcopenia is a major contributor to frailty, falls, and loss of independence in older adults. 

Age and frailty have become a wild card in this discussion, as well, as frailty rates in the US have crept upward, for sure, but more problematic is that frailty and prefrailty are now more common in younger people. We're becoming physically compromised at younger and younger ages.

“Survival is shorter for people with low muscle mass across the continuum of care — whether they are older adults, hospitalized patients, or patients with cancer or liver diseases,” said Prado. “If they are hospitalized, for example, they are more likely to develop complications and stay at the hospital for longer periods of time.”

This is largely due to skeletal muscle's role as the center of protein and amino acid metabolism in the body, said Robert Wolfe, PhD, director of the Center for Translational Research in Aging and Longevity at the Reynolds Institute on Aging in Little Rock, Arkansas.

During periods of stress, trauma, or illness, muscle can be broken down to supply the body with necessary proteins for immune function and tissue repair. Individuals with limited reserves of muscle mass respond poorly, explained Wolfe.

“For example, survival from severe burn injury is lowest in individuals with reduced lean body mass,” he said. “Loss of muscle mass is also known to be detrimental to survival from cancer: In patients with lung cancer receiving radiation therapy, the amount of body protein predicted recurrence.”

Herein lies the rub: We can't predict when an accident or critical illness may hit, yet the state of our skeletal muscle at that time can play a dramatic role in our recovery. “If there is a preexisting deficiency of muscle mass before trauma, the acute loss of muscle mass and function may push an individual over a threshold that makes recovery of normal function unlikely to ever occur,” said Wolfe. This is why 50% of women 65 years old or older who break a hip in a fall never walk again.

The takeaway? “We're all going to lose muscle as we age, but not all of us will reach the threshold below which is associated with clinical implications,” said Prado. “That's what we're trying to avoid here.”

Maintaining muscle demands early and proactive interventions, as age-related anabolic resistance is inevitable without it.

“While it can be somewhat reversed in those who are anabolically resistant, it can be mostly avoided by adopting a lifelong approach to muscular health,” said Brad Schoenfeld, PhD, researcher and professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York City. “This involves regular resistance training and consuming adequate dietary protein.” 

Not cardio? While cardiovascular exercise has been much more well researched over the years and indisputably has powerful effects on your health, strength training goes well beyond what you can achieve through aerobic training.

“In my opinion, resistance training is one of the most important interventions you can do for overall health and wellness,” said Schoenfeld. “It positively affects virtually every organ system and is key to preventing a loss of physical independence as we age.”

For starters, resistance training directly stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and improves mitochondrial function, he said. Mitochondria are critical for energy production, and their decline is linked to aging and chronic disease. Resistance training helps maintain mitochondrial health by increasing both the number and function of mitochondria in muscle cells. This has been shown to improve energy metabolism and reduce oxidative stress. For older adults, this can translate to not only better endurance but also a lower risk for metabolic diseases and improved longevity.

Resistance training is strongly linked to the prevention and management of osteoporosis, as well. The mechanical load placed on bones during resistance exercises stimulates bone remodeling and increases bone mineral density (BMD). Numerous studies have shown that resistance training is effective in preventing osteoporosis and reducing the risk for fractures in older adults. While weight-bearing exercises like walking and running are beneficial, resistance training targets areas at high risk for fractures, such as the hips and spine, making it a key intervention for maintaining bone health.

​​Skeletal muscle is also a major regulator of inflammation. During exercise, muscles release myokines, such as interleukin-6, which have anti-inflammatory effects. These myokines help regulate the immune system, improve fat metabolism, and contribute to better metabolic health. This means that beyond strength and mobility, muscle health plays a key role in modulating chronic, low-grade inflammation — a driver of many age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease.

And despite cardio getting all the glory when it comes to heart health, a 2023 study in Sports Medicine revealed that low to moderate load resistance training has been associated with lower rates of adverse cardiovascular complications than aerobic exercise in older adults with cardiovascular disease. In fact, with strength and skeletal muscle independently associated with risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality, researchers posit that resistance training is an important interventional strategy for mitigating cardiovascular risk.

Impressive results in a research setting is one thing. Achieving them in the real world? Way tougher, of course.

Varshavski has some doubts when it comes to the realities of monitoring muscle mass or using it as a vital sign in the same way we use measures like heart rate and blood pressure. “I don't think we have enough evidence to say we have a method to do this well,” he said. “It definitely needs to be incorporated and we perhaps have neglected it at times, but to say that it will be at the forefront of all the things that ail us — I think that's jumping the gun.”

It doesn't need to be the holy grail, but the evaluation of muscle health needs to be an important piece of the puzzle, said Prado. “I think that every healthcare professional has the duty to look into it.” 

More techniques are becoming available from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance, to surrogate assessments such as calf circumference. Even simple questions (“Do you do any form of resistance training?”) or screening tools (like observing patients' mobility) can go a long way to establishing a baseline.

One simple measure is grip strength, using an inexpensive dynamometer to monitor progress over time. Grip strength can be a decent proxy for overall strength, though not muscle mass.

These are imperfect measures and estimates, for sure. “But as my dear colleague Dr Christina Gonzalez likes to say: Instead of taking a picture, we can make a movie,” said Prado. “So even techniques that have some limitations, if we're looking at change over time, some of those limitations will be offset.”

In other words, let's not let perfect be the enemy of good.

Shifting into a more pro-muscle mentality will take time and adherence — both for practitioners and patients. “When you make one change here, it has drastic implications everywhere else,” said Varshavski. “That's why it's important when we're talking with patients about the need for muscle, we talk about how it helps all parts of the body — how it can help them stay independent, help them stay mobile.”

“When it comes to muscle, what's interesting is that we've seen it be a protective factor in aging and in disease prevention (or at least, lower risk evaluation for disease) irrespective if someone perhaps doesn't have a healthy BMI,” he continued. “That sort of paradoxical relationship gets people excited and allows them to listen in.”

It's no secret many physicians don't get into specifics with patients on what they should be doing. One survey showed exercise prescribing rates as low as 17% with 84% of doctors saying they felt inadequately trained in the subject of resistance training. Referrals to other pros with strength training backgrounds, particularly physical therapists, can help. (See also: Medscape's “How to Prescribe Exercise in 5 Steps”).

Schoenfeld's research (he's published more than 300 studies) reveals two key areas that may make strength training more palatable to patients: First, data now shows that using lighter weights can build just as much strength as heavier weights, so long as the lifter pushes to near failure in the last few repetitions (aka “the hard reps.”) So there is no barrier to entry for folks who can't lift, or may be intimidated by heavy weights.

And second: It's never too late to start. In a meta-analysis of adults aged 70 years or older (including nonagenarians), Schoenfeld's team saw profound improvements in muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy within 8- to 12-week training programs. “These were novice trainees who've never done anything before,” he said.

Important caveat: It's always better to start today. Because while you can always improve on where you are at a given point in time, once you start losing, it's harder to get it back.

“The analogy I like to use is having a retirement account,” he said. “Yeah, it's never too late to start, technically. But if you start when you're in your 50s, your retirement isn't going to be what it is if you start in your 20s.”

 June 13, 2025  

Caregivers of terminally ill patients often turn to health professionals to learn what to expect in the final weeks, days, and hours of life. Regardless of the underlying cause, many signs and symptoms are similar during this period.

Addressing families' concerns proactively can ease discomfort and anxiety and help prevent crises that lead to unnecessary ICU admissions. Below are the key topics to discuss with caregivers as death approaches a patient.

Patients spend increasing amounts of time sleeping and may struggle to keep their eyes open because of fatigue and metabolic changes related to the dying process. Families should make the most of the time when the patient is alert, even at night, and avoid waking them.

Restlessness or agitation may arise during periods of wakefulness, making it difficult for patients to return to sleep. These symptoms, which are sometimes associated with mental confusion, may reflect real distress resulting from metabolic changes and the perception of loss of autonomy.

Speaking calmly, acknowledging patients' concerns, and suggesting comfort measures can help. If these steps are ineffective, neuroleptics or sedatives may be prescribed to aid in rest.

As death approaches, patients often become progressively disoriented in terms of time and place, even with regard to close relatives and caregivers. Hallucinations may occur, particularly in long-standing older adults. Patients might report seeing deceased loved ones or describe comforting visions or memories, which can distress families. In these moments, caregivers must not correct or rationalize their experiences. Instead, they should encourage patients to share their feelings and explore their emotional states.

It is common for patients to withdraw socially as their condition worsens. They may lose interest in activities such as reading newspapers, listening to music, watching television, visiting friends, and seeing family. Although difficult to witness, caregivers can offer a gentle and unobtrusive presence by talking softly or simply holding the patient's hand.

Interest in eating and drinking declines gradually and can vary from one day to the next. Patients tend to need less food and liquids in response to metabolic changes during the end-of-life process. At this stage, eating no longer has a nutritional purpose and does not influence energy or prognosis, making meals a gesture of affection. It is recommended to offer only those foods that the patient prefers. Do not force-feed, as it may cause discomfort. Small ice chips or frozen fruit juice pops can soothe the mouth. When swallowing becomes impossible, oral intake should be stopped to avoid aspiration.

Loss of urinary and/or bowel control is common at the end of life and may affect a patient's dignity and comfort. Keep the patient clean by changing soiled clothes and sheets regularly and using diapers or protective clothing to ensure proper hygiene and prevent skin irritation or infections. If a patient cannot urinate, a catheter may be required. Advise caregivers that urine output decreases and darkens as death approaches.

Vision and hearing often decline days and hours before death, sometimes with increased sensitivity to light and sound. Keep the room dim and minimize sudden noise to reduce discomfort and disorientation. Do not assume that the patient cannot hear; hearing is typically the last sense to go.

An increase in temperature is common during the final days and hours. Causes include inflammation from tumors, infections, or metabolic changes. A temperature above 38 °C does not always indicate discomfort or the need for medication. Caregivers can apply a cool, damp cloth to the forehead to help lower the temperature and at the same time feel helpful.

In the hours before death, the skin may redden, become moist, and feel warm if the body temperature rises. Conversely, extremities, such as the hands, arms, feet, and legs, may cool, accompanied by cyanosis and mottling of the skin. Cooling of the body is a natural process that occurs when circulation slows and vital organs begin to stop functioning. Sometimes, the skin on the face takes on a yellowish hue with paleness that is more pronounced around the mouth.

Breathing patterns also change as bodily functions slow. Breaths may become shallow and irregular, and the accessory muscles may engage. The interval between breaths can lengthen, and patients may take several quick, shallow breaths, followed by a long pause. These cycles deepen over time and can be distressing for families.

As consciousness fades, patients lose the ability to swallow or clear their oral secretions. Air passes through these accumulated secretions, resulting in noisy ventilation in approximately half the terminally ill patients. Families and caregivers may find this sound unsettling, fearing the patient is choking. Changing the patient's position or administering medication for dry secretions can reduce, and sometimes relieve, noise.

In drivers with schizophrenia, better adherence to antipsychotic medication is associated with a lower risk for motor vehicle crashes, according to new research.

In a case-crossover study, perfect adherence to antipsychotic medication in drivers with schizophrenia was associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of a crash, relative to complete nonadherence.

Physicians and fitness-to-drive policy makers might consider antipsychotic treatment adherence as a condition for maintaining an active driver's license in these patients, the authors suggest.

The study was published June 9 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. 

“Whether a person is safe to drive is a question that comes up for psychiatrists and physicians like me who look after people when they are in the hospital with a worsening of their schizophrenia,” study author John A. Staples, MD, MPH, clinical associate professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told Medscape Medical News.

“This is particularly important for people who have schizophrenia, because we know schizophrenia impairs their judgment. Often, these individuals have had problems with driving in the past,” Staples said.

The investigators examined population-based administrative health and driving data from British Columbia. They included patients with schizophrenia who were involved as drivers in police-attended motor vehicle crashes from 2001 to 2016. Eligible participants filled prescriptions for antipsychotic medication as outpatients in the 2 years before the crash.

“We have data on all their health issues specific to hospital visits with physicians and medication data, and we also have data on their driving, including crashes and traffic accidents. It's unique that we have both data sets,” Staples noted.

The investigators assessed adherence by looking at how often in the 30 days before their crash these drivers filled prescriptions for their antipsychotic medication. They also examined how often patients filled the prescriptions in a 30-day period 1 year before the crash.

The final sample consisted of 1130 crashes involving 1001 drivers. At the time of the crash, the median age of the drivers was 37 years. Two-thirds of participants were male, 58.1% resided in an urban area, and 84.5% had a driver's license. More than half (54.8%) also had one or more traffic violations in the past 3 years.

About half (49.8%) of all crashes resulted in an injury, and 0.7% resulted in a fatality. Attending police reported that the driver's condition was a contributing factor in 43.5% of the crashes.

“We hope these findings encourage people with schizophrenia to take their antipsychotics,” Staples said. The results should also highlight the need for physicians faced with patients who may not be adherent to think about driving safety. “We don't want there to be a crash where somebody gets hurt, but on the other hand, suspending or canceling somebody's license is a grave blow to independence and the ability to work. That's the difficult tradeoff physicians are often left struggling with. We want to make sure we are making decisions that are justified when we take away the freedom of being able to drive,” Staples said.

Mark Rapoport, MD, professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, told Medscape Medical News that physicians treating patients with schizophrenia should stress the importance of adherence and driving safety.

“This is a very good study that shows the positive outcome of staying on medication. But there is variability among individuals, so it is hard to make a sweeping declaration that everyone must be adherent or they can't drive. To me as a clinician, it comes down to the judgment and insight of the patient. Do they have the wherewithal to realize that they should wait until they take their medication before they get behind the wheel? That they need to take another form of transportation? Some people don't have the ability to do that,” Rapoport said.

“A study like this can't answer those nuanced questions, but it is a good study that shows the very positive outcome of staying on medication,” he said.

“Given the elevated crash risk among those with schizophrenia, this research is valuable in that it provides evidence of the efficacy of antipsychotics in improving a person's safety and well-being as it applies to driving,” Simon B. Sherry, PhD, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, told Medscape Medical News.

“The ability to drive can provide freedom and independence and improve quality of life. Unfortunately, many of the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as disorganized thinking; reduced motivation; trouble with attention, memory, and decision-making; and difficulty with daily activities, can make regularly taking medication more challenging,” Sherry said.

“As a psychologist, I do not prescribe medication, but I can vouch for the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy for managing symptoms. It would be interesting to see future research comparing whether this therapy is also associated with lower crash risk and whether such treatment is equally effective in reducing crash risk as antipsychotic medications,” he said.

The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Staples, Rapoport, and Sherry reported having no relevant financial relationships.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Mark A. Lewis, MD: Hello. I'm Dr Mark Lewis, director of Gastrointestinal Oncology at Intermountain Health in Utah. Joining me today is Dr Stephanie Graff, director of the Breast Oncology Program at Brown University Health's Cancer Institute, and co-leader of the Breast Cancer Translational Research Disease Group. Today, we would like to talk to you about the latest updates from the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting.

Stephanie, it's a true joy to sit down with you. I always look forward to ASCO. I sometimes explain to my patients that it's like the Super Bowl of oncology, and I don't think that's hyperbolic. It's the largest meeting of the year. 

One of the true advantages is getting to network with people like you, but also — I don't know about you — I get a real tangible sense of progress, and I often tell my patients, “Listen, I'm going to go to this meeting. I don't want to over-promise and underdeliver, but I think there's a real chance that I'll bring back something new that might affect your care.” 

There are the big four tumor types in oncology, breast, lung, [gastro intestinal (GI), and genitourinary]. You practice above the diaphragm, and I practice below the diaphragm. As we might talk about in the Venn diagram, I think we overlap. I'm just curious what's exciting you at this meeting? 

Stephanie L. Graff, MD: In breast oncology, there's been a large amount of really exciting news. One of the ASCO plenary sessions, which we haven't heard yet, is SERENA-6, which will be looking at camizestrant with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). That'll be exciting. 

We're getting updates on overall survival with the INAVO120 regimen. We saw this morning that it improved survival, which is great. We also are going to be seeing data looking at trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-positive breast cancer in the first line and then other data looking at targeted therapies for things like PI3 kinase.

Our first oral [abstract] PROTAC, Dr Hamilton presented today, also showed improvement in progression-free survival. Many things like that are exciting and certainly starting to change practice. Pembrolizumab and sacituzumab [are] changing practice in first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. There's so much and it's a really great breast oncology ASCO. 

Lewis: I'm so glad to hear that. There are a couple areas I think that we definitely overlap. I'm curious to get your thoughts on ctDNA. My sense as a GI oncologist is that it is a very prognostic biomarker, but it is not always demonstrably predictive. 

My real reservation in using it, to be honest with you, is: Number one, I don't think it entirely supplants our traditional clinical pathologic understanding. For instance, as a GI oncologist, if I think someone has high-risk stage III colon cancer and their initial postoperative ctDNA is negative, I'm not entirely going to abandon my approach to their adjuvant therapy.

Also thinking about it as a patient, we're sometimes telling these people that they have literal subclinical disease. You can make the argument, “Well, why wait until cells aggregate to the point that you can see them as an actual tumor on a scan?” 

On the other hand, I worry sometimes about the psychological impact of ctDNA. As you said, we'll hear about SERENA-6 tomorrow. I think that's a really interesting study in the sense of letting patients be aware of emerging ESR1 mutations that are conferring resistance to aromatase inhibition. I'll be really curious to see the outcome of that study and whether that's a meaningful change for the patient, because I think we sometimes actually underestimate the psychological weight. 

Graff: It's interesting. In breast oncology, we've benefited from a wealth of patient advocacy, driving a wealth of progress, funding, and advancing science, which has been really beneficial in our field. We actually have done research looking at how the psychological impact affects how patients handle disease. I think that, historically, you can imagine a time in medicine when people thought, “Oh, those sweet little girls, we shouldn't weigh them down with the worry about cancer.” That has borne out to not be true.

When we think about telling people the results of a mammogram that needs additional imaging or biopsy, or that they have dense breast tissue or that their mammogram needs additional follow-up in 6 months, none of those things actually increase or decrease a patient's worry. 

Lewis: Interesting. 

Graff: What helps is just open and honest communication. I think what's more important is that we empower physicians and oncologists with the tools to actually understand what these tests mean and how to communicate effectively with patients about them. I think patients are going to be worrying about the fact that they have cancer.

Good test or bad test, that patient knows the next test might not be the same. Good test or bad test, their cancer could have a different outcome down the roadway. They're going to worry. I don't have cancer and I worry. I worry about my kids. I worry about my house. I worry about the weather. We all worry. I think that just having the tools to explain what's going on is probably the most powerful thing that we can do. 

Lewis: That is such a wonderful anecdote to literal and figurative paternalism, and you're absolutely right. We already have these points of apprehension in patient care and diagnostics, and I think ctDNA potentially adds to that, but we can use the same methods of counseling that we've used for all these other tools. That's so well said. 

I also wanted to tell you — and I really, really mean this — that I view breast medical oncology as aspirational for the rest of solid tumor oncology. When you were mentioning trastuzumab deruxtecan earlier, one of my most vivid memories from ASCO meetings of any year was the plenary session where DESTINY-Breast04 was presented.

I remember being part of the standing ovation for that trial, even though I don't treat breast cancer anymore, because I thought, “Wow, we are really making progress in biomarker-driven care.” The other reason I view you as aspirational is we are not yet at that standard in GI oncology, at least, where it's a foregone conclusion that we would know all the biomarkers that we need to know.

One of the interesting conversations I have with patients now is on pathologists as our silent, or at least unseen, partners. I think you would agree that you would almost never treat a patient with metastatic disease without knowing ER, PR, and HER2 status. 

Meanwhile, over in GI oncology, I'm sometimes having to ask for these things to be done that would be relevant to my patients, say KRAS mutations or BRAF mutations. To me, it seems like it should be as reflexive for me as it is for you as a breast cancer oncologist. 

What I'm getting at here, too, is this is back to how we have conversations with patients. I think patients need to understand, again, that biomarkers are a huge part of how we personalize their care, even though they might never actually meet their pathologists.

Again, I just wanted to tell you, because I don't often get to sit with you, that the way that breast cancer oncologists — and to your own point, patient advocates — have kind of pushed things forward, it's a rising tide that lifts all boats. I often use your field as an example of where we should be.

Graff: It's ironic because I have maybe the opposite perspective. As a breast oncologist, I feel like, here we are in 2025 with all these amazing genomic ctDNA and RNA assays, and we're still using ER, PR, and HER2, which is — spoiler alert — literally dumping ink on slides, right? It's immunohistochemistry. 

Our thoracic oncology colleagues are using true genomic-driven care to look at ROS1, EGFR, and all these different things to say, based on this profile, this is what you're going to get. We're like, well, we have to wait for that ER to come back. I'm a little bit jealous that some fields have more genomic-driven care than breast does, but you're right. Breast was definitely a pioneer in biomarkers. 

DESTINY-Breast04 is an interesting example because, if anything, it shows that the biomarker doesn't matter, right? Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2 antibody, and as it turns out, it works great for HER2-positive disease, but it also works great for HER2 not-so-positive disease.

DESTINY-Breast06 now includes ultra-low, which is zero with just a little bit of fuzzy in the background. We're seeing that maybe we're not getting our biomarkers right after all. 

Lewis: So well said. I remember thinking about the effect in ultra-low and thinking, man, how strong is this bystander effect? If the chemo payload is being delivered to barely present HER2 receptors, it must be really potent indeed. 

I often think that we're actually putting a large amount of credence in what our pathologists tell us. For instance, like you said, immunohistochemistry is very qualitative, sort of semi-quantitative. Again, with things like PD-L1, it's funny how we all have sour grapes to other tumor types. 

Thinking about continuous variables, we can always debate the appropriate cutoff. Pathologists have actually warned us at this very meeting. I remember Anirban Maitra standing up and saying, “Listen, you guys need to realize, as pathologists, the number that we give you for PD-L1 expression, for instance, that's our impression on that day, on that slide. You really shouldn't take it to be gospel truth.” Again, I think we're still finding our way with that. 

Graff: We've seen, in breast oncology, a presentation at this meeting looking at if that's the forefront for AI, right? Is that where artificial intelligence is going to be able to augment our ability, because again, we heard in the opening session that AI should be a tool that is an agent to advance human skills. 

If AI can help augment the eye of the pathologist, enhance the skills of the microscope, and move HER2 zero to HER2 ultra-low with more accuracy than the naked eye or more robustly in global centers where access to those stains aren't as readily available, then AI is advancing care for everyone equitably around the globe: the same global population that's participating in these trials and bringing them to our patient population. 

Back to biomarker-driven care, I think it just comes back down to patient communication. All of these tests take time. Even in breast oncology, sometimes my patients have to wait. They have to wait for ESR1. It's a mechanism of resistance. I don't have it until their disease progresses and I can send that test out.

That means that sometimes they have to have some patience while we wait and make sure that they're a candidate for the right therapy at the right time. That requires partnership with a bunch of people on my team. The staff that draw the blood and the mail room staff that ship it out to the right team. I'm so thankful that I have a huge wealth of people that make the cancer center work.

Lewis: So well said. I often tell my patients that oncology is a team sport. 

Graff: Yes. 

Lewis: I think the last thing I wanted to say is that you and I have talked a little bit about the pace of progress as a wonderful problem to have. I'm curious, [going] off your comment about sort of global equity, how do you feel like that plays out in sort of clinical trial design?

Graff: The breast oncology community discussed this today as some data were revealed. An interesting problem that we're starting to have in breast cancer is the rapidity of new agents relative to the rapidity of trial accrual. This means that, if it takes a year to design a trial and get regulatory approval, and then another year to accrue and then another year to read out results, by then there have been 27 new drugs added, right? I think we had 25 regulatory approvals last year in the US, or something like that, in oncology. 

Whatever the standard-of-care control arm was in the study 3 years ago when that trial was designed is laughable. I'm going to use the example of second-line HR-positive breast cancer. We have two problems. Problem number one is that the standard control arm is fulvestrant. When many of these trials were accruing in 2020 and 2021, that was the standard of care. 

Now, we have ESR1-targeting agents. We have PI3 kinase-targeting agents. We have data that extending a CDK4/6 inhibitor is efficacious. We have evidence for earlier trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients that maybe aren't so endocrine sensitive. We can always extend everolimus into that space. There's all this other stuff, including oral SERDs. There are so many different directions we can go. I don't even remember what all I've listed [to] at this point.

We're getting the next generation of medicine, but they're still being compared to fulvestrant. 

Lewis: Right.

Graff: We're looking at these results, saying, “Well, great, you beat that drug we used back in the late 1900s.” 

Lewis: Right. Yes. 

Graff: Now, I think that another problem is that global angle, which is that not all of those new drugs, although almost all of these trials are global trials, they're accruing these from international countries. Not all of the regulatory agencies have approved them internationally. Not all of the payers have approved them internationally because they meet different benchmarks around the globe.

Lewis: Yes. 

Graff: That standard-of-care arm isn't available as we advance. Again, trial design gets complicated because if we want the control arm to be the US standard of care, and that's different than the German standard of care, the Indian standard of care, the Kenyan standard of care, or the Argentinian standard of care; then we have to make sure that they're connected with that standard of care. We have to make sure that they're comfortable delivering that standard of care and figure out what that really looks like. 

Lewis: I think where I completely agree with you is you have to walk before you can run. It's really exciting to see the sophisticated assays like ctDNA, but I'm sitting here thinking, based on your comments, I can't even guarantee that I'll have mismatch repair protein status in my patients with colon cancer. 

Again, we have to take this in a stepwise fashion. You're right that, for all the excitement that we understandably and should feel at meetings like this, we do have to temper our enthusiasm a little bit and be practical in the real world. 

I have to say, Stephanie, it's just a delight to sit with you. I think you really are a true exemplar of shared decision making. Again, it really, at the end of the day, doesn't come down to the primary site. Yes, you're a breast oncologist. Yes, I'm a GI oncologist. A rising tide lifts all boats, and I think, as we also heard this morning, there's a difference between irrational exuberance and unjustified optimism, and then there's legitimate hope. At least what I feel at these meetings, and I strongly suspect you do too, is legitimate hope for our patients.

Graff: I agree. 

Lewis: With that, we'll close. Again, thank you for joining us. We hope this was a helpful summary of what we've been hearing today at the ASCO 2025 Annual Meeting. Thank you.","{'href': 'http://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Adding nivolumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival among patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to findings from a phase 3 trial presented at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. The survival benefit was more pronounced in patients who achieved a pathologic complete response or a presurgery clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

“In this trial, we found that the use of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone, along with long-term benefit regarding event-free survival,” the authors wrote. “These findings support the hypothesis that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy can have a profound impact on the course of a patient's life when paired with the curative potential of surgical resection.”

This study, led by Patrick M. Forde, MB, BCh, PhD, Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, was published online in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ASCO.

Although the overall survival with nivolumab plus chemotherapy achieved statistical significance, the margin was narrow. Additionally, several subgroups in the exploratory analyses were too small for adequate statistical comparison, requiring cautious interpretation of these results. Black patients were underrepresented, which may have affected the generalizability of the findings.

This study was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb. Five authors declared being employees of Bristol Myers Squibb, with some holding stock or stock options with the company. Several authors declared working as consultants or having other ties with various sources including Bristol Myers Squibb.

MILAN — Immune-based treatments continue to fall short in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Now, experts from the European Hematology Association's (EHA) Specialized Working Group on MDS here at the EHA 2025 Congress are reevaluating their core strategies, from clinical trial endpoints to patient selection and timing.

The researchers are suggesting the need for a shift in how these therapies are developed and deployed, as new data suggests that current benchmarks might be missing meaningful responses and that immune dysfunction in MDS can evolve over time.

MDS are a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid stem and progenitor cell disorders marked by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Immune dysregulation is thought to be a key driver in MDS pathogenesis, raising hopes that modulating immune responses within the bone marrow niche could alter disease trajectory. Yet, despite numerous attempts, immune-based interventions have largely failed to yield meaningful clinical results.

Currently, few therapies targeting inflammation and immune activation are approved for MDS — namely antithymocyte globulin, with or without cyclosporine A, lenalidomide, and luspatercept. 

However, a growing list of investigational agents is under study, including cytokine inhibitors, signaling pathway inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific and trispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor cell-based therapies.

Anne Sophie Kubasch, MD, a hematologist at the University Medical Hospital Leipzig, Germany, presented preliminary findings from two trials by the German MDS Study Group: the phase 2 CANFIRE trial of the IL-1Beta inhibitor canakinumab and the LUCAS trial of the IRAK4 inhibitor emavusertib. 

The CANFIRE trial enrolled 11 patients treated for 6 months, while LUCAS included 36 patients treated for 4 months. Both studies failed to meet their primary endpoint, hematologic improvement in erythroid cells per International Working Group (IWG) 2018 criteria, by the end of the treatment period.

Despite this, Kubasch noted that several patients opted to continue treatment due to perceived clinical benefit, such as reduced fatigue or general improvement. Some also showed biomarker changes or delayed hematologic responses. These findings led her to question whether hematologic improvement in erythroid cells is the most appropriate efficacy endpoint for immunomodulatory agents.

“We can argue that current IWG endpoint criteria are too rigid for immune modulation trials,” she said. “Late or gradual responses may go undetected.” 

Kubasch suggested that future trials should incorporate patient-reported outcomes and quality-of-life metrics as co-primary endpoints. “We may focus on composite endpoints combining various parameters, such as hematologic trends, biomarker shifts, molecular remission or stability, and, of course, patient-reported benefits.”

A second key question, Kubasch said, is whether the right patients are being selected for immunotherapy. She cited a recent transcriptomic analysis of bone marrow CD34+ cells from 183 MDS patients that identified two immune subtypes based on the expression of six genes — including IRAK4, the target of emavusertib. These subtypes were called hyperactive (HIC) and moderate (MIC) immune clusters. The HIC group had greater activation of immune-related pathways and higher infiltration of natural killer cells and M1 macrophages.

“We might be treating the wrong immune subgroup with immunomodulators,” she said, hypothesizing that it's possible that only MIC patients were being enrolled in their trials, contributing to negative results.

She proposed a stepwise stratification approach:

“Selective inclusion of patients with immune activation, such as those with an HIC profile, is essential,” she concluded.

Valeria Santini, MD, associate professor of hematology at the University of Florence Medical School, Italy, focused her remarks on immunosuppressive therapy, a long-used but inconsistently effective strategy in MDS.

To re-evaluate its role, Santini reviewed older literature — what she called “archaeological digging.” She showed that complete responses and survival benefits are achievable in some patients, albeit rarely.

Importantly, she emphasized that immune dysfunction in MDS is dynamic. “It changes during the course of the disease,” she said. Therefore, precise immune profiling at both the subtype and patient level is needed. Optimization of immunosuppressive therapy is hampered by the lack of prospective randomized trials, heterogeneity in study populations, poor characterization of immune abnormalities, and the need for integration with novel agents. “It is not one cure for all,” she said. “By selecting patients, we might be more successful than in the past.”

Lionel Adès, MD, PhD, professor of hematology at Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France, commented to Medscape Medical News that, while the biological rationale for immune modulation is strong, clinical evidence remains weak.

“Maybe we don't have the right drugs or combinations. Maybe we're using them too late in the disease course,” he said. Immune dysregulation might play a role early in MDS, but by the time patients are treated, it could be too late to alter the disease with immune-targeted agents.

Moreover, Adès noted that immune therapies often require extended treatment periods before activity can be detected, while traditional MDS trial endpoints focus on earlier timepoints. “If a drug appears completely ineffective, it's not ethical to keep a patient on trial for a year just to see if something happens,” he said.

Still, he remains cautiously optimistic. He pointed to the EHA-sponsored i4MDS Consortium, which aims to deepen understanding of MDS immunobiology, and to data from the STIMULUS MDS 2 study presented during the session by Amer Zeidan, MBBS, MHS, of Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. That study evaluated the TIM-3 immune checkpoint inhibitor sabatolimab plus azacitidine as a first-line therapy in MDS. Although the trial failed to show a survival advantage overall, subgroup analysis revealed a benefit among female patients.

“This is something very interesting,” Adès said. “It's something we didn't look at before, because we never thought survival could differ between male and female MDS patients.” While sabatolimab development has since been discontinued, other agents targeting the same pathway remain in the pipeline. “This finding could be valuable for stratifying future trials by sex,” he said.

Kubasch reported relationships with BMS, Curis, Jazz, Johnson & Johnson, and Novartis. Santini reported serving on advisory boards for AbbVie, Ascentage, BMS, Geron, GSK, Keros, Novartis, Servier, and Takeda. Adès disclosed research support from BMS/Celgene and AbbVie, and advisory roles with AbbVie, Amgen, BMS, Jazz, Novartis, Roche, and Takeda.

A missense variant in WNT10A detected by a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) suggested that drug-development efforts should target hair follicle biology, said the authors of a recent letter responding to the study. Increasing providers' and patients' knowledge about the genetic underpinnings of HS also could help reduce stigma around the disease, an expert told Medscape Dermatology.

The GWAS meta-analysis, published online on December 5, 2024, in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), included 4814 HS cases and 1.2 million control patients. RNA sequencing and other tools enabled authors led by Rune Kjærsgaard Andersen, MD, PhD, of the Department of Dermatology, Zealand University Hospital in Roskilde, Denmark, to identify eight independent HS-associated variants, including four previously unreported variants that all mapped to signaling pathways crucial in epidermal keratinization. Ultimately, the authors highlighted rs121908120-A, a missense variant in the WNT10A pathway, as protective against HS.

The discovery of rs121908120-A is notable, wrote authors led by Olivia D. Perez, MD, of the Department of Dermatology, New York University School of Medicine in New York City, because of its clinical implications derived from previously reported disease associations at the WNT10A locus.

A 2023 British Journal of Dermatology publication showed that the rs121908120-A variant is elevated in patients with hair miniaturization disorders. Because the clinical effects of WNT10A deficiency on hair have been validated in a mouse model, added Perez and colleagues, “a shortened hair follicle growth phase could be protective of HS, which has clinical implications for HS trials.” Their letter was published in the JAAD Notes and Comments section on May 5, 2025.

In the absence of functional genomic studies elucidating the mechanism(s) of the WNT10A pathway in HS, Perez and coauthors used data from a study published in Immunity in 2024 to investigate where this gene is expressed in lesional skin. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that WNT10A is expressed in keratinocytes, including hair follicle infundibulum, proliferative cells, basal cells, and immune cells, including regulatory T cells. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed that WNT10A is expressed in both surface and tunnel epithelium, along with the immune cell-rich dermis of HS lesions. The latter findings suggest potential WNT10A involvement in immune responses and augment its known roles in follicular biology, wrote Perez and colleagues.

With few treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for HS, trials to date largely have attempted to repurpose existing drugs that target the inflammatory cascade. Conversely, Perez and colleagues wrote that the GWAS findings highlighted the potential of targeting hair follicle biology and that a shorter follicular growth phase may explain the success of laser hair removal in HS management.

Lasers appeared to address HS through ablation rather than targeting any specific cytokine or gene, Christopher Sayed, MD, professor of dermatology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said in an interview. “If the initial event in disease development is centered on the hair follicle, then reducing the number of follicles present should help slow down the development of new lesions and progression.” He was not involved with JAAD studies but was asked to comment.

More broadly, Sayed said, Perez and colleagues' paper resonates with prior research, including a study published in JAMA Dermatology in 2023 that he co-authored, all suggesting that HS involves follicular dysregulation that probably also affects processes such as wound healing and inflammatory responses. “That's potentially another thread that we should be pulling on, beyond the inflammatory process, when it comes to treatment, to see if there's a way to improve how the follicles differentiate and how the chronic wounds in HS could perhaps be coaxed into healing better,” he said.

Perez and colleagues' findings also could counter the long-standing misconception that HS stems largely from modifiable factors such as hygiene issues, infection, or obesity, Sayed noted. “There's a very strong genetic correlation, and multiple genes now implicated have to do with follicular regulation and epidermal differentiation,” he explained. “While environmental factors may play a role, it's probably a much smaller role than people used to think.”

As with other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, said Sayed, probably the biggest HS risk factor is heredity. “So, when we talk to patients and the public about hidradenitis suppurativa, we can describe it as a chronic inflammatory condition with a strong genetic component — rather than something where there should be blame and stigma placed on patients.”

Regarding new therapeutics, Sayed said he is unaware of any HS drugs in development that specifically target hair follicle biology. “It's an area that has just started to come into focus over the last couple of years as genome-wide association studies have highlighted a role for these pathways that are intertwined with inflammatory processes and wound healing.”

Regardless of what triggers HS, he added, the process results in inflammation, which is the target of many drugs in HS trials. “As we understand hidradenitis suppurativa and how pathways around epidermal and follicular differentiation are dysregulated,” Sayed said, “it will hopefully present opportunities for more deliberate drug development.”

The letter authors reported funding from the National Institutes of Health, Sanofi-Aventis US, and the Irma T. Hirschl Charitable Trust. These authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest. GWAS authors reported financial relationships with more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, LEO Pharma, Novartis, and others. Additionally, several of these authors are employees of deCODE genetics/Amgen. Sayed reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

In a first in-human study, KITE-363, an anti-CD19/CD20 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, showed high rates of response in patients with highly refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The bicistronic, autologous CAR T-cell therapy, designed to prevent CD19 escape through the upfront targeting of CD19 and CD20, also showed an encouraging safety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities.

“KITE-363 demonstrated high responses in patients with highly refractory LBCL, including those with primary refractory disease,” said first author Saurabh Dahiya, MD, of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in Stanford, California. “We observed no grade 3 or 4 CRS or ICANS in this study, which is a sharp contrast to the current FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies,” he said.

“Taken together, these results support KITE-363 as a promising therapeutic approach for patients with R/R [relapsed or refractory] B-cell lymphoma, including those with highly refractory LBCL,” Dahiya added. “Given the promising early results and specifically robust CAR T expansion and good safety profile, KITE-363 is now being developed for the treatment of autoimmune conditions.”

This study was presented in Chicago at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025.

COMMENTARY

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthors

Interviewee: Eric Kania, MD
Psychiatrist, Baumettes Prison, Marseille, France
Disclosure: Eric Kania, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

 |  June 13, 2025  

Disclosure: Eric Kania, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Eric Kania, MD, who has been a psychiatrist at Baumettes Prison in Marseille, France, for 25 years, has witnessed an increasing proportion of inmates being treated for psychiatric disorders.

In an interview with Medscape's French edition, he explains how care teams are organizing treatment in often overcrowded prisons and describes the special monitoring implemented for inmates at highest risk for suicide.

How did you become a prison physician?

I studied medicine in Marseille and specialized in psychiatry. During my residency, I completed a 6-month internship at Baumettes Prison, which greatly interested me. After completing my thesis and working in hospitals, I returned to the prison because I wanted to continue this work. I now work half-time at Baumettes and half-time in private practice.

Why this attraction to prison work?

Prison is a place that requires dedication. It sits at the confluence of multiple issues: social, sociologic, medical, and judicial. I'm particularly interested in the criminal responsibility of offenders with psychiatric disorders. Like many of my colleagues, I've read the work of Michel Foucault — particularly his 1975 book Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison (Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison) — which helped shape my thinking around justice, mental illness, and social structures. These reflections played a significant role in my decision to work in the prison system.

How are psychiatric services organized at Baumettes?

We are a team of seven psychiatrists — some of us, like myself, working part-time. We collaborate with a nursing team of eight for level 1 psychiatric care, and a second team handles level 2 care.

Baumettes is a very old facility, originally opened in 1930, and it has housed a regional medico-psychological service since 1980. Today, we provide psychiatric care for more than 1000 inmates. The renovated section of Baumettes, which opened in 2017, was designed to accommodate 580 men and 200 women. However, overcrowding became an issue almost immediately. Although the cells were intended for single occupancy, additional fold-out beds had to be added owing to limited space. The older part of the facility previously held up to 2000 inmates in a space built for 1300.

Currently, two detention buildings are in use, and three more are under construction, expected to open within 1-2 years. In the long term, the total capacity at Baumettes will once again double. Although we hope this will help relieve overcrowding, experience has shown that any new space tends to fill up very quickly.

What are the main psychiatric disorders among inmates?

There is an overrepresentation of psychiatric disorders in prisons. Epidemiologic studies show five to eight times more severe psychiatric disorders (bipolar disorder or schizophrenia) among inmates than in the general population. We also manage more common pathologies, such as depression and anxiety. Sometimes, people with no prior psychiatric history develop anxiety reactions owing to the prison environment.

Do you have enough resources to care for everyone?

Resource availability is a complex issue. It's reasonable to assume that there aren't enough mental health professionals working in prisons. This shortage was one of the reasons behind the creation of specially adapted hospital units, located within public health facilities, to provide care for incarcerated individuals. These units represented real progress, but they also had an unintended consequence: The more mental health staff we place in prisons, the more it appears that mental illness is prevalent in these settings.

Is this a reality?

The reality is that society, the justice system, and law enforcement are now more likely to send individuals with mental illness to prison, partly because they know that mental health professionals are available there to manage them. I've been practicing in prison since 2000. In the past, it was rare to see a person with schizophrenia incarcerated after committing an offense during an escape from a psychiatric hospital. Today, that scenario has become unfortunately common. Psychiatric patients are being sent to prison because understaffed hospitals are increasingly unwilling, or unable, to take them back.

Should we conclude that France's psychiatric crisis is increasing the prison population?

Penrose's law, named after an English psychiatrist, suggests that in several countries, reductions in psychiatric hospital beds have been associated with increases in the prison population. In France, the decrease in psychiatric inpatient capacity has coincided with a rise in both overall incarceration rates and the number of inmates with psychiatric disorders. Although correlation does not imply causation, the pattern is worth considering. Of course, other factors may also contribute to the growing number of individuals with mental illness in prison.

What are those factors?

Many believe that the 1994 reform of the French Penal Code, which introduced the concept of partial criminal responsibility, contributed to an increase in the number of mentally ill individuals in prison. Previously, under the 1810 Penal Code, a person deemed to be in a state of insanity was exempt from criminal responsibility and was transferred to a psychiatric hospital. The 1994 reform amended this principle, specifying that individuals whose judgment is impaired, but not completely abolished, by mental illness can still be held criminally liable. This change led to convictions that might not have occurred under the previous legal framework. Sociologist Caroline Protais has shown that the number of rulings of criminal irresponsibility has decreased since the reform.

Another policy that has significantly contributed to the increase in mentally ill inmates is comparution immédiate (immediate appearance), a legal procedure introduced in 1983 and strengthened in the mid-2000s under then-Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. This fast-track process has been a major driver of prison overcrowding, particularly among individuals with serious psychiatric disorders that often go unrecognized at the time of sentencing. By the time their condition is identified in prison, the sentence has already been handed down, making transfer to a psychiatric facility no longer possible.

How are inmates cared for? Can a patient request to see you? Are there mandatory check-ups?

Every inmate undergoes a medical consultation upon arrival, typically with a general practitioner. If needed — whether due to existing psychiatric care or observed concerns — they are referred the same day for a psychiatric evaluation. If we identify signs of “carceral shock” (a psychological reaction to incarceration) during this initial assessment, we schedule follow-up and initiate appropriate care. Additionally, if an inmate requests to see a psychiatrist or psychologist at any point during their incarceration, or if someone in their environment alerts us to an urgent situation, we make arrangements to see the patient promptly.

What are your main concerns? Are inmates treated differently than other patients?

The context for providing care in prison is very specific, and we have to account for that. Inmates often reach out to us because the prison environment intensifies their psychological distress. At times, we need to coordinate with the prison administration to adjust detention conditions, even though that falls outside our formal responsibilities. If an inmate expresses suicidal thoughts, we inform the administration so that special monitoring can be implemented. At night, correctional officers check through the cell's observation window to ensure the inmate is safe. Every 2 weeks, a multidisciplinary committee reviews the cases of these at-risk individuals.

How far does this special monitoring go?

If inmates are at high risk for suicide or attempt to hang themselves during the night, the prison administration may transfer them to the emergency department. They can also place the individual in an “emergency protection cell” designed to ensure safety until appropriate care can be arranged. These cells are smooth and free of any anchor points. In many cases, an emergency protection system is also activated, which consists of making the prisoner wear a tear-away gown to avoid any risk for hanging. The following morning, the inmate is seen by the regional medico-psychological service, which determines — based on clinical assessment — whether hospitalization is required.

A recent study by the penitentiary administration shows rising suicide rates among inmates. Are you concerned?

We have always been concerned about this issue. There have been several suicides at Baumettes in recent years; some involved patients we were actively treating, while others were unknown to us. Each case is a tragedy. Importantly, suicides are not limited to individuals who previously expressed distress; many had no diagnosed psychiatric illness. In some cases, the act may have been a way to protest or attempt to change detention conditions. Fortunately, not all suicide attempts result in death.

Psychiatric care for the approximately 80,000 incarcerated individuals in France is organized into a three-tiered system. Level 1 care is available in all 187 prisons across the country and provides outpatient psychiatric services. Inmates leave their cells to attend appointments in the prison's health unit, where they may be seen by a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, and, when appropriate, a social worker or educator.

When level 1 care is insufficient owing to the severity of the condition, inmates can access level 2 care through day hospitals. Twenty-six prisons are equipped with both level 1 and level 2 services, including a day hospital as part of the regional medico-psychological service.

If level 2 care is still inadequate — typically when a patient is highly unstable — they may be transferred to level 3 care, which involves full-time inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. This may occur in a nearby psychiatric hospital when the patient is experiencing an acute emergency, such as a psychotic episode or suicidal crisis.

The inmate may remain hospitalized for several days and can be admitted to one of the nine specially adapted hospital units located in Lyon, Nancy, Toulouse, Villejuif, Lille, Rennes, Orléans, Bordeaux, and Marseille. These units accept inmates under voluntary or compulsory care, based on a decision by a state representative when the patient is deemed incapable of providing informed consent. These secure facilities — equipped with video surveillance, barbed wire, and security checkpoints — are dedicated healthcare environments. Prison staff only intervene in cases of agitation or violence; otherwise, all care is provided exclusively by medical professionals.

The population across developed countries is getting older and the associated frailty and debilitation are becoming major health problems. This gradual muscle loss is accelerated by the poor capacity to repair damage and injury, especially after falls or surgeries.

Low muscle mass in the elderly - known as sarcopenia - leads to increased frailty and movement problems. Patients with sarcopenia are more likely to be hospitalized and develop other comorbidities, largely due to falls and fractures that tend to create health declines that quickly spiral out of control.

We knew that a major contributor is the muscle stem cells that are needed to repair muscle damage. They become dysfunctional with age. We've been trying to understand how aged stem cells are different from young and how to reverse these changes.""

Yu Xin (Will) Wang, PhD, assistant professor in the Center for Cardiovascular and Muscle Diseases, Center for Data Sciences, and Cancer Metabolism and Microenvironment Program at Sanford Burnham Prebys

Wang and colleagues at Stanford University published findings June 12, 2025, in Cell Stem Cell demonstrating the effectiveness of treating aged mice with a naturally occurring lipid, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which improved regeneration and strength of aged muscle. The research team also detailed how this therapy worked, showing that it counteracts molecular changes that occur with stem cell aging.

The scientists began by examining the effects of PGE2 and its receptor EP4. Their prior research had established that PGE2 signals during muscle injury trigger muscle stem cells to regenerate the muscles of young mice.

In aged mice, the team found that EP4 expression on aged muscle stem cells are either lacking or reduced by half of those found in young stem cells.

""PGE2 levels in muscle also decline with age, so we see blunted signaling from reductions in both the messenger and receiver,"" said Wang. ""PGE2 is an alarm clock to wake up the stem cells and repair the damage. Aging essentially reduces the volume of the alarm and the stem cells have also put on ear plugs.""

It is possible, however, to overcome the effects of aging and reset the intensity of this cellular siren. Wang and his collaborators gave a stable form of PGE2 to aged mice after muscle injury and in conjunction with exercise. The treated mice gained more muscle mass and were stronger compared to untreated ones.

""What amazes me most is that a single dose of treatment is sufficient to restore muscle stem cell function, and that the benefit lasts far beyond the duration of the drug,"" said Wang. ""In addition to making new muscle, the stem cells stay in the tissue, where they sustain the effect of the PGE2 and instill the muscle with further capacity to regenerate.""

The study revealed that PGE2 treatment restores stem cell function by modulating the activity of key transcription factors which reversed many of the age-related changes that the researchers observed.

""The genes that are upregulated during the aging process are downregulated after treatment, and vice versa,"" Wang said.

In addition to continuing to uncover how to regenerate muscle and prevent sarcopenia and its associated health risks, Wang and his collaborators plan to widen their scope beyond muscle.

""The evidence suggests that PGE2 is not just acting on one mechanism,"" said Wang. ""We've previously shown that PGE2 can also benefit the muscle fiber, and neurons that innervate the muscle. PGE2 has been implicated in the regenerative process and signaling for the intestine, liver, and several other tissues, potentially opening up an approach that could restore the renewing capacity of other aged tissues.

""The ultimate goal is to improve people's quality of life by reversing the effects of aging.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New data reveals insights into cancer and cardiovascular safety of JAK inhibitors","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250612/New-data-reveals-insights-into-cancer-and-cardiovascular-safety-of-JAK-inhibitors.aspx","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 03:14:00 GMT","

Now, the work presented at the 2025 annual EULAR congress in Barcelona adds two important pieces to the puzzle. First, a large-scale real-world study reporting no significantly higher risk of cancer in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to bDMARDs, and second an abstract looking at whether the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) which are causing waves in many fields including diabetes and obesity might offer cardiovascular protection in RA. 

Romain Aymon and colleagues set out to assess the cancer incidence in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD), using data from 13 registers. Cancers were linked to treatments within 5 years of cessation or until follow-up loss, death, or study end, whichever came first. Overall they identified 53,169 treatment initiations in 33,127 patients; 219 non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) were reported, plus 638 non-NMSC cancers. The crude incidence of non-NMSC cancer was lower for TNFi than both JAKi and bDMARDs with other mechanism of action (OMA), with rates of 2.2, 2.9, and 3.1 per 1000 patient-years. But further statistical analysis found no significant difference in the incidence of either cancer type between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA. 

A sub-analysis was performed on patients aged 50 and older who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor – mimicking the inclusion criteria from ORAL Surveillance. This high-risk cohort made up 39.4% of treatment courses, and showed a higher cancer incidence in each treatment group: 3.2, 4.2, and 4.1 per 1000 patient-years for TNFi, JAKi, and OMA, respectively. But similarly to the overall population, there was no significant difference in the incidence of either cancer type between JAKi and either bDMARD group. 

The authors note that further analyses are planned, including additional registries to enhance statistical power and that they will evaluate the cancer incidence across different exposure periods – but in the meantime the findings look reassuring. 

Of note, the incidence of keratinocyte cancer – largely comprised of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma – is increasing in the general population. This could be due to UV light, but immune alteration has also been linked to increased risk – including in people with RA, but largely with data from the pre-biologic era. New work has set out to assess the risk of keratinocyte cancer in modern RA patients initiating treatment with b/tsDMARDs, including the risk of a second keratinocyte cancer. 21,121 people were identified from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register. Overall, 94 keratinocyte cancers were identified in people starting a JAKi, 407 with OMA, and 628 with a TNFi. When compared to TNFi, the hazard ratio for a keratinocyte cancer was 1.72 with JAKi and 0.81 with OMA, Among RA patients with a history of keratinocyte cancers, the hazard ratio for a second diagnosis was 2.76 for JAKi versus TNFi, and 1.54 for OMA versus TNFi. 

Presenting the work, Viking Huss said ""these findings suggest that people with RA treated with a JAKi have a higher incidence of a first keratinocyte cancer, primarily driven by basal cell carcinoma. Additionally – although based on a limited number of events – we saw a higher incidence of a second cancer of this type with JAKi compared to TNFi."" 

These findings support the notion that skin examination would be beneficial in this population, and skin cancer risks with JAKi treatment should be monitored. 

It is well-known that as well as increased cancer risks, people with RA are prone to cardiovascular complications, and in ORAL Surveillance JAKi were associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Conversely, GLP-1RA have demonstrated possible cardioprotective effects in other patient populations, with some agents now specifically approved for reducing cardiovascular risk. 

Asmaa Beltagy presented findings from a retrospective analysis of two cohorts of RA patients over the age of 40. All 2,449 patients were on JAKi, but one group subsequently initiated GLP-1RA, while the other group did not. The work assessed primary outcomes occurring within 5 years, including the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, cerebral infarction, acute peripheral arterial thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, and overall arterial events. 

The results show that patients taking a GLP-1RA had a significantly lower risk of acute coronary syndromes and deep venous thrombosis, with a trend towards a lower risk of acute cerebral infarction and peripheral arterial disease events, although the difference was not statistically significant. The overall incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly lower in GLP-1RA group. A survival analysis showed comparable probabilities between the two groups for all studied outcomes, with no significant difference in median survival. 

These findings underscore the potential of GLP-1RA to reduce certain CV risks in people with RA being treated with JAKi. However, not all effects were significant, and there remains a need for further research to validate the results.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","CDC staffing upheaval disrupts HIV projects and wastes money, researchers say","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250613/CDC-staffing-upheaval-disrupts-HIV-projects-and-wastes-money-researchers-say.aspx","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:52:00 GMT","

Dozens of HIV experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received emails on Wednesday revoking notices they received 10 weeks ago that laid them off. Damage to their projects may be permanent, however, and ongoing restrictions on their research will harm lives, multiple HIV scientists at the CDC told KFF Health News on condition of anonymity because of fears of retaliation.

The researchers were laid off in early April, just before they put the finishing touches on in-depth, national surveys about HIV. Health officials across the country had interviewed tens of thousands of people at risk of acquiring HIV, or who are living with the virus, and compiled information from mountains of medical records.

States and cities were prepared to submit the information they collected to the CDC in April so the agency's statisticians could prepare the volumes of data for analysis.

Health officials and policymakers use the data to design HIV programs that more efficiently curb the spread of infections and save lives. For example, a 2023 survey revealed that about half of adults under age 30 who were living with HIV weren't on treatment steadily enough to keep them healthy and prevent them from spreading the virus to others. Treatment rates were far higher for those over 50. As a result, health officials doubled down on outreach to younger generations.

However, in April, state and local health officials found themselves cut off from their CDC counterparts after the layoffs. Emails from the Department of Health and Human Services told staff their roles were ""either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.""

Marti Merritt, a project coordinator at the Illinois state health department, was flabbergasted that she and other state employees had invested more than a year into the surveys only to have them go dark in the final phase. ""It's like the data has gone into a black hole,"" she said. ""How do you set priorities if you don't have data?""

Merritt worries that if the surveys don't resume, limited budgets will be misspent — and that cases will rise. Data allows health departments to tailor their efforts to the populations at greatest risk of infection or disease progression.

Evidence shows that preventing HIV is far cheaper than treating people once they're infected. Preventing one HIV infection results in $466,000 in lifetime savings. Merritt was also dismayed to have wasted the time of thousands of people who opened up about intimate details of their lives in hopes of fighting the HIV epidemic.

A doctor and HIV expert reinstated at the CDC this week said the late termination of the surveys would waste millions of taxpayer dollars that have already been spent on data collection. Two large, long-standing efforts, the Medical Monitoring Project and the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system, cost around $72 million, he said.

""Two years' worth of data from 30,000 participants will be unusable, and therefore wasted,"" if the projects can't be finished, he said.

To resume the surveys, he and other CDC researchers would need a green light from higher up because the grants covering these surveys ended while they were on administrative leave in May.

State health officials said they haven't received the CDC notices that typically renew the surveys every June. Merritt has conducted interviews for the Medical Monitoring Project for about 20 years, she said, but the Illinois health department has now assigned her to other tasks. Other health departments have laid off or reassigned employees dedicated to HIV surveillance, too.

If HHS allows the reinstated researchers to resume the projects, they could try to account for the 10-week gap in their analysis. But it would take time, further delaying the next round of surveys — if those begin at all.

""These surveys aren't lights that you turn on and off,"" said John Brooks, a researcher who retired from the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention last year. If the surveys resume, he said, ""we can get some value out of all of the money spent.""

However, the surveys would be further impaired by actions related to Trump's executive orders targeting words such as ""gender"" that researchers use to learn who has HIV, who is at risk, and why.

Experts at the CDC said they've already had to revise earlier surveys and recalculate results to not reference gender. This has meant altering data on two populations disproportionately affected by HIV: transgender people and men who have sex with men.

""To erase people from our data harms them,"" said the researcher and doctor now reinstated at the CDC. ""I care about the transgender patients I see, and it's so hurtful to see them treated this way by the government.""

The doctor said he has treated HIV patients since the beginning of the epidemic in the 1980s, and the sting he feels now is worse than under President Ronald Reagan, who never publicly mentioned HIV in his first term.

""There was a lack of funding,"" he said, ""but they didn't censor science or try to control science like they're doing now.""

Many HIV researchers have taken jobs outside the government or moved since the April layoffs. Some researchers returning to the agency called the reinstatements perplexing because the notices don't say what they'll be doing when they return and for how long.

A terse email to CDC employees from Tom Nagy, chief human capital officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, reviewed by KFF Health News, simply refers to the notice regarding the reduction in force and says, ""That notice is hereby revoked.""

In an email response to queries, Andrew Nixon, HHS director of communications, wrote, ""HHS is streamlining operations without compromising mission-critical work. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority.""

""We've been getting paid this whole time even though we've not been allowed to work, and that doesn't feel good when you're a dedicated civil servant,"" said one reinstated employee.

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy. Please message KFF Health News on Signal at (415) 519-8778.

A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on May 22, 2025, titled ""A rare case: Pure Sertoli cell tumor uncovered in atrophic ovary during postmenopausal vault prolapse evaluation.""

In this case report, corresponding author Naina Kumar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and team describe a rare ovarian tumor in a 70-year-old postmenopausal woman. The tumor was found incidentally during surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. This unusual finding demonstrates the importance of careful tissue evaluation during routine surgeries, especially in older women who may show no symptoms of ovarian disease.

Sertoli cell tumors of the ovary are rare and usually occur in younger women. An even rarer subtype, known as ""pure"" Sertoli cell tumors, lacks other cellular components typically found in related tumors. While some of these tumors may produce hormones, the tumor in this case was non-functional and was discovered only through microscopic analysis after removal during surgery for an unrelated condition.

The patient had undergone a hysterectomy two decades earlier and was admitted to address a vault prolapse, a type of vaginal wall collapse. During the procedure, both atrophic ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed as part of standard surgical care. Although the ovaries appeared age-shrunken and unremarkable, tissue analysis revealed a Stage Ia pure Sertoli cell tumor in the right ovary, with no abnormalities in the left ovary or fallopian tubes.

""Her medical history included Whipple's surgery six years ago for periampullary carcinoma (pT1aN0), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² IV infusion weekly for 7 weeks, a week of rest, and then weekly infusions for 3 weeks in each 28-day cycle).""

Because the tumor was diagnosed at an early stage and confined to the ovary, no additional treatment was needed. The patient recovered well from surgery and remains in good health under regular follow-up. The authors emphasize that early-stage tumors like this one are generally not aggressive and have excellent outcomes, especially when detected early.

This case emphasizes how rare conditions can go undetected in postmenopausal women, particularly when symptoms are absent. It also highlights the value of thorough inspection and histological analysis during pelvic surgeries. Identifying such tumors early, even when incidental, can ensure appropriate management and long-term health monitoring.

By reporting this case, the researchers contribute to broader clinical awareness of rare ovarian tumors and support best practices for surgical evaluation in gynecological care.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Breathing patterns reveal clues about mental and physical well-being","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250613/Breathing-patterns-reveal-clues-about-mental-and-physical-well-being.aspx","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 04:38:00 GMT","

Your breath is one of a kind. A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy. These nasal respiratory ""fingerprints"" also offer insights into physical and mental health. 

The research stemmed from the lab's interest in olfaction, or the sense of smell. In mammals, the brain processes odor information during inhalation. This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn't each person's breathing pattern reflect that? 

To test the idea, the team developed a lightweight wearable device that tracks nasal airflow continuously for 24 hours using soft tubes placed under the nostrils. Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren't enough to capture subtle patterns. 

You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way. Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. We consider this as a brain readout."" 

Noam Sobel, Author, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel

Sobel's team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. Using the collected data, the team identified individuals using only their breathing patterns with high accuracy. This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies. 

""I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting,"" says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science. ""But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct."" 

Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person's body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits. For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions. The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being. 

""We intuitively assume that how depressed or anxious you are changes the way you breathe,"" says Sobel. ""But it might be the other way around. Perhaps the way you breathe makes you anxious or depressed. If that's true, we might be able to change the way you breathe to change those conditions."" 

The current device still faces real-world challenges. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption. The device also doesn't account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use. 

Soroka and Sobel are already investigating whether people can mimic healthy breathing patterns to improve their mental and emotional states. ""We definitely want to go beyond diagnostics to treatment, and we are cautiously optimistic,"" says Sobel.

Three-dimensional cancer cell models, like tumoroids and spheroids, closely mimic the structure and behavior of tumors, making them powerful tools in cancer research and drug development.

However, manual 3D cell culture workflows are often time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone, hindering their adoption for high-throughput drug screening. 

To expedite and standardize spheroid assays, automated 3D cell culture methods utilizing the CellXpress.ai™ Automated Cell Culture System have been developed. This system enables automation of the entire cell culture process, including automated processes for plating, media exchange, passaging and culture monitoring in response to compound treatment and endpoint assays.

The study discussed here outlines the automation of a colorectal cell culture workflow, specifically the culture and imaging of colorectal cancer 3D spheroids derived from HCT116 cell lines in U-shaped low-attachment plates.

HCT116 cells were expanded in two-dimensional culture, and spheroids were generated through automated dispensing of the cell suspension into U-shaped 96- or 384-well plates.

Following a 48-hour incubation, spheroids were treated with various anti-cancer compounds at multiple concentrations for 3–5 days, after which staining and imaging were conducted.

The processes of cell plating, compound addition, media exchange and staining were executed automatically by the CellXpress.ai system.

During the cell culture automation, spheroids were monitored using transmitted light to assess phenotypic changes, including growth inhibition and spheroid disintegration.

For the endpoint assay, spheroids were stained with a combination of Hoechst nuclear stain and viability dyes Calcein AM and EtHD. The spheroids were subsequently imaged and analyzed for size and live-dead cell scoring.

Additionally, ATP content was measured utilizing a CellTiter-Glo assay, with luminescent readouts obtained using the SpectraMax® iD3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.

A concentration-dependent decrease in ATP content was observed, as well as inhibition of spheroid growth and increased cell death in response to the anti-cancer compounds.

A new study published in PLOS Mental Health has explored whether having a sibling born preterm (before 37 weeks of gestation) affects the behavior of children born at term. In a study by the University of Oulu, researchers found no evidence that siblings of preterm-born children experience more behavioral problems than those with only term-born siblings. However, children without any siblings showed higher levels of behavioral difficulties.

The study analyzed data from 65,711 children aged 14 and under, using information from birth cohorts in Denmark, Norway, Italy, and the Netherlands. Children were divided into three groups: those with at least one preterm-born sibling, those with only term-born siblings, and those without siblings. Researchers assessed internalizing behaviors—such as anxiety, depression and stress—and externalizing behaviours, including impulsivity, aggression and rule-breaking. Behavioral data were gathered using parental reports via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Child Behaviour Checklist. The results showed that children with preterm-born siblings did not differ significantly in behavioral outcomes compared to those with only term-born siblings.

In contrast, children without siblings had higher internalizing and externalizing scores. While the study did not identify a behavioral risk associated with having a preterm-born sibling, it highlights the need for further research. The authors note that the mental health of siblings and larger sample sizes for specific subgroups should be included in future longitudinal studies. Children with preterm-born siblings remain an understudied group that could potentially be at increased risk of mental health challenges. The researchers emphasize that continued investigation could provide essential evidence for targeted support, especially if future studies reveal specific vulnerabilities among siblings of preterm-born children.

The study analyzed all data using DataSHIELD, an analysis platform which allows remote access to data and aims to facilitate data sharing across institutions, whilst ensuring total data protection. The research was conducted as part of the European Union-funded LifeCycle project but was a larger collaboration involving projects such as LongITools and ATHLETE, part of the European Human Exposome Network. The LifeCycle project created the EU Child Cohort Network (EUCCN), which brings together data from 17 cohorts across Europe and Australia, and is featured in the larger European Health Research Data and Sample Catalogue developed in the other projects.

 About 30% of all respiratory tract infections are caused by coronaviruses, leading to widespread illnesses and, in some cases, to epidemic and even pandemic outbreaks, as we experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the development of groundbreaking technology that enables the design of prophylactic vaccines, access to those vaccines is not equal across the globe, especially in low-resource countries, and also other hesitations prevent their adoption. 

In addition, coronavirus variants are emerging that can have higher infectivity and resistance to existing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Therefore, fast-acting antiviral drugs with broad activity against multiple respiratory coronaviruses and the ability to be rapidly distributed as oral treatments are urgently needed. 

In 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multidisciplinary team of computational biologists, and infectious disease, medical chemistry and drug development experts formed at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. With early support from the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), the team, led by Wyss Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D, Ph.D., sought to leverage the Wyss Institute's existing computational and biological modeling capabilities to rapidly repurpose existing FDA-approved drugs for the fight against the disease. 

By creating a cohesive AI-enabled and physics-based molecular modeling and drug discovery pipeline built around film industry procedural animation software, they identified the orally available, FDA-approved drug bemcentinib, as a potential antiviral agent. However, to further optimize its activity with follow up support from Open Philanthropy-Good Ventures Foundation, they used this chemical compound as a launch pad for developing a more specific and effective antiviral drug with efficacy against a broad range of coronaviruses. Their findings are published in Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences.

During COVID-19, many research groups sought to develop drugs that target the external surfaces of Spike proteins shared by coronaviruses, which bind to receptor molecules on the surface of host cells and mediate virus entry. At the start of the project, the researchers hypothesized that rather than targeting these external sites, which are prone to mutation under the pressure of vaccines and therapies, focusing on hidden regions of the Spike protein could offer unprecedented benefits.

""We thought that constant regions that remain hidden while the virus initially binds to its host cell, but become accessible during a critical time window when it prepares itself for membrane fusion could be ideal sites. Targeting those could be a way to essentially lock the virus in at the pre-fusion stage before it can release its genetic material into the cytoplasm of host cells,"" said first-author Charles Reilly, Ph.D., a former Wyss Principal Scientist who led the project with Ingber. ""The major challenge lay in identifying these moving cogs for which we could design drugs that could work as a universal wrench for multiple coronaviruses."" 

Previously, Reilly and Ingber had used tools from the film special effects industry to develop computational models of how molecules move and function from the atomic level to that of whole cells, and they used this to depict movements during the origins of human life – the fusion of a sperm with an egg cell – as featured in the short film, ""The Beginning"". 

The team used a similar approach to model the dynamic transformations that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein undergoes after binding its receptor and while literally moving towards fusion. To accomplish this complex modelling, they essentially animated a variety of structural snapshots of the Spike protein that other researchers had captured at different stages of virus binding and fusion in X-Ray crystallography and other studies. This ""molecular dynamics simulation,"" based on actual physical features of the Spike protein, allowed them to generate ""synthetic data"" in which they could glean regions in the so-called S2 subunit of the protein that underwent large-scale mechanical transitions. By applying AI methods to their synthetic data, they were able to pinpoint a specific site within one of those mechanically highly-active regions that revealed itself at a pre-fusion step before facilitating the Spike protein's embedding within the host cell membrane. This key site had potential to function as a binding pocket for drug compounds that would gum up the works to prevent membrane fusion and viral entry and, importantly, it was shared by different members of the coronavirus family. 

To identify drugs that could precisely fit themselves into the predicted binding pocket within the Spike protein's S2 subunit, the researchers computationally screened through about 10,000 existing drugs and ranked them according to their predicted binding affinities to the pocket. The highest-ranking drug that was also orally available was bemcentinib, which in their AI-enabled simulations and molecular docking studies remained strongly bound across multiple structural changes the entire region was undergoing, eventually freezing it at the pre-fusion stage. In fact, the team, with drug development expertise of Wyss Senior Principal Scientist Sylvie Bernier, Ph.D., and Wyss' Senior Director, Translational R&D, Ken Carlson, Ph.D., demonstrated that bemcentinib potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells expressing the ACE2 receptor on their surface by preventing its entry into the cells.

Interestingly, the infection-blocking effect of bemcentinib had also been observed by other researchers, and bemcentinib had actually improved clinical outcomes in a clinical trial with hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But it was generally assumed that the drug had to function through its original target, the AXL kinase protein, which helps drive the growth of tumor cells.

To unequivocally prove that bemcentinib achieved its antiviral activity through our proposed mechanism and further improve its efficacy, we needed to create structurally similar compounds (analogs) that lack any affinity to AXL but retain their affinity to the Spike protein's binding pocket.""

Charles Reilly, Ph.D., a former Wyss Principal Scientist

Joel Moore, Ph.D., a talented medicinal chemist on the team, designed a series of novel compounds, the best of which, dubbed WYS-633, inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into lung cells just like bemcentinib did and, importantly, without binding to AXL. WYS-633 also prevented SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from infecting cells, suggesting that the approach could indeed lead to a broad-spectrum antiviral drug against multiple coronaviruses. 

To further improve the drug-like features of WYS-633, also with an eye towards oral bioavailability, the team performed another round of medical chemistry, AI-enabled computational analysis, and in vitro testing, which culminated in WYS-694, an antiviral compound 12.5-fold more potent than WYS-633. In a last crucial step, Bernier, Carlson, and other members of the team tested WYS-694 as an oral prophylactic treatment in mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, which they infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While both bemcentinib and WYS-633 failed to reduce the viral load, WYS-694 reduced the viral load in the animals by more than 4-fold and significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection.

""While additional computational predictions using Google's AlphaFold 3 machine learning algorithm supported our central hypothesis, we will still have to demonstrate that WYS-694 precisely binds to the target site we identified in the Spike protein's S2 subunit through detailed structural studies, and that the interaction alone and no other potential target enables the antiviral activity,"" said Reilly. ""But our findings are extremely compelling and open up a new path for dealing with viral outbreaks.""

""By aiming for an orally available drug that broadly inhibits multiple coronaviruses, even as a prophylactic treatment, we deliberately set the bar at maximum height,"" said senior author Ingber. ""Yet, our integrated approach merging new AI-driven computational and experimental technologies has proven to be incredibly powerful in achieving this goal. Beyond producing a promising new drug that could be useful in future respiratory pandemics, this approach holds great potential for the discovery of drugs against a number of other virus families utilizing membrane fusion proteins, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, Measles, and others."" Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Additional authors on the study were Shanda Lightbown and Austin Paul. The study was supported by the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, a contract from the DARPA (under contract #HR0011-20-2-0040), and additional funding by the Open Philanthropy–Good Ventures Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

Reigning 18-time French champions OL Lyonnes are looking to secure the signatures of another two U.S. Women's National Team stars to join forces with international teammate Lindsey Heaps.

Former Notre Dame star Korbin Albert is very familiar with Lyon, having spent the last two and a half seasons in the French top tier with Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old midfielder has impressed during her time on the continent, making 47 appearances in Division 1 Féminine, scoring six goals, and lifting the 2024 Coupe de France in the process.

Albert is expected to switch Paris for Lyon this summer as a free agent, as per ESPN, shortly after being dropped from the USWNT by head coach Emma Hayes for their recent friendly wins against China and Jamaica.

A regular in the lineup since she made her debut in late 2023, Albert has gone on to make 26 appearances for the USWNT, scoring once, and winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Upon Albert's potential move to Lyon, she may yet be joined by international teammate and fellow midfielder Lily Yohannes. The 18-year-old has been a standout performer for the USWNT since Hayes' arrival, with one goal in eight caps to date.

“As I keep saying to everyone, she's 17,” Hayes said in May, via ESPN. “She's got a couple of years of experience as a professional. I think the next two years of development will be important for her.

“I think it's been an unbelievable development pathway for her to be at Ajax. That, for me, I think, has advanced her positional play in a way that I think makes her stand out beyond her years.

“She's physically developed in the last 12 months. Tactically in possession, when she plays for her club team, they generally have the ball against sort of mid-to-low blocks. So, I think she's developed that side of her play.”

Yohannes has already secured her role as a regular for the Dutch giants over the last two seasons, appearing in 39 games and scoring on 11 occasions, leading her to be named the Johan Cruyff Talent of the Year in 2024, whilst also lifting the KNVB Women's Cup.

Lyon are now said to be “in talks” over signing the youngster, with the team having “expressed serious interest” in acquiring her services, as per The Athletic.

Exactly what compensation would be required to pry Yohannes away from Ajax is unclear, although she still has another year on her current deal.

Not that Lyon is the only team potentially considering signing Yohannes, with ESPN having claimed Women's Super League champions, and Hayes' former side, Chelsea, are also keeping an eye on her.

Should Albert and/or Yohannes head for Lyon, they would link up with Heaps, who has called the eight-time UEFA Women's Champions League winners home since 2022 when she joined from the Portland Thorns.

Saturday Edition

POWERED BY







The Concacaf Gold Cup kicks off Saturday, and the United States men's national team is in an odd place going into the competition. The lean USMNT roster and packed soccer calendar may be making filling stadiums a difficult proposition, especially up against the Club World Cup. But FOS contributor Sam Blum writes that a potentially tepid reception isn't stoking fear inside U.S. Soccer.

The United States men's national team is playing in a major international tournament this summer, but it isn't on the radar of many fans outside of the bleeding-heart contingent. The hype surrounding the Concacaf Gold Cup has been muted—and also swallowed whole by a historically bloated soccer calendar.

As the USMNT's biggest regional competition, it's an important event that the U.S. has won seven times, last lifting the trophy in 2021. The tournament, played every other year, takes place from June 15 to July 7 across 13 stadiums in the U.S. and one in Vancouver.

Concacaf's 16 member nations are scheduled to compete across 31 matches. In the past, the Gold Cup has roped in casual viewers alongside the team's devotees. But this year, the marketplace is crowded; the USMNT's stars are sitting out; and the U.S. has little on the line, having already qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as hosts. 

The Gold Cup takes place amid a full slate of soccer competitions crisscrossing the country, including Major League Soccer's regular season and the Premier League Summer Series. The biggest rival is the Club World Cup—featuring the star power of Real Madrid, Juventus, and Chelsea—which is kicking off the same weekend on the U.S. East Coast. Inter Miami will be there, too—and Club World Cup tickets have fallen so sharply, fans can see Lionel Messi for $4. All this soccer is swarming North America mere weeks after a grueling nine-month campaign ended for European clubs in May. 

Soccer fans' attention—and their dollars—are being pulled in all directions.

The fixture congestion complicates U.S. Soccer's quest to grab the spotlight. “It's going to be incredibly hard for the U.S. to sell this competition,” says Nick Watanabe, a professor of sports and entertainment management at the University of South Carolina. Plus, the fact that the USMNT plays the event every other year means the novelty of the biannual Gold Cup has worn thin, he tells Front Office Sports: “Because we play it so often, it makes it hard to sell, especially when you have 100 [other] matches packed into a month.” 

It doesn't help that new USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino is working with a threadbare roster.

Fullback Antonee Robinson underwent knee surgery last month after his exertions with Fulham in the Premier League; midfielder Gio Reyna of Borussia Dortmund and the Juventus duo of forward Tim Weah and midfielder Weston McKennie are playing in the Club World Cup; AC Milan midfielder Yunus Musah is also missing play for personal reasons. And then there's Christian Pulisic—for some viewers, the only recognizable name. The USMNT's crown prince and AC Milan forward is controversially sitting out the Gold Cup, much to the dismay and anger of pundits like Landon Donovan, who recently ripped Pulisic's decision to rest after two injury-laden seasons in Italy. 

These games, absent the draw of the USMNT's best players, will be played in colossal arenas. The Gold Cup's venues are largely NFL mega-stadiums, including the 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Tickets are still available, and according to ticketing marketplace TickPick, average prices for USMNT matches have fallen around $30 throughout the past month. The U.S. hasn't done itself any favors in the lead-up to the tournament kickoff: It dropped its table-setter friendly match against Switzerland 4–0. The ongoing back-and-forth about Pulisic's absence is drawing negative attention as well.

The timing for anemic crowds doesn't help the hype machine for the U.S. as it prepares to host the World Cup. It's not lost on some USMNT fans, who have griped about poor attendance at past tournaments. 

Yet while it's true that the Gold Cup is a dress rehearsal for the USMNT ahead of the sport's biggest spectacle—and the U.S. cares about the result—the organization isn't treating the tournament with a lot of promotional urgency, says a source inside U.S. Soccer, who spoke to FOS on the condition of anonymity. 

The bulk of promotion is paid for and coordinated by Concacaf, and although U.S. Soccer has drawn attention to the tournament on social media and made players and coaches available for interviews, they haven't made an overwhelming publicity push. The source adds they also aren't worried that poor attendance could hamper their growth, especially in the lead-up to the World Cup.

In fact, spirits around the financials of U.S. Soccer are just fine, according to the source.

Business is, indeed, humming along. U.S. Soccer began managing its own commercial rights in 2023, and quickly secured a raft of A-list sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Nike, and Visa. Last year, the nonprofit netted $196 million in operating revenue, though it still recorded $190 million in expenses. In the grand scheme, a $6 million profit is not much, but it was the first time U.S. Soccer posted a profit since 2018, and it was largely driven through $102 million in sponsorship revenue, according to U.S. Soccer's Form 990. Ahead of the Gold Cup, the organization also announced a multiyear sponsorship with American Airlines to produce social content from Gold Cup highlights to drum up interest in the World Cup.

It is expecting the World Cup to be a gold mine in terms of attendance, commercial rights, and media deals—making this Concacaf event just a whisper in the larger financial picture for the organization. Even if the Gold Cup's reception is ultimately lukewarm and the national team disappoints, U.S. Soccer has its eyes on another prize, anyway.

							By 

	Luke Cyphers


Senior Editor


	On the same day the U.S. men's national team laid a 4-0 egg against Switzerland in a friendly, getting booed off the field at halftime of a fourth straight loss Wednesday, U.S. Soccer laid a big bet: that the organization can transform the sport at the college level and create a world-class minor league. The juxtaposition was stark.


	Off the field, U.S. Soccer is aggressively pushing boundaries. By this fall, the national governing body said, the newly formed NextGen College Soccer Committee will issue a “white paper” on a path forward for college soccer, which in the past 15 years has become an afterthought in terms of elite player development. U.S. Soccer's plan is for at least some college programs to compete under a revamped format as early as next year, perhaps with a new year-round playing calendar, expanded commercial objectives and far tighter links to the national governing body.

	











	On the field, the men's national team is in a defensive crouch. Fans and pundits are on the verge of panic after a string of dismal performances just a year out from the 2026 World Cup on home soil. The USMNT opens play in the CONCACAF Gold Cup on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago; the tournament will be the squad's last competitive matches before the World Cup.


	While the men's team is struggling, U.S. Soccer is on a roll organizationally, raising millions of dollars from well-heeled corporations and billionaire donors, building a new national training center and headquarters in Atlanta, and pushing proposals to expand the game's reach in the country. The governing body can also point to the women's national team, which has regained its perch atop the global game since the hire of head coach Emma Hayes last year.


	In an interview with Sportico, U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson expounded on his organization's ambitious goals for the college game.


	“The best 18- to 22-year-old soccer players in America are opting to play professionally now, and that shows the growth of the American soccer market,” Batson said. “It also shows the opportunity around evolving around college soccer—that it can become the best U-23 league in the world.”

	











	The college reform efforts, part of a U.S. Soccer “service to soccer” initiative, will involve both men's and women's soccer. Batson says the committee has yet to work out the details, but the death of college-sports amateurism in the wake of NIL reforms and the House antitrust settlement will drive their discussions.


	The potential for players to make money from NIL and revenue-sharing “is part of the reason why the folks from the pro leagues and some of the folks who own pro clubs think college can be a positive pathway for elite players,” Batson said. “But it's going to require some changes, and that's the heart of the work that everyone's focused on.”


	Existing college infrastructure, the chance for an education and the opportunity to make some money might be attractive to players who aren't signed to million-dollar contracts with top clubs as teenagers. There may even be the possibility of MLS, NWSL or USL franchises using college squads as farm teams—which have become an area of interest for investors.


	While player development is a focal point, commercial interests are also driving the moves.


	“Most of the commercial energy and effort in college sports has been focused on football and men's basketball,” Batson said. “There's nobody waking up thinking about how to drive revenue at any sense of scale for college soccer. And we think there are opportunities, if you look at this as a nationwide platform, to be able to drive new commercial value in a way the prior model didn't allow for.”


	Such opportunities exist with media rights, for example, which Batson says are often “fragmented and highly localized” in college sports.


	With more than 200 men's and 300 women's teams already in Division I, the sport could offer untapped national and regional sponsorship possibilities, especially with a year-long season and more talented players on rosters.


	Speaking of players, any new format would likely include a geographical reorganization of competing teams. Recent conference realignments have led to “players living on planes,” Batson said. “From a student-athlete welfare standpoint, you have a lot of college leaders who believe we have to end up with more regional models than we have today.”

	











	A huge hurdle will be the NCAA rulebook, which right now restricts pay-for-play, practice time and the length of the season. Changing that rulebook through the NCAA's legislative process has historically been a glacial process.


	Batson says the tumult in college sports gives soccer a chance to present a test case for a new era. “We've been in direct conversations with college presidents, with conference leaders, who are all very excited about soccer being able to help lead to a future model for a broad set of college sports. Everyone recognizes that status quo has its challenges,” and there's been “an evolution of how college sports is thinking about its own governance and its own rules.”


	When word leaked about U.S. Soccer's nascent reform proposals presented to college coaches over the winter, the pitch was seen as a national governing body-sponsored “breakaway” of the college game from the NCAA.


	As Sportico reported, early discussions included the Big Ten and ACC, who might form the basis of an experimental test conference. That prompted others in the sport to wonder whether successful mid-major programs such as national champion Vermont, along with fellow Final Four teams Denver and Marshall, might be shunted aside.


	Batson emphasized that U.S. Soccer is “very agnostic as we start this process as what the future of governance model should be, and who is the quote-unquote organizer of the competitions. There's so much change going on in college sports, we're happy with any positive outcome that leads to more opportunities for players and coaches to develop. We don't start with a preconceived notion of what that should look like.”


	Though Batson didn't say this, others in the sport have postulated that the new model could range from continued NCAA governance to an entity that eventually splits off completely from the association.


	“We've been doing a whole body of work around this at U.S. Soccer with all of our stakeholders for quite some time now, and one of the things that bubbled to the top of the priority list was, ‘What does the next generation of college sports look like, and college soccer in particular?'” Batson said. “Conceivably, the right thing for year one may be different than a future state of things.”

World Cup

When Mauricio Pochettino was hired to coach the U.S. men's national team in September 2024, the federation amplified their shared “belief that U.S. Soccer is on the cusp of something truly special.” Over the past week, however, his squad couldn't even handle a Turkey and Swiss.

A year away from the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico and sandwiched in between two regional competitions, the USMNT hardly looks ready. Pochettino's side followed an embarrassing fourth-place showing at the Nations League with a pair of consecutive friendly losses. The latest, a 4-0 thrashing against Switzerland – with all goals coming in the first 36 minutes – provides little optimism about the looming Concacaf Gold Cup, to say nothing of the sport's grandest tournament.

How much of an outlier is this brutal run-up to hosting the World Cup? To understand how the USMNT compares to past hosts, let's look back at every one since the U.S. last hosted the men's World Cup in 1994. To look at how a team improved or regressed, we'll use the Elo Ratings system. While FIFA's rankings are pushed the hardest and even used for competition draws, the formula has changed often and still seems unreflective of recent form. The Elo model uses head-to-head results to award points to teams after every game, with the score fully transparent and ranked among every other national team in the world.

The Elo Rating also considers the stakes of a game, where competitive games will impact a team's rating to a more outsized extent than a friendly. For example, one-goal defeats to Panama and Canada in March's Concacaf Nations League have more sway over the U.S.'s Elo Rating than Tuesday's loss to Switzerland or January's 3-1 win over Venezuela.

Over the course of six games in 2025, the model assesses Pochettino's side to be in freefall. After rising to 28th globally at the end of the January window, four straight defeats have sunk the U.S. to 45th — its lowest ranking since 1997. That feels a bit more honest than FIFA's latest rankings, which has the USMNT 16th in the world as of April 3.

The other 2026 cohosts have only seen slight changes to their ranking since the start of 2025. Mexico has risen eight spots, from 32nd to 24th, while Canada has taken a slight dip from 26th to 29th. At the start of the year, the USMNT was nestled between their regional rivals; now, faltering form has placed the U.S. well behind the pack.

Using Elo, we hope to answer a simple question: did the games host nations played in the 18 months preceding their World Cup leave them in better or worse position in the global landscape?

Elo Rating on January 1, 1993: 32nd (1688)

For the first half of 1993, the hosts (who had qualified outright in 1990) slumped through 14 friendlies. Most notable was a 3-1 defeat at then-74th ranked Japan, while the program notched credible draws against Denmark and Russia on home soil.

Then came the U.S. Cup, a short-lived round robin tournament providing stout competition: Brazil, England and Germany. While the United States lost its opener to Brazil and lost a 4-3 slugfest against Germany, the middle match was an undeniable highlight. The USMNT beat England 2-0 in Foxborough, with Thomas Dooley and Alexi Lalas scoring. England, which entered the match ranked ninth, ultimately failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.

The USMNT fell back to earth immediately after, taking one point from its Copa América group. A month later, it finished as runner-up to Mexico in the 1993 Gold Cup, sinking to 55th at year's end after some more worrying friendlies. 1994 began in the same vein, with friendlies ranging from wins over Norway and Mexico to defeats against Sweden, Iceland and Chile.

Pre-tournament record: 13-19-17 (1.18 ppg)

Elo Rating before 1994 World Cup: 58th (1605); -26 ranks

No match from this 18-month stretch carried as much weight, in the Elo ratings and in real life, as the U.S.'s 2-1 win over Colombia. The infamous result that ultimately cost Andrés Escobar his life helped the USMNT advance from its group, coupled with an opening-match draw against Switzerland. Ultimately, the hosts fell in the round of 16 to eventual champion Brazil.

Elo Rating after 1994 World Cup: 49th (1627)

Trend: -17 ranks, -61 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 1997: 3rd (2017)

This is where the difference between the nascent early 1990s USMNT and the well-established nature of Les Bleus becomes starkly pronounced. While the U.S. needed to enter and host any tournament it could to whip itself into readiness, France kept a fairly lean datebook during its run-up, playing just 15 games compared to its hosting predecessor's 49.

France spent the entirety of its prep ranked either third or fourth in the Elo Ratings, averaging roughly one friendly a month against mostly European opposition. A win against Spain was quickly nullified by a defeat in Russia. In a hosted friendly tournament akin to the U.S. Cup, France struggled, drawing with Brazil and Italy but losing to England. Its final window gave cause for concern: a narrow victory over Belgium (20th), a draw against Morocco (31st) and a slim win at Finland (68th) were hardly befitting of a World Cup contender.

In hindsight, the close calls allowed the team to coalesce ahead of the occasion. After all, youngsters Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet entered the tournament with just 14 combined international caps.

Pre-tournament record: 8-5-2 (1.93 ppg)

Elo Rating before 1998 World Cup: 4th (2004); -1 rank

France snapped out of its pre-tournament sleepwalk in a hurry, claiming all nine points on offer from a thin Group C despite Zinedine Zidane being sent off in its second group match. Its path through the knockout bracket was also unconvincing in moments: narrowly overcoming Paraguay in the round of 16, needing a shootout to see out Italy in the quarterfinal and pipping Croatia 2-1 in the semifinal.

Ultimately, Davor Šuker's goal was the only one France would concede after the group stage. The tale of the 1998 final is largely told through a Brazilian's vantage point, as Ronaldo's pre-match convulsive fit led to Mário Zagallo removing him from his lineup before reinstating him just 45 minutes before kickoff. The striker looked like a shell of himself, while a Zidane brace and a last-minute celebrator from Emmanuel Petit ensured the World Cup trophy remained in France.

Elo Rating after 1998 World Cup: 1st (2090); +3 ranks 

Trend from start: +2 ranks, +73 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 2001: 21st (1797)

One of two nations to serve as the first co-hosts in tournament history, Japan also benefitted from the Confederations Cup no longer being a Saudi Arabian-organized standalone. Instead, this was the first installment where it served as a dress rehearsal for hosts a year out from the World Cup, providing meaningful matches in venues that would become familiar to a global audience the following summer.

Japan won its group, beating Canada and Cameroon before playing Brazil to a scoreless draw. Japan then beat Australia 1-0 in the semifinal before falling to France in the final by an identical scoreline. It was the undeniable high point of the build-up period, which otherwise saw a smattering of friendlies on either side of the Confederations Cup.

Pre-tournament record: 8-6-5 (1.58 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2002 World Cup: 15th (1850); +6 ranks

As with the previous summer, Japan won its group after drawing with Belgium and beating Russia and Tunisia. The good luck ended once the knockout bracket took shape, however, as Japan stared down Turkey in the round of 16.

History remembers this Turkey side as one of the great knockout grinders in World Cup history. Japan ultimately fell 1-0, with Ümit Davala scoring the lone goal in the 12th minute. Turkey went on to finish third in the tournament, notching another 1-0 win in the quarterfinal. As such, Japan finished this stretch in a near-identical standing to where it began at the start of 2001.

Elo Rating after 2002 World Cup: 20th (1827) 

Trend from start: +1 rank, +30 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 2001: 25th (1765)

Another beneficiary of the Confederations Cup, South Korea didn't fare nearly as well as its co-host. A 5-0 defeat in its opener against France left the team at a severe disadvantage. While it did well to beat Mexico and Australia in its final group games, the blowout saw South Korea finish third in Group A, eliminated on goal difference.

Like Japan, South Korea flanked its Confederations Cup appearance with friendlies. Wins over Croatia and the U.S. served as highpoints, while it suffered another 5-0 defeat shortly after the Confederations Cup, this time against Czech Republic. Unlike its co-hosts, however, South Korea participated in the 2002 Concacaf Gold Cup (held in January and February), hoping to bolster its preparations. The guests held their own, losing to the USMNT in the group but beating Mexico on penalties in the quarterfinal. Ultimately, they lost to eventual runner-up Costa Rica in a 3-1 semifinal before Canada beat them in the consolation game — the two most consequential results from this stretch according to the Elo Ratings.

Pre-tournament record: 11-11-9 (1.42 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2002 World Cup: 34th (1736); -9 ranks

It was South Korea who fared better among the co-hosts. It kicked off its tournament with a 2-0 win over Poland, but a draw against the USMNT left Korean hopes of advancing in the balance entering the final game against Portugal. The visiting favorites did themselves no favors, as João Pinto drew a 29th-minute red card for sliding through the back of Park Ji-sung. Still a few years ahead of his move to Manchester United, Park scored the match-winner in the second half to vault South Korea to its knockout bracket in World Cup history – and famously send the U.S. through in the process.

History hasn't been entirely favorable to the ensuing semifinal run. Francesco Totti was sent off in the round of 16 on a controversial call, while Spanish media still believe that then-FIFA executive Jack Warner rigged the quarterfinals by giving the cohosts a favorable referee assignment. No matter: after beating Italy on a golden goal, South Korea toppled Spain in PKs, only to have a storybook run ending with a 1-0 semifinal defeat to Germany.

Jurgen Klinsmann had his work cut out for him ahead of Germany's hosting duties, having to fold in a rising generation (including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski) into the established core led by Oliver Kahn, Michael Ballack and Miroslav Klose. Controversially, Klinsmann took the captain's armband off of Kahn and thrust him into a goalkeeper competition with Jens Lehmann, unsettling the program's mainstays.

The group made an unconvincing case at its Confederations Cup: wins against Australia, Tunisia and Mexico were overshadowed by a draw against Argentina and a 3-2 defeat to Brazil in a rematch of the 2002 final. Its preparations closed out with some concerning results, namely losses in Slovakia and Turkey.

Italy logged a 4-1 win over Germany three months before the tournament, leaving many to wonder if Klinsmann was cut out for international management as the FIFA rankings placed the hosts 22nd. The Elo Ratings' head-to-head model liked them much more than that, though, positioning them 10th entering the 2006 World Cup.

Germany left no bones about its group, beating Costa Rica, Poland and Ecuador by a combined 8-2 scoreline. A Podolski brace inside 12 minutes sprung the hosts to an early lead in the round of 16 against Sweden, seeing out that scoreline to book a date with pre-tournament favorite Argentina in the quarterfinal. Lehmann backed his coach's trust with some shootout heroics, working off research notes tucked in his sock before making two saves to send Germany to the semis.

The hosts played Italy hard in the semifinal, forcing extra time and keeping the contest scoreless for 118 minutes. Seemingly, Lehmann would have another chance to unfurl paper from his hosiery. Instead, Italy left back Fabio Grosso broke the stalemate in the 119th minute, with Alessandro Del Piero finishing the job two minutes later.

Germany went on to beat Portugal in the third place game, while Italy beat France after Zidane's infamous headbutt. Klinsmann would ride the coattails of this performance into several jobs over the years, most notably leading the U.S. from 2011-2017 before being sacked in the middle of its only World Cup qualification failure since 1986.

Even compared to the plucky USMNT of 1994, no previous World Cup host was a clearer underdog who would've otherwise struggled to qualify than South Africa. Bafana Bafana made the field in 1998 and 2002, but was still in a rebuilding phase as 2009 kicked off. The guarantee of meaningful games provided ample opportunity for growth, between tournament hopefuls like Chile and Serbia wanting to pay the hosts a friendly visit and the Confederations Cup fielding top opponents.

South Africa advanced from its Confederations Cup group after beating New Zealand and drawing with Iraq and falling against Spain. It lost to Brazil 1-0 in the semis and 3-2 in a consolation rematch against a Spain side reeling from its shocking defeat to the USMNT. The three losses began a six-match skid in the summer and fall of 2009, followed by friendly losses against Serbia, Germany and Ireland.

Equally surprising was the struggle at the 2009 COSAFA Cup in Zimbabwe, with South Africa finishing fourth among 13 teams from the Southern part of Africa. The New Zealand win was its most impactful result of the build-up, followed by friendly victories over Norway, Jamaica and Colombia.

While the tournament opener from Siphiwe Tshabalala was an instant classic, South Africa suffered from receiving an unusually tough draw for a host. Mexico leveled late in that opening match, and Uruguay thrashed them 3-0 in Pretoria. South Africa sprung one last surprise by toppling a rudderless France 2-1 in the finale, but a -2 goal differential saw the hosts go out in a tie-breaker with Mexico.

Then again, the 63rd-best team in the world seldom advances from a World Cup group.

Twelve years after Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaká won Brazil's fifth World Cup, Neymar seemed poised to lead his nation to a record-extending sixth. Brazil stayed in the top three of the Elo Ratings throughout its run-up, although the defensive cracks that doomed the Seleção in the tournament were visible ahead of time.

Brazil opened 2013 with a 2-1 friendly loss to England at Wembley, then drew four of its next five games against Italy, Russia, Chile and England again. Pressure was building ahead of the Confederations Cup, but a perfect nine-point group stage against Japan, Mexico and Italy returned Brazil to the ascendency. The hosts ultimately won the tune-up tournament final against Spain, winning six of seven games to close 2013 in pole position.

Their 2014 schedule was quite lean: a 5-0 win in South Africa, and a pair of wins against Panama and Serbia immediately before the group stage kicked off. What could possibly go wrong?

First, the good: Brazil won its group with Mexico, Croatia and Cameroon and weathered a round-of-16 test by eliminating Chile in PKs. Their 2-1 win in the quarterfinal over Colombia was marred by Neymar exiting on a stretcher after taking a knee to his back, ruling him out for the competition.

You know what came next. With Neymar injured and Thiago Silva suspended, Brazil was a shell of itself in a 7-1 scoreline that is among the most famous (or infamous, depending on your slant) results in history. That Germany went on to win the final provided no consolation. It's a loss from which Brazil has seemingly never recovered.

Rather than play a balanced schedule of home and away matches, as most hosts before had done, Russia played all but two games at home, working to foster a staunch advantage when the tournament rolled around.

While friendly results were uneven as the Russians invited likely qualifiers like Brazil, Spain and Argentina, their Confederations Cup was arguably even more worrisome. After dispatching New Zealand 2-0 in the opener, losses against Portugal and Mexico saw Russia be the second Confederations Cup host to fall in the group stage.

While Russia notched a 4-2 win in its first friendly after that, it failed to win any of the ensuing seven friendlies before the World Cup.

Leaning into the feverish fan-created atmospheres, Russia shocked everyone by holding its own. Wins over Saudi Arabia and Egypt were enough to advance from their group despite a loss to Uruguay. Russia labored to force penalty shootouts in its two knockout games, beating Spain in the round of 16 before falling to eventual runner-up Croatia in the quarterfinal.

Qatar didn't follow Russia's lead and instead took a page from South Korea's book by looking for additional tournaments. With AFC combining qualification for the World Cup and Asian Cup in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar got meaningful games against regional rivals before accepting an invitation into the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup. A group win over Honduras and a quarterfinal triumph over El Salvador more than made up for a semifinal loss against the USMNT.

In the first run-up without a Confederations Cup since 1998 after FIFA folded the tournament, Qatar hosted the 2021 Arab Cup as a test event. Qatar finished third, winning four games before losing to Algeria and beating Egypt on penalties in a third place game. 2022 featured many friendlies against lower-ranked opponents, with a 2-1 win over Panama (in Spain) being the standout result.

Tyler Adams and Mauricio Pochettino were on the same page after the Concacaf Nations League third place match—the level they showed wasn't good enough.

The U.S. men's national team is facing immense pressure heading into the Concacaf Gold Cup. Losses to Panama and Canada during the Nations League final raised alarm bells, but two more losses in friendly action to Türkiye and Switzerland have pressure turned up to a level not seen since the USMNT failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Representing one final, competitive tournament to prepare for a 2026 World Cup on home soil, down numerous stars amid varying circumstances, Gold Cup is a flashpoint in Mauricio Pochettino's short tenure as head coach. If he can rally the team after a demoralizing send-off match, this summer could be the catalyst for something special. If not, it'll be a precursor for what's to come next year on the biggest stage. Not to mention the drama surrounding Christian Pulisic's absence.

Tyler Adams sat down with Sports Illustrated before the team's summer friendlies revealing Pochettino's post-Nations League message to the team. 

“When we got knocked out of the Nations League and Mauricio spoke after Panama and Canada, we touched on the level of competition we showed in those two games was never good enough. It doesn't matter what level you're at, who you're playing against, any players will make you look bad when you compete at that level. The level of competition has to be higher and higher and we need to raise the bar. For me, it's an opportunity to show we're ready for that,” Adams says.

Pochettino's words seemingly rang true with players when they took the pitch against Türkiye. The passion and energy were there, but defensive lapses resulted in a third straight loss for the team. Switzerland, albeit demoralizing and another loss, should be looked at in a vacuum given the amount of squad rotation. If anything, that game is a warning sign to Pochettino that there's a stark contrast between his perceived best XI, the team that faced Türkiye and the team that started against Switzerland.

Adams didn't play against Switzerland nursing a foot injury, but watching the performance should push him further as a leader this summer. The Bournemouth midfielder brought a sense of calm and poise to the second half against Türkiye, things greatly lacking against the Swiss.

Off the pitch, his mindset remains similar. When asked to describe what the Gold Cup represents this summer for the USMNT, Adams had one word: Opportunity.

“I look at it as a massive opportunity to set the tone of what we're trying to do in the right way. My goal is obviously to win Gold Cup. Whenever you enter a tournament, you want to win. But for me, the most important thing I've said to everyone is to get back to the basics. Make sure we understand what makes the U.S., the U.S. Running, competing, winning duels, tackles, all the things that make fans jump out of their seats because that represents American pride. People want to talk about the quality of players that we have now. The quality can only be shown once we do the basics really well. I think that's what the national team's always been built off of. We have to get back to that point and a high level of competing.” Adams says.

Off the back of the two friendly losses, while blocking out outside noise, Adams is poised to be a driving force behind whatever success the USMNT has this summer as one of the few veteran players in camp.

Their Gold Cup journey gets underway on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens call out Landon Donovan for his criticism of players pulling out of the USMNT, in the wake of the 4-0 defeat to Switzerland. (2:36)

Are you or a loved one ""getting Concacafed?""

Are you experiencing symptoms of a referee giving you a yellow card for getting punched by another player? Have you felt confusion upon watching another man somersault across the grass in anguish after you shook his hand to congratulate him on a nice play? Ever seen a group of ball boys shrug their shoulders and sit, immobile, after a goalkeeper literally punted the ball into the Atlantic Ocean? Want to scream because you just lost a game on a field of knee-high grass against a team of players who spent most of the past week on a commercial fishing boat?

If you've followed North American soccer for long enough, you're familiar with the term. Heck, ESPN contributor Jon Arnold writes an entire newsletter about it every week; it's called Getting CONCACAFed.

Arnold's newsletter celebrates the conundrum that is Concacaf -- a region that features two of the richest federations in all of the sport, the United States and Mexico; another one that mostly plays hockey, Canada; and then a bunch of other soccer-loving nations with varying (low) levels of resources and degrees of professionalism. Just a few years ago, the 60-year-old president of Suriname forced himself into a Concacaf league match. This is the same federation within which Lionel Messi plays his club ball and the likes of Christian Pulisic and Alphonso Davies represent their countries. It all exists together, and it's beautiful.

At its worst, though, the fans who talk about getting Concacafed are fans of the richest country in the region, and they're complaining about the ""uncultured methods"" of their poorer regional brethren. God forbid the underdogs try to find ways to even the playing field.

But what actually happens in Concacaf, from minute one through 90? It's a question with competitive consequences in the Gold Cup, which begins Saturday, for the U.S. men's national team, Mexico and Canada -- all of whom also hope to make it deep into next summer's World Cup.

How different is the sport played here, compared with over there? Let's look into the numbers.

We'll start with the place where it seems Concacaf is most different from everywhere else: its apparent tolerance for violence.

In the rest of this piece, we'll be comparing the Gold Cup with the Copa América, the Euros and the Premier League. Because there aren't many games in any one international tournament, we're using data from the past two Gold Cups, Copas América and Euros. And then we're using only this past season of Premier League data, since there are way more games. This should give us a sense of how Concacaf stacks up against the two best regions for international soccer and then the gold standard for club soccer.

Here's a graph that plots the number of yellow cards per game and the number of fouls per game for the average team:

Though the Gold Cup averages more fouls per game than any of the three other competitions, it also averages the second-fewest yellow cards -- just barely more (1.86 per game to 1.85) than at the Euros.

The way I'd interpret this data: The Concacaf referees allow a lot more physicality than refs do in any of the other tournaments. Though the Copa América has a reputation for being one big rock fight, there aren't as many fouls as in North America, and the referees are way quicker on the draw with their yellow and red cards.

One of the themes here is that, stylistically, South American soccer has a lot more in common with North American soccer than it does with European soccer. Part of the reason for the similar data is that a few Concacaf teams played in last summer's Copa América, but that's not enough to skew the numbers much.

Now, take a look at our next graph:

Why are the Euros all the way in the upper right corner? The possession game is more prevalent in Europe, but in the Premier League, teams are coming up against much more athletic players and much more aggressive pressing systems than in the Euros. So, in the Euros, it's not that these teams are better at passing than Premier League clubs; it's just a lot easier to pass. Plus, both Euros in the dataset came at the end of long seasons, so teams tended to sit on the ball longer once they won possession.

However, the average Gold Cup team attempts around 420 passes per game and completes 82% of them. Those are, nearly exactly, the same numbers that relegated Leicester City put up in the most recent Premier League season.

Although the passing numbers are quite similar, the major area where Concacaf and CONMEBOL differ is in how often dribbles are attempted. Copa America teams attempt 21.2 take-ons per game -- the most of the four competitions we're looking at -- while Gold Cup squads try to beat their opponents on the dribble 17.7 times per game, second fewest in our dataset.

This is where Concacaf sits on its own -- but not for the reasons you might think.

When I say ""aggression"" here, I don't mean, ""How much do you try to injure your opponents?"" Instead, I mean: ""How aggressively are teams trying to move the ball forward?"" There are two ways to determine that: How far do they pass the ball, and how many passes do they make before they attempt a shot?

Behold, the answer!

The longer passing and trigger-happy approach also leads to more moments of transition. In Concacaf, the ball changes hands more frequently (the number of possessions per game) and moves up the field more quickly than in the other competitions:

Those possession and speed numbers are almost exactly what Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth averaged this past season. Tyler Adams was born to play in this tournament --- and yet, he never has. Depending on how serious his foot injury is, it's possible he never will.

All right, so we now know that there are lots of fouls and very few cards at the Gold Cup. We know there aren't many passes attempted, and there are even fewer completed. There's not much dribbling, either. But there's lots of long, aggressive passes, plenty of turnovers and a bunch of shots. Broadly, this is what Gold Cup games look like.

What about the shots themselves? We know how teams are getting the ball forward, what midfield play tends to look like, and how frequently shots are being attempted. But what kind of shots are these?

If there are two basic tactical takeaways from soccer's still-fledgling analytics movement, they are: (1) stop shooting from outside the box and (2) stop crossing so much. Now, this isn't to say you should never cross, but most crosses don't lead to shots; they lead to turnovers that leave your defense scrambling. And even when crosses lead to shots, those shots tend to be with your head, and headers are way less likely to turn into goals than shots with your feet.

As for point one, well, yeah, duh. The hallmark of every analytical revolution in sports was something obvious: For baseball players, getting on base is good, no matter how you do it; passing a football is easier than running; 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers; shots from close to the goal are more likely to go in.

Well, as of yet, it doesn't appear as if anyone has told anyone in Concacaf any of these things.

But in the Gold Cup, goals saved is right around expectation. The same kind of talent-level disparity doesn't exist in any kind of consistent way for keepers.

And then there's pressure on the ball. Perhaps because defenders in the other regions are more talented, or their tactics are more fine-tuned, or because possession play isn't so hectic, the Gold Cup averages the fewest shots under what Stats Perform defines as high pressure, but the most shots under either moderate or low pressure. Defensive pressure, or even the possibility of defensive pressure, has a large effect on shot conversion -- and there's just not as much of it in the Gold Cup, so we get more goals.

I've written before about how the wide-open style of play in the German Bundesliga just isn't preparing Bayern Munich for the Champions League. Most teams in Germany aren't employing typical underdog strategies, so Bayern don't have to figure out how to break down low blocks. But they're also way more talented than everyone else in the league thanks to their massive resource advantage, so they're not playing games where they can't just expect to dominate the ball.

Then, in Europe, they play teams that challenge their claim to possession or fine-tune their own counterattacking strategies -- neither of which Bayern get any practice with at home.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

There's probably some similar kind of translatability problem for the likes of the U.S., Mexico and even Canada. The soccer you see in Concacaf is just significantly different from what you'll see when you play in the World Cup, a tournament that theoretically gathers most of the best teams in the world. Plus, Concacaf is quite different from what all of the USMNT's best players experience on a week in, week out basis for their club teams in Europe these days.

The flipside of this is that the friendlies against European clubs better mirror the tactical environment the U.S. will be facing at the World Cup -- especially the first halves, when teams tend to be less experimental and at least enter the match with a cohesive lineup and some kind of plan. But, uh, yeah: Mauricio Pochettino's team has been outshot 17 to 4 -- to the tune of 0.14 expected goals for and 3.2 xG against; one goal for, six against -- across the two first halves of the recent Turkiye and Switzerland matches. This team is getting UEFAed, too.

Such is the nature of international soccer, then, that the sport the U.S. plays at the Gold Cup this summer will have only a vague connection to the sport it's going to play next summer. Also, the players playing this summer will only vaguely resemble the players who are playing next summer.

Given the recent performances, the latter is a positive. As for the former? It means we're unlikely to learn a whole lot from the Gold Cup about the team's chances at the World Cup. Given the trending direction of recent results, that's probably a good thing, too.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Liverpool could break the British transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz while Thomas Frank may bring two Brentford stars with him to Spurs

Time to sign off – here's a run-down of Friday's main stories:

Liverpool agree £116m deal to sign Leverkusen's Wirtz

Tottenham target Mbeumo and Wissa after Frank arrival

John Brewin takes a look at the Spurs manager's in-tray

Club World Cup kicks off amid extreme heat fears …

… plus concerns over the political climate in the US

City could loan out Grealish having received no offers

Everton have turned their attentions to the Villarreal striker Thierno Barry as David Moyes attempts to improve his forward options for next season.
 Barry, 22, scored 11 goals in La Liga last season and 19 overall as Villarreal qualified for the Champions League. The France under-21 international is understood to have a release clause of €40m in his contract with the Spanish club but Everton would hope to sign him for less. Barry is currently on international duty at the Under-21 Euros in Slovakia.
 Moyes' need to upgrade Everton's attack is pressing, with the club having missed out on Liam Delap, and declined to take up an option to sign Armando Broja on a permanent deal from Chelsea. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is expected to leave on a free transfer this summer, which would leave only Beto and the unproven Youssef Chermiti as central striking options.

How about Dilated Peoples' “Wirtz comes to Wirtz?” asks Fadden Holden, shouting to be heard over bass-heavy speakers while the DJ nods approvingly.

Saudi Arabia currently hosts annual four-team Italian and Spanish Super Cup events, so it makes sense that the Saudi Super Cup is being held in … Hong Kong. The tournament will take place in August at the Hong Kong Stadium, with Al-Ittihad, Al-Qadisiyah, Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr taking part.

Tottenham have tempted Thomas Frank across London to become their new manager – now they could swoop for two of his Brentford stars. Ed Aarons reports:

More potential Wirtz chants from Peter Oh – “Wirtz Science by Oingo Boingo?” – and Nick Smith, who suggests “Wirtz going on?”

More than 170 transfers in the top five men's leagues this summer, and we're barely into June. And it's been even busier in women's football:

On this day in 2004, England led France 1-0 heading into stoppage time in Lisbon. Fabian Barthez had saved David Beckham's penalty, but England were heading for victory regardless. Until Zinedine Zidane got involved …

Celtic fans will face further Hampden Park ticket sanctions after the Scottish champions were one of three clubs to be hit with disciplinary charges relating to pyrotechnics.

The SPFL has revealed that Celtic, Aberdeen and Partick Thistle face notices of complaint. In March, Celtic and Rangers were hit with an immediate reduction of 500 tickets for the next League Cup match to be played at Hampden as a result of similar offences at the final in December.

Celtic were also handed a suspended reduction of 800 tickets, which it appears has been breached. The club were cited over a “large-scale orchestrated pyrotechnic display” which took place on the final day of the season against St Mirren.

The flares were accompanied by a banner directed at chief executive Michael Nicholson which read: “Fan engagement up in smoke”. PA Media

“Not quite a holiday, but I met John Collins when doing my Duke of Edinburgh bronze expedition in the Lake District,” writes Chris Little. “Me and my mates got lost and found this fancy hotel where we thought we'd ask directions. I went in to ask for help and the Celtic midfield maestro was stood at reception. He asked if I was OK and when I explained, he hollered for the receptionist to help me. Top bloke.”

“Big challenge lies ahead for Liverpool fans like myself ahead of Florian's arrival,” writes Graeme Neill. “His name doesn't exactly lend itself well to chants. An REM-inspired Everybody Wirtz isn't going to get the Kop bouncing, nor a rendition of the Nine Inch Nails song. I guess there's perhaps scope for a spin on this belter…” Nailed it.

He's not done yet: James Milner has agreed a one-year extension to his Brighton deal. “I'm really pleased we will have James with us again this season,” said Fabian Hürzeler. “He's a great guy to have in our environment, who is always there for me and the team.”

Milner will turn 40 in January and could join an elite group of outfield players to feature in the Premier League after their 40th birthday – including Teddy Sheringham, Ryan Giggs, Kevin Phillips and Gordon Strachan.

Milner, who only played four times last season due to injuries, also needs 15 more games to equal Gareth Barry at the top of the Premier League's all-time appearance list.

Here's today's Football Daily, by me, on Gianni's big geopolitical headache.

Speaking of Inzaghi, he has helped lead Pisa back to Serie A for the first time in 34 years – but won't be there to coach them in the top flight. He's left his role by mutual consent, and is expected to take over at Palermo, returning to the second tier with the CFG-affiliated Sicilian side.

Thanks Will, and hi everyone. I don't have any great tales of meeting footballers on holiday, but I did once spot Pippo Inzaghi at an airport in the Czech Republic. At least I think it was him.

Thank you very much for joining me. The delightful Niall McVeigh will take you through to the end of time.

Steven Pressley understands why some Dundee fans were unhappy with his appointment as head coach but believes he will be a better leader for his time away from the front line.

The club's selection of the former Rangers, Dundee United, Hearts, Celtic and Scotland defender was not particularly well received among supporters given Pressley's previous role as a manager ended when he was sacked by Carlisle in 2019. For the past four years, the former Falkirk, Coventry, Fleetwood and Pafos manager has been head of individual player development at Brentford while completing a masters degree in strategic leadership.

When asked about the fans' reaction at his first media conference, Pressley said: “I understand how the business works. The only way to win supporters over is to win and get results. But I am aware there has to be a period of growth before we get success. Make no mistake, I am aware we need to win games and we are working extra hard to do so. Regardless of if everyone was happy with the appointment, you will be judged in the same way.”

The 51-year-old added: “If you're a Dundee supporter and you're looking for a manager with a history of producing titles and winning honours, then I'm not your man. I'm perfectly honest, I'm not your man. I've not demonstrated that as yet. I hope I can demonstrate that moving forward but my career to date doesn't suggest that.

“But certainly from a development perspective and certainly from creating a style of play and a way a team performs, I have demonstrated that over the course. And I would like to think the four or five years that I have had out of football, not just the education I had at Brentford but I have also been working on my university career, all of those in the mix I hope brings a different type of leadership than I gave before. Hopefully with that leadership we can bring some form of success.” PA Media.

Does anyone here have Club World Cup fever yet?

Do you have a question for Emma Hayes? Get in touch below!

Joe Pearson gets in touch: “My story concerns a different kind of footballer, the NFL kind. My wife and I were returning from Hawaii on a red-eye in 1990, I think. We had been upgraded to first class as a gift. Sat right across the aisle from us was Billy Sims, Heisman Trophy winner and former running back for the Detroit Lions. Given that it was basically the middle of the night, I did not approach him at all. Opportunity missed, I guess.”

Keep across all the deals here.

Mikey Moore is excited to show new Tottenham boss Thomas Frank what he can do – but the teenager's immediate focus is ending an unforgettable breakthrough campaign with another European trophy.

The winger was given his chance by Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked last week but with have to reset for his new head coach. “With Ange, I'm thankful to him,” Moore said. “He gave me an opportunity to go and show people what I could do. Now I'm just excited to get back and hopefully go and impress the new manager. Try and show what I can do, really. I started away at Brentford, where obviously he was in charge, and I've played against his team before.

“I've heard that he's a good man and he's a good manager. One of the boys here (with the Under-19s) works under him and says good things about him, so I'm just excited to get going under him, really.” PA Media

Thomas Frank is now the main man at Tottenham. John Brewin takes a look at what he needs to sort out.

Real Madrid have beaten off plenty of competition to sign teenage sensation Franco Mastantuono from River Plate. Most of the top clubs in Europe were eager to acquire the Argentinian but Xabi Alonso has won the race.

“It's not a footballers on holiday story but is along those lines,” writes Martin Cruise. “I was once working away in glamorous Telford where upon walking into the hotel bar I strangely seemed to recognise everyone I looked at despite being away on my own. After a queue at the bar for a drink alongside more men I recognised I sat somewhat discombobulated at a table thinking I was in some sort of fever dream.

“I went back for another swift pint and a rather large gent bumped into me on his way out of the gents at which point I recognised the recently departed Uriah Rennie. He apologised and I said “just a yellow on this occasion” to a giant smile and a chuckle from Mr Rennie. It then dawned on me that the entire bar was filled with Premier League referees (your Mike Riley's, Phil Dowd's and so on) on their training activities in what was then the new era of professional refs.”

That is lovely stuff.

Juventus head coach Igor Tudor has signed a new deal with the club, running until June 2027, with the option of a further year.

The Croatian took the role in March and proved himself in the final months of the season that he deserved a long-term crack at the gig. Tudor will lead Juventus at the Club World Cup, where they will play Manchester City, Al Ain and Wydad AC.

Brentford are expected to target an external candidate to replace Thomas Frank despite holding talks with Keith Andrews about stepping up from his role as set-piece coach.
 The former Republic of Ireland midfielder has emerged as a potential candidate for the post after Frank's departure was confirmed on Thursday night. Andrews joined Brentford last summer and is highly regarded by Brentford but it is understood he is unlikely to be given his first senior role in management despite being made the favourite by some bookmakers. 
 Brentford's owner, Matthew Benham, is believed to have considered promoting Justin Cochrane from his role as Frank's assistant until the 43-year-old former midfielder, who is part of Thomas Tuchel's England staff, opted to join Tottenham instead. 
 That means that Brentford are likely to turn their attention to other candidates thought to include Ipswich's Kieran McKenna - who is a long-term target - and the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic.

I really enjoyed this from the great John Brewin this week. You should too.

Tottenham have filed high court proceedings against Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos over a terminated sponsorship agreement.

Court records show Spurs filed a commercial claim at the high court against Ineos Automotive on Thursday, though no documents are available. Chemicals firm Ineos agreed a five-year deal with Spurs in 2022 - before Ratcliffe bought a stake in United – for Ineos Grenadier to become the London team's official 4x4 vehicle partner.

Ineos said in a statement: “Ineos Automotive has been a partner of Tottenham Hotspur since 2022, expanding on a partnership agreement that Ineos Group had in place with the club since 2020. We have a contractual right to terminate our partnership contract and in December 2024 exercised that right.”

Spurs declined to comment.

In March it was announced Ineos had reached a settlement with New Zealand Rugby in relation to a sponsorship deal. The previous month, NZR had said it had launched legal proceedings against Ineos after alleging that the first instalment of 2025 sponsorship money due under a six-year agreement struck in 2021 had not been paid.

Chris Boyle reminisces: “When I was nine we stayed at the same resort in Portugal as legendary striker John Aldridge. As a Liverpool-mad kid, this was incredible, even more so as John and his family were very down to earth and friendly. I have happy memories of him and my Dad ‘singing' La Bamba on karaoke. To add to the football-Stella Street vibe, Lee Dixon was also there (from memory he spent the time chasing after his small children and looking harassed) and we bumped into Joe Jordan at a water park. My days of holidaying alongside top flight footballers are highly unlikely to return (and much less appealing in my 40s tbf).”

Shaun Tooze gets in touch: “Met John Barnes in the queue at Qatar airport getting on the plane back to the UK (I was just connecting from Thailand) and we had a good old chat about the 1987/88 season - Barnes was on fire that season and I'd been lucky enough to see him play a handful of times (the 4-0 v QPR being the stand out.)

“Anyway, he was really normal, just a humble guy and you could see the glow as he recalled ‘They were happy days' and other bits.

“One thing that sticks out is that none of the flight crew knew who he was as I protested ‘ That's John Barnes...John Barnes!' after he'd passed them, and I just remember feeling deflated that none of them who he was.

“But I didn't bother him again because I didn't want to get all ‘fanboy' and in his face. (He was in economy by the way).

“Anyway. John Barnes. Nice guy.”

Fraser Mann emails: “On the topic of meeting footballers on holiday, me and my family shared a lift in a Spanish airport with Pat Jennings some time in the mid 80s. My mum had always had a bit of crush on him and was all over the shop to be stood so near to him. I said, ‘hello Mr Jennings, are you on holiday?' and he chuckled and said, ‘I hope so, otherwise I'm a bit far from home'. At which point, we all laughed very loudly as if it was the funniest thing anyone has said EVER. Cue awkward silence until the lift door opened and Pat left saying, ‘Be nice to your mum, son.'

“A strange encounter with the big handed Irish legend I'll think you'll agree. My mum still can't really talk about it.”

And rightly so.

This was published while I as on holiday. I hunted down some of the very few UK-based Chelsea and Man City fans heading over for the Club World Cup and asked “why?”.

In the meantime … Caio Carrieri has been chatting the Palmeiras president Leila Pereira.

“People think women are the weaker sex, and we're not. I fight back. If they hit me, I hit back – but much harder. The way I hit back is by continuing to work and by showcasing Palmeiras's work.”

Thank you Yara. Go enjoy the sunshine. Speaking of which … I was on holiday last week and the former Nottingham Forest and Manchester City manager Frank Clark was at the same hotel. I considered confronting him to ask why he played striker Craig Russell at left-back during his Maine Road days. Then I remember it was 30 years ago and Clark is now in his 80s. This, however, leads to the question … when have you met a footballer on holiday?

That is all from me today. Will Unwin is on deck to take you through the afternoon's stories. Happy Friday!

Bayer Leverkusen are expected to make an offer for Manchester City's James McAtee when the transfer window reopens according to multiple reports.

The 22-year-old is currently captaining the England U21s in Slovakia and any move to Germany cannot progress until after the U21s Euros and Club World Cup.

City expect a fee of at least £25m plus add-ons for McAtee. The player is understood to be keen to join Leverkusen if the clubs can come to an agreement.

Cardiff City are inching towards the appointment of Brian Barry-Murphy as their manager, as a protracted process heads towards the end game. The 46-year-old was appointed as Ruud van Nistelrooy's assistant by Leicester last December but Cardiff are expected to trigger his release.

Van Nistelrooy remains in the dark over his own future after relegation from the Premier League and the expectation remains that the Dutchman will leave this summer. Cardiff have flip-flopped over the decision after holding advanced talks with Des Buckingham, who is out of work after leaving Oxford, before landing on Barry-Murphy, whose only job as a No 1 was at Rochdale.

Aaron Ramsey also held discussions about taking the job on a permanent basis but the 34-year-old has agreed to prolong his playing career in Mexico with Pumas with a view of playing at the 2026 World Cup.

The postbag is here with some of your thoughts on the CWC, Wirtz and more.

Rick on Liverpool's newest acquisition:

For what it's Wirtz: it is truly wonderful that Liverpool have splashed the cash for Florian Wirtz as his fabulous talent will light up the PL next season and also make the Reds far more enjoyable to watch with real midfield creativity injected into the more effort based approach that has been the mainstay of the Klopp years and Slot's first season.

Makes a change to see the best player in the Bundesliga go to England rather than Munich or Madrid.

John on heatwave solutions:

As an Aussie who lives in the cooler City of Melbourne, I can attest to the temperature gauge getting it massively wrong from time to time.

Playing cricket in summertime in Australia is a mixed bag, but when you are playing in the middle of summer the heat doesn't miss you.

The air temperature said 35C on this hot day, but in the middle it felt like 42C. Needless to say standing around in white isn't as near taxing as running full tilt For 100 minutes as Footballers do. Short drinks break will be handy but not a solution. Maybe 7 subs per game?

And Rogorn on comparing the PL to Europe:

The wording of this bit of news reminds me of what I used to call the Matt Derbyshire Dilemma a few years ago, which was: would you rather play for Blackburn Rovers or Olympiacos? (That's how the club spells it now in Latin alphabet, by the way) I don't mean the league-winning 1995 Rovers or the current version down in the second tier, but the Rovers of around 2006, when they were middle of the Premier League table. (A few years ago, did I say? Blimey, it's 20 years ago!) I used the question to spark a debate whether English players would have a more interesting career staying in a 9th to 12th-placed club in England season after season or venturing into “lesser” (all due respect) continental sides, with a big chance of a league trophy and Champions League football. Derbyshire was the perfect example of that at a time when top English players abroad were a rarity. Of course, for a Greek player like Kostoulas the version of the MDD is different.

Gabriel Magalhães has described the Arsenal transfer target Rodrygo as a “phenomenon” and admitted he would like to see him join the north London club.

The Real Madrid winger, who plays with Gabriel for Brazil, is of interest to Arsenal this summer as they look to strengthen their attack after falling short in the Premier League race this season.

According to reports Rodrygo is questioning his future at Real Madrid amid fierce competition for places. The Brazilian is competing for places in the starting XI with Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior.

Asked if he knows whether Rodrygo is coming to Arsenal, Gabriel told the Podpah podcast in Brazil: “I don't know. I would like it but who knows? Rodrygo for me is a phenomenon. People are mentioning his name a lot. If it was up to me, of course. As I said, he is a phenomenon.”

David Beckham has been awarded a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours. The former England captain, a winner of league titles in four countries and of 115 national team caps, has been awarded the honour for services to sport and to charity.

Sir David also won the Champions League as part of Manchester United's treble-winning team in 1999, and since retiring as a player has become a founder and co-owner of American team Inter Miami.
 He has worked as an ambassador for the worldwide charity UNICEF since 2005 and since last year has been an ambassador for the King's Foundation.

Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour. To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true.

“Off the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation. I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.

“It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.”

Rachel Daly, one of the stars of the England women's team which won the European Championship on home soil in 2022, has been made an MBE. The Harrogate-born star, 33, plays for Aston Villa in the Women's Super League but retired from international football last year.

Daly said: “I am greatly honoured to receive an MBE. This award is not just for me, but for everyone who has supported me and worked alongside me. It's a very proud moment for me and my family.”

Chelsea's first match at the Club World Cup is against Los Angeles FC where they will meet a familiar foe in Hugo Lloris.

The former Tottenham goalkeeper took some time to settle in but is now one of the MLS's best. Lloris played a pivotal role in getting LAFC to the tournament by making a big save late in extra time during the play-in match against Club América, one of Mexico's perennial powers.

The score was tied 1-1 in the 109th minute when Club América's Javairô Dilrosun (who, interestingly, has just signed with LAFC ahead of the Club World Cup) fired a blistering shot from eight yards out after a give-and-go with Diego Valdes. But Lloris reacted quickly and pivoted to his left to deflect the ball away from the near post. Six minutes later, Denis Bouanga scored to give LAFC a 2-1 victory.

Joseph D'Hippolito has the lowdown from Lloris and his teammates on his time in LA.

Brighton have signed the teenage forward Charalampos Kostoulas, who gave up a Champions League season with Olympiakos to play in the Premier League.

The 18-year-old Kostoulas signed a five-year contract, Brighton said, with the transfer fee reportedly set at an initial €35m.
 “It is a dream for everybody to come here and play football,” the Greece Under-21 striker said. He scored seven goals in 22 games in the Greek league as Olympiakos won a record-extending 48th title and completed a trophy double in the domestic cup.

Olympiakos was elevated directly into the lucrative Champions League opening phase — because title-holder Paris Saint-Germain already secured a place by winning the French league — and will play eight games in the single-standings league. Brighton finished eighth in the Premier League and did not qualify for European football. Associated Press

Thomas Frank and Spurs are a good fit on paper but the north London job will be a tough one for the Dane. Frank is tactically flexible but can be a slow starter and has limited experience in managing sides competing in Europe. Plus he arrives as the love still lingers for Ange Postecoglou after the Australian delivered Tottenham's first trophy since 2008 and the club's first European trophy since 1984.

Frank has limited experience of balancing the domestic league and Europe, the furthest he ever took Brøndby being the fourth qualifying round of the Europa League. His European record is notably poor: played 10, won three, and two of those were against Juvenes/Dogana of San Marino. His record in domestic cups, similarly, is dismal; his past history makes it unlikely a poor league season could be redeemed by other silverware – although the depth of the Spurs squad perhaps means the cups will not be such a low priority.

There is one further doubt, which is more to do with Spurs than with Frank. He is leaving an exceptionally well-run club, at which every component worked together to a coherent philosophy. There can be no certainty that any one cog from that system, however important, can achieve success in a different environment, something Chelsea have found as they accumulate more and more parts from Brighton without ever looking like replicating the efficiency of the Brighton model. It may be that such efficiency is not even possible at bigger clubs.

Read Jonathan Wilson's full assessment below.

Tottenham confirmed the appointment of Thomas Frank last night after holding talks via ­intermediaries and plainly keen to avoid a protracted search for the ­person to lead them forward following a season in which they finished 17th with 38 points.

Spurs have been impressed by more than the headline items of Frank's Brentford tenure – the ­promotion from the Championship via the playoffs in 2021, how he has established them in the Premier League, finishing 13th, ninth, 16th and 10th. Frank consistently over-achieved in relation to his financial means at Brentford; they have one of the smallest budgets in the division. An excellent ­communicator and noted developer of young ­talent, he has also shown himself to be ­tactically flexible.

Thomas Frank has penned a letter to Brentford supporters after deciding to leave the west London club nine years on from when he came in.

To everyone associated with Brentford Football Club.

The time has come for me to move on. But, even as I leave, I know I have left a big piece of my heart at Brentford, not just at the football club but with the community and, of course, the incredible and loyal supporters.

I want to extend my profound gratitude to the club for giving me the chance to pursue my dreams and for everyone involved who made the journey such a memorable one.

For my family and I, it has been a privilege to be allowed to be part of such a special community - it's an experience and adventure that we will cherish for life. So, thank you.

Whatever we have achieved, we have achieved together, and our success is built on unity, spirit, courage and ambition at every level of the club and amongst the fans.

Everybody has contributed, and every contribution has been invaluable. I am not just leaving a football club, I am saying goodbye to friends whose support through good and bad times I will carry with me always.

I would like to say a special word of thanks to Matthew Benham [Brentford owner]. His trust and friendship have meant so much and the fact he gave me a chance in English football means I will always owe him a debt of gratitude. Thank you, Matt.

So, while this is a goodbye, I hope the relationships I have built with everybody will be lasting ones and, of course, we will meet again in the wonderful world of football.

Thank you,

Thomas

Florian Wirtz has equally impressed for Germany. After missing the 2022 World Cup due to his ACL injury. He returned to the national side in 2024, scoring his first goal for Germany in seven seconds against France to become the second fastest goalscorer in international football history behind Austria's Christoph Baumgartner.

Wirtz was named in Germany's squad for the 2024 Euros 2024 where he scored the opener of the tournament in a 5–1 victory against Scotland, becoming the youngest German player to score in the European Championship. Against Spain in the quarter-final, Wirtz came off the bench to score an 89th-minute equalising goal but Spain went on to win in extra-time.

A possible British transfer record is nothing to scoff at but the fact Liverpool only spent around £10m on Federico Chiesa last summer combined with the finances that come with winning the Premier League, means the club seem to be happy to spend big to support Arne Slot.

With Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving the club, there are likely concerns about where Liverpool's creative output comes from. While the two do not play the same position, Wirtz can fill help bridge that gap as a player who can progress the ball forward effectively.

Liverpool's pursuit of Florian Wirtz has been no secret. The club fought off interest from Manchester City and Bayern Munich with the German only wanting to join Arne Slot's side. Wirtz, who can play across the frontline, is one of the most coveted players in Europe and was understood to be impressed by Liverpool's plans.

The 22-year-old has spent his entire senior career at Bayer Leverkusen. He was instrumental in breaking the chokehold Munich have on the Bundesliga by helping his side win their first ever league title and the DFB-Pokal in 2023-24 with 18 goals and 19 assists in 47 games, showing no signs of his ACL injury in 2022 being an issue.

Last season, Leverkusen finished runners-up to the German giants and Wirtz managed 16 goals and 14 assists in all competitions. According to Opta, only Mohamed Salah (18) and Lamine Yamal (13) recorded more than his 12 assists from open play among players from Europe's top five leagues.

With the fee agreed between the two clubs Liverpool is now free to speak to Wirtz to agree on personal terms.

Liverpool have agreed a fee with Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz. The German will join the Premier League champions in an £100m deal plus £16m in potential add-ons that would make Wirtz the most expensive British transfer of all time, eclipsing Chelsea's £115m purchase of Moises Caicedo.

He will undergo a medical and finalise the transfer in the coming days. Personal terms have already been agreed.

The Club World Cup starts on Sunday and has already been controversial because of extra fixtures and Fifa involvement. Add on that temperatures in US are likely to be above 30C and whew.

Notable heat events are not guaranteed during the Club World Cup but they are more likely to happen than in the past because of climate breakdown and there is a question over whether enough is being done to adapt to a new reality. The sole reference to extreme weather in Fifa's regulations for the Club World Cup relates to the use of cooling breaks, which allow players to take on extra fluids once in each half if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (a measure of heat stress that includes humidity and air movement) exceeds 32C on the pitch. This is the protocol in place since 2014, and for the international players' union, FifPro, it is insufficient. It argues that the threshold for cooling breaks should be between 28C and 32C under the WBGT, with options for a second drinks break per half. If the heat rises above 32C, FifPro argues, matches should be rescheduled.

Erling Haaland publicly shared how much he missed Jack Grealish on Manchester City's flight to the United States.

Manchester City officially touched down on U.S. soil ahead of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup with some new faces in blue. Rayan Cherki, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders made the trip overseas and are all expected to feature in the newly expanded tournament.

Grealish, though, did not make the cut. The England international was left out of Pep Guardiola's squad after another underwhelming season. Speculation continues to mount of an impending exit for the 29-year-old, keeping him out of Guardiola's plans this summer.

Manchester City are firmly focused on the future, but Haaland is still reminiscing about the past. The striker couldn't help but share the photo of an empty seat next to him on the flight to the United States. Grealish was always the person next to Haaland on travel days, but now, the Norway captain was forced to sit alone.

Erling Haaland 💔 Jack Grealish pic.twitter.com/KZXQ1VHenX

“Jack Grealish where are you?” Haaland posted on social media. 

Grealish only recorded a single goal and assist in 20 Premier League appearances in the 2024–25 season. Across all competitions, he found the back of the net just three times. Although he featured in every FA Cup game on the road to the final, he then was benched against Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium.

The forward recently let his frustrations out on social media when he replied to a fan's criticism with the following: “Haha I've been bad lately? Scored three goals in my last three appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x.” Grealish also commented, “What u want me to do, score a hatty in 20?”

Grealish's future destination remains uncertain, but it is very likely Haaland will have to find a permanent new travelling companion very soon.

Manchester City, meanwhile, kick off their FIFA Club World Cup campaign against Wydad on Wednesday, June 18. Along with Grealish, the Cityzens will also be without Napoli-bound Kevin De Bruyne, the injured Mateo Kovačic and James McAtee, who is representing England at the Under-21 European Championship.

Defending champions Manchester City finished trophyless and scrambling for Champions League qualification last season.

Manager: Pep Guardiola
Star player: Rodri
Fixtures: Wydad (June 18), Al Ain (June 23), Juventus (June 26)

Manchester City endured a season, just passed, unthinkable only a year ago when Pep Guardiola was leading the expensively assembled unit to an unprecedented fourth consecutive English Premier League title.

In 2023, City claimed five trophies in the calendar year, including finally cracking the Champions League to be crowned kings of Europe.

This last season could not have been a more stark contrast as the defence of their title was left in tatters by a run of form unthinkable for a squad, let alone a team, of City's strength. Guardiola at one stage described his side as “weak and vulnerable” while his side was on a run of one win in 13 games, of which they lost nine. A defeat by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final capped a campaign to forget for the Cityzens.

Would Guardiola be up for the rebuild, and was that what was required? The answer appears to be “yes” to both questions.

Abdukodir Khusanov and Omar Marmoush were recruited from Lens and Eintracht Frankfurt respectively in January in an immediate response to the downturn in on-field fortunes. It helped in some way with City recovering to secure third spot in the English top flight and Champions League qualification with it.

Three summer signings have since been secured, and more appear to be on the way, while Kevin De Bruyne has been allowed to leave and former club captain – and England international – Kyle Walker could also be on his way.

The FIFA Club World Cup could prove to be the preseason Guardiola needs to kick-start City's resurgence ahead of the next campaign.

City lifted the Club World Cup for the first time as part of their 2023 five-trophy sweep.

Alongside their domestic league and FA Cup double, City won the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup before completing a unique set with the defeat of Brazilian side Flamengo in the Club World Cup.

The latter three titles were all firsts for City, who only just missed out on a sixth trophy that year when they were beaten by Southampton in the English Football League Cup final.

City may have had a season to forget but their qualification for the Club World Cup is based on performances over a four-year period. That time includes the four straight Premier League titles and the Champions League first last season.

They are also the defending champions of the Club World Cup from its older format in 2023.

City have moved swiftly to secure the summer signings of defender Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolverhampton Wanderers and forward Rayan Cherki from Lyon while a deal for AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders is understood to have been agreed upon, although the official announcement has yet to be made.

The Manchester City manager is the most successful coach in Club World Cup history with four wins.

The Spaniard's first two titles came with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 – and included Lionel Messi, who is lining up for Inter Miami at this edition.

Guardiola then lifted the trophy again with Bayern Munich in 2013 – a third victory in the tournament in five years.

The 54-year-old had to wait a further 10 years for the next title when he lifted the trophy with City in Saudi Arabia in December 2023 to complete the incredible year for the Manchester-based club.

While City find themselves in the US for the CWC, they are facing serious charges by authorities back home. Club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said City are being “patient” as they wait for the verdict on charges of alleged breaches of Premier League financial rules.

City were referred to an independent commission in February 2023 over the charges, which the club strongly deny.

The case was heard between September and December last year, but no decision has yet been announced.

“Well, I suppose the only thing I can say is we still don't have a ruling,” Khaldoon said at the end of May.

“Once there's a ruling, I'll be able to speak about it. Until then, we just have to be patient, and it'll come, and we will talk about it, I promise you, once we have the ruling.”

City could face a points deduction, a heavy fine or even relegation from the Premier League if they are found guilty.

City were charged with failing to report accurate financial information for nine seasons stretching from 2009-10 to 2017-18, as well as failing to provide full details of former manager Roberto Mancini's pay between 2009-10 and 2012-13.

They are also charged with failing to provide full details of remuneration in contracts with players between 2010-11 and 2015-16, and with failing to cooperate with the investigation over a period from 2018 to 2023.

Chelsea's quest to add another trophy to their growing cabinet gets underway on Monday when they take on LAFC in their Club World Cup opener.

Todd Boehly will no doubt be keen to get his hands on a second honour after the Blues secured Conference League glory last month.

Despite the competition disrupting their build up for the new Premier League season, Enzo Maresca has taken a strong squad to the United States. This includes new signing Liam Delap and star loanee Andrey Santos.

The American has been an advocate in the past for less games to be played in the footballing calendar, with the Blues adding anywhere between three and seven games to their already busy 2024/25 campaign.

However, finance expert Adam Williams has claimed he believes the Club World Cup is a competition the owner would love to make a regular feature for his side, and instead make changes elsewhere.

He exclusively told The Chelsea Chronicle that Boehly would love to cut down the extortionate wage bill by not needing as many players on the books to play in a reduced schedule.

He said: “I think the Club World Cup is a litmus test in terms of what Todd Boehly and Clearlake want at Chelsea.

“Boehly has said that the fixture calendar is too crowded and that they need to reduce the number of matches. But what he really means is that there should be fewer less lucrative matches. The Club World Cup could be worth up to £100m in prize money, so that's definitely not the type of event he wants removed from the calendar.

“Instead, he probably wants to scrap the League Cup and reduce the size of the Premier League. That way, you keep fixture congestion relatively limited, you lose less money to injuries and you can maybe cut the size of your squad and reduce your wage bill. I think if you look at the research, if you can remove seven or eight competitive matches from the calendar then that can let you have quite a brutal revision when it comes to the size of your squad.

I know Chelsea have a massive squad at the moment and that has been one of the hallmarks of this nascent phase under Boehly and Clearlake, but that's not the long-term vision. In my view, they're using their squad now as a player trading base – they are going to continue to trim the fat and make money in the process in the coming years. Or, at least, that is the plan.

“Their camp for the Club World Cup is 28 players and they're all on big wages. The wage bill was £338m last season, down a bit from the previous year but still high. If they can reduce the total number of matches and replace some of the lost ones with matches like the Club World Cup or money-spinning friendlies in big commercial markets, they are going to be laughing.

“Because you're replacing less lucrative matches with more lucrative ones, you're probably at a net neutral position financially in terms of revenue, but your costs are lower because you don't have to pay as significant wages.“

Some of the methods utilised by the new Chelsea owners can certainly be described as unique, and something the Premier League has not seen before.

However, Boehly is clearly trying to disrupt the recognised big three in the Premier League, with Williams stating that those in charge at Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool disagree with his way of thinking in terms of the football calendar.

He said: “Some owners take a different view. I think the received wisdom among clubs like Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool has been that more matches equals more money, which can only be a good thing. But Boehly and a couple of other guys are looking at it in a different way.“

The American will be keen to see his side get off to the perfect start against MLS opposition when they get underway in the Club World Cup on Monday night.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

                The completely revamped Club World Cup men's soccer tournament kicks off Saturday, with 63 games to be played over the next month.

The Club World Cup men's soccer tournament is set to kick off at stadiums across the U.S. on Saturday, with some of the world's top teams competing for a brand new trophy — and a whole lot of cash.

The 32-team tournament represents a bold gamble by FIFA to unveil a completely revamped version of a tournament that was previously far smaller. For the U.S., it will be an opportunity to host a major event a year before the country co-stages the World Cup with Canada and Mexico.

But the new format has been controversial. Players have complained about adding yet more games to an already congested calendar. Ticket sales have been sluggish, forcing FIFA to slash prices under a dynamic pricing model that it has introduced for the first time.

Then again, there's the money: a $1 billion pot that will be spread out among all participating teams, with the winner set to take up to $125 million.

Here are five things to know about the Club World Cup, taking place over the next month.

It's not technically new. The previous versions of the Club World Cup were fairly low key, consisting of the champions of the top regional club competition around the world (mostly six or seven teams in total), and it was held annually.

This is the turbo-charged version. 

Under FIFA President Gianni Infantino, the tournament has been expanded to 32 teams, a mix of regional champions from recent years and others selected based on regional rankings. Even the trophy was given a huge redesign.  

It will now be held every four years, and it marks FIFA's ambitious attempt to introduce a much more global club tournament.

This year's edition will consist of 63 games played across 11 cities around the U.S.  They include the opening game at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday between Inter Miami and Al Ahly from Egypt at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. The final will be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on July 13.

The streaming platform DAZN has the global rights and will offer all games free. TNT Sports will also co-broadcast 24 games under a special deal with DAZN.


                Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembélé, seen during a UEFA Nations League semifinal match earlier this month against Spain, is among the players to watch at the Club World Cup.

Some of the top and best known teams around the world will be playing, including Real Madrid from Spain, Bayern Munich from Germany, Inter Milan from Italy and River Plate from Argentina. It's an opportunity to watch some of the best players in the world, including Kylian Mbappé at Real Madrid, Ousmane Dembélé at Paris Saint-Germain and Lionel Messi from Inter Miami.

European clubs will have the most representatives — 12 — but not all top teams are taking part. Some notable absences, for example, include FC Barcelona from Spain and Liverpool FC from England.

Instead, in a bid to globalize the tournament further, other less well-known clubs are getting a chance to participate, including Urawa Red Diamonds from Japan, Mamelodi Sundowns from South Africa, and Auckland City FC, an amateur club from New Zealand.

No surprise here: European teams are seen as the top contenders.

A European team has won 16 of the previous 20 versions of the Club World Cup, including the past 11 editions in a row.

But South American teams could provide some steep competition. Brazil's Botafogo is the most recent winner of the top South American regional tournament, Copa Libertadores.

There will be some high-profile match-ups. Among European sides, PSG — the most recent Champions League winner — is set to face Atlético Madrid from Spain in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. And Juventus from Italy will face Manchester City on June 26 in Orlando.

Meanwhile, Bayern Munich and Argentinian top side Boca Juniors will clash on June 20 in Miami, while Inter Milan will face River Plate on June 25 in Seattle. 


                The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup isn't exactly the hottest ticket in town, but FIFA President Gianni Infantino, pictured last month during the 75th FIFA congress at the CONMEBOL headquarters in Paraguay, has said he thinks more fans will get interested once matches actually start.

Mainly because of a question many players — and fans — have posed: Is this revamped tournament even necessary? 

FIFA didn't respond to requests for comment. But FIFPRO, the union representing players worldwide, has been very critical of the tournament.

Its European body teamed up with leagues in Europe and Spain's La Liga to file a complaint against FIFA to the European Commission, arguing the Club World Cup was contributing to an ""oversaturated international football calendar"" that was putting ""player safety and wellbeing"" at risk.

Across the soccer world, players usually compete with their clubs on their domestic leagues as well as in separate domestic championships. The top teams also go on to play in regional tournaments like the Champions League or the Copa Libertadores — and then some players have to represent their national squads, as well. It can be a packed calendar.

And the organization has argued the tournament will help grow the sport globally even further, saying it would steer $250 million to soccer clubs around the world.

Not quite.

A recent look through the ticket inventory shows plenty of seats remain available across a broad swath of games, including for marquee matches such as PSG versus Atlético Madrid, although some teams like Real Madrid have proven to be bigger draws. Even the final match on July 13 has yet to sell out.

Controversially, FIFA implemented dynamic pricing and initially started selling tickets at prices that were considered too high for many fans — such as $100-$200 for group games. But FIFA has since slashed prices, while introducing promotions to boost sales.

Take the opening game on Saturday. To avoid having big chunks of empty seats, FIFA dropped prices and collaborated with Miami Dade College to offer up to four complementary tickets for fans who buy a single one for $20, meaning a cost of just $4 per person to see Messi, according to an email seen by NPR.

FIFA's Infantino has tried to manage expectations, telling media he believes more fans will get interested once play gets underway.

That may be FIFA's big hope — because so far, the unveiling of the Club World Cup has been bumpy.

What next for the AFC World Cup 2026 qualifiers?

Qatar and Saudi Arabia will host the Asian qualifying playoffs for the 2026 World Cup, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) have confirmed.

Six teams, the third and fourth-placed sides from the recent Asian third round of qualifying, will be divided into two groups of three teams.

They will battle each other in a centralised format from October 8 to 14, 2025, the AFC said in a statement on Friday.

The group winners will secure the two remaining automatic berths at the World Cup.

The runners-up from each group will play two matches on November 13 and 18, with the winners qualifying for the inter-confederation playoffs, through which they could win a spot at the World Cup.

The draw for the next, and final, round of qualifying in Asia is scheduled for July 17.

The venues for each of the matches will be confirmed thereafter.

The third round of qualifying constituted three groups of six, with the top two teams from each group automatically qualifying for the World Cup, filling six of the AFC's eight slots at the 2026 edition of world football's showpiece event.

The third- and fourth-placed teams from each group progressed to the final round of the AFC qualifiers, hoping to win one of the rapidly dwindling spots at the World Cup finals.

The bottom two teams from each of those groups were eliminated – Palestine being the last side to see their hopes of progressing ended when they were defeated by a late penalty for Oman, who claimed fourth spot in Group B as a result.

It was the furthest Palestine had reached in their attempts to qualify for a World Cup.

Japan were the first team to secure their place at the tournament, which is to be hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico, when they swept through Group C. Australia, in the same group, claimed their place in second spot with a final day win against Saudi Arabia, who could have leapt above the Socceroos with a win.

Jordan and Uzbekistan both finished second in their groups, behind South Korea and Iraq respectively, sealing their first appearances at at World Cup.

Indonesia, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the six teams still in with a chance of reaching the World Cup finals.

AFC Asian Cup champions, and hosts of the 2022 World Cup, Qatar endured a mixed campaign to finish fourth in Group A, with UAE claiming third.

Indonesia, hoping for only a second appearance at the World Cup finals, secured the fourth spot in Group C, seeing off a late charge from China, who missed out on qualification for the next stage alongside Bahrain. Saudi Arabia finished third in that group.

Iraq and Oman finished third and fourth, respectively, in Group B.

The next edition of the Asian Cup will be played in 2027. Saudi Arabia, which will also host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, has been named the host nation.

The first round of AFC qualifying for the tournament began in October 2023, and saw 20 teams (ranked 27 to 46) playing home and away playoffs, with the 10 winners progressing.

The second round saw the teams ranked 1-26 join the qualification process, with the 36 teams split into nine groups. The round was played across 2023 and 2024.

The winners and runners-up of the nine groups progressed not only to the 2027 Asian Cup, but also to the AFC World Cup qualifying groups.

A third round of qualifiers is currently in progress to find out who will line up at the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, alongside the 18 teams that have just completed the AFC qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Welcome to the dress rehearsal for a year from now when a chunk of the soccer world will descend on Seattle.

This one, though, comes with a new twist on an attempt to bring together the international soccer community.

Clubs instead of countries. Some of the biggest names in international soccer playing competitive games in Seattle. A decidedly local angle and an opportunity for Sounders FC that may never come again.

And an event that also begs the question: Will anyone really care?

“We're all looking at this with a prism of this has never happened and we don't really know how this is going to play out,” said ESPN analyst and former Sounders goalkeeper Kasey Keller.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will kick off on Sunday night when the local side Sounders FC will face Brazilian club Botafogo for the first of six matches to be played at Lumen Field over the next two weeks.

The tournament will bring some of the biggest club names in international soccer to the Pacific Northwest, with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, River Plate and Atlético Madrid all slated for games during the first playing of this tournament in its newly expanded format.

For FIFA and local officials, the Club World Cup is essentially a test event for next year when the FIFA Men's World Cup comes to Seattle for six matches over a three-week span that is expected to bring a significant number of international visitors and attention to the city and region.

“We'll be looking very closely at sort of the security, the crowd control. We've been discussing, kind of improvements on how we move people in and around the stadium, and so those things all will be very much examined,” said Peter Tomozawa, CEO of Seattle's organizing committee for next year's tournament. “It is, in a way, a dress rehearsal for the World Cup.”

While next year is expected to turn the city into a cultural melting pot of soccer fans from around the world descending on the city, that will not be the case for this year's tournament. There are strong signs that even the most die-hard soccer fans aren't interested in spending their dollars to see some of these big clubs play in Seattle with uncertainty of how many of the top players for those teams might even see the field, although the initial rosters released for the event show teams are brining the majority of their stars. FIFA has slashed ticket prices in markets around the country, including Seattle, hoping that games don't end up getting played inside significantly empty stadiums.

For the Sounders, the opportunity to play competitive matches against the likes of the current UEFA Champions League winners PSG and Atlético Madrid may never come again. But the backdrop to the matches has come with controversy over bonus payouts for the players of the three Major League Soccer teams participating in the event.

The Sounders went as far as a public protest before their last home match against Minnesota United on June 1.

If the Club World Cup sounds familiar, you'd be correct. The tournament dates to 2000, including the 2022 version (played in February 2023) that included the Sounders as a participant. Their participation lasted one match in Morocco where they were eliminated by Egyptian side Al Ahly.

At that time, the tournament included only the champions of the six confederations around the world, plus a host team. The tournament usually took place during the winter and lasted about 10 days.

But with the growing interest in club soccer around the world and the Men's World Cup being held in North America next year, FIFA saw an opportunity — both for exposure and financial gain — to launch plans for an expanded tournament for 2025.

The 32-team event will follow a similar format to the World Cup, with each team guaranteed three group stage matches, and the top two teams in each group advancing to a knockout bracket. The final will be on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The uniqueness of the Club World Cup lies with the chance to see players that may not otherwise appear in a World Cup playing for their country. Will Norway qualify for the World Cup? No idea, but Erling Haaland and Manchester City will be here this summer. Turkey might not qualify either, but Inter Milan midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu might be the best player at his position in the world and will play in Seattle twice. Luka Modric is leaving Real Madrid after the Club World Cup and there's no guarantee he'll be back next year with Croatia.

But player participation has come begrudgingly with growing concerns about overuse, especially for European players just finishing a long club season and knowing that next year will be another long campaign with additional matches for those hoping to play in the World Cup itself.

“It really is a concern for players' well-being. Players are facing greater levels of possible injury just by nature of anytime you play more games there's more risk of injury because you're playing more. ,” said Ron Krabill, professor and director of the Global Sports Lab at UW.

The favorites are clear and obvious because they are the current powers of world soccer: Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Chelsea. But, depending on the rosters each club brings, an unexpected team could emerge as a contender. 

Sounders general manager Craig Waibel said the tournament will mean more when it's played next in 2029 because someone will have four years to brag about it.

“It's a trophy no one owns, and so there's no jealousy right now. And I think jealousy in sports has a value that transcends a lot of a lot of just the moments,” Waibel said.  

As an enticement for clubs and players to take the competition seriously, FIFA created a $1 billion prize pool for the tournament. But that's also led to issues for at least one team playing in Seattle: the Sounders.

When MLS and its players agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 2021, an expanded Club World Cup including MLS teams wasn't even a dream. Now it's a reality, and the split of the money the three MLS teams will get from the event is leaving the players feeling shortchanged.

As part of the prize pool from FIFA, the three MLS teams are ensured of earning at least $9.55 million each from their participation. The teams can earn another $2 million for wins and $1 million for a draw in the group stage, while advancing to the knockout round would garner another $7.5 million.

That is — and could be — a lot of money for a franchise and its players.

However, the CBA agreed to in 2021 created a 90/10 split between teams and players for events like this, meaning of that $9.55 million guaranteed to the Sounders less than $1 million would go to the players to be split.

The frustration from players at such a paltry payment structure reached a tipping point on June 1 when Sounders players wore “Club World Ca$h Grab” shirts before their match against Minnesota United and owner Adrian Hanauer reportedly angrily confronting the players after the match.

The MLS Players Association received a proposal from the league last week on how pay would be divided that the players were “deeply disappointed” with. As of Thursday, a resolution in a pay split had not been reached.

Whatever viewpoint fans take in looking at the tournament is probably fair. An optimist may look at the fact that PSG, Atlético Madrid, River Plate and Inter Milan will play competitive matches in Seattle for likely the only time ever, with two of those teams playing the hometown squad.

“My uncle is coming from Germany just to watch these games,” Sounders FC coach Brian Schmetzer said.

A pessimist will see high ticket prices that overestimated the interest of the tournament, clubs have no requirement of playing their top players, some odd starts times in order to appease overseas markets and the local side an underdog in two of its three matches.

Both views are fair and add to the uncertainty of how this tournament will ultimately be received.

“This might be the only time we play one of these teams in Seattle in our stadium, in our home,” Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas said. “So we're going to have fun and at the end of the day, this is a game, it's a tournament. Obviously, it's a great opportunity, but we need to have fun with it. This is an unbelievable moment for us, for the whole city, for the whole team and we just need to look at it that way.”

Botafogo has three players on the way out to Nottingham Forest of the Premier League after the tournament. Seeing River Plate will be the last chance to watch 17-year-old young phenom Franco Mastantuono before his permanent move to Real Madrid. PSG might still be on a celebratory bender after winning the Champions League.  

For the combo of star power and entertainment, the June 19 match between Sounders FC and Atlético Madrid might be the game to see. Atleti is full of stars from Koke to Julián Alvarez to Jan Oblak to noted Seattle Mariners fan Antoine Griezmann.

Seattle will be a decided underdog in the match, but it could be an entertaining Thursday afternoon. And as Keller noted, the resources for the two clubs vastly different, noting that the transfers last year of Alvarez and Conor Gallagher to Atleti were $160 million which might equate to a decade worth of combined salaries for the Sounders.

“We're talking different ballparks on different planets,” he said.

Still, Keller thinks the Sounders can be competitive in all three matches.

“I wouldn't be surprised if they sneaked a draw or maybe even a win against somebody that came in sleeping,” Keller said.

What should be a festive start to the FIFA Club World Cup in Seattle this Sunday has instead created fear and uncertainty for some fans. This comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suggested on social media that it would be involved in security at the matches.

SEATTLE, Wash. - What should be a festive kickoff to the FIFA Club World Cup in Seattle this Sunday has instead sparked fear and uncertainty among some fans after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suggested on social media it would be involved in security at Club World Cup matches.

The Seattle Sounders will face Brazil's Botafogo in a high-stakes match at Lumen Field on Sunday, marking one of the biggest games in the tournament. Seattle, considered the underdog, will host the match as the city prepares for a broader role in the global soccer spotlight ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup.

But for some fans, the excitement is being overshadowed by rumors and social media posts suggesting increased immigration enforcement presence at matches — not just in Seattle, but across the country.

Earlier this week, CBP shared a now-deleted post on its official channels stating, ""Let the games begin – the first FIFA Club World Cup games starts on June 14 in Miami. CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games."" The post has since been taken down but is still being circulated by outlets such as FOX Sports 940 AM in Miami.

According to FOX's affiliate in Florida, FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed CBP agents would be working alongside Miami-Dade Sheriff's deputies to provide security for the matches in Florida.

Concerns grew further after reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents advised non-citizens to bring proof of legal status to the matches. While that advisory appears specific to Miami, the uncertainty has reached fans in Seattle as well.

Washington Governor Bob Ferguson addressed those concerns saying, ""I'm not getting communication from the federal government about what they're doing. I want to be very clear about that,"" Ferguson said. ""But we, of course, are very focused on the days ahead of us and being sure we're doing everything we can to ensure the President does not take any legal action here in Washington.""

The office of Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell also responded, acknowledging awareness of the rumors. A spokesperson said the city has been in contact with Gov. Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown. The office emphasized that Seattle does not coordinate or assist federal agencies in immigration enforcement.

Ticket sales have also become a topic of conversation. Sunday's match tickets are available for as low as $35. In comparison, a ticket to see Paris Saint-Germain — featuring some of the most well-known players in international soccer — costs around $117 – compared to $350 a year ago. 

While it's unclear whether the enforcement rumors are affecting sales, sports analyst Nico Moreno of Pulso Sports said the drop in demand isn't surprising.

""I really thought a couple months back that it would be beyond that,"" Moreno said. ""But when I'm hearing that there's basically a fire sale on tickets, that people are getting free tickets if they bought the 300 level — people are being brought down from 300 levels down — it makes me feel like it's going to be a Portland vs. Sounders atmosphere.""

In a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup 26™ is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. Our mission remains unchanged.""

Security concerns aren't unprecedented. During the 2023 Copa América final, hundreds of fans breached Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, an incident attributed to a lack of security personnel.

FOX 13 Seattle reached out to Lumen Field for comment but has not yet received a response.

Seattle is set to host six matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and Sunday's match is being seen as an early test of how the city handles international sporting events — both on and off the pitch.

The Sounders are three days away from their first FIFA Club World Cup match, the biggest tournament in franchise history, as an ongoing disagreement between players and Major League Soccer casts a shadow over the event.

Airbnb and FIFA recently announced a partnership spanning three tournaments that will deliver unforgettable travel experiences to fans, alongside economic opportunities for local communities and valuable support for host cities.  

During the three-year partnership, Airbnb will serve as an Official Partner for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 that kicks off this weekend; an Official Supporter for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 in North America; and an Official Supporter for the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027. Airbnb will offer Official Fan Accommodation on its platform globally for these three FIFA tournaments. 

With Airbnb Experiences, fans can also experience the tournament engaging with soccer legends like Tim Howard (who is hosting an Airbnb Experience during FIFA Club World Cup 2025) – as well as FIFA experts.  

Over 380,000 guests are expected to use Airbnb for stays during the FIFA World Cup 26, generating an estimated economic impact of $3.6 billion for host city economies, according to a study by Deloitte. FIFA has launched a $5 million Host City Impact Program established by Airbnb to support initiatives that benefit local communities. 

About 25,000 Airbnb guests are expected to stay in New York and New Jersey and surrounding areas during FIFA World Cup 26 and contribute to a total economic impact of $288 million. The Deloitte study estimates Airbnb hosts in the New York-New Jersey region may collectively earn up to $20 million, or an average $5,700 per host over the duration of the event. Airbnb will also contribute to broader local economic development by generating the equivalent of nearly 1,140 full-time jobs, the Deloitte study said. 

“The World Cup brings the world together — and so do we,” said Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO. “Airbnb is proud to partner with FIFA to offer fans once-in-a-lifetime experiences during the tournaments—while welcoming hundreds of thousands of guests during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and driving meaningful economic impact for local communities.” 

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, featuring the top club teams from six continents, kicks off this weekend with games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford; Miami Gardens, Florida; Cincinnati; Pasadena, California; and Seattle. The club tournament will include 63 games across 11 U.S. cities before the final is played at MetLife on July 13.  

Next year, the 2026 Men's World Cup featuring the globe's top national teams comes to 16 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. New Jersey's MetLife Stadium will also host eight of the 104 games, including the final set for July 19, 2026. 

The 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup games will be played in Brazil. 

“We're delighted to welcome Airbnb to FIFA, and we're thrilled that it is taking on such a key role in the three groundbreaking tournaments coming up,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will be a defining competition for generations to come and will reshape club football.  

“Meanwhile, the FIFA World Cup 26 will be the biggest tournament in history, with 48 teams competing across three host nations,” Infantino said. “Then, one year later, the FIFA Women's World Cup will be held in South America for the first time. Having a travel leader such as Airbnb by our side is special. Together, we'll continue to see football unite the world.”

Spurs are set to appoint the Brentford boss after deciding to sack Ange Postecoglou earlier this month

Tottenham's search for a successor to Ange Postecoglou has led them to Thomas Frank. The Dane has joined from Brentford after an incredibly successful seven-year stint in west London, and has been tasked with a similar revolution on the northern edge of the city after signing a three-year contract.

Frank was not only part of the Bees' revolution from mid-table Championship fodder to one of the Premier League's toughest outfits, but rather the catalyst. Brentford are forward thinking and innovators in their own right, but the crown jewel was their loveable, charismatic and tactically-astute head coach.

There are several reasons as to why Spurs were attracted to Frank, not least his philosophical flexibility and ability to operate on a budget, and now is the time to get behind their new manager. His spell at Brentford revolved around alignment on all fronts, and he's going to need similar support to bring further glory to Tottenham.

Defending champion Tommy Paul is among several big names who have been forced to pull out of next week's ATP 500 at the Queen's Club at the last minute. Paul had been carrying leg and abdominal injuries during his recent run to the quarter-final at the French Open and has now withdrawn from the HSBC Championships due to the latter.

Lorenzo Musetti, the world No. 6 who lost to Paul in last year's final, has also pulled out of Queen's with a leg muscle injury. The Italian retired from his Roland Garros semi-final match against Carlos Alcaraz last week. And two-time former champion Matteo Berrettini will not be playing due to an ab problem.

It comes after Nick Kyrgios, who was set to return to Queen's for the first time since 2019, announced he would be skipping the entire grass season due to an injury setback. World No. 23 Sebastian Korda also pulled out of the draw.

Paul was set to defend his crown at the West Kensington club next week. The American went on an impressive run 12 months ago, dropping just one set to Jack Draper across five matches on his way to the title.

But, after reaching a career-high ranking of No. 8 this week, Paul has officially removed himself from the Queen's entry list. The 28-year-old made it no secret that he was playing through injuries at the recent French Open.

After beating Marton Fucsovics from two sets and 5-3 down in round two, Paul said: “I've been dealing with a bunch of things. But just something in my lower ab I've been dealing with. I mean, for most of the match, I mean, I was feeling it.”

Paul made it all the way to the last eight but visibly struggled and had his right thigh strapped up during his 6-0 6-1 6-4 defeat to Alcaraz and said it quickly became apparent that he “wasn't moving amazing”.

Musetti's French Open campaign also ended in a match against Alcaraz. The Italian pushed took the first set and pushed Alcaraz to a tiebreak in the second but he quickly fell away and retired with the No. 2 seed leading 4-6 7-6(3) 6-0 2-0.

Last year's runner-up at Queen's later explained: “I felt at the beginning of the third when I was serving, I started losing a little bit of strength on the left leg behind, and definitely was going worse and worse, so I decided to stop.

“I think it was, you know, the right decision to make, even if it was not what I wanted. Tomorrow I will do exams, and I will of course see and evaluate the situation.”

Berrettini, who was crowned the Queen's Club champion in 2021 and 2022, will also no longer be playing. The former world No. 6 has been plagued by injuries in recent years and skipped the French Open for the fourth year running.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz's participation in the ATP 500 at Queen's remains in doubt. The world No. 2 successfully defended his French Open crown over the weekend then jetted to Ibiza to celebrate.

His coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, later confirmed that they would do some tests and make a final decision on whether to play Queen's when he returned.

              PUBLICIDAD





A new and exciting adventure begins for Carlos Alcaraz with the dispute of the ATP 500 Queen's 2025. The Spaniard arrives for his first encounter with the grass court, brimming with confidence from his achievements in Paris and with his sights set on Wimbledon 2025 where he will defend his title. It is important to review aspects such as the schedule, timings, where to watch, and the prize money of the English tournament.

There is no respite in the tennis calendar, especially not in this swift transition between two vastly different surfaces like clay and grass. The top players on the men's circuit will seek to adjust to this surface in preparation for Wimbledon 2025. Like the past two years, Carlos Alcaraz has chosen the ATP 500 Queen's 2025 as a testing ground before the third Grand Slam of the year.

- Schedule and Timings of ATP Queen's 2025

The final draw of the London tournament will take place from Monday, June 16, to Sunday, June 22, consisting of 32 players with no byes in the first round for any of the favorites. This means that everyone needs to win five matches to become the champion, resulting in almost daily matches throughout the week. The matches will begin at 12:00 local time, which translates to 13:00 in Spain, while the final will be held at 14:00 local time, corresponding to 15:00 in Spain.

In his debut, Alcaraz may face big names such as Dimitrov, Popyrin, Davidovich, Nakashima, Lehecka, or Mpetshi-Perricard, reflecting the challenge of emerging victorious in a tournament with a condensed lineup that intensifies competitiveness. The last-minute withdrawals of Musetti, Paul, Korda, and Berrettini have slightly clarified the situation.

- Prize Money and Ranking Points in ATP Queen's 2025

A significant cash prize awaits at the tournament competing with Halle to attract top stars in the circuit. Besides presumed high participation rates, the prize money is substantial, totaling €2,522,220. Additionally, the winner earns 500 ranking points. Here is how the prize money is distributed in the various rounds:

The American overcame Jiri Lehecka 6-4, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals at the BOSS OPEN, while Daniil Medvedev lost to Reilly Opelka at the Libema Open in The Netherlands. Shelton will now surpass Medvedev in the PIF ATP Rankings and is set to join countryman Taylor Fritz in the Top 10.

""That is really cool,"" Shelton said on cracking the Top 10. ""A big milestone and in tennis. I guess Stuttgart is the place for Americans to break into the Top 10 because you all saw Frances Tiafoe do it a couple of years ago when he won that title. I am just thinking about this week, I want to keep going this week and want to be playing on Sunday.""

Into his 10th tour-level semi-final and first on grass, Shelton will meet Alexander Zverev in the last four on Saturday after dispatching Lehecka in 62 minutes. The American fired 18 aces, won 100 per cent (28/28) of his first-serve points and did not face a break point against the Czech, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Top seed Zverev continued the quest for his first grass-court title on Friday at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart, where he overcame Brandon Nakashima 7-5, 6-4 to maintain his perfect record against the American.

Playing on home soil, the German saved both break points he faced against Nakashima and struck 31 winners to 20 unforced errors to reach the semi-finals at the ATP 250 grass-court event after one hour and 32 minutes.

Zverev, who leads Nakashima 4-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, is the first Top 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings to reach the last four in Stuttgart since Roger Federer won the title in 2018. Zverev lifted a trophy in Germany earlier this year when he triumphed on clay in Munich and will aim to add to that in Stuttgart.

Earlier, Felix Auger-Aliassime ended the run of #NextGenATP German Justin Engel with a 7-6(3), 6-3 victory. The Canadian, who is chasing his third title of the season, fired 18 aces and won 86 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to reach his sixth tour-level semi-final on grass.
Engel, 17, defeated James Duckworth and Alex Michelsen to become the youngest grass-court tour-level quarter-finalist since Boris Becker at Wimbledon in 1985. The German wild card is up 47 spots to No. 234 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run.
Auger-Aliassime will meet Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals. The second-seeded American beat Hungarian qualifier Marton Fucsovics 6-3, 6-4 in 77 minutes. Fritz has enjoyed success on grass in the past, triumphing at the ATP 250 event in Eastbourne in 2019, 2022 and 2024.

The 27-year-old, who suffered a shock first-round exit at Roland Garros to Daniel Altmaier, now leads Fucsovics 3-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.
""I think regardless of the surface, when Felix and I have played, it has been on pretty fast hard courts, so it has always come down to a lot of serving and one or two breaks,"" Fritz said on facing Auger-Aliassime. ""I think it will be a similar situation.""

Where does Sunday's final stack up against other GMOAT candidates?BySteve TignorPublished Jun 13, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 13, 2025

“Dude, that French Open final!” an old friend wrote in an email two days ago. “Just when I thought the glory days were over.”That was the theme of a dozen messages I received and conversations I had this week, and maybe it was for you as well. If any sports fans were unaware of the budding—now fully blooming—rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner before this weekend at Roland Garros, they know about it today.Part of me even fears that the Spaniard and Italian have set the bar a wee bit high for themselves. Is the sporting public going to be let down if they don't make every Grand Slam final, and don't duel all the way to a fifth-set tiebreaker when they do?But those are worries for another week. For the past few days, tennis fans have been able to bask in a rare moment in the mainstream sun: Sinner and Alcaraz have been the talk of the world.

It hasn't hurt that, even before it was over, their Roland Garros final had entered the G-MOAT—greatest match of all time—conversation. I saw the chatter begin online late in the fifth set, when it became clear that Sinner wasn't going away, and that this would be more than just a legendary comeback by Alcaraz.The match belongs in the best-ever conversation. In terms of quality and drama—the two categories that count—Sinner-Alcaraz was as good as anything that has come before in tennis. The question at the back of my mind since Sunday has been where exactly it should fall in the all-time list.So let's hazard an early guess.For today, to keep the comparisons relatively apples to apples, I'll restrict myself to men's matches played in the Open era. A definitive ranking of the all-time greatest matches, by men or women, in the entirety of tennis history, is a longer-term project—or an impossibility, depending on your point of view. I'll also stipulate that this is a subjective exercise, and not meant to speak for anything other than my personal preferences.

A post shared by Carlos Alcaraz Garfia (@carlitosalcarazz)

For me, the men's matches since 1968 that stand out are, in chronological order:Pancho Gonzalez d. Charlie Pasarell, 1969 Wimbledon 1st roundBjorn Borg d. John McEnroe, 1980 Wimbledon finalRafael Nadal d. Roger Federer, 2008 Wimbledon finalNovak Djokovic d. Rafael Nadal, 2012 Australian Open finalNovak Djokovic d. Rafael Nadal 2018 Wimbledon semifinalNovak Djokovic d. Roger Federer, 2019 Wimbledon finalCarlos Alcaraz d. Novak Djokovic 2023 Wimbledon finalCarlos Alcaraz d. Jannik Sinner, 2025 Roland Garros final

All of these had multiple twists and turns, with many match points saved and squandered. All went deep into a fifth; Alcaraz-Djokovic was the only one that didn't continue past 5-5 in the deciding set. All of them except Gonzalez-Pasarell and 2018 Djokovic-Nadal were Grand Slam finals, and only Pasarell wasn't a Grand Slam champion. All but two were played on Centre Court at Wimbledon. That makes Sinner vs. Alcaraz, the only one at Roland Garros, an outlier in a good way. Court Philippe Chatrier deserves an all-time great contest.I'll start by eliminating Gonzalez-Pasarell. Yes, it lasted 112 games, but it was a first-round match.Next, I'll eliminate Djokovic-Nadal in Australia, because there was some sense at the time that, at five hours and 53 minutes, it was slightly too long, and that the tennis was slightly too attritional—“brutal,” in the parlance of that moment.(As I said, this is a subjective exercise. I love all of these matches, but I like best-of lists, too, and to make this one I have to find reasons to choose between them wherever I can.)I'll continue by eliminating Borg v. McEnroe because…I guess because it didn't really come to life until the fourth-set tiebreaker.

I'll eliminate Djokovic-Federer, because…I don't know…because it's tough to think that this was Federer's last Slam final, and he lost it after having two match points? Also, as high-quality as the play between these two all-timers was, the rallies weren't quite as extensive or mind-boggling as the ones that Alcaraz and Sinner produced.I'll eliminate Alcaraz-Djokovic because two of the sets were 6-1.That leaves Nadal-Federer 2008 Wimbledon, Djokovic-Nadal 2018 Wimbledon, and Alcaraz-Sinner.Most people probably don't have the Djokovic-Nadal Wimbledon semi from 2018 at the top of their list. But it's an all-time favorite of mine, and the best of their 60 face-offs, in my opinion. On the first day, they raced to beat a curfew, and it only made their play sharper and, especially in Nadal's case, more aggressive. That pace continued the next afternoon. Djokovic's hair's-breadth victory, which he saved with one of his handy running forehand passes late in the fifth, was an appropriate microcosm of their rivalry. And if it wasn't a final, it felt like one to both men—they knew their opponent two days later would be surprise finalist Kevin Anderson. Djokovic indeed went on to beat the South African in straights.Alcaraz-Sinner was as brilliantly played and theatrically thrilling as any match on the list. It featured No. 1 vs. No. 2, on Chatrier's wide expanse of red, in front of a French crowd that lives to amp up the tension. The young players' super-charged mix of pace, finesse and athleticism made it feel like the next step in the game's evolution, and especially its evolution on clay. It featured a goal-line stand in the fourth set from Alcaraz, and a goal-line stand from Sinner in the fifth. And it ended with Alcaraz going stratospheric to win it in the deciding tiebreaker.

If there's a hesitation about calling Sinner-Alcaraz the greatest match ever, it's probably due to their youth. Someday, we may rank them alongside the Big 3. But their names don't conjure the same sense of historical awe yet.Which brings me to Nadal-Federer at Wimbledon in 2008. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, it was No. 1 vs. No. 2. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, it was brilliantly played; at the time, I thought it was the highest-quality match I'd ever seen. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, one player was trying to invade the other's surface—Nadal succeeded where Sinner failed. In both matches, there was a flurry of shots that saved match points in the fourth set, and sent it to a fifth. And both matches came to a climactic conclusion. On Sunday we had Alcaraz going supernova; in 2008, we had the duel in the darkness.I'll give the darkness, and the cinematic images of agony and ecstasy that it created, the edge. And I'll give the moment the edge as well. Where Alcaraz and Sinner were playing their first Slam final, Nadal and Federer had been contesting them for two years, and had been building to this collision that whole time. It would be far from their final collision, but with this win Nadal would take over No. 1 from Federer for the first time, prove he wasn't just a dirt-baller, and etch their names together forever.

Tommy Paul enjoyed a four-game winning streak at the French Open, making it to the quarter-finals, but was ultimately defeated by eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz. 

Alcaraz crushed Paul, 6-0, 6-1, 6-4, beating him for the fourth time in a row en route to his second consecutive Roland Garros title.

The American didn't look to be anywhere near his best in the match, considering his hot run of form on the clay courts of both the Italian Open and the French Open.

Paul‘s struggles in his clash with the Spaniard have now been made clearer, after the 28-year-old provided fans with an injury update ahead of the Queen's, where he is the defending champion. 

Paul took to Instagram to say: “I'm crushed, I will not be able to play Queen's next week. I sadly am still recovering from an abdominal strain and need more time to get fully fit. 

“I look forward to getting back on the grass soon. TP,” added the world number eight.

He won Queen's for the first time last season, after defeating Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets in the final, to hoist the trophy on Centre Court, which is now the Andy Murray Arena.

The triumph marked his third career title, having picked up a maiden ATP crown at Stockholm in 2021, and clinching his second in 2024 at the Dallas Open. 

Paul won Queen's while only dropping one set throughout the tournament, which came in the quarter-final against Jack Draper.

After defeating Sebastian Baez and Alejandro Tabilo in the first two rounds, he played the British home hope in their fifth career meeting. 

Draper forced a third set in the match, but wasn't able to get over the line against a red-hot Paul, who he had beaten in three of their previous four clashes. 

In an all-American semi-final, Paul was able to best his compatriot Sebastian Korda 6-4, 7-6, to book his place in the final. 

He got off to a hot start in his showdown with Musetti on Centre Court, taking the first set 6-1, and despite the Italian's best efforts in the second set, he emerged victorious in London.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The American lifted her second Grand Slam singles title on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Seven years ago, on the iconic ‘Bullring' No.1 Court, a 14-year-old Coco Gauff reeled in her opponent from a set down to rule Roland-Garros. Sound familiar? It was the RG 2018 girls' singles final and Gauff overcame compatriot Caty McNally 1-6, 6-3, 7-6(1) en route to becoming junior world No.1 later that season.

It was a triumph that has stuck in the American's heart and mind ever since, returning to her thoughts on Friday, June 6, the evening before the RG 2025 women's singles final.

Erasing the heartbreak from an emphatic RG 2022 final loss at the hands of Iga Swiatek, Gauff turned the tables this time with a compelling 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 victory over world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka.

“It felt very similar,” Gauff told a select group of reporters in Paris. “That was a three-set final win too, having to comeback. I remember not playing that great in that match either.

“I did actually think about that last night before this match, I thought of the mentality I had in that final is what I need to bring today.

“As much as sometimes you think juniors doesn't matter, or that it's so far in the past, I was able to recount an experience from that. It just goes to show you can learn from literally every match that you play in your life.

“I never thought I'd need that final today, but it helped me mentally.”

The world No.2 is clearly a deep thinker and takes influences from all sorts of avenues, whether it's across different cultures, sports or from a plethora of public figures.

Rewind to the Paris 2024 Olympics and American 200m gold medalist Gabby Thomas revealed she wrote ‘I will be the Olympic champion,” multiple times on paper to manifest her magic moment.

It's a mental exercise Gauff took up in preparation for her final duel on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

“I was on TikTok last night and I saw an interview with Gabby Thomas, she said she wrote that,” explained the US Open 2023 champion.

“I remember it at the time, but it came up on my feed again and I don't know, I just thought this is meant to be. Why is this video of her interviewing from the Olympics coming up now?

“She said she wrote it 50, or 500 times, something crazy. I had this little hotel pad and I said I'm gonna write it as many times as I can fit it, then I'm done.

“I was looking at myself in the mirror, saying it, trying to instil it in my brain, that belief.

“It worked! It's great mindset that she had. Did I win because of that? I'm going to say that I did!”

The 21-year-old is the first American woman to be crowned the singles winner in Paris since a certain Serena Williams (2015) and the youngest representing the stars and stripes since Williams in 2002.

Gauff – just like Serena – has grown up in the public eye, has evolved into a role model herself. As always for Coco, there is the bigger picture to consider.

“In general, with my career, knowing how much Serena meant to me... Obviously, I'm not going to have the same impact as her, but even a quarter impact that she had, that's still a lot of people,” added the two-time major champion.

“My biggest goal would be to have someone start to play professional tennis because of me. Just being that representation, also knowing it's a decade since she won here, is so crazy to hear that stat. I'm really proud and I hope that maybe sooner someone can say they did well because of me.”

The generational talent often reflects on leading hopes for future athletes of colour, for using her platform for good. It never seems a burden, Gauff has spoken maturely and respectfully on a multitude of topics ever since launching onto the global scene in 2019.

“Before and after matches is when I feel that weight. During them I just get the ball in the court,” admitted the world No.2.

“Honestly, in tough moments, I just think of how many people are proud of me regardless of the result, if I walk with the trophy or the plate.

“I thought about that on court during the final. There's some negativity in the world, but the positivity always outweighs that. I know I have that support and whatever happened, I wanted people watching me to know that I was genuinely trying my best.”

Next stop for Coco is the grass, which is where she shot into the limelight at Wimbledon six years ago, by taking out one of her idols Venus Williams as a 15-year-old prodigy.

‘I love London, it's one of my favourite cities in the world. I'm really looking forward to Wimbledon.”","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland Garros (official site)'}","tennis"

Wimbledon is on the way, and whether you're planning to watch on TV, brave the famous queues or are lucky enough to have a ticket, it's an exciting time for tennis fans everywhere. 

For those attending in person, one big question (other than how many strawberries with cream you can possibly consume in one day) is what to wear. After all, while it's mainly about the tennis action on court, Wimbledon has always been a place to see and be seen, with celebrities from Sienna Miller to the Princess of Wales snapped on Centre Court in stunning outfits.

The dress code for Wimbledon is generally smart casual - you don't want to go too over-the-top (this is not Royal Ascot) but at the same time, it's a nice opportunity to don a beautiful dress or some on-trend tailoring. Shoes-wise, think practical: if you're up on Murray Mound, you don't want to sink into the grass, and the day tends to involve quite a lot of walking around. 

With the other accessories, you can go to town - think bold jewellery, chic handbags and a useful sun hat (although nothing too large, as you'll be very unpopular if you block someone else's view of the tennis action). As for what to avoid - clothes with political slogans or big company logos are banned - although you probably weren't going to wear that anyway. Here's what we suggest instead...

Dress, £99, Albaray; crossbody bag, £22.99, H&M; sandals, £35, Freemans; hat, £32, & Other Stories and disc necklace, £34, Oliver Bonas

Emma Raducanu will face a tough test at Queen's Club today with the young Brit set to go up against the top seed in the quarter-finals. She will play Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng in the last eight, with the winner facing either Emma Navarro or Amanda Anisimova in the semis. Raducanu has already locked in a return to the top of the British rankings after beating Rebecca Sramkova in straight sets yesterday.

The former US Open champion will surpass Katie Boulter, who was knocked out by Diana Shnaider in the last eight. She won the first set but allowed her Russian opponent to fight back and claim a 2-6 6-3 6-2 victory. It means Raducanu will return to the summit of British tennis for the first time in two years when the rankings are updated on Monday.

It's the end of the road for Emma Raducanu at Queen's as the Brit is defeated in straight sets by top seed Qinwen Zheng.

Raducanu had a commanding lead at one point in the second set, having been outclassed in the first, but Zheng held her nerve to come back and win 6-2 6-4.

Not the result Raducanu wanted, but she comes away from the tournament with many positives to take as Wimbledon edges closer.



Zheng is fully back in this second set now, breaking Raducanu back to level the score at 4-4.

Raducanu will be bitterly disappointed after losing the game on a double fault.

Raducanu has got off to a stormer in the second set as she looks to keep her Queen's campaign going.

She broke Zheng straight away before holding her own serve, and leads 2-0 in the second set currently.

During the break in play between sets, Raducanu is receiving treatment on her back.

The physio came out to check in on the Brit, and she has just made her way off court for a medical timeout.

Hopefully it's just a minor issue.

Qinwen Zheng claims the first set 6-2 and it's a difficult task from here on in for Raducanu against the Olympic champion.



Qinwen Zheng has stamped her authority on this match. She is currently 4-2 up and will be looking to wrap the set up quickly from here.

But Raducanu is battling and has the home crowd on her side.

Emma Raducanu is due to get going any minute now against Qinwen Zheng in the quarter-finals at Queen's.

A very exciting match-up this...

Fourth seed Elena Rybakina is in a spot of bother in her Queen's quarter-final clash against German qualifier Tatjana Maria.

Maria took the opening set 6-4 and currently leads the second set 4-3. She also has the serve to move 5-3 in front.

After this match, Emma Raducanu will face top seed Qinwen Zheng for a spot in the semi-finals...

Madison Keys is safely through to the semi-finals at Queen's Club after coming from behind to beat Diana Shnaider.

The reigning Australian Open champion lost the opening set but fought back to secure a 2-6 6-3 6-4 victory.

Tatjana Maria and Elena Rybakina are currently in action at the Andy Murray Arena, with the scores locked at three games each in the first set.

Once that match concludes, it will be the turn of Emma Raducanu and Qinwen Zheng.

John McEnroe has claimed that Carlos Alcaraz is the only tennis player he would buy a ticket to watch.

""Carlos is the most talented young man I have ever seen hold a racket, Jannik [Sinner] is not far behind,"" said the American.

""Alcaraz is brighter, Sinner is more consistent. I am struck by the sound of Jannik's ball. I have never heard anything like it.

""Carlos is the best gift the post-Big Three generation could give us and he's the only tennis player I'd pay a ticket for.""



The action is underway at Queen's Club with Diana Shnaider going up against Madison Keys in the quarter-finals.

Shnaider won the opening set at a canter but Keys is battling back, having raced to a three-game lead in set two.

It looks like it will go to a decider unless Shnaider can pull off a run of successive games.

Defending champion Tommy Paul is among several big names who have pulled out of the men's tournament at Queen's Club.

He had been nursing several injuries at the French Open and will be looking to return to full fitness ahead of Wimbledon.

Lorenzo Musetti has also withdrawn from the ATP 500 event due to a leg muscle injury.

Matteo Berrettini, meanwhile, will not be playing because of an abdominal problem.

Nick Kyrgios has given himself a bold new look two months after celebrating his 30th birthday.

He has taken the plunge and shaved his head, having previously been known for his signature dark curls.

Kyrgios revealed his new buzzcut in a short Instagram video, turning his head to show it off from multiple angles.

He captioned the post: ""30 is unreal. Not even in my prime yet. And shaved head is UNREAL.""



Wimbledon chief Sally Bolton has confirmed that security measures will be ramped up at SW19 this year.

It comes after Emma Raducanu was targeted by a stalker during a match against Karolina Muchova in February.

Bolton said: ""The safety and wellbeing of all of the players is our absolute top priority.

""I think the recent incidents coming to light certainly recognise the concern generated by that.

""But we have in place, and have had for many years, processes for ensuring the safety of our players.

""That is in liaison with law enforcement agencies, specialist security teams and we liaise with both tours.

""It is a bit like the broader security for the grounds. We are putting in place measures that are reflective of the threat and risk profile at the time.""

Novak Djokovic has revealed that he has always felt closer to Rafael Nadal than Roger Federer in a candid interview.

He said: ""Just because someone is my biggest rival doesn't mean I wish them harm, hate them, or want to do anything else on the court to defeat them.

""We fought for the win, and the better player won. I've never said a single bad word about them [Federer and Nadal] and never will.

""I looked up to them and still do, but I've always gotten along better with Nadal.""



Here's a look at what's in store today at Queen's Club...

Women's singles: Quarter-finals

Diana Shnaider vs Madison Keys

Tatjana Maria vs Elena Rybakina

Qinwen Zheng vs Emma Raducanu

Emma Navarro vs Amanda Anisimova

Women's doubles: Semi-finals

Erin Routliffe/Lyudmyla Kichenok vs Demi Schuurs/Asia Muhammad

Shuai Zhang/Ellen Perez vs Anna Danilina/Diana Shnaider

Novak Djokovic has emotionally admitted that he felt like an 'unwanted child' in comparison to Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

He told Failures of Champions: ""I acted and still felt like an unwanted child.

""I asked myself why that was. It hurt me. Then I thought the fans would accept me if I acted differently, but that wasn't the case either.

""I was never as loved as Federer and Nadal because I wasn't supposed to be there.

""I was the little guy, the third guy who came along and said: 'I'm going to be No 1'. Many people didn't like that.""

Emma Raducanu sent a classy message to Katie Boulter after surpassing her doubles partner as Britain's top-ranked female player.

Following her victory over Rebecca Sramkova at Queen's Club, she wrote a message on the camera lens which read: ""Long live Boultercanu.""

Raducanu also revealed that she wanted to rekindle her partnership with Boulter, having enjoyed their brief run in the doubles tournament.

""I really want to play with Katie again in the future,"" she said. ""Maybe over the grass, but for sure in the future.""



Hello and welcome to Express Sport's live coverage of the latest tennis news with Queen's Club taking centre stage once again.

Emma Raducanu will be in action later today, with the young Brit facing Qinwen Zheng in the quarter-finals.

Their friendship has deep roots, having trained together at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton from a young age.

Born less than a year apart, Raducanu and Draper competed in many of the same junior tournaments throughout their development.

The pair's shared experiences include prestigious events such as the Orange Bowls in Miami and the Eddie Herr Invitationals in Bradenton.

Their parallel journeys through British tennis have naturally fostered a strong bond between them.

Draper has spoken warmly about their relationship, telling The Times: ""She has always been there for me. I've always been there for her.

The 23-year-old acknowledged that whilst they had witnessed Andy Murray's Grand Slam success, Raducanu's victory felt particularly special.

""Obviously, we've watched the likes of Andy Murray winning a Grand Slam from Great Britain, but her winning, it was just really a fairy-tale run,"" he said.

When Martina Navratilova criticised Raducanu following her first-round exit at the 2024 US Open, Draper defended his friend.

""There's no doubt it was extremely difficult for Emma, because she's done her A Levels and she'd just come out of school,"" he said, urging people to allow her to continue her journey without undue pressure.

Their enduring friendship represents more than personal camaraderie - it embodies the future of British tennis.

Carlos Alcaraz has enjoyed a stellar year thus far, culminating in the retention of his French Open crown earlier this month.

The Spaniard, who is now a five-time Grand Slam champion, will now be hoping to mimic his Parisian feat by successfully defending his Wimbledon title too.

One of very few to have ever won these two events back to back, and now vying to become just the second-ever player to have defended both in successive years as well, so much history is on the line as he prepares to return to the All England Club.

However, before then, he must reacclimate to the grass courts which have served him so well over recent years.

There have been some questions over his preparation ahead of Wimbledon though, with his Queen's participation thrown into doubt.

These worries were sparked by his coach, after he made some comments about their upcoming plans that did not specify when his pupil's next tournament would come.

Juan Carlos Ferrero spoke about Alcaraz's potential Queen's appearance, and played down the chances, admitting that additional tests were needed to confirm.

He noted: ‘The plan is to play him, but we'll make a final decision in a few days.

‘After these days off, on Thursday or Friday, we'll do a test to see how he's feeling physically and mentally.'

Whilst they hope to be available, missing Queen's might mark a huge error from the Carlos Alcaraz team that could have huge repercussions ahead of Wimbledon too.

It seems like Alcaraz is becoming a creature of habit during certain parts of the year, with May to July all following the same pattern.

After all, why fix what's not broken?

The 22-year-old seems to have fallen into the routine of winning the French Open, jetting off to Ibiza for some much-needed downtime, returning to play Queen's as his sole warm-up tournament before then winning Wimbledon too.

If he were to miss that crucial preparatory event, he would be heading to SW19 wholly unprepared, and having broken a routine that has brought him so much success in the past few years.

Hopefully, their tests come back positive, and Alcaraz is given the green light to confirm his attendance at Queen's.

If not, there will be serious worries over his ability to convert his fine form directly from the Parisian clay to the grass of Wimbledon.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

@TennisPublisher

Let's do a comparison between U.S. Open golf and U.S. Open tennis. I was motivated to do this as the 2024 U.S. Open was taking place at the Oakmont Country Club just outside of Pittsburgh, Pa. and recorded a podcast on my “TennisPublisher” podcast on the Swell podcast network (a mini-podcast where all the podcasts are less than 15 minutes long, as you can listen to here: https://www.swellcast.com/t/O1Uo0Qian4fUZNr

PRIZE MONEY

In 2024, the U.S. Tennis Association paid out $75 million in prize money with the men's and women's singles champions each earning $3.6 million.  The USTA pays out prize money checks to about 600 players, between main draw singles player (256 players), qualifying singles players (224 players), doubles-only players (about 100 total)/

In 2025, the U.S. Golf Association paid $21.5 million in prize money at the men's U.S. Open golf at Oakmont and $12 million at the U.S. Women's Open at Erin Hills in Wisconsin. The U.S. Golf Association does not pay equal prize money to men and women, unlike the U.S. Tennis Association, which has done it since 1973. The U.S. Open men's champion earned $4.3 million and women's champ earned $2.4 million in 2025. While the U.S. Open tennis pays prize money checks to about 600 players, in golf only players who make the cut (top 60 and ties) earn a paycheck.

TV RATINGS

In 2024, both the men's and women's singles finals earned TV ratings on ESPN of 1.6 million viewers (Aryna Sabalenka beating Jessica Pegula and Jannik Sinner beating Taylor Fritz). In 2023, Coco Gauff's win over Sabalenka was viewed by 3.6 million viewers and Novak Djokovic's win over Daniil Medvedev earned a 2.3 million viewership number. U.S. Open tennis, of course, goes head-to-head against college football and NFL football.

In 2024, the U.S. Open dual between Bryson Dechambeau and Rory McIlroy at Pinehurst in North Carolina was seen by 5.9 million viewers on NBC. The U.S. Women's Open in 2025 at Erin Hills won by relative unknown Maja Stark was seen by 1.58 million views on NBC (roughly the same as the 2024 U.S. Open men's and women's singles finals).

MEDIA AVAILABILITY / INFRASTRUCTURE

I discuss this on my above mentioned podcast where pro golfers are not required to do post-match/round press conferences or media availability – and this is becoming a controversy in golf – while tennis players must be available to the media, or get fined.

The USTA just announced an $800 million upgrade to the facilities at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and Arthur Ashe Stadium. The USGA recently spent $4.8 million on a fan and corporate hospitality expense just at Oakmont Country Club, one of its newly-announced “anchor” sites for their championship.

AI-generated summary reviewed by our newsroom

Eight-year-old Reese Brantmeier stared out her classroom window at a pair of tennis courts, where overgrown weeds sprouted from cracks in the green and red surface.

A rusted fence surrounded the neglected space outside of Washington Elementary in Whitewater, Wisconsin. There was no net; only the empty poles, faded white lines — and memories.

Frustration consumed the fourth grader when she packed her gear into her mom's car to take tennis lessons in Lake Geneva, 45 minutes away. The two courts at her elementary school mocked her from afar.

A teammate on her basketball team had picked up tennis, but hated making the 45-minute commute alone, so she asked Brantmeier to join her. 

Brantmeier enjoyed it enough to keep going, but the future UNC women's tennis star wished she could play in Whitewater. Her school was only 10 minutes away from her house in rural Cold Spring, population: 786. 

But, she had no choice. Wisconsin is a tennis desert. It's difficult to play year-round, and it's expensive.

A large portion of the population of the east side of Whitewater — which includes Washington Elementary – is classified “low-income.” Twenty-nine percent of Whitewater's residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census data.

Even as her tennis skills and ambition have outgrown Wisconsin, Brantmeier hasn't forgotten the sight of those courts outside her classroom window.

She thought about the courts as she qualified for the U.S. Open at 14, and again at 16. They remained on her mind when a dispute with the NCAA over prize money cost her the first semester of her freshman year — and as she led UNC to its first-ever national championship in spring 2023. 

They were certainly on her mind when a torn meniscus ripped her away from the sport and shattered North Carolina's chances of going back-to-back — and when she sued the NCAA over those prize money rules. 

Andnow, as the 20-year-old Brantmeier works to come back from a second meniscus injury and earn a U.S. Open doubles wild card at a playoff in Orlando on Tuesday, the thought of those courts has not abandoned her. 

“Since she was in the fourth grade,” Her mother, Becky, said, “she said, ‘I'm gonna become famous, and I'm gonna fix those courts.'”

Now, the rusted chain-link fence is gone. The weeds and cracks, too — replaced with new, smooth asphalt. It's not completed, yet, still a work in progress.

But so is Brantmeier. 

Ahead 3-1 in doubles against Southern California with partner Elizabeth Scotty, looking to put UNC ahead in the round of 16 in the 2024 ITA indoor national championship in Seattle, Brantmeier swayed behind the baseline. 

North Carolina returned its entire starting lineup from the 2023 NCAA title run, and was aiming for a fifth-straight indoor title that February, with hopes of an NCAA repeat in the spring. 

On the serve, Brantmeier split-stepped.

Her right knee popped. Something snapped. Her mother could see the pain on Brantmeier's face. 

“The second I took that step, I knew,” Brantmeier said, “I was not gonna be playing tennis like I'd been for a good amount of time.”

To avoid putting pressure on the rest of the team, Brantmeier stayed, and played standing still, even though it meant watching Scotty cover the court like a singles match. 

After the pair won 6-3, trainers carted Brantmeier off the court. 

UNC finished off USC, but lost to N.C. State, 4-3, the next day without Brantmeier.

The on-site doctor said she had patellar subluxation — her kneecap had popped out. It moved back into place on its own, so she could be back competing in two weeks. 

But she wasn't. 

An MRI back in Chapel Hill revealed a bucket-handle tear of her meniscus, a notoriously slow-healing injury. 

“It was just shock,” Brantmeier said. “And a lot of disappointment.”

Doctors gave Brantmeier two options.

One: Repair her meniscus, hoping to increase her health and longevity as an athlete. Sit out for six months. 

Two: Remove it completely. Sit out for two months.

She settled on the repair, at her doctors' recommendation. Brantmeier's mother, Becky, traveled to North Carolina to be with her daughter. 

That repair usually takes four or five permanent sutures. Brantmeier required 12, a record for her surgeon. She was bedridden in her mother's hotel room. 

“It was the most pain I've ever been in,” she said.

Then came blood clots, which set back the healing process.

“I told her I'd stay there until she had one day without complications,” Becky said.

She stayed a week.

It didn't get any easier. Walking to class on crutches exhausted Brantmeier. She skipped some days because of the pain. Still, she traveled to every match. If she couldn't be on court, she felt she at least owed the team that much.

“Somebody gets injured, something gets taken away, their attitude goes south,” head coach Brian Kalbas said. “Hers never went south.”

But the losses weighed on her.

Confined to the sidelines of the NCAA super regional, Brantmeier watched as the team's hopes for another national championship crashed. 

First, Texas A&M took the doubles point, clinching on Court 1 — where Brantmeier should've been playing. Then, three singles matches. Once again, the clinch came at the No. 1 seed. Her court. 

“I would have given anything to be able to help out,” Brantmeier said.

Who was Brantmeier without tennis?

This wasn't the first time she'd faced that question. In the fall of her freshman year, before her first individual tournament, the NCAA began investigating some of her prize money and expenses from high school. 

Prior to college enrollment, athletes can accept up to $10,000 per calendar year in prize money from professional tournaments. Beyond that, they can only accept money to cover “actual and necessary expenses” — like meals, lodging, equipment and “other reasonable expenses.” 

Brantmeier's family said they never received an itemization of what was being disputed, only random questions — particularly related to the nearly $49,000 for making it to the third round of the 2021 U.S. Open singles qualifying tournament and the main draw in doubles. 

Her mother had bought a receipt scanner to track their expenses. The NCAA questioned if it was necessary, as well as a racket restringing outside of a 14-day competition window and a hotel room 16-year-old Brantmeier shared with her mother at the U.S. Open. 

The NCAA refused to certify her amateur status for four months, rendering her ineligible for the fall semester.

“I had come to college to play tennis and that was all I'd done my whole life,” Brantmeier said. “So not being able to do that, I kind of was a little lost. I [didn't] really know why I'm here.”

The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment. 

At the end of winter break, the NCAA ruled she had to pay $5,100 to a charity of her choice. Then she could finally play college tennis. 

She remembered the courts. 

Brantmeier donated the money to the Patrick Ryan Memorial Tennis Foundation — aimed at promoting tennis in Wisconsin. She grew up taking lessons where David Ryan, the organizer of the foundation, also played. She asked him to resurface the courts in her hometown.

After her donation, Brantmeier found out it needed more work. The estimate totaled $200,000. She offered to become the spokesperson.

She fund-raised. Wrote grants. Networked with pro players and UNC donors. Ran clinics. 

A year later, she turned to the work during her injury. It made the weeks and months on the sidelines go by a little quicker. 

“I hadn't thought about tennis for myself in a long time,” Brantmeier said. “I was trying to give tennis back to a lot of people.”

In March 2024, she sued the NCAA. The legal action seeks a change in the prize money rules, specifically the ban on athletes' ability to receive money for outside competitions beyond expenses. 

“When the distinction was you cannot make money at all [and] that was the line that they drew, that's a fair distinction between amateur and pro,” Brantmeier said. “But now in this NIL era that we're in, it's just out of date.”

Eight months after the surgery, Brantmeier's knee still hurt. It made strange noises when she moved. 

A scope procedure in the fall of 2024 revealed the meniscus cartilage never healed. The repair had failed.

So, back under the knife she went. This time, surgeons removed her meniscus, resetting all progress.

“Ending up now without my meniscus, knowing that I could have done that earlier and played for the team by the end of the spring, was really tough to know,” Brantmeier said. “But obviously hindsight's 20/20.”

She woke up from her procedure in October and felt she could walk on her knee immediately. 

Brantmeier couldn't join the team in practice until January, right before the first match of the season against James Madison. She came back early to school from winter break to train, but only played one practice set. 

“I truly had no idea if I was gonna be ready,” Brantmeier said. “But it was to a point if I'm physically cleared, it's gonna be tough regardless, you've just got to rip the Bandaid off.”

She won her first match in straight sets. It was the most fun she'd had playing tennis since she was a kid making those commutes to Lake Geneva. 

She was back.

Brantmeier upset the No. 1 singles player in the nation at top-ranked Georgia in February to lead the team to a 4-3 victory. She finished the regular season with a 14-1 singles record and ranked No. 7 in the nation. 

In doubles, Brantmeier and her partner, freshman Alanis Hamilton, ranked No. 2 with a 23-3 record. 

She clinched North Carolina's 2025 ACC Tournament Championship and was named Tournament MVP. Four days later, the ACC named her player of the year. 

At the height of her game, she led UNC to the NCAA Tournament quarterfinals in May. 

Then, after hitting a serve in her singles match against LSU, Brantmeier landed awkwardly. Wincing, hands gripped her right leg. 

She called an injury timeout, but the pain in her knee was too much. She retired from the match, recording only her second loss of the season. Trainers carried her off the court. Again.

This time, it was a slight tear in her medial meniscus — the remaining pad of cartilage in her knee. 

Two days later, UNC's season ended in the NCAA semifinals with a 4-0 loss to Georgia. 

“She has been playing such good tennis — the best tennis I've seen all semester,” senior teammate Lindsay Zink said. “It's been tough to see her get reinjured, but I know she's gonna come back better than ever.”

Washington Elementary principal Tom Grosinske stood outside the Whitewater school in May. He took out his phone and hit record. 

“Hey Reese, it's Mr. G here,” Gronsinske said in the video. “I thought you wanted to see something pretty awesome.” 

He flipped the camera to pan across the scene around him. Every time there's changes on those no-longer-abandoned courts, he records an update and sends it to Brantmeier. 

In the first video, the removal of the rusted fencing. Next, the stripping of the cracked surface down to sand. Most recently, the laying of the base-level pavement.

“Everyone has a vision — a hero or someone [they've] admired,” Gregory Stewart, an assistant coach for the girls' tennis team at Whitewater High, said. “Reese [is] that within our community.”

Weeks have passed since Brantmeier's latest injury, but she's returned to training. Tuesday, she and Hamilton will travel to Orlando to face three other collegiate doubles teams. The winner will earn a spot in the U.S. Open.

Meanwhile, Brantmeier v. NCAA is proceeding to discovery. On July 7, nearly seven weeks before the U.S. Open, a judge will decide whether to certify it as a class action suit. If granted, a trial is expected to follow in the summer of 2026.

And as for those courts in Whitewater? Brantmeier has raised more than $159,000 in three years. Until the crew broke ground this summer, a green sign decorated the fence outside as a reminder that she hadn't forgotten. In white, bold lettering: 

Help us renovate these courts and bring tennis back to the East side. 

The Reese Brantmeier Project.

That name is apropos for the Whitewater tennis court reclamation project, but also for Brantmeier's ongoing journey through the tennis world. 

The former appears close to a positive resolution.

The latter appears to be just getting started — again.

If Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce take another hiatus from the spotlight, it won't come as a surprise. An insider exclusively told RadarOnline that the pop star has plans to take a year off with her beau amid rumors about their engagement and marriage. Swift reportedly told her friends that she has been spending a “freeing time” with the NFL star. The couple previously took a brief break from the public eye before resuming public appearances through date nights and holiday outings.

Over the past few weeks, Taylor Swift has had a busy personal and professional life. She regained ownership of her music catalogue while also marking date nights with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. RadarOnline exclusively reported that the singer has no complaints with her life at the moment and is quite optimistic about her future with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. According to the source, Swift told her friends, “Having control over my music and building a genuine life with someone I care about — that's exactly what I needed.”

On May 30, the singer took to her social media to announce that she had brought back her masters from Shamrock Capital, six years after record executive Scooter Braun allegedly acquired them without her knowledge. Since her milestone achievement, Swift has been out and about with Kelce, most recently at Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.

Amid marriage speculations, the couple is reportedly staying committed for the long haul. A source close to the pair told RadarOnline that the duo sees this as their “final relationship.” The insider continued, “They're taking their time, but those close to them believe an engagement is imminent.” They further hinted that the proposal will happen at the “right moment.”

Swift and Kelce fueled marriage rumors after a wedding planner's envelope for the couple went viral. Page Six reported that while attending Kelce's fellow NFL pal Cole Kmet's wedding, the two went by, “Taylor and Travis Kelce.” While the couple is yet to address these speculations directly, fans have been eagerly waiting for a celebratory update.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","'How many more?': Daria Saville claims Novak Djokovic facing similar press crush as Serena Williams did towards career end","https://www.yardbarker.com/tennis/articles/how_many_more_daria_saville_claims_novak_djokovic_facing_similar_press_crush_as_serena_williams_did_towards_career_end/s1_17460_42323099","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 15:05:30 GMT","


Daria Saville has highlighted that Novak Djokovic is facing similar questions about retirement, which bothered Serena Williams. The 38-year-old has often discussed his future in different press conferences.     


            Djokovic's most recent appearance was at the French Open, where he was knocked out after losing in the semifinal to Jannik Sinner in straight sets with a score of 6-4, 7-5, 7-6. While talking to the media after the match, Djokovic admitted that it might have been the last time he played in the competition where he lifted the title three times.    


            ""I mean, this could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know,"" he said. ""That's why I was a bit more emotional, even in the end. But if this was the farewell match of the Roland-Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd. Not long, you know, I don't know. I don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career. You know, I'm going to keep on keeping on, yes.”    


            Saville recently appeared on the Australian Open official YouTube channel podcast, where she emphasised that Djokovic is now facing something similar to what Serena faced during her final playing days. The 31-year-old also highlighted that, as a player, it is not easy to know when the right time is to retire.    


            “It's pretty hard going to every press [conference] and hearing people asking him the same questions. How much longer? How many more?” she said. “That's what people did to Serena [Williams]. The funny thing as a player is I don't think you know yourself. I kind of feel that he'll be there, I don't think that's how he'd want to go out. I think he doesn't know where his body is. He's just unsure, but I don't think he's there. It would be hard to know, how the hell do you even retire? My favorite retirement was Ash [Barty], that was pretty cool.”

It's been nearly a decade since record five-time champion Andy Murray last lifted the trophy at the HSBC Championships, but the echoes of his legacy still resonate on the Queen's Club grass.

At this year's edition of the ATP 500 event, Jack Draper will step onto the newly-named Andy Murray Arena with his sights set on carving his own history as the first British titlist since former World No. 1 Murray in 2016.

Draper arrives at Queen's Club at a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings after an eye-catching ascent, highlighted by three ATP Tour titles. While his victory in Indian Wells in March marked his first ATP Masters 1000 trophy, it was his breakthrough triumph in Stuttgart 12 months ago that underscored his grass-court pedigree and cemented his status as British No. 1.



Fans in west London have already witnessed Draper's potential at Queen's Club. Competing as a wild card in 2021, he upset third seed Jannik Sinner to record his first tour-level match win. Although he was forced to miss the 2023 grass swing due to a shoulder injury, Draper returned last year to seal another statement victory over then-defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

“I have gone through a lot in the last couple of years,” Draper said after his straight-sets win over Alcaraz. “Coming here two years ago, I had just broken the Top 100, I felt like a bit of an imposter at the tournament. I had been here when I was very young watching Andy play, and it was a completely new experience for me.

“Last year having to miss out on the grass really hurt, but I think it was a blessing in disguise. Ever since I came back from those injuries I have been really putting in great work.”







Despite those headline victories, Draper is yet to advance past the quarter-finals at the iconic event. But this year, the 23-year-old is no longer an imposter. With runs to the semi-finals at the US Open last year and to his biggest title yet in Indian Wells — where he toppled two-time defending champion Alcaraz en route — Draper has firmly established himself among the sport's elite.
Yet for those well-placed to comment, Draper's rapid rise was less a surprise than an inevitability.
“Jack, I think, has bigger goals to aspire to than being British No. 1,” Murray said at Queen's last year. “In my opinion, he can get right up to the top of the game, right to the top of the world rankings. He works really hard and I think grass is a brilliant surface for him. I think he'll do really well over the years on the surface.”
Indeed, Draper's ascent has not only been defined by results, but by resilience. Having overcome a string of physical setbacks earlier in his career, the Briton has redefined his approach, placing renewed emphasis on his conditioning. Draper competed in just four tournaments across the first three months of the year, but yielded a fourth-round finish at the Australian Open, a runner-up showing in Doha and a title run in Indian Wells that propelled him inside the Top 10 for the first time.

Draper then carried that momentum onto the clay, which was once considered his least natural surface, with an inspired run to the final at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid. Despite falling short to Casper Ruud, it was a further signal of his growing adaptability and confidence.
Now, as he returns to home soil at Queen's Club, the second-seeded Draper is among the leading contenders for the crown. In pursuit of his first title at the tournament that helped inspire his dream, Draper aims to join a prestigious roll of champions that includes not only Murray, but other ATP No. 1 Club members Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, and Andy Roddick.

Whether it's sports, tennis—anything in life—I think autistic people are very good at getting in routines and sticking with them. Jenson Brooksby

Jenson Brooksby knew tennis was for him at a very young age. He started playing around 4, toting a racquet around the house, wearing headbands and wristbands like his favorite players and pelting a garage door with Nerf balls. He was swinging plenty, but he wasn't saying much—Jenson didn't speak his first words until around the same age. It was an early sign of autism.“Speech therapy was a full-time job for a while,” Brooksby told Tennis Channel in an exclusive interview. “It was harder to make friends.”

“Speech therapy was a full-time job for a while,” Brooksby told Tennis Channel in an exclusive interview. “It was harder to make friends.”

With plenty of support and a relentless focus, Brooksby would eventually turn a childhood obsession into his full-time job. While innate talent was part of that journey, another element is his ability to excel at routines—something all tennis players must embrace.“He can really lock into a specific skill, and he can do it over, and over, and over again,” says Eric Nunez, Jenson's coach. “He needs to be very specific, what he's working on—explaining the ‘why' sometimes is important, because he can see the big picture.”“His attention to detail is very strong,” says Satoshi Ochi, head strength and conditioning coach at the USTA. “And he wants to do it right.”This year, Brooksby has done more right than ever. Following a third-round showing at Indian Wells, the 24-year-old won his first ATP title in Houston in April—Autism Awareness Month—after coming up short in three prior finals.Eight days earlier, during qualifying, he saved a match point against Federico Augustin Gomez. Brooksby would go on to save match points two more times in Houston, against the third seed, Alejandro Tabilo, and the top seed, Tommy Paul.

The achievement was the culmination of a return to the tour following a 13-month suspension for missing drug tests (he called the ban “unfair and unfortunate”), and a new team he's put together, which includes Nunez.“I really do believe that this autism is a superpower,” says his coach.We'll see how far Brooksby's momentum, and his “superpower,” can take him. The former ATP No. 33 is currently 151st in the world, and is playing all levels of tournaments in his quest for ranking points, including on the ATP Challenger Tour. This week he traveled to Ilkley, England, where he defeated Yosuke Watanuki before falling to Oliver Crawford.

All the talking points ahead of the Canadian GP

Kimi Antonelli has cited his struggles with the new C6 tyre as being one of the key reasons behind his difficulties during the recent triple header of races, with the Italian admitting that his issues with the compound “took some confidence away”.

Following a strong start to his rookie campaign for Mercedes – in which he scored points at five of the opening six races – Antonelli faced a more challenging run from Imola onwards, a weekend in which the all-new C6 was introduced by Pirelli as the soft tyre in their range.

It turned out to be a tough first home race in F1 for the teenager, ending in a retirement owing to a mechanical issue, while he went on to finish Monaco down in P18 after hitting the barriers in Qualifying before recording another mechanically-related DNF in Spain.

Reflecting back on what he had learned across this triple header sequence ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix, Antonelli explained: “It's been quite a tough triple header on my side, especially because performance-wise I didn't do that well, and then we had also a couple of issues.

Antonelli came away from the European triple header with no points

“But overall, I think there's still been a very big learning on my side, especially on how to manage busier weekends. Imola was incredible in terms of how busy it was and also time in front of the home crowd, and I definitely didn't manage things the best way.

“So overall, it's been quite tough – not the way I wanted. But luckily, after these three difficult weekends, we had a week off and now I feel ready to be back on track tomorrow.”

NEED TO KNOW: The most important facts, stats and trivia ahead of the 2025 Canadian Grand Prix

When pushed on what was holding him back during the last three races – given the contrast to his form earlier in the season – Antonelli responded: “I think, above all, the new C6 [tyre] – [in] Imola and Monaco – I've been struggling to find the consistency in the tyre, just to find the consistent performance of the tyre.

“The C6 seems to be a super picky tyre, and it's really difficult to put it in the right window already from the out lap. That's what I've been struggling with. In Imola, I was having such a swing of performances between sessions.

Antonelli is hoping to get on top of his issues with the C6 tyre in Montreal

“In FP3 in Imola, I remember we were up there, and then in Qualifying I suddenly lost five or six tenths compared to FP3. So I've been really struggling to understand the tyre and to put it in the right window, and that took some confidence away.

“That's why I feel in Barcelona it was nice to get back into the rhythm. But at the same time, especially at the start of the session, it took me too long to get into the rhythm. That was also because I had two really difficult Qualifying sessions in the previous two events. So definitely, I think that was the main issue.”

After not being used in Spain, the C6 tyre has returned as part of Pirelli's selection for Montreal. Despite his previous struggles with it, Antonelli is confident that the work he has put into this will pay off at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve.

“During the week we had off, I spent a couple of days at the factory doing some sim work and also trying to analyse the C6 – analyse when it went well, why I was able to extract the performance, and when it went badly, what I did differently,” the 18-year-old said.

“I've been understanding quite a few things. Obviously, Montreal is a completely different track – close tarmac, a lot of low speed, and also quite cold eventually. So I've been trying to really work on that in order to have a better idea, so I know how to behave better, especially this weekend.”

Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon are looking forward to a “special” weekend ahead in Canada as Haas prepare to celebrate their 200th Grand Prix in Formula 1, one in which they are also hoping for a good performance after failing to score points last time out in Spain.

It was back in 2016 at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix that the Haas team made their debut in F1, a race that saw them score their maiden points thanks to Romain Grosjean crossing the line in P6.

Since then the American outfit have endured various highs and lows in the sport, with their strongest finish to date being fifth place in the 2018 Teams' Championship, while the squad's best race result was a fourth scored in that same year by Grosjean at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Now, as they enter into their 200th race, Haas are set to mark the occasion with a special livery for the upcoming weekend in Montreal that harks back to the original design sported on their car back in 2016.

Despite only joining the outfit full-time this year, Bearman is honoured to be a part of their continuing journey through Formula 1.

“I'm very proud of the team and how far they've come,” the Briton said. “Of course it's strange to say, I've only been there for 10 races, but they are the youngest team in F1 and to hit such an incredible milestone of 200 races is very special.

“I'm very happy for them and glad to have played a very small part in their fantastic journey.”

Looking back on Grosjean's points-scoring result on Haas' debut, Bearman added: “I've spoken to Romain a bit because he's been at a few races, and listening to how far the team has come since then is a very special feeling to see as well.

“There are a few people who have been there since the beginning, like Ayao [Komatsu, Team Principal], and it's nice to see the loyalty and how hard he has been working for us.”

Bearman hopes to deliver 'good performance' in Canada at Haas' 200th race

While he would not make his own F1 debut until later in 2016 for the Manor team, Ocon can also recall Haas' first-ever race and the moment that Grosjean claimed sixth for the squad.

“I remember Romain's radio message saying, 'Welcome to Formula 1, guys,'” Ocon explained during media day in Montreal. “That [P6] was pretty impressive I would say. Definitely a nice first race and we are wearing these colours this weekend, the full suit, the livery.

“We have team members' [names] on the front wing as well written down, and it's a nice little throwback and I hope that this will bring us luck this weekend.”

While the milestone will make this weekend's event a “special race” for Haas, Ocon also admitted that the team need to work hard in order to keep up with their rivals.

“I think the good thing is that, when we were able to have decent pace, we've managed to take opportunities and get the result and score some decent points, like [in] Monaco,” the Frenchman said of the recent triple header sequence.

Ocon: Haas' 200th GP will be a 'special weekend'

“But we need to work a little bit more on the consistency, try and get more performance out of the car when the track doesn't necessarily suit our package.

“We are working on all of that with the team, and I hope that we can get a little bit more out of this weekend and the next ones because obviously it's very tight throughout the whole grid.

“Everyone is improving, there are no people that are not dangerous at the moment so it is interesting out there. We need to be on top of our game.”

Bearman echoed those sentiments following a more challenging outing in Spain, with the Briton conceding: “It was a tough one for us in Barcelona. I think made tougher by the fact that some rivals had some good results.

“Good for them, but shows that we still have a bit of work to do. This is a big milestone race for us and I'm really happy to be here and it's a very special moment for the entire team, but of course a good performance would be great.”

Love, a founder member of The Beach Boys, was inducted alongside music legends George Clinton, and The Doobie Brothers' Michael McDonald, Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Mike Love gave thanks to his late cousin and Beach Boys bandmate and co-writer Brian Wilson during his Songwriters Hall of Fame induction in New York on Thursday night, telling the crowd of fellow writers and industry insiders that “I do feel his presence” in the room as he accepted his honor. 


	Love's induction to the Songwriters Hall of Fame came just a day after Wilson died Wednesday at age 82, and 25 years after Wilson himself was inducted into the Hall back in 2000. 




	“I especially must thank my cousin Brian Wilson,” Love said Thursday. “My first cousin by blood but brother in music, together we set the stage for some of the most successful music collaborations of all time.”

	Love was inducted by John Stamos, a famously huge Beach Boys fan who's collaborated with the band frequently. In his induction speech, Stamos said that Love chronicled “the American dream” with the songs he wrote.“He made the whole world want to be us: sun-kissed, carefree, full of promise,” Stamos said. “His lyrics were cinematic. What's a song without a hook? What's a hook without a picture in your head or a memory in your heart? Mike Love knows how to write that song.”  


	Love performed “California Girls,” with Stamos beside him adorned with a sparked gold electric guitar before going through culture-defining hits “I Get Around,” “Kokomo” and “Good Vibrations.”


	Love's induction and performance was just one of several major moments in a ceremony that also celebrated funk legend George Clinton, The Doobie Brothers' Michael McDonald, Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons and hitmakers Ashley Gorley, Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins and Tony Macaulay as this year's inductees. Broadway icon Stephen Schwartz was also recognized as this year's Johnny Mercer Award recipient, while rising star Gracie Abrams received the Hal David Starlight Award. 


	Living Color kicked off the evening to induct Clinton, opening the night with a rousing rendition of Funkadelic's “Cosmic Slop,” complete with shredding guitar solos from Vernon Reid.

	











	Clinton came to the stage afterward for his speech, strutting to “We Want the Funk” and wearing a cream pinstriped suit, a bedazzled gold captain's hat and a Sly and the Family Stone shirt, presumably in homage to his close friend Sly Stone, who also died this week. 


	In his speech, Clinton acknowledged his previous honors and awards like his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, but said that “This one hits different, this comes from people who truly know what it means to be a songwriter,” Clinton said. The 83-year-old stuck around the stage, performing a lively rendition of the Parliament's “(I Wanna) Testify” afterward. 


	Debbie Gibson also took the stage to perform a cover of the Tony Macaulay-penned classic “Build Me Up Butter Cup.” “Tony's list of accolades is the stuff of legend.” Gibson told the crowd. “Wouldn't the world be a happier place if we all sang “Build Me Up Buttercup” and “Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes?”” 


	Dan + Shay inducted Gorley, playing an extensive mashup of several of the country songwriting legend's hits including Morgan Wallen's “Last Night,” Luke Bryan's “Play it Again,” Carrie Underwood's “All-American Girl” Post Malone and Wallen's “I Had Some Help.”


	Gorely's daughter came up for her father, giving a speech before she performed Trace Adkins' “You're Gonna Miss This,” which Gorely wrote with Lee Thomas Miller. 


	Teddy Riley inducted Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins, who recalled his early days as a producer and songwriter, recalling how his father took out $1,200 from his life insurance policy to buy his son production equipment. 

	











	“As a little boy at 5 years old, I used to write poetry for my mother, who would cherish every word, every rhyme,” Riley said. “She didn't know it then, but she was nurturing the soul of a songwriter.”


	Jerkins further spoke about how Clive Davis consistently rejected early songs he'd pitch to the legendary executive until he finally brought him Whitney Houston's classic “It's Not Right, but It's OK.”


	“Clive turned me down and said get back to work. The greatest way to become successful is to be turned down,” Jerkins said. “Those failures turn to wins, it builds you. I came back to Clive's office, the next year and the next year until I walked into his office with “It's Not Right, but it's OK,” and Clive told me ‘I think you've got it, Rodney.'”


	In one of the sweetest (and most impressive) moments of the evening, Jerkins' four children performed a string-arranged cover of Brandy and Monica's “The Boy Is Mine” as their father looked on. 


	Musical theater songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul introduced Schwartz, while Mary Kate Morrissey and Kristin Chenoweth duetted “For Good” from Wicked.


	By the latter half of the evening, the National's Aaron Dessner had introduced Gracie Abrams, his friend and frequent writing partner, as she was presented with the Hal David Starlight Award. 


	She's one of the most gifted lyricists and melodic artists I've ever heard,” Dessner said of Abrams. “Emotional narratives conveyed in her songs are uncompromising, honest, sung from the heart, and deeply moving and relatable to her fans. 

	











	Abrams, who soon after performed her song “Free Now,” told the crowd that “the truth is I love songwriters, and I'll never stop pinching myself that anyone, let alone the Songwriters Hall of Fame, considers me one.” 


	Garth came out soon after and immediately opened with “Long Train Runnin'” before jumping into “China Grove” to induct the Doobies' McDonald, Johnston and Simmons. 


	“We can talk about how great they were decades ago, but trust me, more people are listening to the Doobie Brothers today than they ever have,” Brooks said. “It's feel-good music, undeniable Doobies, some of the greatest songwriting ever.”


	The Doobies, for their part, played their hits “Black Water” and “Takin' It to the Streets” before finishing the night with their ultimate yacht rock classic “Listen to the Music.”


	“It's just amazing to think we would be named along people like Stephen Schwartz on that list,” McDonald said before they played. “If I could send a message to all the writers in this room, I'd say thank you for the inspiration. We've learned from you, we've imitated you our whole lives. We're honored to be among you.”

""Well, that changed — 40 became sexy. It became, 'Man, let's have more of that,'"" Cattrall said about playing sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	With And Just Like That… returning to our screens via HBO Max, it feels right that Kim Cattrall should also get back in on the Sex and The City action.


	The revival series is currently airing with stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis all reprising the roles that catapulted the group to superstardom in the late '90s and early '00s.




	Bar a small cameo in the season two finale, Cattrall has not reteamed with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte on the streets of New York in the new show and confirmed she won't be appearing in the third installment. Reports of a long-running feud between Parker and Cattrall have dominated Sex and The City headlines for years following the 2008 and 2010 movies.

	However, in a new interview with U.K. outlet The Times, Cattrall is revealing a few tidbits about her connection to the iconic character of sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones.




			Related Video		







	In the feature published Thursday evening, the 69-year-old Liverpool-born star said she turned down the role four times, believing that at 41 she wouldn't be seen by audiences as sexy. “Self-inflicted ageism,” she told the paper. “Well, that changed — 40 became sexy. It became, ‘Man, let's have more of that.'”


	The British/Canadian/American actress continued: “[Samantha] wasn't a nymphomaniac — well, some people might have thought she was — but she was just enjoying the main course. Everyone else was nibbling on the appetisers when she was going for the steak.”

	











	“And it was always on her terms — that I always insisted on.”


	Despite such a celebrated performance, Cattrall, who has been dating BBC audio engineer Russell Thomas since 2016, added that she is not much like her character in real life. “I'm the antithesis of her in many ways. I'm a serial monogamist, and then some.”


	The six seasons of the show, which ran from 1998 to 2004, saw the women battle tumultuous love lives, sex problems and professional hiccups while strengthening their own friendships. The popularity of the show has only increased since its addition to streaming services like Netflix, which broadcast the pinnacle of nineties NYC glamor to a younger, Gen Z audience.


	Cattrall was talking to The Times about the second season of Central Intelligence, a retelling of the founding of the CIA in which she stars opposite Ed Harris and Johnny Flynn.


	New episodes of And Just Like That… are dropping weekly on HBO Max and on Sky in the U.K.

The Hollywood Reporter's latest “Person of Interest” is the Pittsburgh-based drag artist and double 'RuPaul's Drag Race' alum who's making her mark on the franchise this Pride season in 'All Stars' season 10: “This is the path that I was meant to take.”


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	With back-to-back seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race under her belt, the internet seems to think Lydia B Kollins is RuPaul Charles' new favorite drag queen. 


	But what does Mrs. Butthole (Yes, the “B” in Lydia B Kollins stands for Butthole) think? “I would love to claim that title, but I think she has room in her heart for so many queens,” she tells The Hollywood Reporter, though it's not hard to believe that she's Ru new go-to girl as the Pittsburgh-based queen was asked back to appear on the landmark 10th season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars immediately after gracing the cast of season 17.

	Queens often take at least a year off before pivoting to the All Stars franchise, but not Lydia, who had a few weeks off between filming season 17 and All Stars season 10. In fact, she believes her quick return to the competition was a “blessing” because she was still “in the competition mindset.” It's widely known in the Drag Race world that she had a mere five days to prepare her package for All Stars, but that didn't hold her back from jumping at the opportunity to showcase her artistry on the biggest platform for drag in the world. “This is the path that I was meant to take,” Lydia asserts of her double-Drag Race status.

	Below, Lydia recounts what it was like reuniting with Chappell Roan (whom she opened for before appearing on Drag Race) on the set of All Stars season 10, what Pride as a new Ru Girl is like, having her partner Kori King (who she met during RPDR season 17) “to ride with me during all this,” and the advice she has for aspiring queens looking to get into drag amid the current political landscape in the United States. 

	











Everybody knows you had roughly four to five days to prepare for All Stars after season 17, and a lot of fans have been pointing out how difficult it must have been to prepare your runways, so how you approach the seasons differently from an emotional standpoint with such little time?


	I think it was kind of like a — I don't want to say a blessing and a curse — I think it was more a blessing. I definitely had already been in the competition mindset, so I went into All Stars with an alleviated sense of stress. Season 17 had a lot of loud, rowdy bitches on the season, and I felt like I couldn't get a word in, but having only five other people in the room with me [at the beginning of my All Stars bracket] was a big help. So I went in with just an air of fun, and my main goal was to have fun.


Going into All Stars 10, Mistress Isabelle Brooks was the only queen who had met you at that point as a Ru Girl because she was on the roast episode of season 17. Do you think this anonymity with your drag and the other queens not knowing who you were was an asset?


	I think so, yes. The only time Mistress saw me was when I was doing well in the competition, so I think that played to my benefit, and I worked with Nicole [Paige Brooks] before even filming season 17, so we had some sort of establishment with each other. But I loved the fact that I went in there and they all knew each other, and they had absolutely no idea what was going on, what to expect from me. That was very tantalizing and very exciting. 

	











When you went in for All Stars, did you fill them in on what challenges you did well on? Did you tell them you won the roast? What was the rundown you gave the other queens? 


	Oh, I absolutely gassed myself up. I was like, “Yeah, I ate season 17 up, I won the roast, I was in the top for every challenge!” I just wanted to scare them, even if it was all a lie (Laughs).


On season 17, RuPaul took an early affinity towards you. Have you seen the memes that came out after the premiere episode of your bracket on All Stars 10 of Jorgeous realizing you're her new favorite, and do you personally think that you are RuPaul's new favorite queen? 


	I mean, listen, I would love to claim that title. I would love to be mother's favorite, so if people are saying that, I'm going to run with it for sure. But I think that she has room in her heart for so many queens, and I mean, Jorgeous is really small, so she'll always fit into one blood vessel one way or another. 


Well, a lot of fans fell in love with you on season 17 after your lip sync to “Boogie Wonderland.” Now, there's another running meme online that you've only (so far) won lip-syncs that are set to 70s and 80s songs. Have you seen that?


	(Laughs) Yes, I have.


Is this your favorite niche of music to perform, or is this just something that has come with your time on Drag Race?


	I mean, kind of. My favorite song to perform is a niche Tom Jones song, and growing up, my dad would play disco music and Earth, Wind & Fire constantly, so I feel like it was something that's always been ingrained in my bones. I'm just really grateful that that happened, you know? I'm grateful that I got the chance to sort of show off what I love. So, yeah, I think it's always been around.

	











You and Kori King started dating after meeting on season 17, but right after that, you were busy filming back-to-back seasons, so when did this relationship blossom? Was it after you shot All Stars, or was it in between seasons before you left to go back for All Stars?


	We immediately started talking after season 17, for sure. But I am, what's the word, crazy, so I really wanted to give it a moment and see what happened, and All Stars happened too quick for us to establish any real [relationship], you know. We didn't hang out as much as we could have before All Stars started. So it really blossomed after both seasons were wrapped up, but we're still going strong. She's gonna come and see me very soon, maybe even tomorrow, so things are going very good with Kori King.


What has it been like being in a new romantic relationship during this really hectic, busy time of your life?


	It's fascinating. I think that Kori takes it like a champ, she is built for this, and her emotional standpoint is super strong. She's very solid in her stance, and I am as well, but I think that I sort of take little comments more seriously than she does, and I think I shouldn't. So, it's the most amazing thing in the world. I love having someone who's going through the same thing as me to ride with me during all this. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't just a little tiny fraction of stress.


And you guys are both so popular on social media, so that must be an added level of stress.












	A little bit, but I kind of love it! I kind of love it. I'm like, “Yeah, that's my man, and y'all know it!” 


After All Stars 10, do you think that you're going to be ready for a break from the machine that is Drag Race, or are we going to see you join the cast of season 18 too?


	Oh, I'm going on season 18, I'm going on [the] vs. the World [spin-off series]. It's gonna be Lydia B. Kollins vs. the World pretty soon, trust and believe. 


On All Stars, you reunited with Chappell Roan after opening for one of her shows last April. What was that like reuniting with her when she came on All Stars as a guest judge? 


	It was awesome, it was great. I feel like I don't even know if she had the chance to watch season 17 or if she knew what was going on, but it was very full circle. It felt like things were aligning and clicking into place exactly how they should be.


Season 17 hadn't even premiered when you were filming All Stars at that point, so what was her reaction when she saw you there for All Stars?


	Jaws were dropped, she was gagged.


Your first public drag performance was during Pride of 2021. Looking forward four years from that time in your life, did you ever think heading into Pride of 2025 that you would be a double Drag Race alumni? 


	(Laughs) I mean, yes. A little part of me was like, this is the path that I was meant to take. I've always said that Lydia Kollins on Drag Race makes a lot of sense, but if I could go back and talk to her, I feel like that girl in 2021 would absolutely not believe me. 

	











What does a typical day in your life look like as Ru Girl on a currently airing Drag Race season during Pride month?


	It's a lot of business. Luckily, I have fantastic managers who help me through it all, and it's a whirlwind. I honestly can't even describe it. It's a lot of preparation, a lot of making, sewing, stitching, editing, mixes and lots of fun stuff coming up, too. I'm preparing for our Butt-Toot-King tour [with Kori and Suzie] that we have coming up, and a lot of Pride shows here in Pittsburgh. It's a lot of a lot, but I am so grateful to be stressed about it.


What has it been like performing with Kori and Suzie Toot after the show? 


	That has been one of, if not my favorite, moments. We've just recently had our first Butt-Toot-King show in New York at 3 Dollar Bill [in Brooklyn], and it was absolutely fantastic. There were so many people at both shows, so much love was shared, and I'm just grateful to have the fans on our side — especially the lesbians.


What else is on your Pride slate this year? 


	There's so much. We have tons of shows coming up — check my Instagram story to find out. Mostly Butt-Toot-King shows coming up, Pittsburgh pride as well. There's going to be a Pittsburgh Pride parade on June 1, and I'm going to be the Grand Marshal. And then there's Pride on the Shore, which is happening on the 30th that is gonna be super exciting.


How are you feeling about being the Grand Marshal of Pittsburgh Pride?


	I think I'm gonna have to see how I feel when it happens. I love my city so much, I'm so grateful to Pittsburgh for nurturing me and making me the drag artist that I am today. So the fact that I am going to be celebrated in this Pride parade is beyond me, it's beyond my world.

	











Drag Race aside, what is your dream gig? 


	Oh, I would love to be in a horror film. Of course I would like to do one-woman shows, I want to make dolls, but mainly I would love to be in a horror movie. If the director of Smile 3 is out there, put me in that movie now, please.


You've been vying for a spot in Smile 3 in the press a lot. Has anyone from Smile reached out yet?


	No, every time they post a story on Instagram or a Reel or on TikTok, I respond to them and I say, “Hey, I'm available!” If you've seen the ending of Smile 2, I think it would make total sense to have a drag queen in this movie.


Looking back on your experience with RuPaul's Drag Race and All Stars, if there was one thing that you wish you had known going into both seasons, what would that be?


	I can't speak much for All Stars 10 because I feel like I've applied it, but for season 17, I would just say to relax. RuPaul always says, “Don't reinvent the wheel, the wheel is just fine,” and she's totally right about that. You have to sort of make the wheel your own, and just have fun. I think that I was so stressed during season 17 and so full of anxiety that it hindered me a lot, and the main thing is, if you're having fun, then they will have fun.


Are there any other pieces of advice you've learned from RuPaul from your time on both seasons? 


	I mean, she has a plethora of quotes and life advice that I think is really valuable, that I've applied to my own life since before the race and after. I think the biggest piece of advice that I've taken is that “What other people think of you is none of your business.” It's a very valuable quote, and I think about it constantly, and it is very true. I mean, obviously, read the comments that are full of love, accept the support, but truly at the end of the day, you just have to be strong in what your viewpoints are, and yeah, what other people think of you is none of your business.

	











As a very young, successful, now two-time Drag Race alumnus, what piece of advice would you give to any other young queens out there who are looking into getting into drag in this turbulent time in our political state?


	I was doing drag for years and years before Drag Race, since I was a very young child, and I think the most valuable thing is to stay passionate, keep creating, keep making art. Stop for literally nothing, unless it's hindering your life. Keep making art — art is the most important thing that I think young people have. If you can't vote, if you can't go out and make a difference yourself, making art is definitely something that I hold a lot of value to, and that's what's helped me throughout my entire life.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the 10th Amendment and exceeded President Trump's statutory authority. 


							By 

	The Associated Press



	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.


	The court said it would hold a hearing on the matter Tuesday. The ruling came only hours after a federal judge's order was to take effect at noon Friday.




	Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the 10th Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. The order applied only to the National Guard troops and not Marines who were also deployed to the L.A. protests. The judge said he would not rule on the Marines because they were not out on the streets yet.

	California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had asked the judge for an emergency stop to troops helping carry out immigration raids, had praised the earlier ruling.

	“Today was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,” Newsom said in a news conference before the appeals court decision.


	In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump thanked the appeals court Friday morning.


	“If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now,” he said.


	The White House had called Breyer's order “unprecedented” and said it “puts our brave federal officials in danger.”


	“The district court has no authority to usurp the President's authority as Commander in Chief,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. “The President exercised his lawful authority to mobilize the National Guard to protect federal buildings and personnel in Gavin Newsom's lawless Los Angeles. The Trump Administration will immediately appeal this abuse of power and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

	











	About 700 Marines have been undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California. Nicholas Green, an attorney for the state, told the court: “I have been told by the office of the governor that within the next 24 hours, 140 Marines will replace and relieve National Guard members in Los Angeles.”


	Typically the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.


	Title 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service under certain limited circumstances, such as when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government” or when the president is unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”


	Breyer, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said in his ruling that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.


	“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” he wrote.


	Newsom sued to block the Guard's deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids.


	The governor argued that the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and wanted the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying that involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.

	











	Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles, said that as of Wednesday about 500 of the Guard troops had been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials.


	None of the Marines have been trained to go on immigration raids, and it is not yet clear if they eventually will, Sherman said.


	In his broad ruling, the judge determined Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place.The lawsuit argued that Title 10 also requires that the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard.


	Brett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not.


	In a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump's orders were not subject to judicial review.


	“Courts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation. Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. And courts should not interfere here either,” the department said.


	“Our position is this is not subject to judicial review,” Shumate told the judge.


	Breyer, who at one point waved a copy of the Constitution, said he disagreed.

	











	“We're talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority. That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George,” he said.


	The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.


	Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

Executive produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Jackie Jesko's film traces the iconic journalist's life and career.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	It's a familiar routine: Famous person dies and each network's news division works quickly to cobble together (or finish off) a tribute special that answers a few basic questions — “Why was this person significant?” mostly — in a satisfying way that can be delivered within days of the death.


	Tribute packages like that aren't really “documentaries,” but they serve a valuable purpose for grieving or simply curious fans.







	
	
		
					Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	A decent, if thin, primer.
	



Venue: Tribeca Film Festival (Spotlight Documentary)Airdate: Monday, June 23 (Hulu)Director: Jackie Jesko

								1 hour 35 minutes			






	The problem with Jackie Jesko's new documentary Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything, premiering at Tribeca ahead of a Hulu launch, is that for much of its 95-minute run, it feels exactly like one of those immediately posthumous overviews.

	Especially in its first half, Tell Me Everything tries to emulate the iconic television journalist by guiding audiences through basic information, and eventually asking the tough questions, or at least touching on provocative issues. But it only rarely pushes deeper than hero worship.




			Related Video		







	The conceit of letting Walters' own interview tactics steer the documentary isn't a bad one, but as executed here, it isn't interesting either, which is a pity since Walters was absolutely interesting. The doc showcases Walters' approach use of seemingly basic questions to set her subjects at ease before sneaking in the blunt or pointed queries. But since Jesko isn't actually talking to Walters, it's hard to know whom she thinks she's setting at ease and to what end.


	The first half of the documentary traces Walters' path from childhood to her early reporting endeavors to her time at Today and then ABC Evening News. Jesko takes us through the sexism Walters experienced along the way — one condescending male nemesis after another — before ABC gave her the chance to do the long-form TV interviews that helped an industry find a then-unprecedented blurring of lines between celebrity and news.

	











	She interviewed presidents, dictators and actors, and the footage is exceptional, if familiar. Walters sitting awkwardly with Harry Reasoner at the ABC Evening News desk. Walters sitting far less awkwardly with Anwar al-Sadat and Menachem Begin. Walters sitting amiably with the likes of Bette Midler and Clint Eastwood. The interviews with various producers/colleagues, plus Midler as a representative of the tier of stars Walters was both friendly and professional with, are decent. But two-plus years after Walters' death, there's nothing here that indicates a deeper understanding courtesy of the passing of time or the presence of these particular talking heads.


	In the second half of the documentary, things get significantly better, as we follow Walters into her peak years and get some insights from figures like Katie Couric, Oprah Winfrey and Connie Chung, who followed in Walters' footsteps. There are interesting sections on Walters' famous Rolodex, the competitiveness of interview booking in the '80s and '90s, and a fantastic segment on Walters' famous sit-down with Monica Lewinsky, featuring memories from Lewinsky and from Winfrey, who thought she had the interview herself only for Walters to sneak in and snag it. A bunch of people who aren't Diane Sawyer spend a lot of time circling the nature of the Sawyer/Walters rivalry.


	Sawyer, however, is not present, which is a running theme when it comes to the most difficult topics on the documentary's plate. Jesko knows the stories she needs to tell, but she doesn't necessarily have the interviews that she needs to tell them properly. Sawyer's absence is a big deal given how crucial the documentary believes that dynamic to be. Walters' frequently estranged daughter Jacqueline isn't here, either, which is a big deal given how the thesis of the film ends up being “Walters chose her career over love and over family.”

	











	The handling of the rest of Walters' personal life is left to people without direct personal knowledge, so there's completely hollow speculation about what was or wasn't happening in the relationship (or “relationship”) between Walters and Roy Cohn — one of those odd facts that many people already know, but will blow a few minds — or her multiple marriages to Merv Adelson, who isn't even mentioned. Instead, we're taking a lot of personal details on faith from Cindy Adams — whose presence and expertise are at least explicable given her stature as an iconic gossip columnist — and from a makeup artist whose exact role in Walters' life is never explained. (That makeup artist, Lori Klein, worked with Walters for 29 years. I know this from press notes, not the documentary.)


	The most emotionally affecting piece of Tell Me Everything isn't even from Tell Me Everything. The parade of female journalists who appeared on Walters' last episode of The View is presented in full, and it somehow provides, without resorting to voiceover or analysis, an efficient overview of Walters' cultural impact far more potent than anything the doc contributes on its own.


	I think it's clear-eyed and reasonable for a documentary about any hard-working figure to follow its story to a conclusion of “Can you have it all? No. But here's why that's OK.” Would you ever get a documentary about a male figure asking the same question? Certainly not. And does Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything fully interrogate its own conclusions? Not really. It's a simple and respectful documentary that, had it come out a month after Walters' death, would have made its point decently. It's in taking that step back and using the distance afforded by time for something more substantive that it falls short.

The Celebration of Pride '25, presented by Paramount+ FYC, brought a slew of guests from the LGBTQ community and allies to West Hollywood. 


							By 

	THR Staff



The Hollywood Reporter partnered up with GLAAD for the Celebration of Pride '25 party Wednesday night that brought a slew of guests from the LGBTQ community and allies to West Hollywood. 


	Several stars stopped by the celebration, presented by Paramount+ FYC at Sunset at Edition, to dance, chat and, most important, gather as a community — something GLAAD's Anthony Allen Ramos emphasized was critical. “I think more than ever it's important to be loud and proud and vocal,” Ramos told THR before the large crowd gathered at the event, which also served as a celebration of GLAAD's 40th year.

	“The more that we can come together during Pride and remind the world that we are just like everyone else, we are everyday people, but we're also super creative when it comes to the work that we do in the entertainment industry and beyond,” he added. “It's unfortunate that we're having these new challenges, but if you look back at history, we overcame it, and I'm hoping that [with] Pride, everyone feels like we can do it again.”

	The event featured plenty of stars, including the cast of Prime Video's Overcompensating, who stopped by THR's portrait studio and red carpet. Much of the cast shared how they're celebrating pride this year. I've been to a few events. I go with the flow, and I try to watch as many gay things as possible,” creator and star Benito Skinner told THR on the red carpet. “I also treat myself. I'm like, ‘It's Pride, I need a new top,'” he said, jokingly clarifying “not like that.”

	











	Skinner's co-star and longtime comedy partner Mary Beth Barone had a pretty simple answer. “I'm going to have sex with women,” she said. “I think that's the best way I can do it.”

	A running theme of the night — through speeches by THR's co-editor-in-chief Maer Roshan and GLAAD's Zeke Smith and from comments from attendees — was the importance of celebrating Pride this year.


	“We're surrounded with queer talent [and] with allies who support our community. The idea that we get to celebrate now more than ever being authentically who we are, that is a weapon,” What We Do in the Shadows star Harvey Guillén told THR during the event. “The weapon is that we are who we are and we have ourselves, our allies. Literally who we are is our weapon.”


Ghosts star Danielle Pinnock echoed Guillén's sentiment. “I'm a proud ally. I would not be where I am without the LGBTQIA community and more specifically the Black LGBTQIA community,” she added.


	“We're in a time where it is a hot mess, honey, with our leadership and the queer community right now, what pride means to me is independence. It's inspiration,” she continued. “We have to keep our creativity going because even when they say no, we have to say yes. I hope everyone in the community continues to move forward.”


	Other attendees included Yellowjackets' Samantha Hanratty, Raven-Symoné, Adam DiMarco of Overcompensating, Scott Hoying of Pentatonix, former SNL castmember Sasheer Zamata, Wilson Cruz and Lance Bass.

The soulful ballad from the quintet dropped a week after the band was signed by the Avex Music Group.

	Gil Kaufman



	While Justin Bieber stays busy recording the long-awaited follow-up to his 2021 Justice album, his backing gorup, We the Band, dropped their debut single on Friday morning (June 13). The Earth, Wind & Fire-esque slow-burn R&B jam “One & Only” showcases the group's smooth, soulful vocals and retro '70s funk style. The slick accompanying performance video was directed by Zev York in collaboration with Nick DeMoura, who was the choreographer and creative director for JB's 2023 Believe world tour.

	











	The group consisting of bassist/vocalist Harv, DJ Tay James, guitarist/vocalist Julian Michael, drummer Devin “Stixx” Taylor and keyboardist Dr. O backed up Bieber on his 2015 Purpose world tour as well as his 2022 Justice world tour, which prematurely ended in Sept. 2022 after the singer revealed that he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and suffering from partial facial paralysis.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	According to a release announcing the song, Tay James met Bieber in 2009 after graduating from college, snagging a gig as the singer's official DJ, followed by bassist Harv taking on the role of music director in Bieber's live band, which he filled out with Taylor and Michael. In 2021, Harv co-wrote and co-produced Bieber's Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Peaches.”


	We The Band recently signed with the Avex Music Group and the group is working to finish their as-yet-untitled debut album, which, according to a release announcing the signing will include unnamed “special guest appearances.”


	“This has been a dream of ours for many years now,” the group said in a statement. “To create our own music that represents who we are as musicians with the support of a global powerhouse like Avex is incredibly exciting for all of us. We can't wait for our fans to hear what we've been working on.”


	At press time no additional information was available on Bieber's next studio album, which the singer has been teasing for much of the past year via videos and pictures from the recording studio.

	However, with Swift and Kelce in the crowd, ice hockey was of least concern for fans of the musician, with announcers focusing on the pair to describe them as “musical and sporting royalty.” Likewise, even a photo of the pair taken during the game's second period with Canadian hockey icon Wayne Gretzky failed to overtake the excitement generated by Swift's presence.

	Per a recent report from People, Swift is currently staying with Kelce at his Florida residence while he's in training for the upcoming NFL season. In February, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end made the decision that he would return to professional football for another season, with the upcoming season set to be his last under contract with the team.


	Earlier this month, Travis and brother Jason spoke to former professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal on their New Heights podcast, where the NBA icon suggested that Travis could follow in his footsteps of his DJ moniker Diesel and become an opening act for Swift.

	











	“You know what [would be] crazy? You opening up with your girlfriend,” O'Neal suggested. “Bro, you'd be a f–king star. Ten minutes hyping up the crowd, oh my God.” 


	“Come on, you know I'm a hype man,” Kelce said while laughing. “You know I'm a hype man. Get it rocking in there. Have the Swifties bouncing off the walls before T gets out there.”

""One of my all time favorite songs ever,"" the Green Day singer said of the 1964 single.

	Tyler Jenke



Billie Joe Armstrong has paid tribute to Brian Wilson by sharing a cover of the Beach Boys‘ 1964 classic “I Get Around.”


	The Green Day guitarist and vocalist shared his rendition of the song on Instagram on Wednesday (June 12), hours after the news of Wilson's passing broke. 


	“Thank you Brian Wilson,” Armstrong wrote. “I recorded a cover of ‘I Get Around' a few years ago.. never got to share it. One of my all time favorite songs ever.”

	Originally released in May 1964 as the sole single from the Beach Boys' sixth album, All Summer Long, “I Get Around” would become the group's first song to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100, a feat they would achieve twice more in the '60s – thanks to “Help Me, Rhonda” and “Good Vibrations” – and once in 1988 by way of “Kokomo.”

	Armstrong's rendition of “I Get Around” isn't exactly a left-field choice for the musician, especially given the influence that many bands of the pop-punk genre have taken from the Beach Boys' approach to music and songwriting. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	While Green Day's 2009 track “Last of the American Girls” was noted as containing harmonies reminiscent of the Beach Boys, Wilson himself showed an ignorance toward the punk genre in 2015. “I never went for that. I never went for the fast kind of music,” he told The Guardian. 


	Wilson passed away on June 11 at the age of 82, with his death inspiring countless tributes from musicians around the world. In the same vein as Armstrong, Sting honored Wilson's legacy by performing a live rendition of 1966's “God Only Knows.”

	











	“Today, one of my heroes died, Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys,” Sting said during the encore of his Wednesday night concert in Rostock, Germany. “So I want to sing a song that I love.” Both Sting and Wilson had previously performed the same song together during a 2008 concert at Carnegie Hall.

More than ever, the independent sector of the music business sits at the core of the entire industry. Last November, a MIDiA Research report put indie labels' global market share at 46.7% — and that has come with plenty of pressure, as private equity firms and major music companies have begun snapping up distributors, launching new ventures in the space and coming for pieces of the pie. But it has also proved one underlying fact: The indie world is thriving and everyone wants in on the action. At this critical juncture, Billboard celebrates the most influential record labels, distribution companies and associations helping nurture that artistry — and push it into the future.

In 2015, Dana Biondi was looking for the future.The frat-rap and weed-rap crazes in the early 2010s catapulted artists like Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y to fame, but by the middle of the decade, Biondi — who had promoted shows at New Haven, Conn., club Toad's Place and had some rap management experience — sensed a different energy on hip-hop's horizon. “I had really seen a lot of the fans sit at shows and just kind of bob their head,” he recalls. “I knew that the industry was pushing toward a new movement.”Biondi found that future in $uicideboy$. At the dawn of what would come to be known as the SoundCloud rap era, the New Orleans hip-hop duo, consisting of cousins $crim and Ruby da Cherry, had quickly attracted a passionate cult following with their strikingly personal lyrics, rock-influenced sonics and attitude, and, particularly, their riotous live shows. “The first show that I went to to see them was at the Roxy [in Los Angeles] — and it was chaos like I had never seen before,” says Biondi, now 36. “Between the mosh pits and the fandom and the overall show just being… chaotically beautiful, in a way. I [knew] that they were really special.”He started managing the Boy$ shortly after — along with longtime friend Kyle Leunissen, who introduced him to the duo — while also serving as music manager for G59 Records, the cousins' own label. Distributed by The Orchard, G59 now boasts a battalion of similarly minded artists like Shakewell, Germ and Night Lovell who have since cultivated their own fan bases. But the empire all revolves around $uicideboy$, who have not only hit the top 10 of the Billboard 200 with each of their four official studio albums but also become a popular arena act with their annual Grey Day Tour (which in 2024 grossed $50.7 million, according to Billboard Boxscore) and a dominant brand in artist merchandise. (Biondi cites merch sales of over $30 million in 2024 alone.)

During the last 12 months, A2IM, the trade group that has been advocating for indie labels for the last 20 years, received the President's “E” Star Award from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which recognizes significant contributions to U.S. export growth, which A2IM did through its “unique project amplifying the export of music,” Hresko says. “It's a powerful validation of the global reach and cultural value of independent music.” Additionally, A2IM was named one of Women in Music's Best Places to Work. “That recognition means a lot — it reflects the work we've done to build a supportive, inclusive environment not just internally but across the independent music community as a whole,” she says. This year will also be Burgess' last atop the trade association; after 10 years, he plans to step down at the end of 2025.

“Artists need real support systems: fair policies, transparent revenue streams and legislation that protects their rights.” —Hresko

AIM capped off its 25th anniversary in 2024 with its first cohort of independent music apprentices completing their placements and new partnerships to support indie music communities in regions outside London. “We also saw the most inclusive celebration ever of independent music success at the U.K.'s Independent Music Awards,” Davy says. Highlights included an award for Glastonbury headliner Barry Can't Swim, a memorable acceptance speech from Neneh Cherry on the role independent music played in her success and a surprise visit from Los Angeles-based rock band Sparks, which announced its return to independent music through a new deal with Transgressive Records. Adds Davy: “It was an incredible night with the best mixture of community, star quality and heart-stopping music.”



Planas is proud of the “unprecedented solidarity” the global independent music community has shown recently to challenge the growing trend of acquisitions by major labels, including petitioning competition authorities around the world for intervention. “These acquisitions have moved beyond normal business growth into a juggernaut strategy, squeezing out competition in various parts of the value chain, forcing independent labels and artists into an increased dependency for access to distribution channels and other essential services,” she says, adding that the collective action “aims to establish new precedents for scrutinizing music industry mergers and acquisitions, potentially reshaping how regulatory bodies evaluate market concentration in creative industries.”

“Choice — specifically, the freedom to choose business partnerships that align with [artists'] unique career visions.”

The launch of Merlin Connect in June 2024 was “a major milestone,” says Sirota, who announced in May he'll be stepping down at the end of 2025. That initiative offers emerging tech and social platforms flexible terms and licenses for independent music, allowing rights holders to get paid as startups get off the ground. “By removing the traditional legal and operational hurdles of music licensing, Merlin Connect empowers startups and scale-ups to integrate fully cleared, quality music into their products with greater ease and speed,” he adds, noting that since the launch, two partnerships have been “unlocked,” one is “in the pipeline,” and dozens more applications have been received.

“We are in a next wave of digital upheaval — defined by disruption, emerging business models and the rapid rise of AI [artificial intelligence]. A decade ago, launching a new service or app was far more complex; today, new platforms emerge constantly, especially outside the music industry.”

Having taken a stand against excessive consolidation, IMPALA supports the European Commission's decision to investigate Universal Music Group's acquisition of Downtown Music. “Major players are important in any market but there is a point when big is too big,” Smith says. IMPALA has also spoken out on remuneration and streaming reform and regards diversity, equity and inclusion work as “a priority in the current climate.” This year, Smith notes, IMPALA also “became a recognized [European Union] cultural network, supporting work on digital, finance, DEI, sustainability, international cooperation and more.”

“Consolidation has increased and independent market access options are reducing, so there is more work dealing with regulators, but this should return to normal soon.”

In June 2024, LVRN invested in Jerk x Jollof, a “global brand and event series celebrating Afro Caribbean culture, cuisine and nightlife,” Balogun says, noting that the partnership “aligned perfectly with our own mission at LVRN — to create spaces where Black culture and artistry thrive.” LVRN also recently signed CIZA, whose “Isaka (6am)” has spent five weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's South Africa Songs chart; Odeal, who was Billboard's inaugural African Rookie of the Month in January; and Belly Gang Kushington, who “is literally stopping traffic in Atlanta to bring a music video vision to life for his debut album that just dropped,” Balogun says, adding that Summer Walker will have a new album this year.

“Individuality. Artists who know who they are and aren't afraid to be unapologetically themselves are cutting through the noise. It's not just about the music anymore; it's about presence, perspective and personality.” —Balogun

PULSE caught a ride on a rocket ship last year with Tommy Richman's “Million Dollar Baby,” a bona fide smash that ended 2024 as the eighth most-streamed song of the year in the United States by audio streams, according to Luminate, and has blown past 900 million official on-demand U.S. streams through the end of May. “With our partner, Concord, every department had a big hand in helping this song reach the level of success that it did,” Cutler says. “The fact that we are nimble and we were able to react immediately as an indie definitely played a significant part here as well.”

“An artist's ability to communicate effectively with their fans. The audience now holds more power than ever.” —Cutler



Grupo Frontera completed its second sold-out U.S. tour across 30 arenas with “a whole new production, musical arrangements and show,” Cantú says. The co-founder and musician also highlights the band's ventures beyond touring, such as expanding its label by hiring executives across various sectors, creating “a one-stop shop for our music and brand development.” And the group's collaborations continue to flourish, with the Mala Mía EP alongside Fuerza Regida reaching No. 9 on Top Latin Albums and No. 6 on Top Regional Mexican Albums. “We love to experiment with our sound and try new things, but we make sure to keep our essence,” Cantú says. “That's why fans resonate with our music.”

“We have been able to independently cultivate our brand [and] oversee creative decisions and business decisions. A few years ago, artists couldn't dream of finding the success we have independently.” —Cantú

Kim Gordon earned two Grammy Award nominations in 2025 for best alternative music performance and best alternative music album. “It's been amazing to see her claim her rightful place in music history with the accolades generated by her most recent work,” says Amory, who lists “short attention spans, the decline of legacy media and the exponential explosion in the sheer quantity of music being released” as headwinds for indie labels looking to “cut through the noise.”

“Of course, one can always list touring, socials, incredible visuals, interesting collaborations and new studio tracks dropping after the album release. But without life-changing music, the rest is just window dressing.” —Amory

Bad Bunny, Rimas' top artist — and Assad's marquee management client — again made headlines, this time with his album DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. Released in January, the set became Bad Bunny's fourth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and involved a savvy marketing strategy that will include a residency in the artist's native Puerto Rico. Assad has also focused in the past year on expanding his company's structure and reach. Rimas now encompasses label Rimas Music, whose signings include Bad Bunny, Eladio Carrión and Mora; management division Habibi, with clients including Karol G, Arcángel and Sebastián Yatra; distributor Sonar, through The Orchard; athletic agency Rimas Sports; booking agency Rimas Nation; and the Rimas Foundation. In March, Rimas announced it had acquired a “significant stake” in Argentine indie label Dale Play, home to Bizarrap and Duki. “From day one,” Assad says, “our mission has been to support and develop artists with authenticity and respect for their identity.”



After celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2024, Fat Beats “continues to be a leading voice and outlet for independent artists and labels,” Atlas says. The distribution company and retail brand, which joined the Rostrum Pacific umbrella in early 2024, has supported artists such as Talib Kweli & J Rawls, Smif n Wessun, IDK, Shordie Shordie, The Heatmakerz, Diamond D, Tinashe, Tuxedo, 80 Empire and more. “Our mission is to continue to support the growing desire and connection of consumers to connect with the music and artists they love,” he says.

“Always great music, but also knowing your audience and how to directly speak to and reach them. Understand how to connect with them, and offer insight into the artist's world.”

Since building Brent Faiyaz and his Lost Kids label into a “$100 million brand,” Baisden says, COLTURE has become an incubator for other developing R&B/hip-hop labels, including partnerships with Million Dollars Worth of Game and Soulection. COLTURE has also partnered with AG Touring to elevate overall marketing for the company, whose current roster of R&B/hip-hop tours includes Faiyaz, Sexyy Red, GloRilla, Fridayy and Rod Wave. Baisden's firm is expanding into other pursuits, too, such as co-producing Broadway's Othello. “COLTURE is developing into a notable multisector company across music, sports and media,” says Baisden, 2024's Indie Power Players Executive of the Year.

“Engaging with your fans in a way that motivates them to leave home and meet you at your live shows is essential.” —Baisden

Just four years into the company's existence, Exceleration Music's investments and partnerships include distribution (Redeye) and record labels spanning rock, punk, blues and, most recently, jazz. “We were proud to add the Mack Avenue Music Group to our roster of labels, strengthening our commitment to the jazz genre,” Barros says of the 2024 acquisition. “We were equally proud that our label partners at Down the Road Records were entrusted with the release of Alison Krauss & Union Station's wonderful Arcadia album, their first release in over 14 years.”

“Major-label consolidation has provided fewer good choices for labels wishing to stay truly independent. We stand firm in our belief that a healthy industry needs healthy alternatives to those systems.” —Barros

Digital distributor DistroKid pays over $1.5 million per day in commission-free royalties, Bauer says, adding that although the total number of tracks uploaded to streaming services declined by 4.4% last year, according to Luminate, uploads through DistroKid grew by more than 30% year over year. The contrast “highlights the continued momentum of independent artists using self-serve tools to reach a global audience and release music on their own terms,” he says. “There's been a clear shift toward building direct relationships with listeners — through on-demand merch, driving traffic to personal websites and owning the experience end-to-end.”

“The focus has moved away from chasing viral moments and toward long-term connection and control.”

Concord's constellation of labels excelled across the spectrum in the past year. Tommy Richman's “Million Dollar Baby” (PULSE Music) was the eighth most-streamed song of 2024 by audio streams, Sierra Ferrell (Rounder Records) won four Grammys in February, and Ghost's Skeletá (Loma Vista) became the Swedish hard-rock band's first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 in May, with Becci saying such successes proved Concord “genuinely impacted culture at a new level across all our frontline labels.” And, with the $50 million-plus acquisition of Stem in March, Concord further “expanded the services we can offer to artists,” Becci adds.

“Authenticity always has and always will move the needle. Music is about connection, and fans will always seek out the music that speaks to them.”



K Music (formerly Kartel Music) has cemented itself as “a flagship label in the Mexican and broader Latin music landscape,” Becerra says. Over the past year, the label built a globally impactful catalog of over 1,000 songs while developing the careers of artists transforming regional Mexican music. Breakthrough talents include Luis R. Conriquez — “a top performer in both Mexico and the U.S.,” he says — as well as rising stars like Tony Aguirre, Joel de la P and Said Norzagaray. Becerra notes a shift in the indie world toward “artist empowerment,” with many acts owning their masters. “Talent alone isn't enough anymore — artists need to be creators, storytellers and brand-builders to stand out.”

“Today, many artists are building their own labels from the ground up, supported by flexible label-service partners that deliver across A&R, marketing and commercial strategy.” —Becerra

Benz and De Oliveira run their company on the belief that “discoverability is decided by fans and algorithms, no longer by major players or playlists,” as Benz puts it. It's a lesson the two learned when building up the popular YouTube channel Trap Nation as passionate, entrepreneurial teenagers looking to break into the music business. Since starting broke records, the label has seen “Embrace It” by Ndotz and “Alibi” by Sevdaliza land on Spotify's Global Top 50 chart, and its international roster, which includes bbno$, ZHU, sosocamo, RJ Pasin and BLP Kosher, do tens of millions of streams a day on Spotify globally, according to the company.

“You can have a hit single now in a matter of several weeks and do not have to spend a dollar, if you're lucky. This landscape did not exist 10 years ago, and the freedom to do what you like, how you like did not either.” —Benz

Read the full profile on executive of the year Dana Biondi here.

Black 17 Media was one of the first labels to see the promise of the genre phonk, which flourishes on TikTok, and the bet has paid off handsomely: The company's roster amassed 7 billion streams in the last 12 months, and Black 17 paid out more than $35 million in royalties to over 600 artists around the world. Unlike many of its label competitors, Black 17 “covers over 95% of marketing costs internally,” Blatchley says, making them nonrecoupable instead of “burdening our clients with substantial debt.” That means “the responsibility for success” lands squarely on the shoulders of Black 17's co-founders — and that's the way they like it.

“There's a ton of new deal options and more investment capital than ever, but not enough music companies trying to create valuable marketing services for their ­releases.” —Blatchley

Riley Green has been on Big Machine Label Group's Nashville Harbor imprint since 2018, but his career was propelled into overdrive over the past year, leading Borchetta to call Green's “global breakthrough” one of BMLG's biggest achievements. Green and Ella Langley scored a Country Airplay No. 1 with “you look like you love me,” and the saucy duet also won the pair the Country Music Association Award for musical event of the year and three trophies at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Green's sultry follow-up, “Worst Way,” has soared into the top five on Country Airplay. Borchetta adds that Green recently finished a Canadian tour and “just killed it.”

“Great still wins, but how you market and connect with ‘great' is everything. Artists must be remarkable in their own way to claim their place in this attention-based economy.” —Borchetta

While layoffs and consolidation have been common in the music business in recent years, Symphonic Distribution is expanding and hiring. “We have invested a great deal in our proprietary technology as well as in our people with a large investment operationally, but also through a recent push further expanding our A&R presence worldwide,” Brea says. In the last year, the Tampa, Fla.-based company invested in the Asia Pacific region, and Brea plans additional “boots on the ground” in more key territories by the end of the year.

“No amount of talent offsets the need for an artist to have a fan base. The best music on earth will fall flat if no one is there to hear the release or buy tickets to the show.” —Brea

From executing the soundtracks to movie blockbusters like Moana 2, Mufasa: The Lion King and the live-action Snow White to developing the careers of Hollywood Records artists such as Sofia Carson, kenzie and more, Disney Music Group has continued to expand its creative and commercial reach. Citing more than 4 billion listening hours logged with Disney Music and an attendance sheet of over 2 million people at Disney concerts worldwide in the past 12 months, Bunt adds that the company has “had a lot of success in the past year” with touring, particularly for artists TINI, almost monday, Andy Grammer and Adrian Lyles.

Tyree “DJ Drama” Simmons

Generation Now was busy churning out hits this past year. Lil Uzi Vert returned with their unexpected Eternal Atake 2 album in 2024, while Jack Harlow charted with “Hello Miss Johnson,” “Set You Free” and, most notably, his “Just Us” collaboration with Doja Cat. DJ Drama also dropped mixtapes with Young Buck and G Perico.

“Artists are moving smarter — they're building real businesses, leveraging tech and tapping into major opportunities without losing their freedom. Independence isn't just an option anymore — it's the blueprint.” —Cannon



APG has enjoyed recent success with electronic producer Odetari and rapper BabyChiefDoIt. The company has also worked to build a self-sustaining ecosystem over the last year by bringing “more core record-label functions in-house,” Copell says — from royalty processing to legal services to direct distribution. “By eliminating third-party bottlenecks, we're moving faster and solving problems with the ­urgency that artists expect,” Copell adds. “Rights disputes at DSPs [digital service providers] can sideline a release for weeks — unless you have a team with the legal insight and the right industry relationships to fix it fast. That's what we do at APG.”

“A song on TikTok isn't just fighting for space with other music, it's going head-to-head with brand campaigns, influencer drops and comedy skits. The artists who break through are the ones who work.” —Copell

This year, Venice Music launched Rollout Strategies, a campaign-planning system that gives artists a release strategy tailored to their goals, which Carter says is “designed to replace guesswork with guidance.” He explains, “It breaks down what to do, when to do it and how to keep growing once the music is out. Independent artists need more than tools. They need structure, clarity and a way forward. We've expanded access to real support through workshops led by experts, one-on-one feedback sessions and intimate in-person gatherings that spark real connections. The hardest part for most artists isn't making the music. It's knowing what to do after.”

“Artists can now operate with the precision of a label, if they have the right strategy and support. The definition of ‘independent' isn't scrappy anymore — it's strategic.” —Carter

AudioSalad has become “a truly global organization” in the past year, Catling says, a period during which he has helped lead the company's metadata and media asset management, delivery and distribution services into new territories thanks to what he calls “new technical capabilities.” Being more widely available is more necessary than ever, he says, as “the major labels are strengthening by acquiring further market share, creating further fragmentation of the independent sector.”

“Artists increasingly see the independent sector as a viable option through which they can release music and retain ownership compared to antiquated label deals.”

The recent addition of a touring division to hello82's core services — which previously included helping K-pop acts like ATEEZ and P1Harmony with album releases, merchandise, marketing and events — adds a new dimension to the Los Angeles-based entertainment company, which is constantly hustling to reach the genre's hardcore fans. “Over the past 12 months, we have released eight albums, achieved the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 twice and expanded our reach to regions including Europe and Mexico,” Choi says. That combination of international growth and meticulous detail requires a hands-on approach: “In this way,” he continues, “hello82 has become a platform where artists can discover new fans while also connecting with their superfans.”

“We're seeing more and more artists gaining significant recognition online before signing a label or distribution deal. This is creating new pathways to debut and grow as an artist.”



With electronic duo ODESZA playing stadiums and arenas in 2024 and “selling record numbers of tickets,” according to Clausen, and rock band Black Country, New Road landing its Forever Howlong album at No. 3 on the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart in April, Ninja Tune heads into its 35th year with “thriving artists.” The label's production music division also increased revenue more than 20% and is “focusing heavily on new business development at the forefront of the AI era,” Clausen says. Next for the label: continuing to break Fcukers, Glass Beams and nimino.

“A strong social presence, a compelling live strategy and artistry that reflects genuine craft and contributes to culture are all key. Building true fandom matters more than ever.”

2025 has been another stellar year for J. Cole's Dreamville, as the label closed out its Dreamville Festival in April with its biggest lineup to date including performances from Lil Wayne and the Hot Boys, Tems, Erykah Badu and Cole himself. Fans also got the new Cole track “cLOUDs,” all while he continues to tease his long-awaited album The Fall Off. While it's unclear when the set may finally arrive, Dreamville filled the gaps with stellar new single releases from Bas and JID, with the latter confirming that his new album is due Aug. 8.

 Avant Garden

Artists like Chiiild, Emotional Oranges, Rory and Evan Fong are putting their trust in Avant Garden, an indie label based in Los Angeles. Through partnering with the company, now “over a dozen artists [have] become financially stable, earning over $100,000 a year on their own creative terms,” Naficy says. To expand its business, which largely centers on artists of color, the label is exploring new deal structures, like “building out sublabels with our artist partners,” Naficy adds. But, Crawford says, nothing is possible without “fan connection.” “If you can figure out how to build a real relationship with the fans, you'll have a career for life.”

Fresh off celebrating its 60th anniversary last year, the storied Curb Records continues to mint hits under its founder and namesake, who points to country singer-songwriter Dylan Scott's multiple Country Airplay No. 1s dating back to 2022 — “New Truck,” “Can't Have Mine” and “This Town's Been Too Good to Us” — as one of the label's key recent accomplishments. And, Curb says, the future is bright for indies: “I believe the independents are getting stronger and are often able to move much faster than the major distributors.”

“The combination of coordinating the DSPs, social media and radio to build positive streaming and overall consumption.”

Futures Music Group clocked several major successes in its first year. The first release, “Home” by British duo Good Neighbours, was certified platinum less than nine months after its release. Futures, which comprises flagship labels Neon Gold and Avenue A, also released albums from artists including Phantogram, Barns Courtney, The Knocks and Mt. Joy. Altogether, Davies, Wallace and Kesselman say, they're making “exciting progress toward establishing our blueprint for what an artist-friendly, technology-forward, paradigm-shifting independent label group can look like in the next chapter of the music industry.”

“At Because,” de Buretel says, “independence means building sustainable careers, protecting creative identity and shaping culture — without compromise.” As the company turned 20, he says it “celebrated a record-breaking year in 2024” across its recorded-music, publishing and live divisions with 17% revenue growth. French electronic duo Justice scored a hit with its album Hyperdrama, which spawned the Grammy-winning Alternative Airplay No. 1 “Neverender” (with Tama Impala) and propelled a huge world tour, while Parcels, Shygirl, Camille and Manu Chao all had banner years. Because also signed its first U.S.-based artists, Spill Tab and BAMBII.

“The convergence of authenticity, agility and strategic visibility. In an algorithm-driven, fast-paced landscape, what matters is resonance — not volume.”



“We're no longer the little engine that could,” Tanner says of Big Loud. This year, the label released Morgan Wallen's new album, I'm the Problem, after four straight years of monumental growth stemming from Wallen's 2021 blockbuster, Dangerous: The Double Album, which in January was crowned No. 1 on the Top Billboard 200 Albums chart for the 21st century so far. The sale of a stake in the artist's catalog to Chord Music Partners for a reported $200 million in April was another big move, and the label has kept expanding, eclipsing 100 employees across five offices this past year and supporting HARDY and Miranda Lambert in launching Crow Records and Big Loud Texas Publishing, respectively.

“It's about genuine and meaningful connection. You have to have intention behind every move, from socials to creative to releasing your first single.” —Deslippe

Erving counts RAYE's dizzying rise this year as a major highlight. The British singer-songwriter became the first artist in history to receive Grammy nominations for both best new artist and songwriter of the year in the same year, and her performance of “Oscar Winning Tears.” drew a standing ovation during the televised ceremony. Weeks later, she performed at the Academy Awards ceremony itself. Says Erving: “It's incredibly gratifying to be part of RAYE's journey and to see her achieve success on her own terms.”

“There are more players, artists and executives that are interested in the independent sector versus frontline labels. Lots of people in the independent space are starting to get their 10,000 hours.”



EMPIRE's year was highlighted by Shaboozey, whose “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” spent a record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in the United States. And the song was a global smash, too, with the single and its parent album reaching No. 1 in multiple countries and becoming “a testament to how [founder and CEO] Ghazi built EMPIRE to be a global independent record label that is in lockstep with an artist's home marketplace,” Kadin says. “Rather than clawing our way through red tape to work an artist internationally, we were able to move quickly and efficiently to make sure we were servicing an artist like Shaboozey properly for long-term growth.”

“Authenticity.” —Kadin

One of BMG and sublabel Flood Division's “standout achievements” this year, Gill says, came from the 22-year-old Chinese Canadian artist yung kai. His 2024 viral hit, “Blue,” peaked at No. 39 on the Billboard Global 200 and reached Billboard charts in Canada and Singapore. Streamed more than “1 billion times across platforms,” according to Gill, the track “underscores both yung kai's global impact and BMG's dedication to nurturing new and emerging talent.” In April, BMG released a remix version of the song with the K-pop artist MINNIE from the girl group (G)I-DLE.

“More than ever, independent labels have a responsibility to invest in artist storytelling and brand-building initiatives to generate real fan engagement.” —Gill

Earlier this year, Glassnote celebrated the return of Mumford & Sons. “After seven years, the lads came back with a tremendous record, Rushmere,” Glass says, adding that the title track reached No. 1 on Alternative Airplay, while the album landed at No. 1 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart. Glassnote's new U.K. folk trio, Tors, opened for Myles Smith's global, sold-out tour and is poised to return to the United States and Canada for its own sold-out headlining run beginning in October before doing more dates in Europe.

“Hard work and hustle. Artists need to be relentless and create their own spark. Once that spark is lit, the label can turn it into a flame and then a fire. The days of simply pushing a button or jamming a record onto the charts are over.”

Longtime indie stalwart Mom + Pop had a major breakout in 2024 with acclaimed alt-pop band Magdalena Bay, whose second album, Imaginal Disk, drew rave reviews and led to the group launching two headlining tours across the United States and Europe and making its late-night debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Goldstone says that it comes down to “culture and community” and “consistent engagement with one's audience” when building a career independent artist in 2025, “whether artists are building that in-person touring across the country or purposefully creating connections among their fans online.”

“Musicians' creative controls continue to grow, and genres are more boundaryless than ever. As a result, we find ourselves in a fiercely competitive market, as there is more focus than ever on the independent space.” —Goldstone

Yo Gotti's CMG Records continues to stand tall in the hip-hop arena thanks to the meteoric rise of its star signee, GloRilla — Billboard's 2024 Hottest Female Rapper. Big Glo lit up the charts last year with five top 30 Hot 100 hits, including “Yeah Glo!” and the crossover smash “TGIF,” which Rihanna co-signed. Her momentum didn't stop there: GloRilla's debut album, Glorious, stormed onto the Billboard 200 at No. 5, racking up 69,000 first-week equivalent album units — the best opening-week performance for any female rapper in 2024.

Despite Drake's ongoing legal clash with Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” the hip-hop titan reaffirmed his chart dominance earlier this year. In March, he and PartyNextDoor scored a No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200 with $ome $exy $ongs 4 U, marking Drake's 14th chart-topping album, which tied him with Jay-Z for the most No. 1s by a solo rapper and was a major statement for OVO after it inked its new distribution deal with Santa Anna. The project also features the club-ready anthem “Nokia,” which surged to No. 2 on the Hot 100 and quickly became a contender for song of the summer.

After a decade of hard work, Concord acquired Stem in a deal announced in March. Over the years, the distribution firm has served as a home to talents like Brent Faiyaz, Chappell Roan, Julia Michaels and Mk.gee. Now, according to Faber, its deal with Concord has “provided [Stem] with a substantial war chest” to grow Stem even further. “We're now poised to be competitive in virtually any deal scenario. We love that Concord has our back and encourages our entrepreneurial behavior.”

“The overall playing field has been increasingly evened by the number of enterprising tools, platforms and resources available to indie artists. From fintech to fan engagement to AI, artists can do things on their own now more than ever.” —Faber

Regional Mexican powerhouse Grupo Firme, Gutiérrez's marquee act, is in the midst of its La Ultima Peda (The Last Drunken Party) Tour, which as of May 5 had played 40 dates and sold over 750,000 tickets, making it one of the most successful Latin tours globally, Gutiérrez says. “We've also focused on expanding Music VIP Entertainment in new territories like Central and South America, diversifying our artist and producer catalog and aiming for innovation, independence and direct connection with fans,” Gutiérrez adds. Overall, Grupo Firme has played over 250 shows for nearly 4 million fans since the pandemic. The secret is “authenticity: Fans want a real connection. Social media allows that direct connection, with no middleman, and that's changed the rules of the game.”



Sung Soo Han

The last 18 months have been filled with achievements for PLEDIS Entertainment acts, notably boy band Seventeen: two album debuts at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, performances at Lollapalooza Berlin and Glastonbury Festival and becoming the first K-pop act to headline Tecate Pal'Norte in Monterrey, Mexico. “Beyond their commercial and performance success, Seventeen has used their influence to inspire a global audience with positive messages through their music,” Han says. “In June 2024, they made history as UNESCO's first-ever Goodwill Ambassador for Youth.”

“Establishing authentic connections with fans is the key ingredient for artists' success, especially with the presence of superfans growing exponentially in not only the K-pop industry but also the global music landscape.”

Triple Tigers proved how nimble it can operate with the current Russell Dickerson single, “Happen to Me.” After the song had the best debut streaming week ever for the label, Triple Tigers switched radio singles within 10 days to capitalize on the excitement and logged 66 radio adds the first week. Herring attributes radio's willingness to play indie artists in part to Triple Tigers' success with Dickerson and Scotty McCreery. “There is a more open attitude that a hit can come from anywhere, not just the major labels,” he says. “I'd like to think Triple Tigers helped that attitude when we launched eight years ago and debuted with six straight [Country Airplay] No. 1 songs.”

“It always starts with the song. ­However, these days the artist must also be in tune and hyper-­engaged with their fans in real life and online. It's empire-building from the ground up that requires basic blocking and tackling at all times.” —Ortmeier

“Artists historically aimed to get signed by a major label to grow and succeed,” Hirschhorn says, noting that the independent sector was viewed as “the minor leagues.” Now the tables have turned: “Artists strive to remain independent and succeed on their terms,” and going independent is seen as a “power move.” Too Lost has capitalized on this shift by signing artists like The All-American Rejects, Freddie Gibbs and Chief Keef over the last year. In addition, the distributor has built relationships with labels such as Victor Victor, Genius and Heatwave Records.

“I feel like this will always remain the same: good music that evokes an emotional reaction from an audience. If you combine that with the right team, good tech and infrastructure and proper capital — you have a recipe for success.”

Over the last year, marquee client Cash ­Cobain continued to fuel Giant Music, the Azoff ­Company-owned label that launched in 2022, with his hit-laden debut album, Play Cash Cobain, a national tour and partnerships with Apple and Spotify — all “further cementing his status as one of the most exciting new voices in hip-hop,” Holiday says. Elsewhere on Giant's roster, FendiDa Rappa's “Point Me 2” (featuring Cardi B) was certified gold and Australian artist Ruel's debut for the label, created with collaborators including Julian Bunetta, John Ryan, Joel Little and Dan Wilson, is nearing completion.

“Commercial success, ambitious global marketing, bold creative swings — so many of these were seen as the dominion of the majors, and now we see success coming from everywhere. Which is how it should be.” —LaMotte

Rancho Humilde and its artists were 20-time finalists at the 2024 Billboard Latin Music Awards and surpassed 60 billion digital streams across all platforms, Humilde says. The company is also expanding into lifestyle with the Humilde Nation brand and into film with its first feature, Clika, in partnership with Sony Pictures and Sony Music Latin, which Humilde calls “a milestone for Mexican American storytelling.” In the touring realm, Sánchez managed Natanael Cano's 35-city Mexican tour, including a sold-out show at Estadio GNP Seguros, and Junior H's 25-city U.S. tour, which included a performance on the Coachella main stage. “For us, it's about telling real stories from the Mexican American experience,” Humilde says. “That identity used to be ignored — now it's leading the charts.”

“Genre fusions. Collabs across genres are huge these days.” —Humilde

Over the past two years, “Our teams at gamma. and Vydia have worked tirelessly to build a big business,” Jackson says. One highlight: watching ­gamma.'s streaming market share rise on the strength of an artist roster that includes Usher, Sexyy Red, Rick Ross and Rich the Kid. The company also distributes Antonio “L.A.” Reid and Usher's label, mega; Snoop Dogg's Death Row Records; and Ross' Maybach Music Group. Jackson says that gamma.'s ability “to also scale across the globe” is underscored by singer Moliy's success with current single “Shake It to the Max.”

“Honesty, sincerity and a genuine reflection of who they are. It may sound trite, but never has such reflection been more of a truer North Star.” —Jackson

SM celebrated its 30th anniversary in February with a new slogan: “The Culture, The Future” — and the launch of ambitious projects reflecting the company's “heritage and vision,” including concerts, albums and orchestral performances, “aimed at strengthening our global influence and corporate leadership in the entertainment industry,” the co-CEOs say. Among the efforts is a series of SMTOWN LIVE 2025 shows in Seoul, Los Angeles, Mexico City and Tokyo, as well as the SMTOWN album featuring reinterpretations of legendary SM hits. Meanwhile, acts aespa, NCT 127 and RIIZE had big years, and new girl group Hearts2Hearts launched. “As we mark 30 years since our founding,” the co-CEOs say, “SM Entertainment remains committed to shaping the future of culture through bold creativity, strong planning and a deep respect for our legacy.”

Black River Records

Kelsea Ballerini reached new career heights over the past year thanks to her headlining Kelsea Ballerini Live on Tour 2025 arena trek and her album Patterns, which became her first No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart. Black River also bolstered its roster with the signing of 11-time Country Airplay chart-topper Chris Young, joining labelmates Pryor Baird, Scotty Hasting and MaRynn Taylor. “We are so proud of what our artists are accomplishing as a part of this wonderful music community,” Kerr says.

“It has shifted from always feeling like the potential ‘underdog' to a space of agile innovation and influence. Direct-to-fan platforms, AI tools, short-form content and other ideas yet to be implemented are beginning to give independent labels and artists more control, speed and global reach than ever before.” —Kerr



Ourness “achieved 10 times growth” over the last year-and-a-half, Klippel says. “This has been the result of working with enduring and definitive artists and investing in developing them from zero, fueled by instinct, without waiting for indications from outside sources,” he adds of the Sydney-based label, which counts Genesis Owusu, Royel Otis and Sonic Reducer as clients. Royel Otis' cover of The Cranberries' “Linger” became the Australian duo's debut Hot 100 hit in late 2024. “I'm incredibly proud of the Ourness team and our partners, who are second to none,” he says. “Everyone has brought their best and worked around the clock to bring it home.”

“There's a cultural lineage to the term ‘indie,' but I see it now as an important phase or a transition rather than a destination. It's essential to embed the authenticity of an artist's culture and exploration prior to the most distilled version, which is sometimes when an artist crosses over.”



ADA, Warner Music Group's indie distribution and label-services division, spent the past year focused on acquisitions and partnerships — some with companies like RSDL.io, a tech tool that helps artists manage accounting, and longtime ­manager-publishers Three Six Zero, and others with artists including Australian DJ Flume. The company's recent hits include actor Jack Black's 34-second “Steve's Lava Chicken,” from A Minecraft Movie, which hit No. 78 on the Hot 100 in April. “Indie music was born from passionate champions of the unconventional,” Kreidich says. “Independence is now a compelling choice for artists seeking both creative control and commercial success.”

TuneCore parent Believe staved off acquisition bids to remain independent in the past year, with CEO Ladegaillerie taking the company private amid the acquisition spree that swept the industry. And it continued to deliver for its artists, racking up 800 billion streams in 2024, he says, something “made possible by our incredible teams around the world, developing artists and labels with expertise, respect, fairness and transparency.” Its Accelerator program also passed the 450,000 artist sign-up mark, helping talent rise through the ranks and “develop their careers on their own terms.”

“Local music has continued to grow from strength to strength, becoming a dominant force around the world — and primarily driven by the independent sector.” —Ladegaillerie

In the past year, The Darkroom's roster reflected the label's forward-thinking spirit. While superstar Billie Eilish released her third album, the Grammy-­nominated Hit Me Hard and Soft, Lubliner helped guide her labelmates through their first. Last July, dance breakout John Summit released his debut album, Comfort in Chaos; in November, country newcomer Waylon Wyatt released his first EP, Til the Sun Goes Down (his second will arrive in June); and this past April, following his debut Coachella performance, alternative artist d4vd released his highly anticipated first album, Withered.

For partner British labels XL and Young (both of which are part of Beggars Group), Fontaines D.C.'s Romance (XL) charted multiple singles across Billboard's rock radio charts and hit the top 10 on the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart, while Jamie xx's In Waves (Young) “bridged the worlds of underground club music and big, euphoric dance bangers,” Lyons says. New signees such as Jim Legxacy (an XL singer-songwriter-rapper) and John Glacier (a Young rapper-producer) “made for an incredibly energizing year at the labels,” she adds.

“Whether by speaking to fans directly in a newsletter or building moments and creative worlds they can pore over and dissect together, there's a way for every artist to build community in a way that's authentic to their practice.”

Over the past year, Thirty Tigers has worked to establish a strong roster in the Black music space, supporting not only longtime signees such as Lupe Fiasco but also more recently signed acts including Corinne Bailey Rae, George Clinton and Leikeli47. The slate of signings “shows a direction for the company I am excited about,” Macias says. And he's optimistic about the state of the business: “The opportunities for independent artists have exploded of late,” he adds.

“Social media, of course, but we are still big believers in press, radio, indie retail and touring. It takes several impressions to dent the consciousness of consumers, and we try to emphasize those mediums that facilitate long-form narrative or a direct, visceral experience with the act and their music.”

Nettwerk Music Group

The indie label, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2024, helps artists build engaged communities to advance their careers, including through a partnership this year with Music BC. “We are proud to have helped establish the careers of breakthrough artists like Paris Paloma, Hazlett, Mon Rovîa and Panchiko,” McBride says. “At Nettwerk, we take a data-informed approach to understanding the relationship between artists and their audiences. This allows us to craft tailored strategies that help artists grow within authentic, fan-connected communities.”

“A strategic, worldwide strategy that touches every aspect of their business — from streaming and touring to branding and digital presence. It's about building a real, sustainable fan base, which requires a deep understanding of how to connect with audiences authentically across regions, platforms and formats and ensuring that every move reinforces the artist's identity and long-term vision.” —McBride

The Influence Media music label and publishing operation was only founded in 2024, but SLANG began with a bang, signing a distribution deal to release Will Smith's “first album in 20 years and helping him achieve a No. 1 on the Gospel Airplay chart with ‘You Can Make It,' ” McLean says. Beyond that, “We've launched SLANG Distro, an AI-powered distribution platform where artists can use AI agents to handle DSP ingestion, scheduling, creating artwork, lyric videos, create and execute marketing strategies and more,” he adds.

“Artists need more services and resources. It's getting more difficult to break through the clutter. You must be strategic in your approach to the market. Majors are buying up various indie distributors to scale more [and to] regain control and market share.”

Imperial boasts a diverse artist roster that spans from hit-making rapper Key Glock and indie-pop vets Kings of Convenience to country icon Miranda Lambert and K-pop stars Stray Kids — the lattermost bringing the label its biggest chart successes in recent years, with the group topping the Billboard 200 six times this decade, and twice in 2024 alone. “The independent music sector is not only getting bigger, but the capabilities on offer are more comprehensive and robust,” says Mendlinger, who also cites the “powerful data insights, speed to market and many self-service tools” as advancements allowing indie artists to “learn the business and optimize for success.”

“The sheer volume of weekly releases is overwhelming and has created a landscape of musical chaos. Fans want to feel rewarded, seen, heard and have more they can lean into and engage with beyond a song.”



Ayers reports that Beggars Group's global reach expanded this year, with the collective's five labels — 4AD, Matador, Rough Trade, XL Recordings and Young — releasing albums by artists from more countries than ever before, “reflecting the increasingly borderless nature of independent music.” Beggars artists earned six Grammy nominations, with Fontaines D.C., Kim Gordon, Adrianne Lenker and Charlotte Day Wilson all picking up nods. “We also saw sustained growth in catalog and global artist development,” he says.

“Artists have never been more capable of moving the needle for themselves. Whether that's via touring, slow-growing word of mouth or a big viral moment, it's our job to add value to what our artists bring.” —Ayers

In the past year, Paper Route Empire kept Young Dolph's vision alive and pushed the boundaries of the label's sound. Most notably, Key Glock returned with his Glockaveli album in May and will spend his summer on a sold-out tour supporting the project, Moore says. PRE's younger acts had a big year as well, with newcomer Kenny Muney dropping his Kenjamin Franklin tape at the end of May. After a banner 2024, Memphis rapper Big Moochie Grape will cap 2025 with the deluxe release of his Eat or Get Ate 2 mixtape. Moore says that PRE “has only gotten stronger,” with Key Glock's work “proving that PRE is thriving.”

“Artists are waking up to their value. They want ownership, they want freedom, and they want to be able to build something that lasts.”

The Dublin-based independent label (which launched in 2001) enjoyed a big year. Hozier — who has been with Rubyworks since his first album — hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 for the first time in April 2024 with “Too Sweet,” making the singer-songwriter the first Irish act to lead the chart in 34 years. “This milestone reinforces the global appetite for authentic artistry and the power of long-term artist development and fan connection,” Muckian says, calling the chart-topper a “standout moment for our company with our partners Columbia.” Additionally, Rubyworks continued to work closely with another Irish singer-songwriter, LYRA, and Grammy winners Rodrigo y Gabriela.

“We're seeing less investment in the slow, patient work of nurturing artists over time [at major labels]. Indies are structurally better suited to support that kind of development: We're closer to the artist, more aligned on creative goals and able to take long views without quarterly pressures.”



Virgin Music Group has experienced “an incredible year of growth, expansion and delivering on behalf of our label and artist partners,” Saturn says. Collaborations with artists like Clairo, St. Vincent, aespa and Kip Moore exemplify the “powerful and meaningful” impact of effective partnerships. As the independent music sector evolves globally, the company is meeting the challenge with strategic acquisitions, including [PIAS], Outdustry and the pending Downtown Music deal, which will “further extend our global footprint, business verticals and capabilities.” Saturn emphasizes the importance of artists cultivating “direct authentic connections with their fans,” noting that fan engagement is essential to “sustaining artists over the long haul.”

Superstar client Bad Bunny and his Rimas Entertainment label helped drive The Orchard to an industry-leading 8.9% current market share among distributors through May 15, according to Luminate, but he wasn't the only one lifting the Sony-owned company to huge heights. New partnerships with LVRN, The System and Smash the House have yielded results, while ongoing relationships with Peso Pluma's Double P Records and Black River Entertainment, home to Kelsea Ballerini, remain lucrative. “The Orchard's success is linked to our clients, who represent the best indie talent in the world,” Theis says. “When they succeed, so do we.”

“Fans want to be part of something — a movement, a scene — they want to be seen, and they invest in musicians who represent their world view.” —Theis

In the past year, Dirty Hit has strategically expanded its global footprint with new offices in London, Los Angeles, New York, Berlin, Sydney and Tokyo, with veteran hires to lead each. “This move reflects our commitment to fostering closer connections with our artists and audiences worldwide,” Oborne says. The company also launched electronic imprint DH2 under the leadership of George Daniel. DH2's debut release of Kelly Lee Owens' Dreamstate “exemplifies our dedication to diversifying our musical offerings and supporting innovative artists,” he adds. “At the heart of our achievements are our artists, whose success stories continue to inspire.”

“Indie labels aren't the underdogs anymore. We're building infrastructure, scaling globally and competing directly with majors — not just artist by artist, but strategy by strategy.”

The development of breakout artist Djo — who racked up over 2 billion global streams in 2024, more than 50,000 ticket sales and a slew of high-profile festival slots in the past year — has been a “dream scenario for any label,” says Olinick, who also highlights Laufey reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 200 and selling 160,000 tickets on her headlining tour, and Jungle winning its first BRIT Award, for group of the year in 2024. Beyond its wins across the roster, “AWAL expanded its operations to sign and develop local artists in West Africa, South Africa, France, the Middle East and the Philippines,” Olinick adds.

“What has shifted is the mindset that there is a ceiling to what is possible commercially for independent artists and the epiphany that it doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your vision and artistry to enjoy those unimaginable heights.” —Olinick

“We've significantly raised the bar for artist development companies, driving success across multiple genres,” Oliver-Cline says, citing the successes of Hudson Westbrook, whose “House Again” reached No. 21 on the Hot Country Songs chart; arena headliner and genre-fluid phenom Billy Strings, who launched two projects to the pinnacle of the Bluegrass Albums chart in the past year; Austin Snell and others. “Even more important, our wins are spread across our label, publishing and management clients,” Oliver-Cline adds. “We have a very passionate and dedicated team who works closely with our artists at every level.”

“Having a strong vision and knowing how to translate that into meaningful fan engagement online.” —Oliver-Cline

Street Mob ended 2024 at No. 6 on Billboard's year-end Top Latin Albums Imprints chart and the label's publishing division — Street Mob Publishing — won publisher of the year at the 2024 Billboard Latin Music Awards. In early 2025, the company founded by Fuerza Regida frontman Jesus Ortiz Paz (aka JOP) hired veteran music executive Gustavo López as its president in a move that signals its intention to become “the next big Latin music label,” JOP says. At Street Mob, which has added Cindy Gaxiola as vp of commercial affairs, Niria León as vp of booking and Jesús Amezcua as vp of marketing to an executive team that already included COO Cristian “Toro” Primera and CFO Luis López, JOP says, “We got The Avengers. The whole point of this is we're going to the next level.”



Cinq Music

In addition to its investment in frontline distribution with labels such as Street Mob Records, Peterson says Cinq Music “has transacted almost $500 million in music rights” in the past year. In 2024, the company bought Marc Anthony's publishing rights, including his entire music catalog, and acquired Daddy Yankee's catalog as well. As part of the 20th-anniversary celebration of Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino, Cinq Music rereleased the album on vinyl, along with his albums El Cangri.com, Los Homerun-es, El Cartel: The Big Boss, Talento de Barrio and Mundial.

“Creating a long-term, value-added bilateral relationship with superfans is what moves the needle for artists — one where the artist generates value for the fans and the fans generate value for the artist.” —Peterson

Redeye

Since its 2023 acquisition by Exceleration Music, the global digital and physical distribution and music services company has been busy consolidating and updating its international distribution business “in a significant way,” Petkov says. It joined Lasgo Worldwide Media in the United Kingdom and consolidated its European operations with Bertus Distribution in the Netherlands. “This provides Redeye labels with a more streamlined, cost-efficient and transparent distribution setup moving forward,” Petkov adds. “It also sets the stage for continued growth across the region, which we are very excited about.”

“Finding truly independent routes to physical and digital marketplaces has become increasingly challenging. In addition, the general global events have increased the levels of uncertainty and complexities that all parties are faced with.” —Petkov

Double P Records

In “another momentous year,” Prajin and Peso Pluma expanded Double P's roster and hit “several milestones,” Prajin says. Peso's own Éxodo, which the Mexican hit-maker released last summer, ­peaked at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums and No. 5 on the Billboard 200, and he became the first Latin artist to headline Rolling Loud Festival in Los Angeles, “taking Mexican music to places it's never reached before,” Prajin says. Following closely in his cousin's footsteps is Tito Double P, one of the label's first signings whose debut, Incómodo, followed Éxodo to No. 1 on Top Latin Albums.

“Offering artists all the services of a major label in a boutique setting, with a personal feel, with a team that supports their creative visions and helps execute them.” —Prajin

Sub Pop/Hardly Art Records

Over the last 12 months, Sub Pop executed album campaigns for Suki Waterhouse, Father John Misty, Tunde Adebimpe, Deep Sea Diver, tella and clipping. while experimenting with “new marketing concepts and digital strategies that have helped us achieve significant growth,” Kiewel says. With a rich back catalog that includes Nirvana, Beach House, The Shins, Flight of the Conchords and The Postal Service, Kiewel adds that the label is always poised to “take advantage of any interest or opportunities that may be surfacing.”

“As more and more of the available opportunities for discovering new music become driven by algorithms that by their very nature reward popularity, developing artists — and their label partners — are finding it more and more difficult to begin building the momentum necessary for the algorithms to even potentially kick in.” —Kiewel

Hopeless Records

The punk-rock label celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2024 with a long-term exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame that featured artifacts and videos from its artists over the years such as Avenged Sevenfold and All Time Low. “It's an incredible honor to anchor their showcase on the future of rock music and to see the impact our artists have had across generations,” Harrison says. “At the same time, we're focused on building the future. We recently opened our first office in Mexico, a market we've believed in for years.”

“With the effects of consolidation both at retail — four DSPs control the majority of recorded revenue — and labels, with the three majors buying up indies, the independent community is faced with significant challenges.” —Posen

Partisan Records

Partisan's wins across its diverse roster of artists in the past year included multiple ­Grammy nominations for U.K. post-punks IDLES, an arena world tour for Texas dream-pop band Cigarettes After Sex and a BRIT Award for genre-blending London jazz quintet Ezra Collective. White attributes the “exponential growth” in the label's business to “prioritizing the right things: investing in the people who make the music and the teams who work with those people to reach the biggest possible audiences without compromising the artist's vision.”

“Great art is still, and always will be, the thing that moves the needle the most.” —White

In 2024, Nice Life helped Tinashe score her first Coachella appearance — and her biggest hit to date. Throughout the summer of 2024, the R&B star's “Nasty” took over, earning Tinashe her highest-charting single on the Hot 100 in a decade, a gold RIAA certification and over 500 million streams, according to Nice Life. Combined with the label's work on The Marías' critically acclaimed second album, Submarine, and its current work on Lizzo's latest singles, “Still Bad” and “Love in Real Life,” Reed says 2024 proved to be a “banner year” for his “small but mighty independent label.”

“Vulnerability is like rocket fuel for artists. We stress that, alongside hard work and uncompromising individuality.” —Reed



Rebel Music's roster of indie hip-hop stars continues to speak for itself in 2025. As Sexyy Red came off her 2024 top 40 Hot 100 hit “Whatchu Kno About Me” (with GloRilla), she immediately earned another smash with the Bruno Mars collaboration “Fat Juicy & Wet.” Rob49, meanwhile, scored his first solo hit on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart earlier in 2025 with “WTHelly.” Yet the company's focus extended beyond rap this year — Rebel Music began working in genres like Latin, alternative and country, with Sang touting the team's “know-how, connections and work ethic” in its ability to land hits across genres in 2025.

“We can get lost in trying to crack Reels and TikTok all day, but without building great habits in the studio and an authentic story, it won't always hold.”



Shin, BIGHIT's youngest and first female president, says she's driven the company's strategy, marketing, production and artist management while overseeing the sprawling universe of BTS solo projects during the members' mandatory South Korean military service and laying the groundwork for the group's 2025 comeback. That has included j-hope launching his first solo tour and becoming the first South Korean male solo artist to headline a stadium show in North America, and Jin's second solo album, Echo, and forthcoming solo tour. Other highlights include Tomorrow X Together's sixth mini album and worldwide tour and the upcoming debut of BIGHIT's as-yet-unnamed boy band. “Under my leadership, BIGHIT MUSIC continues to reinforce its dominance in the global music industry,” Shin says, “while nurturing the next wave of talent poised to extend our legacy.”

“The ability to translate diverse experiences into authentic, creative expression.”

The ascendance of South Korean girl group Le Sserafim included the quintet becoming the only K-pop act in 2024 to chart on the Hot 100 for two consecutive weeks, with the single “CRAZY” peaking at No. 76. The album Crazy hit No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart. The group's fifth mini album, HOT, debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard 200, making Le Sserafim the only fourth-generation K-pop act to have four consecutive albums chart in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, So adds. “This is a huge accomplishment,” So says, “reflecting the group's growing global influence and artistry.”

“The expansion of streaming services, fandom platforms and social media has created new opportunities for artists to directly connect with fans, promote their music independently and share their authentic voices without relying solely on traditional media channels.”

Stevenson says MNRK's focus on “cultivating superfans and creating authentic connections” has driven it to eliminate previously existing divisions and make label services the center of everything it does — “from set and launch of records to supporting our artists' [direct-to-consumer] efforts.” Partnerships with RHEI and Vocana have accelerated those efforts to tap into the superfan market, but Stevenson is not resting on his laurels. “MNRK does not simply observe industry trends,” he says. “We actively engage with them, acknowledge our past shortcomings and implement the necessary changes to build a more successful future for our artists and our label.”

“Great music will always be the most significant asset and the foundation of everything. Great marketing can impact playlisting. Podcasts and synchs are tremendously helpful. Smart radio also makes an impact. Growing an audience we can reach consistently without needing paid social media to increase that reach is the most powerful thing we can do.”

In April, BigXthaPlug earned his first Hot 100 top 10 hit and first No. 1 on Hot Country Songs with “All the Way” (featuring Bailey Zimmerman), “marking a significant crossover success,” says Melhado, who proudly calls UnitedMasters “a powerhouse for independent artists.” And FloyyMenor and Cris Mj's “Gata Only,” which spent 14 consecutive weeks atop Hot Latin Songs, was the top track on TikTok ­globally in 2024. “These milestones reflect UnitedMasters' growing global influence and its ability to break talent outside the traditional system,” he adds.

“Fans want to buy into a story of an artist and be along for the journey. They want to have an emotional connection. The 15-second clip of a song may soundtrack a moment for them on socials, but the artists with staying power are able to transfer that flash of excitement into a breadcrumb into their world.” —Melhado



Create, which received $165 million in backing from Flexpoint Ford in 2024, has “deployed” more than $200 million in label investments and artist ­advances over the past 12 months, with plans to invest another $500 million during the next 18 months, Strauss says. This includes the recent acquisitions of indie electronic labels !K7, Monstercat and Ostereo, as well as the catalogs of deadmau5 and his mau5trap label in a deal valued at $55 million. Strauss also mentions additional investments in indies such as broke records and Enhanced Music and ventures with artists including Ty Dolla $ign.

“The industry is much faster-moving and labels need to be able to market their artists at the same speed.” —Strauss

Recent releases on Secretly labels Dead Oceans, Jagjaguwar, Secretly Canadian and Saddest Factory reflect the group's “continued commitment to championing the unexpected,” Coombs says. While Bon Iver made its long-awaited return with Sable, Fable and Japanese Breakfast scored its highest-charting Billboard 200 album with For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women), Coombs points to hardcore punk band Scowl and dream-pop project Chanel Beads as up-and-coming acts that complement the label group's brand-name indie stars.

“Patience, a strong and steady team, and an understanding that artist development is often brick by brick.” —Coombs

Among AMPED's highlights of the past year was handling the physical release of breakout artist Shaboozey's album, whose single “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” claimed a record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 last year. Other wins, according to Pryor, include 67 titles for Record Store Day in April, with over 100,000 units made for the day; 56 Grammy nominations, including three wins; 93 Libera Award nominations; and new label partnerships with Charly Records, Naxos and Mexican Summer. Notably, AMPED ran a major campaign with Barnes & Noble and Sub Pop across 622 stores and online, increasing vinyl album sales by 40.7% and CD sales by 118.5% from October to January, Pryor says.

“There's been a lot of movement in the past few years — a land grab, so to speak, for market share.” —Pryor

This year, XO released Hurry Up Tomorrow by its star artist and founder, The Weeknd. The album hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and helped fuel the success of the superstar's current North American 43-date After Hours Til Dawn tour. XO has also expanded into what Mahood calls “uncharted territories,” most notably in film and commercial ventures. “Abel has artfully woven the storyline between an album, movie and tour in a way that has never been done before,” she says, “and it has inspired every individual in our company to challenge ourselves and each other to pursue innovation at the highest level.”

“We face a new competitive environment powered by technology. Barrier to entry is low, but the threshold to break artists is higher than ever.” —Mahood

Today, TDE is widely regarded as the blueprint for modern rap conglomerates, having maintained over 15 years of dominance rooted in the success of powerhouses like Kendrick Lamar and SZA. While Lamar has since charted a new path with his pgLang imprint, Tiffith keeps cultivating his roster and ushering in new stars. Leading that charge is Florida's Doechii, who crossed over into the mainstream this year after winning the ­Grammy for best rap album and earning a Hot 100 top 10 hit with “Anxiety.” Meanwhile, SZA has joined Lamar for stadium shows on their joint Grand National Tour.



Last September, Secretly Distribution partnered with Beggars Group and Cargo Records U.K. to create Cargo Independent Distribution as a means of creating “a truly independent route to market in the United Kingdom” for the American indie distributor, Van Arman says. By providing more resources to Cargo U.K.'s roster, the Secretly Group labels gained greater physical distribution and sales support in the United Kingdom and Ireland without involving major labels, a point that was crucial to the Secretly Distribution brain trust, given that “many independent music companies are struggling to secure routes to market that don't involve the major record companies in some way,” Van Arman says.

“Like always, artists want greater control of their rights and the agency and freedom to find the right partner for their recordings. More than ever, labels need to demonstrate they are adding value in order to continue successfully partnering with artists.” —Van Arman

In addition to signing new or renewed deals with artists including Netón Vega, Tori Amos, Jason Mraz, Sofi Tukker, Twenty One Pilots and Capital Cities — whose Spotify streams have surged 30% since aligning with the company, van Rijn says — Downtown's FUGA expanded its global footprint this year by striking partnerships with companies including UNIFIED Music Group (Australia), Record Makers (France), and Maspam Company and Asintada (both the Philippines). Van Rijn adds that Downtown clients contributed “to more than 35%” of this year's Grammy winners and also scored multiple wins at the Latin Grammys and BMI Latin Awards while it prepares to be bought by Universal Music Group in a $775 million deal.

“When it comes to the long-term sustainability of businesses and artist careers, there has also been a major shift toward building deeper, more meaningful fan relationships.” —Van Rijn

In 2024, Better Noise Music reclaimed its title as Billboard's year-end No. 1 mainstream rock airplay label and had four artists on its roster, including The Funeral Portrait, collectively earn four No. 1 singles on the rock charts. New signings include global metal powerhouse Sabaton, Yellowcard, In This Moment and The Rasmus, underscoring “our commitment to breaking new ground in hard rock and supporting our artists at every stage of their careers,” Kline says. To help its artists on the road, Better Noise offers in-house support “to help make tours and packages happen for our acts so they can tour their music and grow their fans,” Waite adds.

“Routes to market are getting squeezed, with [PIAS] and FUGA being bought by Universal, while DSPs are not paying out on tracks under 1,000 streams, disincentivizing future independent artists.” —Waite

As White said of Third Man Records last year, the multifunctional music company is “a world unto itself” — with all divisions operating at full steam. The label, book publisher and pressing plant expanded its operations in 2024 to include Third Man Hardware, focusing on music gear, which has become the company's most hands-on development yet. In March, Third Man Hardware hosted an in-person pedal build at Third Man Records Nashville following demonstrations from White himself at Third Man London and Fender Flagship Tokyo.



In its quest to transform itself into “the record label of the future,” ONErpm has had “tremendous” ­global success with streaming numbers, and 2024 was no exception. Javi Medina and Camilo's “Pinceles” entered Spotify's Top 50 Most Viral chart in Spain, Colombia and Argentina, to name a few countries. Meanwhile, Chike's “Egwu” held the No. 1 spot on Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube for eight consecutive weeks and remained in the top 10 across Africa for over six months. Furthermore, ONErpm Asia Pacific had over 20 songs charting on Spotify's viral charts across Asia and other notable feats in Brazil and Australia. “These milestones underscore the strength of our global strategy and our commitment to empowering artists through forward-thinking partnerships on a global scale,” Zunz says.

Great music is still the foundation, but strategy and execution are what truly move the needle.”

The Traitors is a psychological game of treachery and deceit hosted by Alan Cumming taking place at an ancient castle set deep in the Scottish Higlands. Contestants work together on a series of missions to build a prize fund worth up to $250,000. However, hidden amongst the Faithful are the Traitors, whose goal is to eliminate the Faithful and claim the prize for themselves.

Under the cover of darkness, the Traitors murder the Faithful one by one in a treacherous spree, while the Faithful try to uncover the Traitors and banish them from the game. If the Faithful contestants banish all the Traitors, they will share the prize fund, but if a Traitor (or Traitors) makes it to the end, they will steal all the money.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Irish actor Jack Hudson has signed for the cast of feature adaptation of Matthew Dickens's comic The Devil's Train about Hollywood stuntman Hondo, who has a double life as a time-travelling cowboy.


	The feature will be directed by stuntman and Fast & Furious action director Jack Gill and is adapted from an original story by Dickens based on his unpublished novel, which he turned into a comic book series released by L.A. based publisher Bliss On Tap.


	Hudson will play time-traveling, demon-possessed baddie cyborg Blondie, with his name a nod to one of the nicknames of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name character in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy.

	The movie follows time-travelling cowboy Hondo as he attempts to rob the treasure-laden Devil's Train, encountering multiple time periods and traps as he moves from car to car, looking for clues on how to break into the treasure vault.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The film's soundtrack by three-time Grammy winner Andrew Coleman has already released its first single titled The Emmaus Effect.


	“I believe Jack Hudson has the classical training and rare physical skills to bring the madcap antics of Blondie to life in a dazzling display that will rival the other young guns on the scene,” said Dickens.


	“Pairing Jack Hudson with director Jack Gill, an action director who was a motocross pro at 14 and was later recruited and mentored by the greatest stuntman of all time Hal Needham, is a formula for old school ‘badassery'. 

	











	“There is no greater stuntman working in Hollywood today. We are going to show the world that stunts should serve the story and not be conceived on the fly to suit the fancy of A-listers who think they are real stunt performers. We are going to beat the hell out of Jack Hudson and make him look awesome in the process.”


	Matthias Hues (Borrowed Time III, Operation Thule) has also joined the cast in the role of the Devil.


	Dickens is producing under the banner of Cliffhanger Cowboys, the company he runs with Gill, with John H. Radulovic (Ray Donovan). The movie is due to start shooting in January 2026 for a 2027 release.


	Hudson is represented by International Artist's Management in London and Framework Entertainment in L.A.

“Full House” actor John Stamos got emotional when he shared his thoughts on the death of The Beach Boys star Brian Wilson. Wilson's family revealed the news of his passing on Instagram on Wednesday, June 11. He was 82. Following the news, Stamos posted three photos on Instagram of himself and Wilson, reflecting on the impact the musician had on his life.

A post shared by John Stamos (@johnstamos)

Stamos shared his thoughts in a lengthy and beautiful statement. “Brian Wilson didn't just soundtrack my life…he filled it with color, with wonder, with some of the most unforgettable, emotional, joyful moments I've ever known. It's hard to put into words what it meant to stand beside him, laugh with him, play his music with him,” he wrote.

Stamos praised Wilson for the many qualities he had, including being a “gentle, soulful, funny, complex, beautiful man.” Wilson's music had a tremendous impact on the “Fuller House” actor, and he revealed in his tribute that he had been a fan of The Beach Boys since childhood.

“Brian gave the world Pet Sounds, God Only Knows, and Wouldn't It Be Nice. Songs that didn't just play in the background of our lives, they shaped who we were,” he continued. “They shaped who I became. His music made me feel things I didn't know how to say. It made me want to make people feel the way his music made me feel. So much of my life and career, so much of me, exists because of what Brian created.”

Stamos ended his post by sending his love to Wilson's family.

A post shared by Brian Wilson (@brianwilsonlive)

On Wilson's official Instagram account, his family posted a photo of him sitting on a bench and smiling. In the caption, they announced his death. “We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,” the statement read. “We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.”

Many people are grieving the “Wouldn't It Be Nice” singer's death, and in addition to Stamos, other celebrities have made statements to honor Wilson. This includes Kim Basinger, who commented on the Instagram post with a heartfelt message. 

“Brian …. you and your music has made my life a far more beautiful journey than it ever would have been…….. you taught me how to dream with the music and sounds you created….. extraordinary…… with every note with every lyric… “ she wrote. “I was more and more convinced that nothing in this world was impossible… You took us to heights and places we will never feel and experience again…..Have a blessed journey… Brian …May you find peace…. Freedom …and a piano waiting for you….right there in Heaven…”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Todd Chrisley Makes Emotional Social Media Comeback After Prison Release","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/todd-chrisley-social-media/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 03:01:48 GMT","

Todd Chrisley is back, not just in real life but on Instagram, too. The former reality TV star broke his social media silence this week with a heartfelt post about his youngest son, Grayson, who recently hit a major college milestone.

After completing his first semester at the University of Alabama, the 19-year-old earned a spot on the dean's list. Naturally, his proud dad couldn't resist celebrating the achievement with a post that oozed classic Chrisley sentiment.

“God is good all the time, @graysonchrisley,” Todd wrote on June 12. “I love you to the moon and back and we couldn't be more proud. You have shown great character and fortitude and stood with your Lord and Savior amidst the fire and came out the other side never smelling of smoke. You are proof of [God's] word.”

And in true Todd fashion, equal parts scripture and Southern flair, the caption continued, “Stand tall, stand true, and stand for your fellow brothers in Christ. I love you, Gray Gray.”

Fans immediately flooded the comment section to welcome Todd back online. Several congratulated the family and praised Grayson's accomplishments. “Grayson is in college okay now I feel old ❤️ welcome back, Todd we've missed you,” one user wrote.

Congratulations Grayson! How remarkable despite all of the circumstances these past few years you were able to navigate with the help of Savanna and end up on the Deans list,” another one said. “Glad your Mom and Dad are home. We love you Todd and your entire family. Looking forward to seeing you and Nanny Fae back together! We missed you all.” 

This marked Todd's first public message on social media since his sentencing for bank fraud and tax evasion.

A post shared by Todd Chrisley (@toddchrisley)

For anyone who missed the media whirlwind that was “Chrisley Knows Best,” Todd rose to fame as the sharp-tongued, designer-loving head of the Chrisley family. The reality series documented their extravagant lifestyle, parenting tactics, and, yes, unbeknownst to fans at the time, a financial hiccup.

In 2022, Todd and his wife, Julie Chrisley, were found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks out of more than $36 million through fake loans and falsified documents. Todd was sentenced to 12 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Pensacola, Florida. Julie, on the other hand, received seven years at the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky. Both began serving their sentences in January 2023.

But in a shocking turn of events, May 2025 brought presidential pardons for the couple. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, revealed that President Donald Trump personally called her to share the news.

“It's a terrible situation, it really is,” Trump reportedly told her. “But it's also a great thing—because your parents are going to be free and cleared. I'm hoping we can make it happen by tomorrow. Does that sound good? We'll do our best to get it done by then.”

He added, “Give them my regards and wish them a good life.”

Just days later, on May 30, Todd stood before reporters at a press conference and maintained his innocence.

The couple, who married in 1996, share three children, Chase, Savannah, and Grayson. Todd also has two older children, Lindsie and Kyle, from a previous marriage to Teresa Terry.

A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley)

Though Todd's Instagram post read like a touching tribute to his son, several online noted that it also felt like a calculated reentry into the public eye. Savannah had already documented Grayson's big college move, but Todd's timing added fuel to the family's growing post-prison media momentum.

And yes, we do expect there's more to come.

Especially after Savannah confirmed that filming is already underway for a brand-new reality series. The show is expected to follow the Chrisleys as they reunite and rebuild their lives after incarceration.

A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley)

One Instagram post doesn't mean Todd is ready to start vlogging or launching a podcast (yet), but it's clear the wheels are in motion. Fans are already speculating about what's next. Could we see another show, a public rebrand, or a deeper dive into faith-based content? Who knows!

For now, Todd appears to be focusing on the three things that have always defined him, which family, faith, and a flair for the spotlight.

“Doctor Who” is about to get a bit more animated. Very animated, actually.

The BBC announced a new series coming to the “Doctor Who” galaxy. This time, it'll be for the younger audiences. 

Preschool aged children are the target audience for this new series that has yet to be named. The show will be largely the same with the titular Doctor still traveling through time and space with a companion or two. 

“Doctor Who” just finished up a second season on Disney+ (15th in its current incarnation, 41st overall). Ncuti Gatwa surprised viewers by exiting the series after just two seasons and two specials. 

Series producer Russell T. Davies returned to showrun the series in 2021 after taking time off after producing the show from 2005 – 2010. 

The latest season of “Doctor Who” tackled a partially animated episode titled “Lux” where the Doctor and companion Belinda went up against the villain Mr Ring-a-Ding, voiced by Alan Cumming.

The new show is set to air on the BBC's CBeebies, their preschool channel. While the network hasn't found a production company to make the show, they are excited for the right candidate. 

Disney will not be part of the animated show. However, Disney+ and BBC are set to make a separate spinoff called “The War Between the Land and the Sea.”

When speaking on the new preschool show, the BBC's Director of Children's and Education Patricia Hidalgo said “Everyone is welcome at CBeebies, including the Doctor. This much-loved franchise entertains millions around the world, so it is only right that our younger audience get to experience the wonder and the magic of the Doctor in a brand new format.”

“This is an extremely exciting opportunity, and we are looking forward to welcoming companies to pitch for this new project, as we continue our commitment and investment in the UK's animation industry,” she added.

Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Brandi Glanville hasn't had the best couple of years, as she has experienced some notable health issues. However, she recently took to social media to share some exciting personal news. Her son, Jake, graduated from high school. 

She posted on Instagram, “And just like that it's Graduation Day!!! so proud of you @jakecibrian.” The post contained three photos, the first of which was of Brandi and Jake. The second features him walking across the graduation stage, and the other is of Jake with some of his friends in their blue gowns. 

A post shared by Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville)

Jake's dad, Eddie Cibrian, also took to Instagram to highlight the occasion. He did so with a video montage, which also included his wife, LeAnn Rimes. The caption of the post reads, “And the Class of 2025 is off and running!”

It continued, “Congrats, my boy.” LeAnn also shared the post on her social media as she congratulated her stepson. 

According to PEOPLE, Brandi spent the most recent Christmas holiday with Eddie, LeAnn, and the kids. She said on her podcast, “I went over there to my ex's house [for Christmas] because of my kids. Brandi continued, “I mean, you guys don't understand the love I have for these children. Like, I would take a bullet for them.”

Brandi then said, “What was I gonna do? Stay over here in my house, be lonely during Christmas, or go be with, like, my beloved children and my in-laws, who I'm obsessed with and love?” She added, “I can step in there as long as everyone's happy and everyone's in one place and the kids are happy and we're having a good time and the food is good.”

Regarding Brandi and Eddie, they tied the knot in 2001 and have two sons. Jake is the youngest at 17, and Matt is 21. Sadly, they divorced in 2010 after he fell in love with LeAnn. Eddie and LeAnn connected in 2009 while filming the movie “Northern Lights” and married in 2011. This was a massive scandal at the time, but the three are now on good terms. 

Naturally, Brandi's divorce and the events that led to it became a topic while she was on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” However, she hasn't been on the series since 2015 and has recently spoken openly about her non-existent relationship with Bravo and Andy Cohen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Keira Knightley: Pirates Made Me Rich but ‘Ruined' My Reputation","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/keira-knightley-pirates-ruined-my-reputation/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 12:28:46 GMT","

Keira Knightley recently opened up about the complex legacy of her “Pirates of the Caribbean” experience during a candid conversation with Rosamund Pike for Vanity Fair. The British actress brought Elizabeth Swann to life in three blockbuster films between 2003 and 2007. She shared surprising insights about how the franchise affected public perception of her acting abilities.

“Pirates of the Caribbean had already come out, but I think in the public consciousness, I was seen as a terrible actress,” Knightley revealed to the outlet while discussing her “Pride & Prejudice” era. The actress faced a unique challenge when both projects competed for audience attention, creating very different critical responses.

The timing of her various projects created professional whiplash for the then-21-year-old actress. “Dead Man's Chest” premiered in July 2006, just months after Knightley earned her first Academy Award nomination for portraying Elizabeth Bennet in Joe Wright's “Pride & Prejudice” adaptation.

“I remember it coming out maybe the same year, maybe around the same time, as Pirates 2 – and I got the worst reviews ever for that. Then also being nominated for an Oscar at the same time, it was, in my 21-year-old head, quite confusing,” she explained to Vanity Fair. 

The actress told Vanity Fair that “Pride & Prejudice” represented “the first one that was a phenomenally big success but was also critically acclaimed,” after “Pirates” had established her as a global star. This recognition helped shift perceptions about her range as a performer beyond action-adventure roles.

Speaking to media outlets in 2024, Knightley acknowledged the lasting complexity of her relationship with the franchise that grossed over $1 billion worldwide, according to The Independent. “They were the most successful films I'll ever be a part of and they were the reason that I was taken down publicly. So they're a very confused place in my head,” she shared.

Her perspective aligned with that of co-star Orlando Bloom. Bloom recently reflected on similar experiences while promoting his Prime Video series, “Deep Cover.” He was asked by TheWrap about concerns over being forever known for his blockbuster roles. Bloom admitted, “Well, yes and no. I mean, those are two of, kind of the great — like, if you're going to do two of them in a big way. But yeah, for sure.” He revealed his approach to moving forward: “I was like, ‘You know what? I'm just going to do characters that I can look back on and go, oh, yeah, I really took a swing at that.'”

The franchise's impact extended beyond immediate reviews. Knightley described to The Times last year how “Pirates” simultaneously was “making and breaking” her career. Despite the challenges, her post-“Pirates” filmography demonstrates considerable versatility, including acclaimed performances in “Atonement,” “Never Let Me Go,” and “Colette.”

While producer Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed that a sixth Pirates film is in development without the original cast, Knightley's Elizabeth Swann remains part of the franchise through her appearance in 2017's “Dead Men Tell No Tales.” Since completing the original trilogy, Knightley has earned Academy Award nominations for both “Atonement” and “The Imitation Game,” while starring in films such as “The Boston Strangler.”

Some people might be surprised to hear this, but Tom Hiddleston is not the only star of Mike Flanagan's “The Life of Chuck.” He's not even the only Chuck! In Flanagan's sweeping Stephen King adaptation, four different actors play everyman Chuck throughout various periods of his life. There's Hiddleston, of course, as adult Chuck; Cody Flanagan (Mike and co-star Kate Siegel's real-life child) as kid Chuck; Jacob Tremblay as teen Chuck; and first-time film actor Benjamin Pajak as tween Chuck.

It's Pajak who will likely capture the most attention for his work here, even as he acts alongside legends like Mark Hamill and Mia Sara, thanks to his wonderfully open-hearted performance, plus plenty of dancing. While Pajak, just 12 years old at the time of filming, is no stranger to acting (he did, after all, appear on Broadway in “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman in 2022), the film is his very first film role. It's an auspicious one at that, the kind of star-making role you simply know when you see.

One thing Pajak didn't know initially: He and Hiddleston were playing the same role. How's that for a Hollywood twist?

 










Ahead, Pajak tells IndieWire about getting the role, still being a scaredy-cat when it comes to horror, what he learned from his iconic co-stars, and even gets a little lesson in the sweeping cast of “The Mickey Mouse Club.”

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: Benjamin, are you aware of how many nice things people say about you? Like, true Hollywood legends like Mark Hamill and Mia Sara just gush over you.

Benjamin Pajak: I am so grateful for everything that they've said about me and about the film, too. I had such an amazing time working with Mark and Mia, and they've both been such inspirations to me, and they've motivated me to keep doing good work throughout the projects that I've been doing. But no, I just can't say how grateful enough … I could say it a million times to them. They've just been so kind.

I worked with Mark for a little bit more time than with Mia, but I still had amazing relationships with both of them. The one thing that always kind of stuck out to me when we were filming Mark really always kind of stayed in his character. He wasn't Method, he wasn't one of those actors where you have to call them by their [character] names and talk to them like that, but it was just amazing to see him transform into this character. He's unrecognizable in the best way in this film, and that's the thing that I got to take from it.

 










I spoke to Mark last week, and he told this story about how, on your last day on set, you wrote him a thank you note, and you wrote, “Thank you for being the best scene partner.” He was so taken with this, but it's a very funny thing to say.

[Laughs] That definitely sounds like my writing.

Were you actively looking for a film role or a screen role when “The Life of Chuck” came to you?

I had been auditioning at the time. I had a theater background, I had been on Broadway, and I did “Oliver” at New York City Center. I had been in the mix for a couple things, but when “Chuck” came around, it was the first [screen] audition that had dancing in it. I was like, “Maybe it's a movie musical?” And when I got the role, I was like, “Whoa, this is really original. This is really good stuff.”

I met Mike after the auditions on Zoom, and we both kind of geeked out about working with Luke Skywalker. When I got the audition, seeing Tom and Mark's name [already] on it, I felt I had to put everything into it.

Did you have to dance on Zoom?
 










I think there was a thing in the sides where I had to do a dance move or something, and I was on the couch, and I did something with my hands or something. I guess Mike thought that was prime dancing. I don't know how he thought that I was a dancer from that, but thank you, Mike.

At what point did you get to read the whole script? 

I got the [full] script fairly close to when I flew down to Alabama [to shoot it]. I read my part first, and I got connected with that, and I started learning all my lines. And I think it was after the fact of filming that I read the full thing, and I read the novella after it. I felt so connected with the material after. I felt that I should have read the full thing before I actually did the movie. I got into Stephen King. I got into a Stephen King hole for a while. 

I think, after reading the script, it kind of changed my perspective on filmmaking and writing. I also think it's one of those movies that you have to see a couple times to get. You're going to find something different every single time you see it. People should go and see it in theaters for that reason because there's so many things. There's so many little nuances that you're going to find every time that you're going to love every time. 

What's it like to think, “I'm playing young Tom Hiddleston”?
 










I didn't know because I didn't know who Tom was playing. [Laughs] I thought Tom was some leading role in the script, because I had only read my part. But when I found out that Mark and Tom were both going to be in it, those are two of my favorite actors, and I kind of freaked out a little bit.

You obviously didn't get to work with Tom, but did you spend time with any of the other Chucks?

I did meet Cody. Cody's so cute. I met Jacob briefly, too. He was there because I think he was mirroring Mike for a few days, which was really neat. I had watched Jacob in everything that he's done, and I think he's incredible in everything he does. It was so cool because we got to take a picture together, and I sent it to my grandmother, and she's like, “You guys look so similar. Are you sure it's just not you scaled up a little bit?” I was like, “No, that's Jacob.”

What was your preparation process for this, your first movie? 

I took a lot away from personal experience, because there's a lot of the grandparents' connection in the film that [feels close to me], because I feel very connected with my grandparents in real life. I spent so much time with Mark in the film, and I took that from my grandfather and my grandmother and put it into the film. 

I did watch a lot of movies. I saw a little bit of Mike's work. I'm not a huge horror fan, I'm a scaredy-cat, as a lot of my friends know, but I watched a lot of Mike projects, and I got the feel for it. I love his direction and his writing. I just got really pumped to do the project.

 










Do you remember what you did on your first day on set?

My first day was just dance, I think, because I did dance boot camp for about three weeks with Mandy [Moore]. Mia came in for a little bit, and Trinity [Bliss], who I danced with in the film. 

I think it was Tom's second day filming that I went to meet everyone on set for the first time, which was totally Mandy's idea. I didn't think that I had the right to go on set and see Tom Hiddleston dance, but I'll never forget that. That was the best thing I ever got to do. I got to take so many things from Tom, the subtle way that he moved his hips or how he used his face in his dance, and I got to put that into my performance. I'm so grateful that I got to be there for that day. And also, it was really cool to see Loki dance.

He's such a good dancer. I don't think I realized that.

I don't think anybody knew! I think he danced briefly on a late-night show, and that's how Mike found Tom [for the role].

What was dance boot camp with the great Mandy Moore like?

Every single day, getting to work with Mandy was so much fun. Even if I were to mess a dance move up or something, because I know I definitely stepped on Trinity's feet multiple times dancing, she would say, “It's fine. Just do it again. Pick yourself up, and we'll do it again, and you'll get it right.”

 










I had known she did “La La Land,” and that's one of my favorite movies. The choreography in that is spectacular, and I was like, well, if she can make Ryan Gosling into a dancer, she can turn me into a dancer.

Ryan Gosling was on “The Mickey Mouse Club” as a kid.

What? How did I not know this?

You are a little young for this. This was my youth. It was Ryan Gosling, Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears.

Oh, my God.

Keri Russell.

What?

I knew that one would get you. You need to go back and watch the '90s-era “Mickey Mouse Club.” Dancing, singing, they do little sketches, they have a little soap opera. I think you'll love it.

You're right, Keri Russell did get me!

You're still dancing, you're dancing all over your Instagram.

I love dancing now. I did “Music Man” a few years ago, and Mandy's friends with Warren Carlyle, who was the choreographer for that, and Mandy was like, “Where'd you get your dance experience from?” And I said in a nervous voice back when my voice wasn't changed, “Well, I was choreographed by Warren Carlyle,” and she was like, “Warren? I love Warren. We go way back.” 

When we made the Warren connection, that kind of made Mandy be like, “So you know how to do this, and you know how to do this?” She kind of took some stuff that she knew that I knew how to do from Warren and put it into the performance.

 










I think having all the dance experience back from my theater days kind of gave me a little head start because, when I read the script the first time, seeing all the different dance styles kind of threw me off. I didn't even know samba existed. I called up all my dancer friends, and I was like, “Hey, can you teach me how to do some of these moves?” 

Everyone loves the dancing, of course, but you also get to share this really lovely scene with Kate Siegel, where she's giving this monologue that kind of sums up the whole film. What was it like to act in those moments?

I think we did four shots. We did my coverage, her coverage, and then we did one of the both of us just looking down the barrel of the camera. I think we only did her monologue about four times, and every single time, it got better and better. I just kept on thinking, “How do you memorize all that?”

I was amazed by Kate's acting. I had never really been that close to someone in a scene. We were inches away. And being that close to someone's face, you see what they're thinking. Being in that moment, seeing Kate do that scene, was one of the most amazing experiences that I've ever had. 

What are you hoping audiences feel and think about when they leave the theater after seeing the film? 
 










There's so much that you're going to feel when you leave this film. The first time that I saw it at TIFF, I just felt everything, but the thing I felt the most was just utter joy. I just felt so glad that I got to be there in the moment and see it. I wasn't looking at the audience because I was crying myself, but Mark said that there were grown-ups with tears in their eyes. Hearing that, that kind of changed something in my head, saying, “Wow, people really feel connected to this, and people really want to see this movie, and people really want to experience what they just experienced again and again and again.”

What's next for you?

I have two films coming out this year, sometime. One of them is called “Playdate,” directed by Luke Greenfield. It's starring Kevin James and Alan Ritchson. And my other film this year is “Tiny Fugitives,” directed by Michael Lewen with Johnny Knoxville. And I think that already kind of tells you what it will be like. [Laughs]

As someone who is still fairly early in their film career, what is the big dream for you, the people you want to work with and projects you want to do?

I want to work with Mike again. If I only had a chance to work with Mike my entire career, I would do it. I want to do another “Chuck.” I think that would be amazing. I want to do another “Chuck”!

Kim Cattrall‘s Samantha Jones knows good sex, and isn't afraid to ask. But does that make the iconic “Sex and the City” character a “nymphomaniac”? Not quite. 

Cattrall told The Times that she still disagrees with some audience reactions to the beloved role. Cattrall starred as publicist Samantha in six seasons of “Sex and the City” from 1998 to 2004, and reprised the role for the 2008 and 2010 movies. She later made a cameo in the Season 2 finale of revival series “And Just Like That” in 2023.

“[Samantha] wasn't a nymphomaniac — well, some people might have thought she was — but she was just enjoying the main course,” Cattrall said. “Everyone else was nibbling on the appetizers when she was going for the steak. And it was always on her terms — that I always insisted on.”

Samantha was arguably the on-screen epitome of sex-positivity before the term even existed as a colloquialism. And while Cattrall is proud of the character, she can't totally relate to her: “I'm the antithesis of her in many ways,” she said. “I'm a serial monogamist, and then some.”

 










Cattrall also recalled how she turned down the role of Samantha four times, believing that at age 41, she was too old to be considered sexy. “Self-inflicted ageism,” Cattrall said when asked why. “Well, that changed — 40 became sexy. It became, ‘Man, let's have more of that.'”

Cattrall previously said to Today that she is “protective” of Samantha almost 30 years since the series began. “I don't think I'll ever say goodbye to Samantha,” she said. “She's like a lot of other characters that I've done over the years. I get very emotionally attached and protective of my characters. She gave me so much, and I'm so appreciative of her.”

As for her “And Just Like That” presence, Cattrall is calling it a one and done cameo (Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie does text Samantha in Seasons 1 and 3, but Cattrall only appeared onscreen for Season 2.) “This is as far as I'm going to go,” Cattrall said at the time. “It felt like dipping my toe back in time and having a wonderful afternoon. And then a great martini!”

After officially announcing a new partnership with Google DeepMind to produce short films with Gen-AI and some of Google's newly announced tools last month, filmmaker Darren Aronofsky has unveiled the first of three planned shorts created using generative AI. 

Directed by Eliza McNitt and produced by Aronofsky, the short is entitled “Ancestra,” and it will premiere at the Tribeca Festival on Friday night. Per an official statement, the 8-minute short “blends live-action filmmaking from a crew of 200+ artists and technologists.”

 










The short was inspired by McNitt's “own life-threatening birth, when doctors discovered a hole in her heart” and aims to “shed light on pregnancy challenges rarely seen in storytelling, breaking through technological barriers that once made these narratives impossible to visualize.” The filmmaker “transform[ed] personal family archives into a visually stunning experience, including images of her likeness in the womb.”

As IndieWire's Brian Welk previously reported, “McNitt trained the AI models on her own baby pictures and other photos taken by her late father in order to generate a newborn infant with a story that could be shaped by her own biography.” The short uses both live-action filmmaking and generative AI-created sequences, including those that go inside a woman's womb, as inspired by McNitt's own complicated delivery.

The short is the first to come out of Aronofsky's new venture with Google DeepMind, called Primordial Soup, which aims to produce new shorts that combine, as IndieWire reported last month, “new tech and storytelling and has the mission statement of creating frameworks for AI's role in filmmaking and putting artists in the driver's seat of technological innovation.”

McNitt is known for a previous VR series, the three-part “Spheres,” which was executive produced by Aronofsky and featured the voices of Millie Bobby Brown, Jessica Chastain, and Patti Smith as the voices of the cosmos. It was the first VR project to ever be acquired out of Sundance.

While the next two Primordial Soup shorts and their filmmakers have yet to be formally announced, an official statement noted that both “will explore new applications of Veo, Google DeepMind's video generation model.”

Comedian, actor, and interviewer Marc Maron has always had a lot on his mind. If you've ever seen his stand-up, you've gotten a full dose of his biting reflections on anxieties about the world and his place in it. However, this has always been, to some degree, a performance he's worked at over months in venues across the country to get ready for a special.

In Steven Feinartz's documentary “Are We Good?” (playing Tribeca Festival on June 14), we not only see Maron chipping away at this process but glimpse the man behind the mirth simultaneously trying to grieve and use his art as a way of processing the loss of his partner: the late, great filmmaker Lynn Shelton, who died in May 2020. The result would be his 2023 special, “From Bleak to Dark,” which Feinartz also directed and saw Maron grapple with how to engage with this loss and find a way forward. While he's always been vulnerable in his act and soon-ending, 16-year-old “WTF” podcast, letting a camera into his life off-stage like this was new territory.

The documentary, which premiered in March at SXSW, required Maron to give a high degree of access to his life. This is something, in typical Maron fashion, he humorously grumbles about throughout the film. In an IndieWire interview following the Austin premiere alongside Feinartz, Maron spoke about this experience and how his way into stand-up specials is different from most.

 










“My process is moving through these things to maybe no laughter or not quite having a way to make it funny or a throughline to things. Seeing that part of my process, which is not a standard stand-up process, [is where] I knew going into [the documentary] that telling the stories [was] going to be emotionally loaded, and I didn't have any real control over those emotions,” Maron said. “But I knew that being public with the feelings would eventually enable me to settle into that, and if I believed in comedy's ability to elevate those feelings into something common and funny, if not touching, that it would reveal itself on stage. So we had to do that.” 

Feinartz said that the film was then about figuring their way as they went without any preconception. In total, the duo shot for three years as Maron worked on his special, trying to figure out life after Shelton, wondering whether it was even his place to talk about her loss at all. The art of performing on stage is familiar to Maron, but in the case of “Are We Good?,” he often forgot the camera was even there, entering his home and life as he went through the stages of grieving.

“For better or for worse, the work I do in general is fairly candid and personal. The real question becomes ‘How do you do this? When do you do it?' The choice to do a podcast episode days after [Shelton] passed away, my producer was like, ‘We don't ever have to do a podcast again if you can't handle it.' And I'm like, ‘Well, I don't know, I think it's kind of important to expose this process in a way.' Because everybody goes through it. One way or the other, you can't outrun grief, and it's something that people don't really talk about,” Maron said. “Part of what I was thinking is I owe it to myself, and just what I do as an artist or performer is to have a public experience with this.” 

 










Maron first met Shelton when he did a podcast episode with her in 2015. Along with developing a relationship together, Shelton also directed Maron in episodes of the television series “GLOW,” his special “End Times Fun,” and her final film “Sword of Trust.” This connection wouldn't have happened without the podcast and, in early June, a few months after we spoke, Maron announced that his audio show, which he began in the early days of the medium in September 2009, would end this fall amid feeling “burnt out.”

During our interview, Maron shared how he grappled with how much he should speak about his grieving process in the documentary, knowing Shelton's death is not his alone to mourn.

“I had a fairly short amount of time with Lynn. We were really just starting out, and she has had a profound impact on the film community, the art community in Seattle; she has family that I didn't really know,” Maron said. “What do you do in relation to the fact that you're not the only one grieving, you're just the one who's public, and how do you respect that?” 

When it came to their creative partnership, which reached its peak in “Sword of Trust,” where Maron starred while Shelton wrote and directed and made a brief appearance herself, the process of working together gave him the confidence to take on more acting moving forward. (Since Shelton's death, he's had roles in films like “To Leslie” and “The Order” and shows like “Reservation Dogs.”)

 










“She believed in this talent I had that I didn't necessarily believe in,” Maron said. “When I think about acting or when I'm doing it, I do think about her a lot and her belief in me, because her belief in me kept me going in that particular zone.”

While acknowledging that he is a bit “stubborn” when it comes to receiving direction, he said that Shelton still got a kick out of him acting and that the two would share in laughing while working. 

“Her sensibility around naturalism and acting was something that inspired me and helped me to it. Even though I was resistant, and I'd get cranky. She'd be like, ‘Can we do another take?,' and I'd be like, ‘Why?' She'd say, ‘Just trust me.' Ultimately, she was right, and I trusted her.”

Maron said he's now looking into directing a project based on his longtime friend Sam Lipsyte's most recent novel, “No One Left to Come Looking for You,” which he and Lipsyte have been collaborating on.

“We're moving forward with that, but you know it's a long process, and, hopefully, we'll see it through. That's the plan,” Maron said. “You've got to figure out how to find the time for everything and still have a life. With the directing, it's just one of those things that I've always been curious about, and I always wanted to try it.”

 










When it comes to Shelton's films and her artistic legacy, Maron said that there is one underappreciated work that still resonates for him years later.

“I really like that movie she did with Jay [Duplass], ‘Outside In,'” Maron said. “She got a great thing out of Edie Falco, and I really think that movie is not talked about a lot… She was a real artist, and she had a real sensibility about what she wanted out of a scene.” 

As our conversation concluded, I asked Maron about the finale of “Sword of Trust,” where his character goes to visit Shelton's character's home and leaves her groceries without saying anything. 

“That was a powerful moment because there was a lot of emotion there that was genuine,” Maron said. “It all felt very connected. But yeah, leaving the groceries at the door, that's heavy… Her best work was really ahead of her, and whatever we were gonna be was really ahead of her.” 

“Are We Good?” screens June 14 and 15 at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Dakota Johnson is speaking out: We need more original films. The “Materialists” star said during her recent appearance on “Hot Ones” that modern Hollywood is reliant on remakes and IP, which audiences “don't want.” In turn, according to actress/producer Johnson, it's a “mess.”

“When something does well, studios want to keep that going so they remake the same things,” she said, “but humans don't want that. They want fresh, they want to feel new things, experience new things, see new things, so I don't know, I guess it's all just a bit of a mess right now, isn't it?”

 










Johnson continued, “I think it's hard when creative decisions are made by committee and it's hard when creative decisions are made by people who don't even really watch movies or know anything about them, and that tends to be what's occurring a lot.”

This isn't the first time that Johnson has deemed the studio system a corporate “committee.” Johnson told the Los Angeles Times that “a lot of creative decisions are made by committee or made by people who don't have a creative bone in their body,” such as the case for her superhero flop “Madame Web.”
 










Johnson added, “It's really hard to make art that way. Or to make something entertaining that way. And I think unfortunately with ‘Madame Web,' it started out as something and turned into something else. And I was just sort of along for the ride at that point. But that happens. Bigger-budget movies fail all the time.”

Thankfully, there are still bigger budget (or at least mid-tier budget) original films that are going the distance at the box office, proving that audiences do in fact want new stories. One of those new original films includes “Sinners,” which Johnson's fellow filmmakers have embraced as an “encouraging” step for non-IP films being greenlit. 

Sam Rockwell recently told Variety that “Sinners” succeeding at the box office is reignites hope for Hollywood. “It was encouraging because it was rated R, you know? The sexuality felt palpable,” Rockwell said. “And the fact that it made a bunch of money while mixing all these genres — ‘From Dusk Till Dawn,' ‘Sounder,' ‘Devil in a Blue Dress' — I thought that was encouraging. It's a big swing.”

Few authors are as prolific or as popular as Stephen King. Since releasing his debut novel “Carrie” in 1974, the (famously) Maine-born author has published 65 novels and over 200 short stories, and several of them have permeated the public consciousness to become cultural touchstones, from “Carrie” and its tale of a high school prom turned bloody to the terrifying clown of his mammoth 1986 novel “It.” At roughly $300 million novels sold worldwide, he's one of the best-selling authors alive, and it's no surprise that his works — which range from human dramas to (more typically) thrillers and horror — have been ripe subjects for film adaptations.

The problem is, most of King's work doesn't actually translate well to film. As a novelist, King specializes in a peculiar blend of sincerity, horror, and slight camp that works very well on the written page. In film, it often falls apart: literal translations of his work are less scary than they are mawkish and awkward. As a result, the bad adaptations of his work far, far exceed the good ones. Even King himself isn't necessarily the best at putting his ideas on screen: his sole directorial effort, an adaptation of his short story “Maximum Overdrive,” is a corny mess that even he doesn't think is good.

The upside: when an adaptation of a King novel really manages to work, the results are often spectacular. And plenty of those films work, especially the ones made by great directors like Stanley Kubrick or Brian de Palma. With “The Life of Chuck” currently in theaters, now is the time to comb through the good, the bad, and the horrible of Stephen King adaptations to pick out the true best of the best.

It's difficult to compare some of King's work against each other — what, beyond the author of their source material, really connects a coming of age tale like “Stand By Me” with a horror movie like “The Shining?” But ultimately, the greatest of his films are the ones that find a way to take the stories off the page and make them their own, sometimes eschewing literal fidelity to the material in the process. Read on for the 10 best movies based on Stephen King novels, ranked.

The succession of terrible sequels, prequels, reboots, and everything in between makes it difficult to look back at the original “Children of the Corn” with fresh eyes. Go in with an open mind, and you'll find that the adaptation of King's 1977 short story holds up as an effectively nasty '80s slasher, one with a killer idea that takes a bite from zombie cinema. Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton are the adult saps driving cross country who stumble upon a small town where the entire adult populace has been murdered by children, who have all come to worship a strange devil entity. The film peaks with its opening massacre sequence and never really lives up to that benchmark, but it's a solidly made frightfest all the same, with great performances from John Franklin and Courtney Gains as the main children that'll have you believing kids can be deadly. 

King himself wrote every story in this anthology film (it was his feature screenwriting debut), and only two of the short stories within were based on his pre-existing works: the other three are totally original. Maybe that's for the best, though, because this collaboration with George A. Romero feels like a better use of King's sensibilities than many of the films based on his novels. A homage to EC horror comics of the 1950s like “Tales of the Crypt,” the film is primarily pulpy fun first and foremost, with some misses (“(“The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill”) and some hits (“They're Creeping Up On You”). Still, even its worst moments are a scream, and this is the only film where you can see King himself play a hillbilly, so that counts for something. 

Infamously, Frank Darabont's adaptation of King's novella “The Mist” ends on a note that's way, way darker than its source material, and the alternate ending is controversial to many fans. For what it's worth, King himself prefers Darabont's take, and it adds some extra tragic kick to the story of ordinary people attempting to survive after their town becomes shrouded in a mist hiding otherworldly creatures. Even if you hate the ending, there's a lot to appreciate about Darabont's adaptation, which is tense, genuinely scary, and features a terrific cast, with Thomas Jane, Andre Braugher, and Marcia Gay Harden giving standout performances.  

An extremely loose adaptation of King's 1982 novel (he wrote it under the pen name Richard Bachman) that imagines what would happen if game shows killed people, Paul Michael Glaser's “The Running Man” is an aggressively '80s artifact: The fashion! The theme song! The Arnold! That doesn't mean it doesn't rule, though: as an action film, it's a total blast, with zippy fun fights and hammy performances (especially from Schwarzenegger in the main hero turn and Richard Dawson playing, essentially, an evil version of himself) that make it the platonic ideal of popcorn entertainment. Still, “The Running Man” isn't totally brainless, and it's hard not to see the parallels between its critique of sensationalist mass media and the widening income gap and America today. It's dumb fun, but not too dumb. 

Even the most cynical, unhappy, and soulless among us will likely find themselves a little teary-eyed by the time credits roll on “The Shawshank Redemption.” A little-seen commercial failure elevated to cultural touchstone by repeat cable airings, Frank Darabont's adaptation of King's novella “Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption” is a sweet, meat-and-potatoes story of friendship and freedom, tracking the bond between two prisoners (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) across 19 years as they yearn to escape prison. A classic dad movie, it can be tempting to get snobbish here and say “The Shawshank Redemption” is overrated sap. But, while it's definitely not the best film made from King's works there's a reason why this thoughtful, well-written, well-performed adult drama endures: it's as moving as it is familiar. 

One of the rare Stephen King adaptations to significantly improve upon its source material, Rob Reiner's “Misery” takes a messy novel notoriously written on a cocaine bender and transforms it into a savage, smart, and extremely funny story about the corrosive effects of fandom and stardom. What makes the film work where the novel doesn't is Kathy Bates' star-making turn as Annie Wilkes, the ultimate obsessive fan. On the page, Annie was a flimsy antagonist, an obvious monster with zero depth or pathos. In the hands of Bates, she feels alive and a little sympathetic, and her cat-and-mouse games with the bedridden romance novelist (James Caan) she's holding prisoner are both hair-raising and hilarious. Deservedly, Bates' performance won her a Best Actress Oscar, making “Misery” the only King adaptation to get rewarded by the Academy. Moreover, her performance has made Wilkes an iconic stand-in for the tortured relationship between fandom and the creators they claim to love: one only has to look at stan Twitter now to realize how many potential Annie Wilkes are out there 

“The Dead Zone” never reached the iconic status of other King adaptations like “Carrie” or “Misery.” But this underrated 1983 treat is a fascinating blend of the sensibilities of King and another North American horror great, body horror master David Cronenberg. The result is terrific, essentially a classic '70s political thriller in the shell of a science-fiction story. Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances as Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher who awakens from a coma with the mysterious ability to touch someone and see their future, and is forced to make a terrible decision when he discovers a U.S. senate candidate (Martin Sheen) will go on to be president and begin a nuclear war. It sounds pulpy, but Cronenberg makes it sad and cerebral, a haunting moral dilemma tale in which the right thing will always hurt someone. 

One of the most iconic coming-of-age films ever made, Rob Reiner's adaptation of the novella “The Body” is the type of wistfully nostalgic film that feels like it's always existed. A great quartet of young stars (Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Will Wheaton) play the four friends who, in the summer of 1959, take a hiking trip to find the dead body of their friend in the woods near their town. The result is sweet but never sappy, just lowkey enough and cognizant of how real 12-year-olds behave for it to feel real. And while the framing device of an adult version of one of them (played by Richard Dreyfuss) could be cheap, in practice it's a clear-eyed look at how small moments can become defining memories with the passage of time. A rare film about kids that doesn't condescend to them, “Stand By Me” is a lot like the classic Ben E. King title song: warm, sweet, and comforting. 

King's original 1974 novel version of “Carrie” is very clearly a first novel, wrapping a promising premise about a teen outcast who develops telekinetic powers and ultimately takes revenge upon her bullies in an epistolary format that distances the reader from the emotional core of this narrative. Brian de Palma's 1976 masterpiece, one of the great horror films, throws all that out to situate us into the perspective of the unhappy title character, played by a splendid Sissy Spacek, as she struggles against the rejection of her peers, her domineering mother (a terrifying Piper Laurie), and her own insecurities unhappiness that's steadily eating her alive. Spacek is perfect in the role, raw and unpredictable, and de Palma is content with keeping the film at a low boil for most of its runtime as we follow her deterioration. When her breaking point arrives — in a scene that changed the way people think about prom forever — he really lets loose with lush, swooping direction and editing that unleashes all of the inner turmoil Carrie has struggled with on to the screen. High school is hell is a metaphor that works like “Twin Peaks” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” have copied to not inconsiderable success. “Carrie” did it first, and still did it best. 

Famously, Stephen King himself hates this movie. In adapting the author's third novel to film, Stanley Kubrick made a lot of alterations, turning a story about redemption and conquering one's inner demons — one very personal to King — into a less straightforward tale of insanity that people are still picking apart and debating today; King would later write a more faithful limited TV series adaptation of the novel, to mixed reviews. But while calling a movie the author hates the best adaptation of his work feels a little mean, there's no denying that “The Shining” and its nasty tale of a father who whisks his family away to a remote ski lodge where he's haunted by ghosts and goes steadily insane is a classic for a reason. It's one of the scariest and best-directed horror films ever made, a pitch black, occasionally funny story of insanity that sees Kubrick immerse us in a chilly, mysterious world in which there are few real answers to the horrors we experience. Jack Nicholson gives one of film's most purely frightening performances as Jack Torrence, and the terror is amplified knowing that he's not a boogeyman or a ghost but a normal person with pure evil in his heart. “The Shining” is a feat of adaptation that doesn't seek to replicate King's original work: it distorts it into a new, equally haunting nightmare.

Little Simz's Lotus is the music-industry equivalent of a slash-and-burn harvest, where once-fertile land is razed and set ablaze, flooding the soil with nutrients. Earlier this year, the Mercury Prize-winning rapper sued her former producer and childhood friend Inflo for allegedly failing to repay a loan of £1.7 million (~$2.3 million). A majority of the money had gone toward funding an extravagant live performance by SAULT, the enigmatic collective led by Inflo and his wife, R&B star Cleo Sol; his alleged failure to pay back the debt left Simz unable to pay her taxes for 2024. Simz lost one of her oldest friends and her closest creative collaborator; Inflo had produced each of her three albums since 2019's GREY Area. On Lotus, the fallout from the conflict becomes fuel for her creativity.

Simz started and scrapped four different full-length projects (each of which were worked on with Inflo) between Lotus and the release of NO THANK YOU in 2022. She has admitted to grappling with self-doubt throughout the album's creation, but, emboldened by her trial, Simz emerges from the emotional wilderness spitting with a bristling intensity that manifests in a focus absent from her recent projects. With new producer Miles Clinton James at the helm of Lotus, she puts her interpersonal issues on display with a (sometimes) deft touch; it's a thorough excavation of the graveyard of one's ego and closest relationships.

On past albums, Simz's topical scope has been vast, with varying degrees of success: she hip-fired at the music industry's exploitation of Black artistry on NO THANK YOU and probed her psyche on 2021's Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Within those expansive arcs, the strongest moments were when Simz took aim at specific targets, whether external or internal. It's that energy that makes the opener “Thief” an invigorating entry point. Post-punk guitars crawl in the background, giving the production a murky, forlorn atmosphere, as Simz lays into an unnamed malefactor, presumably Inflo, for his transgressions against her. Simz tells him that she feels “sorry for your wife,” calls him a “devil in disguise,” and accuses him of having no artistic direction until she came along. In the pantheon of diss tracks, it sits alongside Lauryn Hill's evisceration of Wyclef Jean on “Lost Ones,” unflinchingly wielding familiarity as a weapon.

Simz has likened the new album to her diary, telling The Guardian “I really just put my life out there.” In the past, in her weakest moments, Simz would overload lines with syllables, her rapid pace washing away the meaning of her raps. Here, the intended transparency carries over to the way she structures her bars, as though it were just you and her in the room: “They ask why I'm starvin' the streets?/This nigga tryna hold my shit up/I'll never forget when you told me, give up/And that my big dreams were far from a reach,” she raps on “Hollow,” playing with the gas pedal to vary her delivery. Her plainspoken, tempered tone pops with personality, making her strongest musings land with the impact of an exploding bullet. When, over a sparse drumbeat, piano, and acoustic guitar (“Lonely”), Simz spits about being on the verge of quitting music, or reveals that paranoia has her peeking out the window like Malcolm X (“Lotus”), it all begins to feel like a therapy session that you can't tear yourself away from.

James, who previously produced for the London-based band Kokoroko, handles all 13 tracks on Lotus. Largely forgoing the cinematic flair of Simz's previous records, James surrounds her voice with unfussy arrangements that draw from jazz, Afrobeat, and rock. It's a difficult balance but they manage, more or less. The overall lightness can make Simz's musings on stardom and the industry to feel trite this time, especially when combined with her nursery-rhyme singing on the punky “Young.” The instances where James injects his beats with more gravitas—swelling strings set up a call-and-response with singer Lydia Kitto's angelic chorus on “Only,” and pounding drums rattle like the soundtrack of an anxiety-inducing chase scene on “Flood”—suggest that their creative partnership has legs, even if they're still finding their footing together.

What's clear on Lotus is that Simz hasn't closed herself off to the world. Cameos from Sampha, rapper Wretch 32, and Michael Kiwanuka (who has also worked closely with SAULT) raise the album's ceiling, marking the welcome return of a collaborative ethos after NO THANK YOU. (“I love the idea of doing things as a team, you come with your people,” she told the BBC.) She sounds at ease in lengthy soliloquies on the way love and fear offer guiding lights after everything has gone down the gutter, and she comes across as unnervingly honest in the pantomimed sparring with a fraternal figure about their fractured familial ties. In a lesser artist's hands, Lotus could have devolved into a messy confessional. Instead, Simz's clarity defines this stage of her journey: she knows what's behind her and she knows where to put her foot next.

Lyra Pramuk started singing at a young age, yet she always felt like a musical outsider. She cut her teeth in Pennsylvania church choirs before attending conservatory, her ostensible plan to be an operatic baritone; in her 20s, she shifted gears and became a denizen of Berlin dancefloors. Her destination has always been more idiosyncratic than anything she could find in a particular medium, genre, or career model. “I only set out to make an album because everyone told me I had to,” Pramuk self-effacingly told The Quietus in 2020, hot on the heels of her now-classic debut, Fountain. “I've been very much in my own world, so I feel kind of naïve about all of this. I'm more likely to want to talk about Susan Sontag or aesthetics.”

Fountain was composed entirely of Pramuk's voice, which she manipulated, distorted, and layered. It was a minimal album, not necessarily in the vein of Steve Reich or Philip Glass, nor because it sounded stripped down—Pramuk created a cavernous, haunting sense of space out of just one instrument. Her secret sauce was software, yet Fountain smacked of ancient feats of ingenuity, reminiscent of the way cultures that persisted for millennia without modern technology could create mind-boggling works from sparse natural resources. The record's lush vocals feel even more prophetic today than they did five years ago—Pramuk harvested the digital fruits of the nascent 2020s to nourish herself for the deprivations of an unknown future.

Her follow-up fosters a similarly organic sensibility, though it takes a different route to the core. Hymnal is unabashedly maximalist: Pramuk embraces varied collaborators, including chamber ensemble the Sonar Quartett, and processes drawn from literature, visual art, and botany. Her vocal performance emerged from a set of unconventional instructions: She used verse by the poet Nadia Marcus as the basis for a “geographical biology experiment” she built with the artist Jenna Sutela. This sculpture-cum-habitat was littered with Marcus' words, on top of which Pramuk placed oats; she then documented the growth of a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, while it overtook the grains, letting its path dictate the lyrics. Pramuk's intricate, labor-intensive technique places her in a long lineage of composers who use chance operations and alternative musical notation systems, though her score singularly fits her vision. Life, she tells us, finds a way.

Hymnal is a planet of sound, teeming with life, that seems even more habitable than Fountain—a bountiful ecosystem experiencing a permanent May and June. The album's execution is tech-forward, yet tactile. Wielding a CDJ, Pramuk plaits violin, viola, cello, flute, double bass, and handclaps into her own treated singing and speech. The seeds of the LP are human, packed with the same mystifying DNA as its predecessor: Pramuk's voice, which feels incantatory, and maintains its personhood past the augmentation of technology and the constancy of change.

The way Pramuk uses her pipes as raw material is distinctive. She frequently sings or speaks in indiscernible syllables that suggest a postmodern vocalese. Her words become scrutable on centerpiece “Meridian,” but their pitch shifts dramatically in a short span, sinking into a register that feels impossibly low, but not enough to disfigure the bodily origin of her utterances. “Licking the sun/Licking soil,” she intones, yet the nouns soon begin to blur, ground and sky coming together as her tone dips further and then climbs into a higher range.

In part, the mutability of her voice is the product of a realization Pramuk has discussed in interviews: As a trans woman who started taking hormones during adulthood, her voice could never become stereotypically feminine merely from estrogen-based therapy. Her performance on Hymnal twists away from normative expectations and toys with gender's fabrication. On the aptly titled “Reality,” her pitched-down humming sounds artificial, exaggeratedly rich. The computerized and the fleshy question each other, and ultimately figure out a way to speak in tandem—much as they do, for better or worse, in actuality.

If Hymnal's imagination is post-human, its roots are in the European classical tradition, which has a history of foregrounding string arrangements to indicate the replenishment of spring. Opener “Rewild” immediately establishes a chordophone theme, only to bury such analog melodies across the record's first half. As the album continues, its cycles of motif and progression seem to move faster and faster, outpacing humanity's concept of seasons. The album feels more fructuous than the Earth and more cleansing and optimistic than the effects that climate change is predicted to have on it. The Sonar Quartett slips back to the surface on “Meridian,” while the prominent bowing on “Swallow,” “Umbra,” and “Solace” indicate further fecundity, more flushes and blooms. The disc shines with destruction's opposite—a sci-fi verdancy. Pramuk considers not only the subsistence of species—whether single-celled or homo sapiens—but their flourishing: Here, the album finds its wide-scoped notion of hope.

One method for enduring a present of ecological disaster, cynical applications of consequential technology, and constant political upheaval is to look beyond one's own historical moment at the broader workings of time. Using the lenses of enduring customs, Pramuk's music has the courage to peer ahead. She points far past the limits of being a soul with its own circumstances toward a more challenging truce between people and apparatus, society and nature. Hymnal is a truly existential record, but not because it ponders the trials and conundrums of individuals—that would be philosophically old-school, an inhibiting vestige of the 20th Century. Pramuk's subject is the phenomenon of life itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Brian Wilson's Symphony of Life","https://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/brian-wilson-obituary/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:49:44 GMT","

Depending on your age, taste, and life circumstances, you might see Brian Wilson as the sunny figurehead of youthful innocence; the tortured ideal of artistic integrity; the paragon of mastercraftsmanship; or a lovable eccentric who played his grand piano inside a giant sandbox. The common thread through all of these archetypes, of course, is that he endured. There has been a comfort in watching Wilson withstand the eras, knowing he might still pop up on concert stages or give strange squirrely interviews, proving by mere existence that some of us are immortal.

Even after his death this week at the age of 82, “immortal” is still the word that comes to mind. As a child in Inglewood, California, Wilson fell in love with music upon hearing George Gershwin's “Rhapsody in Blue” at his grandmother's house. It doesn't take long to clock what registered: the movement, the magic, the melody. Spurred on by the energy of Chuck Berry, the harmonies of the Four Freshmen, and the ecstatic production of Phil Spector, Wilson chased these highs through his vast, oceanic career. He was fiercely competitive—keeping up with the Beatles in the 1960s is partially what caused his nervous breakdown—but he was also tapped into an uncommonly deep well of intuition, understanding that the power of music was to communicate feelings that could not be expressed in words.

Accordingly, his legacy is not just in the songs he wrote; it is the breadth of his work and the way people connect to it. He is an artist who authored some of the best-selling records in rock history, as well as its most mythical lost album. He has made pop songs that seem woven into the fabric of life and some of the most stoned outsider art of his—or any—era. As an artist who, even in his 20s, felt he “just wasn't made for these times,” he lived to see most of his work re-assessed and rehabilitated in the canon. In other words, he endured—which is a blessing and a curse.

Unlike the Beatles, the Beach Boys remained an active unit well into the 21st century, which means that digging through the back catalog is likely to turn up as many lost gems (like 2012's surprisingly poignant reunion album That's Why God Made the Radio) as bleak cash grabs (like 1996's bizarre country project Stars and Stripes Vol. 1). And as Wilson's mental health dipped and bobbed, he maintained a steady pace of live shows and new releases that occasionally seemed against his better interest, stirring concerns about his well-being and adding another, more troubling persona to his rolodex: the ghostly figure that fans might start worrying about.

Despite occasional glimpses into the darkness—in the 2021 documentary, Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road, he confesses that he “hasn't had a real friend in three years”—Wilson never let anyone worry for too long. There is a Zen-like quality to his outlook, an unwavering consistency to his vision. Around the time that he scrapped Smile—the legendary project he began with Van Dyke Parks immediately after the creative breakthroughs of 1966's Pet Sounds—he decided to let go of his voice-of-god perfectionism and start making smaller, sparer records that sparked more joy—pushing past the old obstacles by simply persevering. (To borrow a popular mindfulness phrase, “You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.”)

Still, moments of profundity emerged. There's a bleak, gorgeous song on the Beach Boys' 1971 album Surf's Up where he carries the thread that began with “I'm Just Not Made for These Times” to depressive new ends. It's called “‘Til I Die,” and it's one of the first songs that a new Beach Boys fan might hear and understand just how much emotional range they covered in their music. In its lyrics, Wilson describes himself a small, meaningless object in a grand universe with no control over his trajectory—a cork on the ocean, a rock in a landslide, a leaf on a windy day—and uses the mellow stormy music to guide him forward: “These things I'll be until I die,” he sings in the chorus, as hopeless as he's ever sounded.

As if proving his point, his bandmates were skeptical of the direction and suggested changing some lines: “How about instead of ‘It kills my soul,' we sing, ‘It holds me up'?” Wilson temporarily acquiesced—you can hear that version on 2021's Feel Flows compilation—but his original lyrics won out in the end. And while it's more despondent than most of his characteristic work, it's hardly an outlier. You don't need to read the biographies or watch the 2014 biopic named after Wilson's credo, Love & Mercy, to understand the desperate romance of “Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder),” or why “In My Room” suggests a level of introspection that goes beyond your average homebody. These were things Wilson couldn't help but expose through the music, and once you caught them, you felt like you were invited into his mind as it reeled.

Through these songs, Brian Wilson wasn't just teaching us to listen to music; he was teaching us to feel it. And for several generations of artists, he wasn't just pushing them to create; he was pushing them to aspire. As with any artist who concerns themselves with themes of childhood and romance, his body of work is carried by a feeling of potential, utopia within grasp, his self-proclaimed “teenage symphonies to God.” This is likely why Smile is often situated at the center of his narrative. Here was an iconic artist with one of the most successful catalogs in recorded music—and his greatest album might be the one we'll never get to hear. (An extensive reissue called The Smile Sessions, which collected studio outtakes from original sessions in the '60s, was released in 2011.) For many people, hearing Brian Wilson for the first time was a sort of gateway drug into a life devoted to music as a higher calling.

This type of mythology is also what makes Wilson, paradoxically, one of the most popular cult artists of all time. I would pinpoint this transition to sometime in the '90s, when he became situated within a canon of artists driven to the brink by their own creative spirit—he is name-dropped alongside figures like Syd Barrett, Scott Walker, and Nick Drake in the Chills' “Song for Randy Newman Etc.” This was a world where Kurt Cobain was becoming a pop star, when the idea of “authenticity” became a rallying cry for art. Of course, Wilson's authenticity was different from the rest of these figures. (After all, among his brothers, Brian wasn't even the surfer!) But does anyone listen to the Beach Boys and wonder if he really feels what he's singing? Even when he's listing the planets in “Solar System,” you imagine a part of him that thinks he'll start orbiting among them if he sings it well enough.

Within this subject matter—innocent wonder at the forces beyond us, heartfelt odes to simpler times, burnt-out submission to our loneliest depths—Wilson sought the connective tissue between all of us. It's what kept him going. When asked in 2004 how he manages to stay active as an artist, he simply responded, “By force of will.” A decade later, he expressed pride that he had “proven stronger than many imagined me to be.” It's a vulnerable statement from an artist who had spent his life struggling with mental illness, who lived under conservatorships, fought through multiple bitter legal battles, and operated at the forefront of a family band managed by an abusive father. There were times, I'm sure, when Wilson wouldn't blame someone for betting against him.

Against these odds, he triumphed. Like few public figures, Brian Wilson is loved by all: From Paul McCartney (“No one is educated musically until they've heard Pet Sounds”), to Bob Dylan (“Jesus, that ear. He should donate it to the Smithsonian.”), to Bruce Springsteen (“The level of musicianship—I don't think anybody's touched it yet”). You would be hard-pressed to find a songwriter who hasn't expressed his influence. Like the public domain songs he loved—“Shortenin' Bread,” for example—his music belongs to everyone. It's equally fitting for a young family on a road trip or a college freshman's first experience with psychedelics; at weddings or funerals; in the collection of any self-respecting vinyl aficionado or the window of a Goodwill. There's a reason why nearly every Beach Boys greatest hit set comes adorned with a sepia-toned image of the ocean on its cover, at some indistinguishable point between sunrise and sunset. It is priceless and free, at any time, forever.

This is why, when Wilson finally released a newly recorded studio version of Smile in September 2004, it still managed to feel new. Not just new, but exciting. At the time, I was just finding my footing with music discovery as a teen. I remember reading the five-star review in Rolling Stone and a glowing write-up on this website. Like the author of that review mentions in the opening paragraph, I was also a child whose father owned a copy of Endless Summer, and my understanding of the Beach Boys had been limited to those otherworldly pop gems about kids on the West Coast and the grinning, bearded faces on the cover. But when I listened to Smile, I heard another dimension to the same music that my dad loved—a lengthening shadow beneath the same sun. I found myself obsessing over its strange, sprawling arc, full of hymns and nursery rhymes, melody and mythos. It felt the way you hope your life will feel when you look back—all your joy alongside your dreams and fears and ambitions, all coated with a heavenly glow of getting to feel it all.

One of the best Texas rap songs of the year isn't as easy to find as it should be. There are two ways to listen to HOODLUM's “Better Dayz (Freestyle)”: directly on his Instagram page or hidden on the second half of another video called “Just Left Walgreens.” “As soon as I posted the song, YouTube banned it right away,” claims HOODLUM, on FaceTime from the front porch of his crib in Houston, where he's moved from his hometown of San Antonio. “They said I was interfering with votes or some shit, and it was the second time, so they took it down.”

“Better Dayz (Freestyle)” rolls in at the 1:50 mark of “Just Left Walgreens” with a news clip from earlier this year: “The president, in his first week in office, is already enforcing an immigration crackdown that has instilled fear in some major cities.” (The video also features him flexing a Cybertruck.) Then, backdropped by a woozy instrumental moving at half-speed, HOODLUM, in his cracked voice that sounds like he just got done ripping an entire carton of cigarettes, vents about the terror and community division that has been caused by the surging presence of ICE—the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency conducting mass raids across the country—in San Antonio, where a sizable portion of the population, including HOODLUM, is Mexican. “My dawg kid got no papers, she might die 'cause a fever/They could run in the church, so don't be trustin' the preacher/They could run in the school, so don't be trustin' the teacher,” he raps with a heavy heart.

It's a really good song, not only because of the strong message, but also because HOODLUM's mumbly, leaned-out rap-sing sounds naturally chopped and screwed and gives his memories the feel of a melancholic dream sequence. On his standout tapes, such as 2023's Southside Story and last year's Brown in America, with the simmering, sample-heavy Texas funk of his go-to producer, bigtexjohnny, as the backbone, HOODLUM uses his flow—which, on occasion, is nearly inaudible—to dig into nostalgic, hardened scenes of hustling, getting high, and hanging with friends and family amid fears of death and going broke.

And “Better Dayz (Freestyle),” isn't the first or last time HOODLUM has tackled political turmoil head on. A few years ago, after the end of the the first Trump administration, he wrote “B.I.A (Brown in Amerikka),” where, in a groove that recalls the heyday of G-funk, he sang, “And it was all good 'til ICE started rolling through the hood,” alongside stories of drug deals and crooked cops. The song's video apparently got him his first YouTube strike. Then, this week, following the protests against ICE in Los Angeles that led to President Trump sending in the National Guard, and ICE's ongoing sweeps at court hearings and on college campuses in San Antonio, he dropped a snippet of new song “Burn It Down” on his Instagram account. “Say they coming for us, they can't take us all,” he says, fired up, over a gloomy piano riff. It's not a protest anthem, just a moment of rage and confusion that comes from watching your hometown get torn apart.

One evening, earlier this week, I had a FaceTime conversation with HOODLUM. He smoked and spoke candidly while kids played in the background. We chatted about Texas rap, the effect ICE has had on San Antonio, and his role as a marquee rapper from a city that doesn't have too many, especially in a social media climate where information is buried by algorithms looking to push and normalize the ultra-conservative political agendas of Silicon Valley and the Trump administration.

HOODLUM: Houston is more mixed. In my neighborhood, there's only, like, one other Mexican family. Everyone else is white, Black, Arab, or Asian. Where I'm from on the southwest side of San Antonio, it was either Black or Mexican. It's small and big at the same time, and everyone is really together.

Not really, but there was some. There was this guy named J.Randle. There was King Kyle Lee and Liveola. Sometimes Chamillionaire would come down from Houston and go to the flea markets on the southside, sign people, and throw them on CDs. But it was never a big scene; it was always on the backs of Houston.

Some, but my first CDs were probably OutKast's Southernplayalistic and that one AZ album [Doe or Die]. I always wanted to go to New York. I liked 2Pac. Wayne. Bankroll Fresh. A lot of Latin music, too. I liked stuff with a lot of samples. I always wanted to sample stuff like Curtis Mayfield, the Isley Brothers, and Sunny Ozuna.

Probably Frank Sinatra, “Jesus Is a Rock.” There's this one part that I feel like me and John [aka producer bigtexjohnny] could make really dark, turn it into some “I Feel Like Dying” type shit.

Z-Ro, because of the melodies and beat choices. He would rap on fuckin' Sade or whatever. Devin the Dude, I'd always listen to his Greatest Hits (Screwed). He's the one person I really want on my next album.

At first, it kind of just happened and I started just pushing it even further. But I was really into Wayne and I just started trying to drag my voice out as long as possible over all these Curtis Mayfield samples or whatever.

One of my favorite Waynes is when he rapped on “Dear Summer,” or the era when he was really into New York. That's part of why I liked New York so much.

It's just all I knew. I didn't know anything outside of San Antonio until my music started blowing up and, all of a sudden, I was in, like, Europe and shit, Norwegian kids rapping my lyrics, tripping me the fuck out. I'm just documenting my life, and people don't always pick everything up because I'm rapping so slow, but, if you catch it, I'll be saying some shit. Like “Brown in Amerikka,” I wrote that years ago just because they [ICE] would just be in the neighborhood everyday from the morning 'til 4 o'clock. We would know not to answer the door.

At first, not really, because it was never something I did intentionally. I would just be writing what's going on in my head. Like, I remember we couldn't even have holidays—Thanksgiving, Christmas, July 4th—because those are the days they would come gather up your whole family. It was just fucked up.

I liked how Wayne did it when Katrina hit. Like “Georgia… Bush” isn't just rapping your ear off about it the whole time. It's still a Wayne song. So now whenever I do get into politics, I make sure that it still sounds like my songs.

It's always felt like everyone has looked at us Chicanos as less than, and we never cared, but it's weird now. You feel it now. It could be a white person, a Chinese person, a Black person, even though in San Antonio the Black people and Mexicans have always been together. It's the internet and this Trump shit. Everyone is feeling bolder about it. Like, bro, what are we doing? They're hunting kids.

Yeah, they're getting money to capture kids. It's kinda been this way since the beginning, though. My dad is 73; I heard the stories of when it was cool for the Navy men to come and take girls and cut their hair and rape your girlfriend. In high school, I would get paid to help bring kids to their families, and they would be so grateful to make it. All of this gets swept under the rug, like when I rapped, “Kids askin' mom, like, ‘Is Trump gon' take you?'” that shit is really happening.

Yeah, they're taking good people, bro. Like, the part at the beginning of “Brown in Amerikka,” that happened in San Antonio. A bunch of people in a 18-wheeler just tryna come here for a better life and the cartel left them there and they all suffocated and died. And they're going harder at certain people.

It's fucked up, man. And they're really tryin' to divide us. Online, they're accounts telling Black people to not stand with us, but this is about all of us. Like, when those protests happened a few years ago, the Mexicans that knew it was the right thing to do were there.

I think it's good. I don't know if the government would try all that military shit in San Antonio; we're really the majority. They would have to take everybody. But you never fucking know; they're close to the majority in L.A., too. Right now, they still try to keep it under the radar; they're real sneaky about it.

It could 'cause people are finally tired of it. I'll see an old Mexican man and he'll never ever tell you everything he's done in his life. But I just know he's worked his ass off. All these families worked their ass off. No one ever told them thank you for helping keep this country alive. They never asked for any credit and this is what they get. Speaking out more is good.

I don't know; I would share it even if I wasn't a rapper. I don't even know if people really even want to hear that shit from us.

Nobody wants to hear disturbing shit all the time. Life's really hard, bro. But sometimes you need it to fuel the fire.

Honestly, what they're doing in L.A. Every person actually standing up and saying something. There's no other way. Because no one is going to see you if you don't make yourself seen.

7.9

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Matador

Reviewed:

June 13, 2025

Kai Slater, the 20-year-old guitarist and co-vocalist of rising post-punk band Lifeguard, edits and produces a zine called Hallogallo. Named after a song by Krautrock pioneers Neu! and inspired by punk and mod revival zines from the '80s, it is painstakingly handmade, detailing and in turn fueling a brilliant young DIY art-punk scene in Chicago that's generated bands like Horsegirl, Friko, and Post Office Winter. Lifeguard's debut album Ripped and Torn—itself named after an early and influential British punk zine—is curious and exciting in all the same ways as Hallogallo. Though its medium and methods might be familiar, the album is made with such intensity and conviction that it feels essential: This is the rare modern album that makes indie rock sound life-changingly important.

The thrills emerge suddenly and don't let up. “It Will Get Worse” begins with a lazy guitar and haymaker cymbal crashes that could easily have been borrowed from the last album by young post-punk prodigies to feel this vital, Parquet Courts' Light Up Gold. But the pace changes on a dime and races forwards, propelled by Isaac Lowenstein's skittish drums and Asher Case's devastatingly simple bassline. Slater's guitar is a serrated blade, top-end and atonal, but he pulls back the moment it's called for, switching to sliding octaves like a spindly young Tom DeLonge. He sings “no one around here” over and over again, a mysterious but simple lyric that sticks to the song like freshly gored chewing gum. Halfway through he eschews lyrics entirely and replaces them with la-la-las, demonstrating a refreshing and well-earned confidence in a three-note melody.

It would be easy for a band like Lifeguard, particularly one so young, to fall into noise for noise's sake, hammering the same atonality to mask a lack of imagination. Instead, they focus on their hooks, which often appear from nowhere. The shifty monotone of “Like You'll Lose” stutters into a surprisingly mournful-sounding chorus, while the harder-edged “France And” breaks into a refrain consisting of two notes and three individual words: “Oh, oh/I am, I am.”

In fact, a theme throughout the album is how good both Slater and Case are at singing “oh” sounds, either as part of a word or just on its own. Slater's voice is higher and raspier, better suited to the power pop he channels and the music he makes alone as Sharp Pins; Case's deeper, icier voice is directly influenced by the '80s new wave bands he loves. But they both pronounce “oh” with a cultivated nonchalance that bursts through the compression on the mics. It ties them to the history of this music—evidence of pop and punk having gone back and forth across the Atlantic countless times over the past 50 years. But it's also evidence of a truth Lifeguard seem to understand on an elemental level: There's no need to clutter up a mix or overwrite a song when you can make a vowel sound that good on its own.

An encyclopedia's worth of reference points has already been lobbed at Lifeguard's music, and, thumbing through Hallogallo and reading interviews with the band members, it's clear they've not stumbled on their sound by accident. But there are so many ideas coming together on Ripped and Torn that it reads more like a Rorschach test than a bibliography. “Under Your Reach,” for example, opens with a descending dub bass that calls to mind UK sound system culture of the '70s and '80s. But over the past couple of years, the members of Lifeguard have been bonding over a shared love of British dance-punk revival and new rave. That bassline and the shouty, open hi-hat syncopations of “How To Say Deisar” will sound instantly familiar to anyone who heard Klaxons around the time the members of Lifeguard were born.

Ripped and Torn could have been a lot longer than this half-hour; the tracklist originally revolved around a spliced-together 12-minute song inspired by British experimentalists This Heat and Ladio Bolocko. Instead they mete out bursts of noise across three short interludes, acrid little palate cleansers. That in itself shows impressive restraint and an understanding of dynamics that very few bands, no matter how old or experienced, ever come to. So while Lifeguard can sound reckless, atonal, and jagged, they're smart enough not to follow those impulses to the point of self-indulgence. Ripped and Torn is the sound of a band making music with the care and attention of a kid standing over a Risograph, printing up the interviews his friends have typed up for their zine, leaving fingerprints on every page.

Kim Gordon has shared a reworked version of “Bye Bye,” the lead single from 2024's The Collective, that's now a protest song against President Donald J. Trump. The new version, dubbed “Bye Bye 25!,” swaps the original lyrics—Gordon's packing list for a trip—for words that the current administration has flagged and used to cancel grant projects, research proposals, and more. Check out the song's music video, co-directed by Gordon and Vice Cooler, below.

“[Producer and collaborator] Justin Raisen had this idea to redo ‘Bye Bye' starting at the end of the song,” explained Gordon. “When I was thinking of lyric ideas, it occurred to me to use words taken from a site that had all the words that Trump has essentially banned, meaning any grant or piece of a project or proposal for research that includes any of those words would be immediately disregarded or ‘cancelled.' I guess Trump does believe in cancel culture, because he is literally trying to cancel culture.”

The new track arrives ahead of the “No Kings” protests that are expected to happen nationwide on Saturday, June 14. Proceeds from the sale of both “Bye Bye 25!” and its promotional T-shirt will be donated to reproductive rights nonprofit Noise for Now. Among the words rattled off in the song are “female,” “climate change,” “Hispanic,” “women,” “mental health,” and “immigrants.” Organizations that have been affected so far by the president's administrative orders and policies include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and NASA, among others.

Both “Bye Bye” and The Collective were nominated for Grammy Awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those nods marked the first time Gordon was ever in the running for a Grammy, as neither she nor Sonic Youth were ever nominated prior. Late last year, The Collective got a digital deluxe edition, featuring the additional tracks: “ECRP” and “Bangin' on the Freeway.”

Kanye West showed up to Sean Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial in New York on Friday morning and walked through security with Combs' youngest son, Christian “King” Combs.


	Wearing an all-white denim ensemble and dark sunglasses, Combs traveled light as he passed through the checkpoint. (His wife, Bianca Censori was not with him.) Inside the courthouse, he was greeted by Combs' attorney, Xavier Donaldson, and Charlucci Finney, Combs' close friend and self-proclaimed godbrother who has attended each day of the trial.


	Combs did not attempt to enter the main courtroom where Combs sat with his team of lawyers, but was quietly led to an overflow room on the 23rd floor, a floor below the typical room where members of the public and extra members of the press watch the courtroom's happenings on a large screen.


	A nonchalant West stood and watched from a screen as Combs' former personal assistant Jonathan Perez testified about the “King Nights” he organized for Combs, before eager spectators flocked to the floor. Shortly after, West motioned he was ready to leave to Christian and he swiftly left the Manhattan courthouse within an hour of his surprise arrival. 

	











	On Friday, a source confirmed to Rolling Stone that court staff discussed the possibility of West's arrival the day before. Both days, West was not on the official list of Combs' close family and associates who get reserved seating in the main courtroom. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	West is one of the few remaining celebrities to voice strong support for Combs amid the music mogul's trial, now in its fifth week. West, who now goes by Ye, previously recorded a jail call with Combs and featured portions in his recent song, “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine.”

	











	“This shit is wicked, wicked, wicked. So you be careful,” Combs said in video of the jail call obtained by The Shade Room. Combs thanked West for acting like a “big brother father figure” to Christian while Combs was in custody. Combs described feeling like he was “left for dead,” with “only one person coming to do anything” to support him.

	“I'm Puff Daddy in jail. This shit is fucking sad as a motherfucker,” Combs said.


	West's appearance at the courthouse in lower Manhattan followed a day after Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as Victim-2 in his indictment, finished her six days on the witness stand. The woman, testifying under the pseudonym “Jane,” said Combs once confronted her in June 2024 over a trip she took to Las Vegas in January 2024 with an unidentified rapper and his wife or girlfriend. Jane testified that during the trip, which was to celebrate the the birthday of the “music icon's” wife or girlfriend, she briefly ended up in a hotel with the couple and several other people, watching a male escort the couple used having sex with a woman.


	Jane said the Las Vegas trip came up months later in June following a prolonged fight with Combs, who allegedly busted down several doors in her house, punched her, and “forced” her into a freak-off that night. Jane said the same male escort who she saw in Las Vegas arrived to join them, leading to disclosure of what happened on the trip. 


	“How could you go to another man's freak-off?” Combs allegedly demanded in June 2024 as the escort waited in another room, according to Jane's testimony. The ex-girlfriend told Combs she inadvertently ended up in the hotel room that night five months earlier and only witnessed what was happening before leaving the birthday afterparty after about 20 minutes.


	Combs, 55, was arrested in September and has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy. If convicted as charged, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.

	On Friday, jurors heard from two more witnesses, including Perez, who was granted immunity before answering questions on the stand. He testified that he worked for Combs between December 2021 and September 2024, when Combs was first arrested.


	Perez said his direct supervisor was Combs' former chief of staff, Kristina Khorram. He confirmed Combs was in a relationship with Jane during his tenure, calling her a “companion.” Perez said part of his job was setting up hotel rooms for Combs' alleged freak-offs, which he knew as “king nights.” Prosecutors showed him messages he exchanged with Khorram and another assistant. In one exchange, Perez said he was heading to a sex store to purchase something for Jane to wear. In another thread from May 2023, another assistant said they “slipped & fell twice” while cleaning up a room after an alleged freak-off. 

	











	Jane and Combs' former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura both previously testified that Combs wanted them dressed in lingerie and drenched in baby oil during their marathon sex sessions with male escorts that Combs would stage-direct, videotape, and watch while masturbating.


	Perez said he accidentally came across such a video during his tenure. He testified that a videotape of Jane and an unknown male engaging in sexual activity while Combs was seen watching in the background was on a staff iPad and quickly alerted Combs and Khorram. A seemingly concerned Combs said he wanted to launch an investigation into how it wound up on the device, although Perez said he was unsure if any investigation actually took place.

	Six months later, in January 2023, Perez said Khorram cornered him about the video, making him break down “step-by-step” how he discovered the recording and who he told afterwards. In audio of the conversation played to the court, Khorram said “an outside person” had brought up the recording and she needed to know how they found out. Perez said he was unaware that the lengthy conversation had been recorded.


	In prior testimony Friday, a special agent with Homeland Security testified that 200 bottles of baby oil and 900 bottles of personal lubricant were found in Combs' Los Angeles mansion during a raid last March.

	Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers swarmed Southern California in concentrated raids of undocumented citizens that are still ongoing. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Los Angeles (and in solidarity nationwide), giving President Donald Trump an excuse to send National Guard troops last weekend and move to deploy Marines to L.A.. 


	Trump baselessly implied the protesters are “paid insurrectionists” during a press conference where he revealed he told California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that “He's doing a bad job, causing a lot of death and a lot of potential death. If we didn't send out the National Guard — and last time, we gave him a little additional help — Los Angeles would be burning right now.” (No one has died during the L.A. protests.) 


	Newsom has said the “chaotic” sweeps “to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,” and that, “Donald Trump's chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America's economy.” On June 10, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass (D) instituted an 8 p.m. curfew in downtown L.A.

Rolling Stone spoke with several on-the-ground Angelenos, who dispute the notion that L.A.'s “on fire” or being overrun by vandals. 


	Adrianne Shropshire is the board chair of the grassroots organization Community Coalition. She says the Trump administration and allied politicians are spewing propaganda that inflames tension between citizens and law enforcement. 

	











	“When you have federal national leaders from this administration talking about arresting our mayor, arresting our governor, when you have the president himself using the kind of rhetoric describing a reality that is nothing like what is happening on the ground right now, it just increases the tension,” she says. “Nothing here that they're doing is about de-escalation. It is all about escalating a confrontation with the people of Los Angeles.”

	Shropshire spoke at a June 9 rally for David Huerta, the president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) California, who was arrested during a June 6 ICE raid in downtown L.A. and charged with a felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer (he's since been released on $50,000 bail). She also attended a prayer vigil on June 10, noting that both events were “peaceful.” From her vantage point, “People [wanted] to simply show up and say, ‘I do not consent. This is wrong. And my presence here is a demonstration of my right to protest.'”


	The same mentality spurred 33-year-old L.A. native Victor Ulloa, aka L.A. media personality Rosecrans Vic, to participate in a demonstration in downtown L.A. on Sunday. “I'm not even sure what my politics are right now, but I just know that I don't stand for families being torn apart and destroyed,” Ulloa tells Rolling Stone. 


	On Sunday, Ulloa walked in a demonstration in downtown L.A., which initially took place without commotion. He saw cops on the roof of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, including Hispanic officers, staring down at them. “I was like, ‘Are they observing in a “We support you” way or “I remember some of your faces” way?' I couldn't really call it, to be honest, but we were staring back at each other,” he says. 


	When Ulloa passed Temple and Los Angeles Street, he saw protesters blocking traffic on the nearby Highway 101, and a “line of cops” pushing back against them; that's when violence ensued. 


	One man was “shoeless,” “knocked out cold,” and being “dragged” away by officers, and another man in a Mexico shirt was arrested as well, Ulloa recalls. Then, he says, officers began shooting rubber pellets at protesters. “You start to see that stuff happen and it's like, ‘Oh, shit, it's going down now,'” he says.

	Shortly after he headed home, he saw viral footage of citizens being tear-gassed and a police car lit aflame in the area where he had been peacefully protesting 20 minutes earlier. While Trump's administration has framed these moments as evidence of Southern California being on the verge of destruction, Ulloa says that clash happened in a specific area, and it was “business as usual” on the other side of downtown L.A. — the BET Experience was taking place there before the Monday BET Awards showcase. “All of L.A. was not on fire. It wasn't all shut down,” he clarifies.

	











	Since last week in California, ICE has conducted a series of aggressive workplace raids and courthouse arrests. The ICE campaign began after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller reportedly instructed agency officials not to bother trying to target gang members or violent criminals, and instead “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens,” including by going to Home Depot or 7-Eleven. 


	Ulloa, a first-generation Mexican-American, says he's never seen ICE raids on the scale that they've taken place over the past week, and even though he and his family are American citizens, he is worried about them, especially his young son, being accosted by law enforcement who don't know that. 


	Last Friday, the Department of Homeland Security announced, “Today, ICE officers and agents alongside partner law enforcement agencies, executed four ​federal search warrants at three location in central Los Angeles.” The department claimed to have apprehended “approximately 44 people” in the initial raids. 


	After rampant anti-ICE protests began that night, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth federalized and sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles and announced they would deploy 700 Marines there, too. While the National Guard is ostensibly there to protect federal buildings, Hegseth posted a photo on social media showing troops standing guard as ICE carried out an arrest.


	Newsom filed an emergency motion blocking the deployment. Yesterday, a federal judge ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to the governor, but an appeals court quickly put that order on hold. An appeal hearing will be held on June 17. 


	On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security published a press release titled, “ICE Captures Worst of the Worst Illegal Alien Criminals in Los Angeles Including Murderers, Sex Offenders, and Other Violent Criminals,” which contained mugshots of various undocumented citizens they detained. 


	In the statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, “These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets. Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.” 


	But the raids aren't about apprehending sex offenders; they're affecting everyday Angelenos like a Mexican mother of three who spoke to us under the alias Sofia. 

	











	Through a translator, the undocumented woman tells Rolling Stone that the “traumatizing” threat of ICE raids has her South Central community feeling like they're living in de facto lockdown. 


	“Stress levels have increased,” she conveys. “There's a lot of individuals who are not going to work because they fear deportation. It's not just about, ‘What if I get deported? I need to go to work, how am I going to pay my rent and my bills?' but, ‘Why are we being surrounded as if we're criminals?' Sofia has been concerned that her husband, who works at different L.A.-based sites every day, could be detained while out providing for his family. And the anxiety has extended to her children. 


	“A few days ago I was at the clinic when my son called me to ask me where I was. He sounded extremely worried, wondering if I was going to be OK because there were ICE raids in the area where I normally commute,” she says. “Instead of my children being able to be at school fully present, they are concerned about my well-being, and that's not how things should be. We are honorable, hardworking individuals with dreams, goals, and aspirations for a better life and a better future.” 


	Shropshire says that the Community Coalition is organizing mutual aid for Angelenos like Sofia to ensure their basic needs are met. Sofia also lauded the efforts of L.A. nonprofit Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE), which has provided her aid and taught her community how to “make use of their voice so that they could empower their friends, family, and neighbors, and together be able to come together as one.”


	The ICE raids continued into Thursday. Shropshire believes that the “show of force” isn't just a concern for Hispanic communities, but all of L.A. For that reason, she says a “mosaic” of people of all identities have been present at the protests, marching in anti-ICE solidarity. Contrary to rampant social media discourse relegating immigration to a Latino issue, she clarifies that ICE's predation affects immigrants in every community, including Black ones.


	“We're talking about African immigrants, we're talking about Caribbean immigrants, we're talking about Afro-Latinos,” she says. “There's no distinction between a Black American and a Black immigrant. How do you know if I'm Haitian? If I'm Belizean? There's nothing that says that ‘I am a citizen' or ‘I'm not a citizen.' So if you have unmarked vans rolling up in your neighborhood and you are a Black Angeleno, you are going to be concerned … it's a continuum of the kind of escalation and unnecessary policing of our communities that Black Angelenos have seen for decades.”

	Fox 5 DC has confirmed that Trump is preparing to deploy ICE special response teams in Northern Virginia (right outside Washington, D.C.), New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Seattle; Shropshire notes that the latter four cities, as well as Washington D.C., have Black Democrat mayors. “When we think about this being a test case, it's important that folks in those cities also get prepared,” she says, imploring citizens to “get their members of Congress and their senators to push back on what is happening.”


	Shropshire is unequivocal that what ICE is doing should be challenged by all citizens. “I think that people are really, really clear that this is a moral moment in America,” she says. “It is a moral moment in Los Angeles. This is about: Who are we as Americans? Who are we as Angelenos? Who are the better angels, and how do we pull them out in this moment to say, ‘This is not who we intend to be as a country. This is not who we intend to be as a city.'”

	If anyone needed further evidence that Kendrick Lamar eviscerated Drake in their feud, look no further than the response Lamar received while performing in Drake's hometown of Toronto this week. He and SZA brought their Grand National Tour to Rogers Centre on Thursday night for the first of two shows in the Canadian city.


	The June 12th show was Lamar's first time performing in Toronto since the onset of the feud last year. While fans speculated whether or not he would further comment on Drake, their song battle or more, Lamar avoided saying anything further on the status of their beef. Instead, he let his chart-topping, Grammy-winning diss song “Not Like Us” speak for itself and serve as his victory lap.

Some of his more hardcore local fans in “The 6ix” plotted an “OVO Takeover” at the stadium during the shows this week, where they plan to play Drake's music outside of the venue from the time gates open until the show ends.

	A federal judge issued an order to block Donald Trump from deploying California National Guard troops to crack down on Los Angeles protests or to stand guard over his immigration raids. 


	Ruling Thursday night, United States District Judge Charles Breyer found that “an injunction restraining the president's use of military force in Los Angeles is in the public interest” and ordered Trump to return control of thousands of National Guard troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom. 


	The injunction came in response to a California lawsuit claiming Trump is violating bedrock American law and the constitution. However, the president's commitment of 700 Marines to the streets of L.A. is apparently unaffected.The ruling was met by an emergency appeal by the Trump administration to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals, which has now stayed the lower court's injunction until at least June 17.


	The back-and-forth court battle over Trump's troop deployments poses a thorny question: Can the president of the United States really unleash the military on U.S citizens?




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Here's what you need to know:

	











	Trump, an authoritarian, has long dreamed of using the military to counter his domestic opposition. The pretext for Trump's move is unrest following protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. ICE agents have been making provocative arrests and detentions of community members in Los Angeles, including of garment workers downtown and day laborers at an area Home Depot. 


	These protests were largely peaceful, but in several locations, devolved into skirmishes between agitators on one side and cops, sheriff's deputies, and/or paramilitary federal agents on the other. The unrest had largely calmed over the weekend, until Trump  decided to federalize units of the California National Guard and send them to the streets of L.A.

	











	Trump mobilized as many as 4,000 members of the California National Guard along with 700 Marines to deploy in Los Angeles. The military described the National Guard's mission as “protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area.”


	The Posse Comitatus Act stands as America's legal guarantee against military occupation.

	Like so much of American history, passage of the Posse Comitatus Act is tarnished by racism. This law dates from the late 1870s. It was born out of backlash to Reconstruction in the South after the Civil War, at a time when former Confederates bridled under occupation by federal troops. These forces, for example, ensured access to the ballot box by Black voters. 


	The act's passage barred the Army from being deployed in a domestic law enforcement capacity; it effectively ended Reconstruction and ushered in decades of Jim Crow segregation in the South. 


	Over time, the law's restriction on the standing military being deployed inside the United States became bedrock U.S. law and a marker of state sovereignty. It is seen as a vital check on authoritarian abuses by a U.S. president, and it allows the military to focus on defeating foreign adversaries, leaving policework to cops. The act has been updated periodically, including as recently as 2021 to clarify that its restrictions apply even to the Space Force.


	(The phrase “Posse Comitatus” itself is Latin for “power of the county” and has a complicated legacy dating back to English common law.)

	National Guard forces are usually under the control of state governors. They have long played a role in responding to state-level natural disasters and public unrest. Under state control, National Guard forces are not restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. 


	State-ordered National Guard deployments have also been controversial. In one of the darkest episodes in recent American history, National Guard troops, called up by the Governor of Ohio to crack down on protesters at Kent State in 1970, opened fire on anti-war activists, killing four and injuring nine.


	To federalize the National Guard, as Trump did this over the weekend, the president invoked an authority established in Title 10 of the federal code. Under that provision, the National Guard may be pressed into federal service under one of three conditions: 

	











	In any of these cases, the president “may call into federal service” the requisite National Guard forces to “repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws.” Invocation of this provision has little case history; Richard Nixon used it to call in the National Guard to deliver mail during a postal strike in 1970.


	But in all cases, the statute states, orders to the National Guard “shall be issued through the governors of the states” — appearing to require agreement between the president and the governor, which does not exist in this case.


	The state of California sued in federal court in San Francisco to block Trump's National Guard deployment as “unlawful,” insisting his Title 10 authority is a nonstarter in the case of the Los Angeles protests. 


	“To put it bluntly, there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles,” the lawsuit states. It describes instead common “civil unrest” that should be handled by “state and local authorities.” The lawsuit underscores that Gov. Newsom was not a party to Trump's decision to federalize the National Guard: “The governor never issued such an order or gave consent.”California is making the case that troops under Trump's command are already unlawfully integrated into a policing function. “Military forces are pervasively intertwined with civilian law enforcement activities,” the latest update to suit argues. “Armed troops are working side by side with ICE agents in conducting arrests and raids in the streets, homes, and workplaces of Los Angeles.”In the court of public opinion, the state is highlighting past comments by Trump and members of his cabinet to argue that administration officials know what they're doing is illegal. A post on the governor's website, calls back to Trump's comments during the 2020 federal incursion into downtown Portland, Oregon. “We have to go by the laws,” Trump said at the time. “We can't call in the National Guard, unless we are requested by a governor.”


	Likewise Kristi Noem, Trump's Homeland Security Secretary, said in 2024 as governor of South Dakota that a president seizing control of National Guard forces would be an unacceptable affront: “If Joe Biden federalizes the National Guard,” she said, “that would be a direct attack on states' rights.”


	In deciding to impose an injunction, Judge Breyer wrote that California had “shown a likelihood of prevailing” on their argument that Trump's federalization of the National Guard was “not in fact not lawful, both exceeding the scope of his authority and violating the Tenth Amendment.” (The judge leaned hard on the that amendment which reserves many powers for the states: “It is well-established that the police power is one of the quintessential powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment,” he wrote.)


	Breyer recognized that the Trump administration has an ““interest in protecting federal agents and property” but insisted that the “the citizens of Los Angeles face a greater harm from the continued unlawful militarization of their city.” He added that the state faces harm of being deprived of “thousands of National Guard members to fight fires, combat the fentanyl trade, and perform other critical functions.” 


	The judge underscored as well that that Trump's troop deployment threatens to “chill legitimate First Amendment expression.” He wrote that he was “troubled” by the administration's stance that “protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.”

	











	The temporary injunction forbids Trump from calling up the National Guard and directs Trump to return control over these forces to Newsom.


	The ruling by the district judge was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which quickly stayed the injunction Thursday, pending a hearing Tuesday, June 17.


	It is unclear what authority Trump has invoked to deploy active duty Marines to Los Angeles. A statement by U.S. Northern Command says the Marines' mission is to “seamlessly integrate with the Title 10 forces” — i.e. the National Guard troops.


	The state of California lawsuit claims the Marine mobilization is a violation of Posse Comitatus. (It also argued that using federalized National Guard troops as military police violates that act.)The suit reads, in part: “The Marine Corps' deployment for law enforcement purposes is… unlawful. For more than a century, the Posse Comitatus Act has expressly prohibited the use of the active duty armed forces and federalized national guard for civilian law enforcement.” 


	The judge in San Francisco did not make any ruling as to the Posse Comitatus Act arguments “at this early moment in the litigation,” explaining that both parties would soon have an opportunity to make their arguments in court.


	The nativist Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller has been posting incessantly on X about the unrest in Los Angeles as an “insurrection.” Trump has also called protesters “insurrectionists.”This over-the-top rhetoric has dangerous implications. 


	The president has a trump card he can play if he seeks to expand this foray into martial law. That is the Insurrection Act. This law gives the president authority to side-step the restrictions of Posse Comitatus and to direct active duty military to suppress insurrection, domestic violence, and even “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages.” 


	The act was pieced together from 1792 to 1871, and the liberal Brennan Center for Justice describes it as so “poorly” crafted and “bafflingly broad” as to “leave virtually everything up to the discretion of the president.”

	











	The law is contradictory. Some provisions require the participation of the governor and/or legislature in the target state. Other parts give the president sole decision-making power. 


	The Insurrection Act has been used both ways. It was famously invoked by President Dwight Eisenhower to enforce desegregation in the South after the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Its most recent use was in Los Angeles in 1992, by President George H.W. Bush, during the Rodney King riots — a move requested by the state. Lyndon B. Johnson was the last president to invoke it against the wishes of a governor, sending in troops to protect Civil Rights marchers in segregationist Alabama in 1965.


	Trump has been coy so far about his intentions, saying of the act from the Oval Office this week: “If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see.”

	Under Trump, any invocation of the Insurrection Act would mark a dangerous step on a path toward dictatorship. In theory, the law only empowers the president to use federal military might to support local law enforcement, or ensure that the constitutional rights of citizens are defended, not to implement martial law. 


	In practice, Trump was given near-kingly authorities last year by the Supreme Court in its immunity decision that shields the president from criminal prosecution. His administration has threatened to arrest Gov. Newsom, and even handcuffed one of the state's U.S. Senators, Alex Padilla, when he attempted to ask Noem a question during a press conference, during which the Homeland Security secretary proclaimed that the federal government was on a mission to “liberate” Los Angeles, from the “socialist” leadership of its mayor and governor.Trump does not see himself bound by any precedent or legal norm. And he is plainly not grounded in reality, rather in delusions of grandeur. In posts on Truth Social, Trump has written of his militarization as an effort to “liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion.” On Wednesday he doubled down, adding: “If our troops didn't go into Los Angeles, it would be burning to the ground right now.”

	Stop us if you've heard this one before: A mother loves her daughter. The younger woman has issues, ranging from a bad boyfriend to substance-abuse problems. You'd never think it would happen to your kid — but it could! Still, only a fool would underestimate the strength of a mom's love. When the blowback from this problem child's dodgy associations threatens to wreck her life, the everymatriarch steps in. She will stop at nothing to protect her offspring. 


	For decades, we called them “maternal dramas.” Then, starting in the mid 1990s — scholars and scientists carbon-date the tipping point to somewhere around the broadcast of Mother, May I Sleep With Danger? — we began folding them into the category simply known as “Lifetime Channel movies.” Yes, this basic cable network's stable of straight-outta-tabloid thrillers from that golden era ran the full gamut of a suburbanite's nightmares, from husbands with double lives to black-market baby trafficking. But the teens-in-peril subgenre was especially popular among their viewers, and for a while, stories about mothers going into rescue mode became synonymous with the channel's programming. (See: this parody.)

	











	Don't let the premium branding, patina of prestige or star power fool you: Echo Valley, a real handwringer of a momma-paranoia melodrama, may open with the familiar Apple TV+ logo. (It drops on the streaming service on June 13th, after something slightly resembling a week-long theatrical run.) But this sizzling slab of cinema du grilled cheese from British director Michael Pearce (Beast, Encounter) is nothing if not a vintage Lifetime Channel joint, one which just happens to feature an Oscar winner and one of the biggest A-listers under the age of 30. It takes its name from the region of southern Pennsylvania where Julianne Moore runs a horse ranch, yet this purposefully trashy movie could easily have been called “A Child's Cry for Help,” or “Terror in the Family,” or “For My Daughter's Honor, Plus Also She's a Drug Addict and Now There's a Psychopath Living in My House.”

	To be fair, unlike so many of those Lifetime heroines, you couldn't say that the protagonist's life looked perfect from the outside. Despite the fact that she owns a gorgeous spread and lives in a lovely, large country home, Kate Garretson (Moore) has been in a state of depression for a while. Her wife, Patty (Kristina Valada-Viars), died nine months ago, and Kate is barely able to get out of bed in the morning. Friends, like her kindly neighbor Leslie (Fiona Shaw), are worried about her mental health. The estate is starting to drift into serious disrepair. She's been regularly canceling the horseriding lessons she gives the area's wealthy kids, and is forced to hit up her ex-husband (Kyle MacLachlan) for money. All of these problems pale in comparison, however, to what's going on with Kate's kid.


	From the second that Claire (Sydney Sweeney) shows up at the house, asking to use her mom's iPad to check her texts — her phone got thrown in a river by her dickhead boyfriend (Edmund Donovan), but don't worry, it's all totally kickin' back no big deal, everything's super cool! — you can hear the warning sirens going off. The twentysomething has a slightly twitchy demeanor and facility for emotional manipulation that immediately telegraphs she's a drug addict. You can also tell that this isn't a new problem, and that Kate and Claire have done this particular tango a dozen or so times before.

	Except this time… remember how that aforementioned boyfriend tossed her phone into the water? She retaliated by dumping some of his stuff off a bridge. And well, there was a bag of narcotics in his jacket, and now that's gone, and this makes the couple's dealer, Jackie (Domhnall Gleason, so skeezy you can smell him), pretty angry. Like, beating up Claire in her mom's front yard kind of mad. Soon, Kate understands how much serious trouble her daughter is in. Luckily for Claire, her mom is the sort that will stop at nothing to make sure her baby girl is safe. By “stop at nothing,” we naturally mean disposing of a corpse, arson, and stopping Jackie from siphoning what's left of her liquid assets. The things we do for our kids!

We can confirm the “trashy” part, and you know that any time you give Moore the chance to either weep, become enraged or, in a best case scenario, do both at once, it's going to reap some sort of dividends. (As for Sweeney, her supporting role is just north of being a glorified cameo. All apologies, Sydney stans and Euphoria fans.) Viewers can sense a third-act turn coming, and when it does, it's so overly complicated, ludicrous and unbelievable that you'll find yourself left with a palm-sized imprint on your face for days afterward. You might hear “are you fucking kidding me?!” echoing throughout your living room several times before the end credits roll. You also might be better off bypassing this faux-Lifetime Channel throwback altogether and seeing if Mother, May I Sleep With Danger? is still streaming anywhere.

Are you passionate about abandoned villages and eerie sites with decaying buildings? Photographers are often intrigued by deserted places that were once bustling (or had big plans to be), such as Hashima Island in Japan, once a hub for the rich, and Burj Al Babas, in Turkey, a Disney-style ghost town with 587 abandoned castles. If you're a fan of ghost towns and abandoned structures, there's a lesser-known village worth adding to your bucket list of places to take your camera for uncanny photographs.

A remote Texas town is facing serious trouble thanks to an abandoned oil well. Let's explore what this means for the people living there.

The so-called UFO village in Taiwan has attracted photography lovers for years thanks to its unique houses, most of which have been abandoned for decades. Here's everything you should know about this bizarre yet eerily cool site, from its construction in the 1970s to the many paranormal stories associated with it and valuable tips for those planning to visit.

Located in the remote region of Sanzhi in Taiwan, the UFO village, also known as Sanzhi Pod City, Wanli UFO Village, and Sanzhi UFO Houses, is an abandoned site that was created to attract plenty of tourists but never achieved success. Built in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this vacation resort was meant to attract visitors thanks to its unique houses designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, which are shaped like flying saucers and cubes. Visitors could rent one of these futuristic ocean-front accommodations and spend their vacations enjoying all sorts of water activities. However, the project failed.

Today, it is a mostly abandoned village with some of the most unusual buildings in the world. Lovers of bizarre buildings, such as the famous Kunsthofpassage's singing wall in Dresden, will surely fall in love with these houses shaped like UFOs, cubes, and hovering saucers. The accommodations featured bright colors and were intended to look as if made of a single piece.

Unfortunately, Taiwan's UFO village project was never truly successful. Several reasons contributed to its downfall. First and foremost, the high costs continued to increase compared to initial expectations. On top of this, there seem to have been legal and bureaucratic problems concerning permits and ownership rights of the land.

Additionally, the local economy was also hit hard in the 80s. While the real estate industry in Taiwan was booming in the early 1970s, the country faced a massive energy crisis in the following decade, which negatively impacted construction work. Work on the vacation resorts resumed again in 1989 and 2010. However, the project was eventually abandoned due to a lack of funds.

Some of the reasons contributing to Wanli UFO Village's failure include a lack of media coverage, poorly chosen materials, including fiberglass and plastic that could not properly insulate the houses and didn't last over time, and the high costs to rent out the accommodations. However, another reason contributed significantly to the site's downfall: eerie stories about paranormal activity.

It's no secret that many Taiwanese people are highly superstitious. Unfortunately, the UFO village soon became known among locals due to strange stories and eerie accidents. People reported strange lights and noises, which, although difficult to verify, surely didn't help advertise the site.

Some spooky stories also circulated about the proximity of the village to an alleged Dutch cemetery. Many Taiwanese believe that when graves are not properly taken care of, the deceased buried there may come back, causing great misfortune. Rumors spread about body parts found during construction work, builders falling ill, and unexplained accidents. None of these have ever been verified, yet they all contribute to the failure of the vacation resort.

While the UFO village was never truly used for its initial purpose, it remains relatively popular among photographers and those passionate about eerie and spooky places. If you plan to head to Taiwan soon and would love to check out this place, below is some helpful information.

Remember that while the village is considered mostly abandoned, some people still live here, so respect their privacy and avoid taking pictures of their homes.

The UFO village is located at Feicui Bay (翡翠灣) in the northern town of Wanli (萬里). You can reach this site by car or public transportation, such as a bus or train. Google Maps tends to be reliable in the country, but you can always ask locals for extra help. Once you're in the village, you can make the most of your trip to this extraordinary site by enjoying your afternoon at the beach, trying activities such as paragliding and surfing, or visiting the nearby Yehliu Geopark, known for its unique geological formations.

Looking for a ghost town with a fascinating history? The ex-capital of this U.S. state may be the perfect option. 

Abandoned villages have always fascinated tourists with their spooky and eerie vibes. There are plenty of options, from Vulture City, a ghost town in Arizona, to Terlingua, Texas, one of the USA's most underrated ghost towns. If you're a fan of these places and are about to head to Taiwan, add UFO Village to your bucket list!

A scientist has sent a chilling warning to the world after the discovery of a UFO adorned with mysterious and bizarre inscriptions, suggesting a monumental shift in our understanding of extraterrestrial life.

Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and researcher into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), the modern term for UFO sightings, suggests that humanity may soon have to confront the reality of alien existence and enter a new phase of comprehension.

This comes amid increasing revelations about supposed encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Notably, an odd, spherical object found in Colombia is thought by some scientists to be a fragment of UFO technology.

The artifact features symbols reminiscent of ancient scripts, such as runes, and scientists have employed artificial intelligence in attempts to decode the cryptic writing. Dr. Mossbridge shared with Fox News: ""We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything.""

She warns that the potential unveiling of extraterrestrial beings could plunge numerous individuals and societies into turmoil as they grapple with the reality of their presence, reports the Daily Star.

""One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true,"" she remarked, noting that it leads to confusion when something arises that doesn't ""fit our model of the world.""

Mossbridge herself remains doubtful about the sphere being a genuine UFO, despite public conviction. ""The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project,"" she commented.

""If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us.""

Conversely, Dr. Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere, found no evidence suggesting human creation.

""It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin,"" he stated.

According to Mail Online, his research team utilized AI to help decode the design, interpreting it as: ""The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness - individual consciousness.""

They suggested: ""We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth-especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline.""

In a similar vein, three-fingered alien mummies discovered in 2017 in the Nazca desert have been puzzling scientists, who now believe they are approximately 1,200 years old.

Often brushed off as merely an art project, experts now believe that the ""alien"" mummies of Peru may have been victims of murder. Scientists studying the enigmatic three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have made new discoveries they assert confirm the specimens are '100% real'.

The injuries they sustained suggest they met violent ends - possibly even assassinated. Unearthed in 2017 in Peru's Nazca desert, the mummies were unveiled to the world in Mexico two years later as potential fossilized remains of extraterrestrials not part of Earth's evolutionary chain.

Supernatural fans have flocked to social media in their droves after Netflix shared a post relating to the hit series.

The official Netflix account posted a GIF of Dean Winchester (played by Jensen Ackles) covered in blood on X (formerly Twitter), with a quoted post which read: “you're a sick f*** if you think people covered in blood is hot [sic].”

The post sent fans into a frenzy as they all demanded the same thing.

One person commented under the post: “UK netflix does not have supernatural!! Why? [sic].”

A second posted: “Supernatural isn't even ON Netflix in Germany but amazon prime instead.”

Someone else echoed similar sentiments: “Supernatural isn't even on Netflix in my country (Bulgaria) and I think you should fix that immediately.”

A fourth disgruntled fan said: “You are so right. Now, what about your announcement to put Supernatural in your playlist in my country (Romania)? I think you should do it.”

Another person noted: “supernatural ain't even ur show bro [sic].”

Others were furious at Supernatural being removed from Netflix after having access to it on the streamer.

One irate Supernatural fan wrote: “@netflix Can you give us one good reason why you are discontinuing Supernatural on your service?

“It still has and always will have a rabid following, with new fans popping up all the time. Many cannot afford the DVDs. I don't understand your reasoning. It HAS to make money.”

“Yeah...so don't take Supernatural away from us,” said a second.

A third wrote: “aren't you removing spn from netflix in the us... [sic].”

A fourth fan was left confused and wrote about the post: “Netflix does this mean you're planning on keeping SPN in the US and not letting it leave by the end of the year?! [sic].”

Supernatural is currently available to watch on Prime Video in the UK for those with a membership. For a fee, you can also watch the fantasy series on Apple TV+ or YouTube.

Netflix US currently has Supernatural available on its service, but is scheduled to leave the platform on December 18, according to CBR.

The CW series Supernatural aired for a whopping 15 seasons between 2005 and 2020, following monster hunter brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester.

Over the course of the series, the pair hunted down all manner of supernatural beings from demons and ghosts to monsters.

During its time on screens, Supernatural became the longest-running American live-action fantasy TV show.

But it seems nothing compares to the success of Supernatural with subsequent spin-offs failing to hit the mark with fans.

Supernatural: Bloodlines got a backdoor pilot in 2013 but failed to be picked up by the network.

In 2017, Wayward Sisters was launched as a backdoor pilot in season 13 of Supernatural but failed to be picked up.

Later, there was Supernatural's prequel series The Winchesters, focusing on Sam and Dean's parents and narrated by Ackles. Sadly, this was cancelled after one season.

Supernatural is available to watch on Netflix until December 18

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Brooklyn Beckham to 'heal family rift' but psychic says 'things will get worse first'","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/brooklyn-beckham-heal-family-rift-35385905","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 09:46:00 GMT","

Brooklyn Beckham has been feuding with his family over reports that he's fell out with him famous parents, David and Victoria.

After the news of him reportedly not planning to attend his dad's pending knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list.

However, a source close to Brooklyn denied this and told Daily Star: ""This seems to be another deliberate attempt to misrepresent the truth, and it only serves to distract from this honor being bestowed on Brooklyn's father.""

But what does tarot say about the family's relationship at the moment? We spoke to celebrity pyschic Inbaal Honigman in collaboration with https://www.casino.org/uk/ about her hot take on the family family feud.

The expert revealed: ""The Beckham clan's relationship is represented by the Ace of Wands card, a fiery Tarot card that describes how everyone in the family has a strong personality and a lot to say for themselves.

""They're in the midst of the situation right now, emotions are running high, and therefore any action, by any family member, will just throw fuel on the fire.

""At this stage, and for the next four weeks, the Tarot predicts that things can only intensify and deteriorate before they start to recover.

""Blocking each other's socials, sending public barbed comments, and taking their sibling rivalry to the max, the coming month brings no relief from this strife.""

What does the future have in store for the Beckham family relationship? She explained: ""This situation is not a permanent one. There are hurt feelings all over, and some things are going to get worse before they get better.

""The 3 of Swords Tarot card, nicknamed 'Sorrow', reveals that the fiery emotions are rooted in pain. In such a big family, it's easy for a sibling to feel left out, and instead of sharing and communicating, they choose to act out. Brooklyn isolated, and in his hurt, and most likely did some things that caused the rift to escalate.

""There's no hate there, nobody dislikes anybody.

""They'll make amends, and a healing will start, but not in the next few weeks.

""Starting August, says the 'Strength' Tarot card, someone from outside the family will start to bring people closer together. The Beckhams will heal.""

But the ultimate question this week is will Brooklyn attend his father's knighthood ceremony? ""Unfortunately, the Tarot doesn't show Brooklyn at his father's knighthood ceremony.

""One of the brothers is trying to advocate for this presently. Brooklyn's younger siblings are reaching out and asking him to turn up to the event, because those photos are for life, and the siblings know how sad it would make David, if he's not able to share his special moment with all his children. But his firstborn won't be able to make it that day.""

Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz's relationship is reportedly being prioritised over his relationship with his family, and some fans have been wondering if they marriage will last the tension.

We asked Inbaal if Brooklyn and Nicola's relationship will last the stress, and she said: ""Both Brooklyn and Nicola are very much committed to their relationship, and are both 'family first' type of people. They value stability and love sharing their lives with each other.

""The 3 of Wands Tarot card indicates that temptation is never too far away, but their family values and mutual love keep them together.

""Nicola herself would like to see Brooklyn reconcile with his family.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Two Bombshell Kraken Predictions & One Conspiracy Theory","https://www.davyjoneslockerroom.com/two-bombshell-kraken-predictions-one-conspiracy-theory/","Fri, 13 Jun 2025 13:45:00 GMT","

As the 2024-25 NHL season draws to a close, a young hockey fan's fancy naturally turns to the wildest rumors, predictions, and even random conspiracy theories they can find. As with all speculation, these Seattle Kraken thoughts are presented without guarantee and may turn out not to be worth the pixels used to write them.

Anthony Trudeau of Daily Faceoff hated the hiring of new Kraken coach Lane Lambert. “Picking the franchise's third bench boss would be an early indication of whether (Seattle) wanted to win now or commit to building through the draft.

“Somehow, it did neither. Lane Lambert was a longtime Barry Trotz assistant who quickly undid most of his mentor's good work in just over a year-and-a-half in charge of the New York Islanders. Lambert wasn't ready for the big chair, and the team's vaunted defensive structure crumbled under his leadership.”

Unduly harsh, no? The Islanders were 5th in the NHL in goals-against per game during Lambert's one full season behind the bench. Their GAPG actually dropped slightly compared to Trotz's last season. But there was one more bomb to drop. “Put on your tin foil hat, and this hire feels a lot like a cheap placeholder by an organization that's very clearly grooming assistant Jessica Campbell for a historic promotion.”

Glenn Probability Index: <1%. Even tin foil can't protect this absurdity from the barest scrutiny. So the Kraken front office is rooting for their new coaching hire to fail? Not bloody likely.

As to Campbell, she's acquitted herself well as Dan Bylsma's assistant, both at the AHL and NHL levels. But she's not nearly ready to be an NHL head coach – yet. Being female is immaterial. Being nine days shy of her 33rd birthday is material. Campbell hasn't had time to gain the seasoning needed to accept a bench boss assignment. It would be patently unfair to ask her to try, without even one minor league head coaching gig on her resume.

Here's hoping “NHL Head Coach Jessica Campbell” is a sentence we'll get to write some day, in Seattle or elsewhere – and by that time, that other women have followed in her footsteps.

At Dobber Hockey, Alex MacLean foresees a change in the Seattle net. “I expect (Philipp) Grubauer to be bought out or traded by the Kraken. They could give an opportunity to Victor Ostman. (Ostman split time between AHL Coachella Valley and ECHL Kansas City last season, appearing in one game for the Kraken.) 

“The more likely option sees them bring in someone like (Alexandar) Georgiev to spell Daccord for 25 games, or maybe even more if a more goalie-friendly environment helps Georgiev regain some of his form from a few years ago.” 

Glenn Probability Index: 25%. The first half of the parlay is more likely. Grubauer apologists worry about the salary cap implications of a buyout, and still hold out hope he can recover his pre-Kraken form. But doing the same thing for a fifth consecutive season and expecting a different result is the definition of, well, you know.

Replacing one fading former Avalanche goalie with another is far less certain. Georgiev, who finished last season with San Jose, is a pending free agent. Whoever the Kraken hire as their new goalie coach may play a role on the direction they go for a backup.

A brokerage firm many years ago ran ads claiming, “When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen.” We didn't know at the time that the E.F. stood for Elliotte Friedman. These days, when the premiere hockey insider talks, everyone in the NHL listens.

Discussing the use of offer sheets, here's what Friedman said on his 32 Thoughts podcast. “I think Seattle is really eager to take a step this year. They have a lot of cap room, a lot of draft picks. Seattle has the flexibility to go down that route.”

Glenn Probability Index: 50%. Far be it from me to pooh-pooh anything suggested by E.F. The Kraken have a new general manager in Jason Botterill; he knows both ownership and fans want bold moves to improve the club right away, and offer sheets are one weapon in his arsenal.

Three reasons why Botterill might not go that route. First, teams have seven days to match any offer, so there's no guarantee a restricted free agent who signs will be an RFA you get. Second, signing players via offer sheets isn't viewed by league GMs as playing nice. That matters, because Botterill has to deal on a regular basis with his 31 counterparts. Third, the sliding scale of compensation for acquiring a player via offer sheet can run as dear as four 1st round draft picks.

As of June 13, 82 NHL players are eligible to be signed to offer sheets starting July 1. These include Kraken RFAs Kaapo Kakko, Ryker Evans and Tye Kartye. (View the entire list here.) 

At this point, don't get too attached to any names on that list. Speculation that this or that player would be a “perfect fit” for the Kraken is clickbait. Many of those 82, including the Seattle trio, in the next three weeks will accept new contracts from their current teams, removing them from offer sheet eligibility.

I appreciate those of you who read my stories, and those who take the time to comment.

Recently, different opinions were expressed about the balance between my Kraken columns and those covering the expansion PWHL Seattle franchise. That ‘s a fair topic, so here's a story breakdown. What you're reading now is my 48th published story since the end of the Kraken's 2024-25 season. .

38 Kraken stories in two months with long stretches of little news, and zero games – and without resorting to clickbait – is pretty good! In writing about Seattle's new women's professional team, I haven't slighted my Kraken coverage in any way, at any time. 

I feel strongly that coverage drives interest just as much as interest should dictate coverage. Women's pro hockey, in its infancy here, richly deserves its share of hockey media oxygen – just as we all want the sport we love to have more of a presence in the greater sports media universe.

If you have ideas for topics you'd like me to cover, let me know in the comments, and I'll do my best to accommodate you. Thanks.

Conspiracy theories and Boeing safety concerns resurface.

A devastating air crash occurred on Thursday afternoon when Air India Flight AI 171 (Boeing 787 Dreamliner), crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The plane, which was bound for London, crashed into a medical college complex, killing 241 people and leaving only one survivor.

The flight was carrying 242 passengers and crew members, including 168 Indians, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese citizens and one Canadian. Former Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was among the passengers.

While investigations are underway, the exact cause of the crash remains unknown. Boeing and Air India have both extended condolences to the families of the victims.

Speculation grows online, blaming Pakistan, Khalistanis and more

In the absence of confirmed information, social media has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Various users have suggested sabotage, pointing fingers at Pakistan's intelligence agency, Kashmiri separatists, and pro-Khalistani groups, especially in the wake of a recent terror attack in Pahalgam.

Some theories have tried to link the crash to the Indian Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Canada for the G7 summit, implying that extremist elements may have targeted the flight because of past threats made against Air India. Others have speculated about the lone survivor's actions, suggesting he might have interfered with the emergency door, although aviation professionals have ruled out this possibility due to pressurisation safeguards.

Additionally, questions have been raised about Air India's use of a Turkish firm for maintaining its wide-body aircraft, though no evidence has surfaced linking this to the crash.

Boeing's Dreamliner under scrutiny again

Thursday's tragedy has brought fresh attention to Boeing's long-standing manufacturing and safety issues, particularly involving its 787 Dreamliner.

Although Boeing maintained a strong safety record for 14 years, recent incidents have raised serious concerns. In December 2023, a Boeing 737-800 crash in South Korea killed 179 of the 181 people on board. The aircraft burst into flames after hitting a concrete wall at the end of a runway.

The 787 Dreamliner series, used in the Ahmedabad crash, has faced a number of technical problems since 2013. That year, the entire fleet was grounded due to incidents of battery fires. Later, Boeing had to suspend all Dreamliner deliveries for almost two years because of manufacturing defects, including structural gaps and use of non-compliant materials.

Whistleblower's suspicious death revives doubts

Concerns about Boeing's practices grew even further earlier this year when John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's South Carolina plant, was found dead shortly after testifying in a legal case involving Boeing. Barnett had previously warned that some safety procedures were being overlooked and that defective parts were being installed.

Although authorities ruled his death a suicide and found no signs of foul play, many social media users have connected his death to Boeing's internal issues. His earlier warnings about poor production quality have resurfaced in public discussions following Thursday's crash.

Boeing's past crashes and legal troubles

Boeing is still recovering from the fallout of two previous disasters involving its 737 Max aircraft, which crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. In May this year, the company reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice that allowed it to avoid criminal prosecution for those incidents.

Despite Boeing's assurances that it has corrected past errors, critics continue to question the company's approach to safety and quality control.

Investigation begins

A detailed investigation into the Ahmedabad crash has begun, with Indian authorities expected to work alongside international aviation experts. Boeing has confirmed that it will cooperate fully with the inquiry.

Public is advised to avoid spreading misinformation or jumping to conclusions. Baseless theories can hamper the investigation and add to the trauma experienced by the victims' families.

The Colorado River basin has lost a Lake Mead's worth of water in the last 20 years — and scientists say we're passing a ""critical point"" where pumping groundwater will become too expensive. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Stark new satellite data reveal that the Colorado River basin has lost huge amounts of groundwater over the last few decades, with some research suggesting that this groundwater could run out by the end of the century.

But is that really the case? And if so, what could be done to prevent that happening?

While groundwater is being depleted, it's unlikely the water will ever run out completely. However, continued drainage of the basin could make the water table fall so far it's basically inaccessible, experts told Live Science.

The Colorado River snakes through seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and California) and two Mexican states (Baja California and Sonora). Some 40 million people, including those in Phoenix and Las Vegas, depend on it for their water needs. But as supplies of this surface water have dried up over the past two decades — reaching record lows — more and more people have been pumping groundwater from far below the surface, mainly for agricultural use.

To get a better idea of how much groundwater is being extracted, Jay Famiglietti, director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative at Arizona State University, and his colleagues turned to data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite missions. These satellites track changes in Earth's gravity field to measure shifts in the amount of water above and below the ground, and when combined with data on snowpack, surface water and soil moisture, this information can allow scientists to estimate how much groundwater has been depleted.

The researchers estimate that since 2003, pumping from wells has drained about 28 million acre feet (34 cubic kilometers) of groundwater from the Colorado River Basin. This is akin to the capacity of Lake Mead, the largest U.S. reservoir, which sits behind the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. The study was published May 27 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

About three-quarters of the groundwater depletion is happening in the river's lower basin, largely in Arizona, where water is pumped from desert aquifers to irrigate farmland, according to the study. In these largely rural areas, farms aren't usually hooked up to municipal water systems, and instead rely on water pumped from wells on the property. Because the wells are private, there is often no municipal, county- or state-level measurement of how much water they are drawing up.

Famiglietti and his colleagues estimate that annual groundwater losses in the basin averaged more than 1.2 million acre-feet (1.5 cubic kilometers) and if the trend continues, it could lead to water shortages and limit food production.

""We're passing a critical point where it is getting more and more expensive to go deeper into the aquifer, and the water quality is dropping,"" Famiglietti said.

Dozens of wells have dried up in the area. Collapsing aquifers have caused land subsidence, and created fissures.

Ryan Mitchell, chief hydrologist at the Arizona Department of Water Resources, who was not involved in the new study, told Live Science that he welcomes the paper's findings and is concerned about the levels of estimated groundwater depletion in some areas. However, he takes issue with a sentence in the paper that suggests that an Arizona Department of Water Resources simulation indicated ""complete depletion by the end of the century."" He said the simulations don't indicate complete depletion of groundwater at all, let alone by the end of the century.

The groundwater won't run out, he said, but neither GRACE satellite data nor measurements of water use will tell us exactly how much water is left in aquifers.

""It's almost like it's an unknowable number in the same way that if someone said how many grains of sand are on the beach, you could make some assumptions and make some guesses but you can never actually know the exact amount of sand grains,"" Mitchell said.

Bridget Scanlon, a research professor in the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, and her team recently used GRACE data to assess the implications of drought in the Colorado River basin. They saw similar patterns, finding that there was a period of high groundwater use as irrigation expanded between the 1940s and 1970s. Then, the amount of groundwater recovered during a wet period in the early 1980s and 1990s.

But since then, the picture has differed depending on how areas are managed. In ""active management areas,"" or areas where water use is monitored, the levels of groundwater have stayed roughly level. In these areas, groundwater is pumped, but based on how much is drawn up, management agencies can divert more water to the depleted area to filter back down to the aquifer.

In unmanaged areas, no agency tracks how much groundwater is pumped, so agencies don't know when to replenish the aquifers. High extraction in unmanaged areas is driving the overall draining of groundwater, Scanlon told Live Science.

""We can't manage what we don't measure,"" he said. ""It shows that if you have rules in place and you keep a close eye on water use and you actively manage it, you can kind of keep it at a sustainable level.""

One thing is for sure: Waiting for precipitation to end the drought and replenish aquifers won't be enough. Studies imply that the flow of the Colorado River is expected to continue to decline thanks to climate-linked reductions in snowfall and rainfall — and that means there will be less surface water to use, less water to recharge aquifers and more reason to extract water from underground.



Drilling deeper wells is one solution, but there are problems with that, Famiglietti said. At some point, it will cost millions of dollars for a deep-enough well that will have high energy costs to pump water, he said, and that water is likely to require treatment.

""As you go deeper into the groundwater, that water has been sitting around in contact with soil and rocks for a long time, so it's dissolving solids and salts,"" Famiglietti said. This can lead to water that is salty, poor-tasting or that contains high levels of arsenic. ""And because these are often refilled by agricultural water, they [are] collecting higher concentrations of pesticides and fertilizer,"" Famiglietti said.

Another option is to reduce water use, by, for example, changing what is farmed, to shift from water-intensive crops like alfalfa, Famiglietti said. ""It can't be business as usual,"" he said. ""We have to think about what our priorities are for water use.""

""I'm as concerned about tomorrow as I am about 100 years from now,"" he said. “It's very clear that we need more groundwater management in the lower basin, which is mostly in Arizona. Only 18% by area is managed, and there's an awful lot of depletion happening outside of those areas.""

Every expert Live Science talked with suggested that extending the area covered by active water management areas would help — first, by keeping tabs on what is being used where, and then trying to replace what is used.

As part of such schemes, water could be brought in from elsewhere, Scanlon said. For example, this already happens when San Antonio buys water and pipes it from East Texas more than 150 miles (240 kilometers) away.

—Over half of the world's largest lakes and reservoirs are losing water

""Groundwater is a finite resource,"" Mitchell said. ""You need to be able to let it recharge naturally or be able to replenish what you use. He said Scanlon's research shows that ""we're doing OK in the active management areas, and we're not doing so hot in the areas where we don't have some kind of framework in place.""

A legislative bill to extend the areas that are actively managed has been proposed in Arizona, but similar ones have stalled after facing opposition. Those opposed say restricting water doesn't protect existing agricultural use of groundwater and will stifle economic growth. Some also object to water use being decided at the state level when they would prefer smaller water districts with locally elected directors.

""We're not trying to spy on anyone; we just want to know what the water uses are,"" Mitchell said. ""But it's hard because trust in governments is at an all-time low. We are trying to put things in place to help the mom-and-pop domestic wells — those folks who can't afford to drill 2,000-foot [600 meters] wells because it's just too deep and too expensive. We want to try to help them protect their water resources.""

Follow:


            Shortly before sunrise in Iran on Friday, Israel launched the first strikes of its operation against the regime's nuclear program.
    


            That operation, called “Rising Lion,” had two prongs: Heavy airstrikes against at least one of Iran's enrichment sites, and more targeted strikes in Tehran to decapitate the regime's military leadership. It aimed to halt what Israel said was Tehran's rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons.
    


            Israel's attack came after years of threats and days of heightened speculation – but without the United States' blessing. The Trump administration stressed that Israel acted unilaterally and that Washington was “not involved.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation would continue “for as many days as it takes” to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat. Tehran, which insists its nuclear program is peaceful, says it has “no option but to respond.”
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            Iran has not seen such a widespread assault in a single day since the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Israel targeted locations all across the capital city, Tehran, and around the country.
    


            The first explosions tore through Tehran at around 3.30 a.m. Friday (8 p.m. ET Thursday). Videos geolocated by CNN showed flames and smoke billowing from buildings across the city.
    


            Residents of Tehran were blindsided. Many did not expect Israel to strike so swiftly. “I didn't know what was happening. It was really scary,” a 17-year-old Iranian told CNN, requesting anonymity due to safety concerns.
    


            Shortly after explosions rocked Tehran, Israel also struck elsewhere in the country. Israel's military said it used jets to strike “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”
    


            An explosion was reported at Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Tehran.
    


            The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed that Natanz had been hit, but said it had not observed an increase in radiation levels in the area.
    


            Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, said other nuclear facilities in Iran – Isfahan, Bushehr and Fordow – were not impacted. The Fordow site is buried under a mountain, and is considered a much harder target for Israel.
    


            In a televised address, Netanyahu said Israel had taken action to “roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,” and said it would continue its operation for as long as it takes “to remove these threats.”
    


            Netanyahu claimed that Iran had in recent years produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine nuclear weapons.
    


            “Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year, it could be within a few months,” he said. “This is a clear and present danger to Israel's survival.”
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said it had destroyed Iran's ballistic missile launch sites and stockpiles.
    


            Several of the most important men in Iran's military and its nuclear program were killed in Israel's strikes.
    


            Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was the highest-profile of those killed.
    


            Israel also said it killed Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran's armed forces; Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC's air force.
    


            Iran retaliated almost immediately. The IDF said Tehran fired more than 100 drones toward Israel on Friday morning. But most appear to have been intercepted.
    


            Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian urged the Iranian people to remain unified and trust Iran's leadership.
    


            “The nation needs unity… more than ever,” he added.
    


            After a series of lethal and embarrassing Israeli blows against the Iranian regime, it is not clear how Tehran might attempt to exact retribution.
    


            Following previous Israeli attacks against Iran and its proxies in the region, Tehran fired back with huge salvos of ballistic missiles.
    


            The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington DC, said this time it was “possible that Israel somehow disrupted Iran's response by targeting Iran's ballistic missile launch sites and stockpiles.”
    


            The Trump administration – which has been pursuing a diplomatic path with Iran in recent weeks – sought to distance itself from Israel's attack.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel's actions were “unilateral.” Although Israel notified the US ahead of its strikes, Rubio said the US was “not involved” in the attack.
    


            “Our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” he added. Earlier this week, the US had made efforts to arrange the departure of non-essential personnel from various countries in the Middle East, leading to speculation that an Israeli attack on Iran could be imminent.
    


            US President Donald Trump urged Iran to agree to a new nuclear deal “before there is nothing left,” suggesting that follow-up Israeli attacks on the country would be “even more brutal.”
    


            Trump said he had given Iran “chance after chance” to make a deal. “JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
    


            Under a 2015 nuclear deal struck by former US President Barack Obama, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to drastically limit its number of centrifuges and cap uranium enrichment at levels far below those required to make weapons, in exchange for sanctions relief.
    


            But during his first term as president in 2018, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA, saying the “rotten structure” of the agreement was not enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. He ramped up sanctions on Iran and threatened to sanction any country that helped the regime to obtain nuclear weapons.
    


            In his second term, Trump has revived efforts to strike a new nuclear deal with Iran. Just hours before Israel's strikes, the president cautioned Israel against launching an attack while US-Iran talks are ongoing.
    


            “As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in because that would blow it. Might help it, actually, but also could blow it,” Trump said.

BRUSSELS, June 14. /TASS/. The United States has analyzed and combined Moscow and Kiev's proposals on peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian conflict, US Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg said.

""We came up to what we call ‘term sheets.' Term sheets are the outline, this is what it looks like,"" he said. ""And we took the Ukrainian term sheet. Then we got what's called the Russian term sheet, they call it memorandum, and we put them together. And we said: ""Okay, how can you melt these two documents together to get to an end state. And we are pretty comfortable right now. We know what it looks like. We know what an end state could look like, should look like. And if we can just get to that point, we think it's winnable. Winnable meaning you can get to a peace agreement, and that's where you really want to get to,"" Kellogg said during an event, organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

The special envoy was asked how this ""end state"" looks like.

""When we talk about it, the term sheet, we talk about <…> a comprehensive ceasefire,"" he said.

He added that he participated in numerous peace meetings, held in Jeddah, Riyadh, Paris, London and Istanbul.

The second round of resumed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was held in Istanbul on June 2. The meeting lasted just over an hour, and the delegations communicated in Russian. The parties exchanged documents with their views on various aspects of conflict resolution. Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, head of Moscow's delegation, said that Russia had submitted a two-part memorandum to Ukraine. According to him, the second part suggests several ways to implement a cease fire. He also said that Russia would unilaterally transfer the remains of 6,000 dead Ukrainian servicemen. Russia and Ukraine also agreed to carry out an ""all for all"" exchange of seriously ill prisoners of war and those under 25 years - at least 1,000 people on each side. Russia also suggested declaring a ceasefire for 2-3 days in some sectors of the front. Also, according to Medinsky, Ukraine handed over a list of 339 children who had lost contact with their parents. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, proposed to hold the next meeting between June 20 and 30.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Discordant US response as president says he was fully aware of plans for what Marco Rubio called a ‘unilateral action'

Middle East crisis – live updates

Donald Trump is walking a tightrope as he claims that he was fully aware of Israel's plans to launch massive airstrikes against Iran while continuing to distance the US from those strikes and deny Washington took any active role in the preparations.

The White House's messaging has shifted quickly from Marco Rubio's arms-length description of the Israeli attack as a “unilateral action”, to Trump claiming on Friday morning that he was fully in the loop on the operation and that it came at the end of a 60-day ultimatum he had given Iran to “make a deal” on its nuclear programme.

“Today is day 61,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I told [Iran] what to do, but they just couldn't get there.”

Trump's framing presents a good cop-bad cop dynamic of his approach with Benjamin Netanyahu, the embattled Israeli leader with whom he has a notoriously combative relationship. The US president has scrambled to now present the Israeli strikes, which he publicly claimed he did not want on Thursday, as a means of continuing his efforts to convince Iran to negotiate.

“They should now come to the table to make a deal before it's too late,” he said.

But the discordant US response from to the strikes, including Rubio's Thursday evening statement, a hasty evacuation of some US personnel from the region and ambiguity over whether the US provided intelligence or would actively take part in Israel's defence from a likely counterattack, has raised questions over whether Israel may have moved ahead of the Trump administration as a way to present Washington with a fait accompli.

“They made a bet on President Trump,” said Elliott Abrams, a former diplomat and senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, suggesting that Israel had pushed harder for strikes while the Trump administration had sought to maintain a diplomatic route. “The Israelis struck and then today Trump called it ‘excellent'.”

While Israel had clearly given the United States advanced warning of the strike, claims that it was fully coordinated in Israeli state media have been subject to speculation: was Trump actually on board or was he repositioning himself on Friday in order to present the strikes as part of a coherent strategy.

On Thursday, in remarks from the White House's East Room, Trump said that strikes on Israel could “blow up” his diplomatic efforts to negotiate with the Iranian leadership and said he “didn't want them going in”. He defended his decision to begin evacuating personnel because a strike “could well happen”.

“The US started evacuating voluntarily non-essential personnel on Wednesday, barely 24 hours ahead of time, not enough time to really get people out of harm's way,” said Rosemary Kelanic, the Middle East director for Defense Priorities, a thinktank that pushes for a more restrained US foreign policy. “So the question for me is what did the president know and when did he know it?”

On Friday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was not caught unaware by the strike: “Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.” And he indicated that he had been apprised of future Israeli plans, writing that the “next already planned attacks” would be “even more brutal”.

Senior Israeli officials also began to brief media that Trump had only pretended to oppose an Israeli attack and that they in fact had a “green light” for the attack. But Kelanic and others noted that Israel may be seeking a means to “entrap” the US into a war.

In either case, it is doubtful that Israel could have prepared the attack in the past week without US knowledge.

Officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies would have seen the preparations for the airstrike – involving more than 200 Israeli fighter jets striking more than 100 targets across Iran – and probably understood that Israel was planning a major attack against Tehran.

Late on Thursday, administration officials told Fox News that the US had replenished missiles for Israel's Iron Dome anti-air batteries in recent weeks in preparation for an expected counterattack.

And the US in recent weeks had deployed B-52 bombers to its airbase on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, where multiple B-2 bombers have also been stationed since late March. B-2s stationed at the base took part in airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen earlier this year, but the base would also serve as a launching point for airstrikes against Iran if the US were to join the conflict.

But there are other explanations for the resupply of anti-air missiles to Iron Dome, particularly following the unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles launched by Iran against Israel last year.

And the US could have employed those B-2s and B-52s to strike the Fordow uranium enrichment centre, which is located deep underground and was not apparently struck in Friday morning's strikes. Still intact, it represents an important element in Iran's nuclear program that was not eliminated – at least in the first round of the Israeli attacks.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Canada's main stock index declined on Friday, dragged down by losses in technology shares, as Israel's wide-scale strikes on Iran dampened global risk appetite.

The S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.5 per cent at 26,490.64 points.

Israel has warned that the strikes were the start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon. Iran has promised a harsh response.

However, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program, saying there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.

The downturn in the TSX was limited as investors shifted to safe-haven assets, boosting metal mining shares. The materials sector gained 0.6 per cent.

The energy sector rose 1.7 per cent to be the top gainer as the tensions in the Middle East sparked worries about supply disruptions, boosting crude prices.

“I don't think it's any surprise that Toronto Stock Exchange is going to hold up greater than New York, which is more based on technology or multinational corporations,” said Allan Small, senior investment advisor at Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.

“Gold and oil make up a big chunk of our market and anything commodities-based is relatively going to do well.”

The technology sector fell 1.5 per cent, while the heavyweight financial stocks were down nearly 1 per cent.

The benchmark index achieved a second consecutive record high on Thursday and appears poised to secure its third straight weekly gain, provided losses remain contained.

As of midmorning south of the border, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 659.45 points, or 1.52 per cent, to 42,313.10, the S&P 500 lost 60.38 points, or 1.00 per cent, to 5,984.88 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 227.71 points, or 1.16 per cent, to 19,435.01.

Oil prices surged nearly 7 per cent on fears the conflict could disrupt crude supply from the Middle East. U.S. energy stocks rose in tandem, with Exxon up 1.7 per cent.

Airline stocks dropped as fuel costs could surge if supply bottlenecks materialize. Delta Air Lines was down 3.7 per cent, United Airlines dropped 4.4 per cent, and American Airlines declined 4.7 per cent.

Defense stocks climbed, with Lockheed Martin, RTX Corporation, Northrop Grumman gaining between 2.2 per cent and 3.2 per cent.

“We have major domestic policy uncertainty and now on top of that, you have geopolitical unrest, which not only is impacting oil markets, but the broader risk premium,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management.

Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sub-sectors fell, with only energy stocks gaining 1.2 per cent. Financials declined the most, with a 2.1 per cent fall. Information technology lost 1.3 per cent, weighed down by Adobe's shares.

Adobe fell 6.6 per cent despite the Photoshop maker raising its full-year results forecast.

Most megacap and growth stocks declined. Nvidia was down 2.1 per cent, Apple fell 1.5 per cent and Amazon lost 1.3 per cent.

Visa shares hit an over four-week low and were last down 5.9 per cent.

U.S.-listed shares of gold miners rose tracking a rise in bullion prices. Newmont gained 2.2 per cent, while AngloGold Ashanti rose 2.1 per cent.

The S&P 500 remains 2.6 per cent below its record high reached earlier this year, following stellar monthly gains in May driven by upbeat corporate earnings and a softening in Trump's trade stance.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is about 3.8 per cent off its record closing high reached in December last year.

A tame consumer price report, softer-than-expected producer price data and largely unchanged initial jobless claims earlier this week helped calm investor jitters around tariff-driven price pressures. However, Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to keep rates unchanged at their meeting next week.

A University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment increased to 60.5 for June from the previous month, according to a preliminary estimate.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.88-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.4-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 70 new lows.

All eyes may have been on Harvey Weinstein as he awaited his fate on the 13th floor of Manhattan criminal court but it was even tenser behind the scenes.

The disgraced movie mogul, who was found guilty of one count of sexual assault on Wednesday but cleared of a second, had an outstanding rape charge collapse on Thursday as tensions in his jury reached breaking point.

There had been rumblings of discontent: reports of shouting, bullying – one juror is even said to have challenged another to a physical fight.

Judge Curtis Farber tried in vain to keep proceedings on track, insisting these were nothing more than the “normal tensions” which occur during the course of a trial, particularly one as high-profile as this.

Nobody can be quite sure what happened behind the closed doors of the jury room, except for the 12 members of the jury. But on Thursday, the foreman headed into court and refused to return to the deliberations.

For Weinstein, a fallen Hollywood titan, the drama could have challenged any of the hundreds of films he produced before he was toppled by the MeToo scandal.

Addressing the foreman's concerns, Arthur Aidala, acting for Weinstein, claimed he had never heard of a case where a “grown man who was in good physical shape” was “so intimidated” that he point-blank refused to go back to the jury room, calling it evidence of “gross juror misconduct”.

The first signs that something was amiss came on Friday, when one of the 12 asked to be removed from the case, aggrieved that a fellow juror was being treated in an “unfair and unjust” way by others.

“Playground stuff” was happening, with a member of the jury being shunned and spoken about behind their back, he said.

Judge Farber, rejecting the defence's request for a mistrial, said: “This is nothing other than normal tensions during heated deliberations.” Noting the juror who made the request was the youngest of the group, he suggested his age “makes him uncomfortable with conflict”.

When proceedings resumed on Monday, the foreman raised concerns that his peers were aggressively pushing others to change their mind, and straying beyond the specifics of Weinstein's charges.

“I feel like they are attacking, talking together, fighting together. I don't like it,” he said, according to a transcript of his conversation with Judge Faber and legal teams.

From there the tensions steadily ramped up, with the disgraced producer addressing the court on Wednesday after a fourth complaint from a juror, pleading: “This is not right for me… this is my life that's on the line.”

The same day, Judge Farber told the court there had been “some fighting in the jury room” and that at least one juror told another: “I'll meet you outside one day.”

“It's 12 people who don't know each other and are randomly thrown together, and there are so many variables,” Sabrina Shroff, a veteran New York defence lawyer, told The Telegraph.

“Race is a variable, sexuality is a variable, class is a variable. So you don't really know which one of these things is at play when they're deliberating.”

Lone holdouts could often end up feeling “bullied” by their peers, she said – particularly in a high-profile trial, which breeds suspicions they have one eye on a TV or book deal afterwards.

For now, the source of that conflict remains a matter of speculation, but John C Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, suggests it could stem from the fact that Weinstein was a major figure felled by the MeToo movement.

“This case falls on one of the leading fault lines in our society,” Prof Coffee said, arguing that society had shifted rightwards since Weinstein was first toppled from his Hollywood perch in 2017.

“Seeing this backsliding may enrage some women, or men who share a feminist view. Both sides may be trodding on the other's sensitivities” in the “packed-in, sweaty tension” of the jury room, he continued.

Bill Cosby, who was convicted of sexual assault before the decision was overturned in 2021, was another MeToo casualty.

The first attempt to secure his conviction in 2017 ultimately fell apart when the jury failed to reach a consensus, amid fractious scenes that threatened to spill over into violence.

According to ABC News, five sheriff's deputies were stationed outside the door of the jury room, and repeatedly barged in during arguments because they feared a brawl was taking place.

One male juror on the case, which was held in Pennsylvania, is said to have become so enraged that he punched a wall.

“I think he broke his pinky knuckle,” an juror who served alongside him said. “If we kept going, there was definitely going to be a fight.”

The tensions were reportedly exacerbated by the fact that jurors were crammed into a room so small they could not stretch their legs – a situation so frustrating that some would spontaneously burst into tears.

New York, where the Weinstein case was heard, works hard to keep its jurors fed, watered and content to limit disruptions, according to Ms Shroff.

“They get a snack, an 11am break and a 3pm break, and the court will send cookies or something like that,” she revealed.

“And if they don't, the jurors will send a note to the court saying that last week, yesterday, ‘we didn't get cookies'.”

After throwing out Weinstein's rape charge, Judge Farber said most of the jurors had denied they were riven by bullying and fighting.

“They all thought they were involved in a normal discourse, and they don't understand why the [foreman] bowed out,” he said.

In the end, the jury seems to have been so hopelessly at odds that they could not even agree on how divided they were.
