                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's flash crash could be followed by a 64% rally if historical data rings true again. Bitcoin returns after major downside catalysts have exceeded 64.6% since 2010, suggesting that the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East could be a BTC purchasing opportunity. Despite trading near all-time highs, Bitcoin's Puell Multiple remains in the discount zone, indicating institutional accumulation and undervalued market conditions. As the tensions culminated, oil prices rose by 5%, and historical data suggests the BTC dip could be a buying opportunity. Amid rising global tensions, Bitcoin's past performance during geopolitical crises offers a compelling investment case. Head of research at Bitwise Europe, André Dragosch, highlighted this potential in an X post, citing data from across the top 20 geopolitical risk events since 2010. The chart shows Bitcoin's geopolitical event performance on a logarithmic factor scale. This pattern suggests that the current dip could be a temporary market reaction, with historical precedent pointing to substantial gains in the weeks ahead. Blockstream CEO Adam Back reinforced this trend, countering gold advocate Peter Schiff's skepticism with data from 10 major events since 2020. Using Granger causality tests on Bitcoin price and geopolitical risk indexes from 2010-2019, the study identified bidirectional influences, indicating that Bitcoin not only reacts to geopolitical events but also serves as a stabilizing asset during global uncertainty. Related: Bitcoin mirrors 80% rally setup that preceded 2024 Israel-Iran conflict Data from CryptoQuant also suggests that Bitcoin is in buy territory. This rare divergence, intensified by the April 2024 halving's reduced block rewards, signals undervaluation and suggests the market is driven by institutional demand or tightening supply, not miner selling pressure. Historically, a Puell Multiple below 1.0 marks accumulation phases, indicating Bitcoin's current rally may be far from its euphoric peak. With most holders in profit, the risk of panic selling remains low, but it could change over the next few weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly said Wednesday (June 11) that the company's XRP cryptocurrency could account for 14% of the cross-border payment volume currently handled by SWIFT within five years. Noting that SWIFT handles messaging while banks handle liquidity, Garlinghouse said, “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” Seeking Alpha reported Friday (June 13). Enterprises are warming up to alternative cross-border money movement vehicles, including blockchain-based solutions that offer streamlined cross-border flows while freeing up capital previously trapped in correspondent accounts across multiple countries, PYMNTS reported in June 2024. These enterprises are doing so because cross-border payments are fraught with inefficiencies, high fees and delayed transactions, largely due to the ongoing limitations of traditional methods and legacy infrastructure. Blockchain technology offers transformative potential to address these issues by streamlining processes and reducing costs, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Can Blockchain Solve the Cross-Border Payments Puzzle?” The report found that by using distributed ledger technology to enable direct transactions without intermediaries, blockchain technology reduces costs and speeds up settlement times, with transactions potentially completed in seconds rather than days. On June 5, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is considering using stablecoins to transfer money among different countries because they can help reduce the cost of moving money. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market is slightly bouncing back from early Friday's jitters on escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. After slumping to the $102,600 mark, bitcoin BTC$105,226.34 rebounded to around $106,000 before fading lower in the U.S. afternoon hours with reports about a fresh wave of airstrikes targeting Iran. The top cryptocurrency was down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, changing hands at $105,200 and still less than 6% shy of its all-time high price. A notable exception is stablecoin issuer Circle (CIRCL), which is still benefiting from the windfall of its recent IPO; the stock is up 13% today, with news of retail giants Amazon and Walmart reportedly exploring stablecoins adding to the momentum. Traditional markets don't seem overwhelmingly concerned by the war. "Nice bounce thus far and lack of follow-through lower," well-followed crypto trader Skew said in a Friday X post. Market participants will likely remain cautious through the weekend with BTC tightly correlated with traditional markets amid heightened geopolitical risks, Skew added. On the longer timeframe, some analysts see risks of a deeper pullback. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen noted that BTC's drop below $106,000 translates to a failed breakout, and traders should wait for more favorable setups before rushing to buy the dip. He highlighted the $100,000-$101,000 zone as key support, warning that a break below could mark a return to the broader consolidation phase similar to last summer. John Glover, chief investment officer at bitcoin lender Ledn, argued that bitcoin entered a corrective phase from its record highs that could see the largest digital asset drop to $88,000-$93,000. He said the $90,000 level could offer a favorable entry for opportunistic investors before BTC resumes its uptrend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A strategic Bitcoin reserve is a step in the right direction for Pakistan, but only mass adoption will truly unlock the immense potential Bitcoin can offer. Pakistan's relationship with Bitcoin has been marked by inconsistency and confusion over the past few years. Initially, the country outright banned bitcoin trading in 2018, citing concerns over fraud, money laundering and lack of regulation. Eventually, citizens were allowed to hold bitcoin, though trading remained murky and unregulated. It is technically allowed, yet not fully embraced or regulated, reflecting the state's struggle to balance innovation with control. 🇵🇰 PAKISTAN TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE Honored to have had the Pakistan Minister Bilal  Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin Conference 🚀 pic.twitter.com/7WunP5fuZm This muddled relationship with Bitcoin seems to have turned a corner in recent weeks as Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas announced that the country is moving to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Ministry of Finance has also commissioned the establishment of an entirely new agency to oversee digital asset regulation which could lead to a less opaque legal framework around bitcoin ownership and usage in everyday transactions. Critics have argued that this is merely an attempt by Pakistan to cozy up to Trump in the aftermath of the recent skirmish with India. After all, Saqib did state that Pakistan was inspired by the Trump administration when he spoke at the recent Las Vegas Bitcoin conference. Others have asserted that Pakistan is merely seeking to build resistance to possible sanctions in the future over its support for terrorist groups. I believe that such a geopolitically focused critique overlooks a deeper economic reality that has been staring Pakistan in the face for many years. I wrote an article for a Pakistani newspaper about a year ago in which I argued that the country is uniquely situated, in economic terms, to take advantage of Bitcoin and unlock the benefits that come with adoption. These systemic issues have eroded citizens' faith in traditional financial systems, leaving many Pakistanis disillusioned and seeking alternative means to safeguard their wealth and economic autonomy. Permissionless transactions could also empower the beleaguered minorities who often struggle to achieve financial freedom. The announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as promises to introduce pro-Bitcoin regulation and a mining strategy, are steps in the right direction. These steps also point to a much broader, global shift in attitudes toward Bitcoin — especially in nations where hyperinflation is a daily reality and the banking system struggles to meet citizens' needs. However, real change will only come when Pakistan fully legalizes bitcoin as a digital currency and takes steps toward mass adoption. Only then will financial autonomy become an achievable goal for those living far away from the big cities where banks are based. It does not signal that a nation has adopted the digital currency as a means to overcome the obstacles imposed by fiat. Strategic national reserves also hoard bitcoin and bring it too close to the state, even though the digital currency was designed to be a hedge against state-controlled money. A strategic Bitcoin reserve is a step in the right direction for Pakistan, as it would be for any nation that suffers from hyperinflation. In my view, strategic reserves are not what bitcoin is all about, but let's hope this is merely the first step in a long and prosperous journey toward orange-pilling a nation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nobody Predicted Israel Would Strike Iran, But Bitcoin Is Still Not in Panic Mode: Analysis Is it time to panic for Bitcoin investors? The data currently doesn't support that view. Bitcoin dropped 4.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $104,343, while Ethereum crashed 8.2% to $2,552 as escalating Middle East tensions sparked a massive risk-off move across cryptocurrency markets. The selloff, which began during Asia trading hours on June 13, wiped out over $420 billion from the total crypto market cap and triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations. Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets indeed tumbled sharply. The pre-dawn airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities sent shockwaves through global financial markets, with cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt of the selling pressure as investors fled to traditional safe havens. The odds of such dramatic escalation seemed remote just days ago. And this is something markets don't like—not war, but uncertainty. Currently, on Myriad Markets—a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company Dastan—the odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal before the end of the week has dropped to just 4.7%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.66% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.17% as investors fled to traditional safe havens. Gold surged 1.8% to $3,445 per ounce, approaching its record high of $3,500.05, while Brent crude oil prices jumped as much as 9.21% during Asia hours before settling around 7% higher at $72.6 per barrel. The sharp moves in commodities reflected genuine supply concerns. Iran, as OPEC's third-largest producer, controls critical oil infrastructure, and any prolonged conflict could severely disrupt global energy markets. The crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures investors' appetite for these risk assets, retreated from 65 to 54, moving from "greed" to "neutral"—an arguably healthy reset rather than the extreme fear readings typically associated with major market bottoms. This measured shift in sentiment, combined with continued ETF inflows of $86.31 million into Bitcoin despite the price decline, suggests institutional conviction remains intact. Against this backdrop of panic in traditional markets, Bitcoin's 2.4% decline to $104,343 appears remarkably contained. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart sits at 47—down from overbought levels near 80 last week but still firmly in neutral territory. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of a trend regardless of direction, is now at 17, which indicates weak directional momentum. Bitcoin's Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, is even more telling. Bitcoin's 50-day EMA at $102,513 provided initial resistance on the bounce attempt, suggesting technical levels still matter—a sign that algorithmic trading rather than emotional panic is driving price action. Failure to break back above this level would target: $100,000 as psychological support, and $95,000 as visible support, based on the charts. Despite recording 19 consecutive days of ETF inflows, ETH couldn't maintain support above $2,700 as traders de-risked portfolios. The second-largest cryptocurrency's technical indicators paint a more bearish picture than Bitcoin's. Ethereum bulls, then, must defend the current $2,552 level to avoid a deeper correction. The token's breakdown from its ascending wedge pattern, combined with strong selling pressure, exemplifies how speculative positions unwind rapidly during times of uncertainty. And even with all that said, the chart still paints an overall bullish picture for Fartcoin, and meme coins tend to do weird things. As a general rule, though, you can expect meme coins and other altcoins to mirror Bitcoin's moves, but with a lot more volatility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum, the OG smart contract blockchain, is more than a decade old, but the intelligence in smart contracts has always been rather rudimentary. It works and, when carefully deployed, has created a lot of value. But what has long passed for “smart” in assets and contracts in the world of blockchain cannot compare with the accelerating intelligence of artificial intelligence systems. We're increasingly seeing that AI systems lack moats, and their performance can be dramatically improved over time in ever smaller computational footprints. This may not be great for AI model makers, but it is a bonanza for everyone else since it means that we can increasingly deploy intelligence to the most remote corners of the business ecosystem. Supply chain operations are an excellent example of where deploying intelligence can supercharge performance. Historically, most replenishment planning in retail stores is formula-driven. As stock falls below a required minimum, orders are placed. These formulas control minimums, maximums and economic order quantities. Sophisticated users are able to push extra stock for major promotions and events. It's basic stuff, but it scales up nicely since no retail chain can afford to have an inventory analyst work on each product every week in every location for a customized forecast and plan. Now do that for 31,000 offerings every week — the average number of items stocked in a U.S. grocery store. Pervasive intelligence requires quality data and it's all useless without the ability to action. The tamper-proof and universally synchronized nature of blockchain data means that we can build good outcomes on reliable information. And the smart contracts that reside on chain can be given the authority to do things like autonomously restock product based on AI-developed market plans. Information itself can know where it is most valuable — and ask to be paid for access. Individually each one of these is valuable, and together they can have an impressive multiplier effect. It's not just about avoiding running out of product; it's also about not spending on expediting logistics or having overstock sales. Profits that used to get lost at the margin can now be kept, all without raising prices. Getting to this future will not be quick or easy. It takes a long time for most firms to absorb technology and transform themselves. Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University, has similarly speculated that like early computers and electricity, the overall productivity takeoff for artificial intelligence will be relatively slow as firms and people take time to truly understand how to use it. What economists don't spend much time talking about, however, is that you don't have to be the average person or the average firm. Early leaders in e-commerce, cloud computing, desktop operating systems and mobile devices have held on to their market leading positions for decades. As global blockchain leader at the professional services firm EY, Paul Brody is responsible for driving initiatives and investments in blockchain technology across consulting, audit and tax business lines, including the build-out of the first EY global software-as-a-service platform, Blockchain.EY.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We all watched: most of us with slight disbelief, some even jumped in, when the NFT market exploded with profile pictures (PFPs) of apes, punks and pixel art. Multi-utility NFTs expand on the function of early NFT releases. NFTs are also being used as the user experience layer of Web3. Communities quickly tired of speculative assets that do little more than decorate a wallet or signal membership. They should unlock real value for the holder. The nascent NFTs generally offered three main features: Because NFTs use blockchain technology, this creates a tamper-proof record of who owns the asset. This ensures the provenance and authenticity of items. Yes, someone could copy/paste your JPEG, but only one Web3 wallet can demonstrate ownership. From digital art to collectibles, or, if backed by a solid audit layer, even real-world goods, can be verified, helping to combat counterfeiting and fraud. NFTs are often issued in limited quantities, introducing scarcity. By controlling supply, creators can make assets more desirable and potentially more valuable, similar to how limited-edition physical items are prized by collectors. From the outset, it was clear that NFT projects were focused on fostering active communities by offering holders exclusive benefits, such as access to special events, private groups, or unique experiences. This sense of belonging and direct engagement with creators or brands is a major draw for many NFT-as-JPEG enthusiasts. More on BlockchainDecentralized Apps (DApps): 16 Examples to Know For example, in December 2024, each holder was given 1.7 million PENGU tokens, which at peak resale value could be worth over $100,000 per NFT. What's particularly interesting is that when revenue share becomes part of the utility set, then NFTs start to look a lot more like shares. For example, NodeOps recently launched UNO, a utility NFT designed to unlock rewards, perks and access to decentralized compute infrastructure. This means that, should the cloud compute business continue to be revenue-positive, they will extract a revenue share every quarter. Furthermore, given that this is a multi-utility NFT, the holders get boosted incentives, future governance rights, and early access to integrations across partner protocols — those perks common to the old guard NFTs. This initiative is now closed, with the NFT no longer available to buy, but the community response was enthusiastic. Most importantly for NodeOps, fundraising by selling an NFT side-stepped having to publicly list a token in the troubled market conditions they faced (those being a 21 percent drop in the crypto market cap over the previous quarter. Utility NFTs are more than just functional tokens. They blur the line between front-end UX and back-end logic, acting as both identity, access, and reward mechanisms in one portable object. Utility NFTs are evolving into smart, user-centric interfaces — they're becoming the user experience layer of Web3. More on BlockchainIs Crypto Finally Headed in the Right Direction? Over the next year, I believe we'll see more and more projects releasing NFTs that offer real-world value, not just loyalty points and early access, but access to revenue. Utility is no longer a “nice to have.” It's the default expectation. More than that, I think the era of defining what “type” of utility an NFT offers may already be over: here's to a new era of the multi-utility NFT.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made a significant and surprising decision to publicly drop some crypto-related rule recommendations that were made when Gary Gensler was Chair. One of the rules that was thrown out was Exchange Act Rule 3b-16, which tried to modify the meaning of the word “exchange” to encompass a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as front-end interfaces, automated market makers, and even certain blockchain-based chat groups. Another proposal that was pulled back focused on crypto custody. It originally said that investment advisers had to employ “qualified custodians,” who are regular banks or other financial organizations. Critics stated that this restriction would have kept many crypto-native companies from offering custody services, which could have limited investor choice and innovation. These would have made it harder for investment firms and tech-driven platforms in the crypto area to follow the rules. These changes to the rules show that more people realize that the current regulatory framework, when applied to decentralized technology without discrimination, might hinder innovation and push crypto development to other countries. The Commission seems to be taking a more balanced approach since Gary Gensler left. This approach takes into account the distinctive structure and function of crypto technology. This includes a fresh focus on working together with people in the sector and the need to encourage growth within a framework that is both controlled and flexible. Instead of making broad guidelines that some said were not consistent with DeFi or blockchain innovation, the SEC is now showing that it is open to changing how it regulates. Many people are happy that these measures are being rolled back, but this doesn't mean that regulatory scrutiny is over. However, some are seeing this step as a promise to make more rules in the future that include input from the public, clearer rules, and techniques that are better suited to the nature of digital assets and decentralized networks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The legislation aims to regulate the roughly $238 billion stablecoin market, per CoinDesk data, creating a clearer framework for banks, companies and other entities to issue the digital currencies. The bill has bipartisan support, as well as criticism from both parties, making its fate in the Senate uncertain. Here's what to know about what's included in the bill and how it could impact investors — even those who don't hold crypto. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar, which makes it less volatile than other cryptocurrencies tend to be. The currency is used in a number of ways, including for payments and futures trading. Since they're also more predictable than regular crypto tokens, traders also use stablecoins "to sit out times of volatility or market downturns," says Nic Puckrin, a crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau. "Stablecoins are also being used increasingly in emerging markets, like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, to hedge against monetary instability, as well as for cheap cross-border payments," he adds. "Right now, [the stablecoin market] is, for all intents and purposes, a duopoly. The market is nearly entirely dominated by Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT," Puckrin says. Since the bill will create a clear pathway for banks and other entities to begin issuing stablecoins, "we'll likely see a flood of them rush into the market at the start," he says. Big banks are gearing up to create their own coins. And while they may not all be successful, Puckrin says they will give consumers more options to find a stablecoin and issuer that works best for their needs. Proponents say it will help safeguard investors and regulate the stablecoin market by ensuring issuers have the reserves needed to give stablecoins their value. "If we fail to act now, not only will these benefits slip away — we will also fall behind in global competitiveness," Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), who introduced the bill, said in the Senate on Wednesday. "Without a regulatory framework, stablecoin innovation will proliferate overseas — not in America!" "Congress has also realized that instead of threatening the U.S. dollar, stablecoins can help cement its global dominance, because 99% of stablecoins are pegged to USD," he says. Some supporters acknowledge the bill isn't perfect, but think it's better than not having regulation on stablecoins at all. "The general outlook is that [the bill] will do better than anything that is currently happening," says Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of blockchain security firm Lionsgate. "It's a step in the right direction for everyone. There are ways to make it better. Critics of the GENIUS Act argue it compromises crypto's decentralization and could enable corruption, such as officials favoring specific stablecoins under new regulations. "We need guardrails that ensure that government officials aren't openly asking people to buy their coins in order to increase their personal profit or their family's profit," Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore), who opposed the current version of the bill, said during Wednesday's session. "As long as issuers are clearly following the rules and regulations, more competition in the stablecoin landscape is both welcome and necessary," Puckrin says. The latter, introduced in 2023 but previously stalled, aimed to boost credit card payment competition by requiring issuers to allow more than two networks (beyond mainly Visa and Mastercard) to process transactions. Still, the GENIUS act could impact retailers outside of crypto, Puckrin says. "We'll likely see stablecoins increasingly adopted as a digital alternative to the U.S. dollar, so banks, fintechs and merchants will be forced to offer stablecoin payment options," he says. "Eventually, payment networks like Visa and Mastercard will have to do so as well, which will lead to lower fees. Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course How to Buy Your First Home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doubling down on its investment in blockchain intelligence technology, along with other investigative platforms. According to a notice of intent on a government procurement website, the Department of Homeland Security component aims to buy more technology from TRM Labs, which focuses on crypto risk management but also offers a bevy of forensics services for government clients. ICE this week also posted an intent to sole source similar technology from Chainalysis, which comes amid a series of planned purchases for other digital forensics tools. In posting its intent to single source both TRM and Chainalysis technology, ICE is indicating there is no other provider that could reasonably provide the same services. Executives from high-tech firms Meta, OpenAI and Palantir are joining the Army Reserve at the rank of lieutenant colonel to serve in Detachment 201, a new “Executive Innovation Corps,” the service announced Friday. On Friday, the service is set to swear-in Meta's chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI's chief product officer Kevin Weil, Palantir's CTO Shyam Sankar and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab who was previously OpenAI's chief research officer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain is reshaping education, with universities offering specialised programmes to meet growing demand for skills in decentralised finance, tokenomics and crypto innovation As blockchain enters finance, logistics, healthcare and governance, companies in the fintech, consulting and cybersecurity sectors – along with traditional banks – will need experts in the technology. Education institutions worldwide are now offering dedicated programmes on blockchain technology, meaning students no longer have to study computer science to find courses in blockchain fundamentals, tokenomics, smart contract development or decentralised finance. The skills that learners gain from these courses extend beyond simply knowing about digital assets and decentralised structures. Tokenomics now appears in business school curricula, economics programmes and law courses. It points out how closely digital assets are connected to innovation and the future global market. With these programmes growing in popularity, educators are starting to track market indicators and trends, such as the BTC price, as a helpful exercise for their students. They offer training in programming smart contracts and using crypto wallets, as well as in the economics, rules and moral questions of decentralised systems. Students are also learning about governance decentralisation, what makes different consensus protocols unique, and what happens to economies when centralised currency authorisation is no longer required. Some institutions also allow students to gain knowledge through online courses and earn certificates remotely. The relationship between blockchain and financial innovation is especially important to business schools. MBA students are being introduced to decentralised finance in their studies. As blockchain is adopted in more mainstream fields, knowing how to use decentralised systems will be essential. Educational bodies know that blockchain's effects will extend beyond tech and finance. Because of this, new programmes have appeared that bring together students in law, engineering, economics and policy to explore blockchain from their own fields. Students are graduating ready to incorporate blockchain and decentralised approaches into their fields of interest. Smart contracts, decentralised applications and updated regulations are now all possible because training is available to support these areas. Firms working with blockchain are investing in research centres, sponsoring student efforts and employing graduates from such programmes. The involvement of industry means teaching is timely and aligned with what employers seek. This technology makes educational spaces a place to experiment with blockchain. It means that people see blockchain as more than a fad; it is transforming the methods we use for establishing value and trust in the new digital space. As programmes in this field expand, they will produce trained professionals and influence the systems, rules and inventions that advance the field of decentralisation. Those learning about blockchain today might design the future of money systems, government methods and standard technology rules.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for a major breakout that could propel the cryptocurrency close to the $4,200 mark. Meanwhile, ETH continues to attract growing institutional interest, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outperforming their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts. In a recent X post, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH is climbing within a massive weekly broadening wedge structure. It typically indicates increasing market volatility and can signal a potential breakout, with the direction depending on the prevailing trend and breakout confirmation. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto echoed a similar outlook, stating that ETH is “setting up for a big move,” especially with over $2.2 billion in short positions clustered near the $3,000 level. If Ethereum breaks above $3,000, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially accelerating ETH's rally. Capital flows also indicate rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows recently pointed out that spot ETH ETFs attracted $240.3 million in inflows yesterday, compared to $164.6 million for spot BTC ETFs. The stronger performance of ETH ETFs suggests that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader shared the following monthly BTC/ETH chart showing two consecutive red candles, signaling a potential shift in momentum as BTC weakens relative to ETH. While altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and SUI created fresh ATHs in 2024, ETH's performance did not live up to expectations. However, 2025 appears to be ushering in a more favorable outlook. On-chain data reveals that ETH faces no major resistance until the $3,417 level. Additionally, ETH recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart – a bullish technical signal that could indicate an impending rally.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The broader cryptocurrency market risk-off sentiment, as Israel confirms attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, triggers a wave of profit booking among top coins, leading to Bitcoin (BTC) edging lower by nearly 2% at press time on Friday. Bitcoin trades in the red on Friday at press time, briefly dropping under $103,000 to $102,664. With the third consecutive bearish candle, BTC erases the recovery earlier this week and is down nearly 2% so far this week. Bitcoin marks a short-term recovery as it bounces off the high-demand zone, marked in a green band, above $102,000 and the rising 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,458. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicates a failed bullish reversal, as it reverses from its signal line without crossing above it. As RSI edges lower towards the oversold zone, it warns of further downside. In such a case, sidelined investors could find an entry opportunity with $100,372, the 30-day lowest trading price, as the next immediate support. However, a recovery later in the day, as Bitcoin upholds the 50-day EMA, could result in a consolidation move before taking a recovery run towards the all-time high of $111,980. Fartcoin marks its third consecutive bearish day, reversing from Wednesday's high at $1.53. Crossing below its 50-day EMA at $1.13, the meme coin is down by over 10% to $1.09 at press time on Friday. A reversal above $1.36 will nullify the downfall and could result in a surge towards the Wednesday high at $1.53. With an over 20% drop in the last three days, ENA tests the support level at $0.28, marked by a low last Thursday. A closing below $0.28 could test the lowest 30-day trading price at $0.25. However, a reversal above could trend towards the $1 psychological level. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
