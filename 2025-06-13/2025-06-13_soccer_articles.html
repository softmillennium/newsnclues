                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami kick off their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup campaign on Saturday night when they face Al Ahly in the tournament opener in Miami. The Herons, who will be playing in familiar surroundings during the group stage, will want to make a fast start. However, with Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets aiming to roll back the years on the world stage, Inter Miami will fancy their chances of causing an upset or two. Here's how Inter Miami could line up for their upcoming duel. RB: Marcelo Weigandt—The defender is on loan from fellow Club World Cup competitors Boca Juniors and will be potentially tasked with thwarting former Aston Villa winger Trézéguet. CB: Maximiliano Falcón—Falcón has earned plenty of minutes in recent weeks and will have his hands full with Wessam Abou Ali, who has scored six goals in his last four matches for club and country. CB: David Martínez—An injury could force Gonzalo Luján to miss out against Al Ahly, with Paraguay international Martínez perhaps taking his place. He played over an hour in both of Miami's recent high-scoring wins. LB: Noah Allen—With the experienced Alba another injury doubt for Saturday, Allen could be asked to play at left back. The versatile young defender is earning plenty of experience this year under Mascherano. RM: Tadeo Allende—The Celta Vigo loanee has already scored eight goals in 20 appearances for Inter Miami, including two in his last three. CM: Benjamin Cremaschi—Cremaschi has not been a constant starter in recent weeks. CM: Sergio Busquets—Busquets won the previous iteration of the Club World Cup on three separate occasions, although his chances of securing a fourth title with Miami are infinitesimal. LM: Telasco Segovia—Segovia has impressed since arriving from Portuguese side Casa Pia at the beginning of the year, with four goals and three assists for Inter Miami. He represented Venezuela twice over the June international break. Messi will draw more eyeballs than most at the Club World Cup despite being 37, and for good reason. The 38-year-old has eight goals and nine assists in all competitions this season. Ewan Ross-Murray is a Sports Illustrated Soccer freelance writer who focuses primarily on the Premier League.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets won it all with Barcelona in 2009. Their Inter Miami coach, Javier Mascherano, came off the bench to help them win it again in 2011. Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba joined them to win it all in 2015. Ten years later, the former Barcelona standouts are back in the Club World Cup together again – playing for a Major League Soccer club that was an expansion franchise before COVID-19 altered 2020. Inter Miami will face Egyptian Premier League champion Al Ahly in the 2025 Club World Cup opener at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday at 8 p.m. Al Alhy is regarded as one of the best teams in Africa. Inter Miami also will face FC Porto, who compete in the Champions League out of Portugal, Thursday in Atlanta, and Palmerias, one of Brazil's best, in Miami on Monday during the group stage. Having the chance to be part of it is exciting,” Messi said in an interview with FIFA this week. Inter Miami's stars have all shined and experienced heartbreak on bigger stages than this. Mascherano, 41 and a first-year MLS coach, was there with Messi for much of the national-team heartbreak they experienced in both tournaments before those victories. Busquets, 36, was part of Spain's World Cup winning side in 2010, while he and Alba, 36, were part of Spain's Euro championship in 2012. They know anything can happen in this Club World Cup. “In this kind of tournament – in the World Cup, the Copa América, in all tournaments – there's always a team that surprises you and has the ability to do so,” Suarez said before Friday's practice. Inter Miami started this season unbeaten in their first 14 matches across all competitions (11 wins and three draws), but hit a major slump toward the end of April when they were bounced by the Vancouver Whitecaps 5-1 on aggregate score in the semifinals of the Concacaf Champions Cup. Since April 24, Inter Miami has played 10 matches – they've lost five of them and had two draws. They were outscored 23-15 in the first eight matches, before outscoring CF Montreal and Columbus Crew 9-3 in two wins before the Club World Cup. Inter Miami, despite its aging stars, has flaws that could be exposed during this Club World Cup. It also doesn't help they could be without Alba, one of their best playmakers who sustained a hamstring injury against Columbus May 31. Mascherano is hopeful they can return at some point in the next two matches. "I think it's a great opportunity for us to measure ourselves, to see what level we're really at – beyond the fact that we already know what level we're at within the MLS, within Concacaf, having reached the final stages of the Concacaf Champions League,” Mascherano said during his pre-match press conference.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's remember, Sounders actually earned this spot. It's a little different when our shift is over and we actually want to feel something, be it at the theater, a stadium, a concert or just sitting in front of our televisions at home. Some emotions, a little drama, hot mess or even heart-pounding tension can bring color and depth to our lives, even with some accompanying stress. After years of buildup, the hyped, heated event is finally here. The host nation's top flight has three entries, triple the number of MLSers that had taken part in all previous editions combined – which would be exactly one, the Sounders in 2023, though they were actually participating in the 2022 CWC, which… OK, let's not get sidetracked. Of that trio, the consensus among both pundits and oddsmakers is that Seattle, despite enjoying the most pronounced home-field advantage, face the longest odds of making a run into the CWC knockout stages, mostly because of the (un)luck of the draw that dropped them into a group of death alongside the reigning champions of Europe and South America as well as one of Spain's elite sides. Despite kinder group-stage assignments, Inter Miami and LAFC still have ample work to do against potent opponents, as Backheeled.com recently noted, whose squads are rated as somewhere between three and 19 times as valuable as their own by Transfermarkt. Because as skeptical as the global audience appears to be about this tournament, it nevertheless remains arguably the biggest stage MLS teams have ever stepped foot on, a rare opportunity to assert the league's competitive and qualitative credentials. From day one, Seattle has been a beacon of sense and sustainability in a league with regulations that deter the latter. Sounders fans know the bullet points better than anyone: four U.S. Open Cups, a Supporters' Shield, two MLS Cups, two more MLS Cup final appearances, playoffs qualification in 15 of 16 MLS seasons, a constant perch at or near the top of the attendance rankings, and best-in-class media coverage, local relevance and supporter culture year after year. The Rave Green showed everyone that a consistent contender dips into every bucket: Designated Player recruitment; academy cultivation and player development; smart trades and drafting; investment in the middle of the roster; physical infrastructure; staff hires; data analytics; and frankly every other buzzword that describes the parts of an organization. As SaH's Brian McKay analyzed in pointed detail back in January, general manager Craig Waibel took this approach to a new level over the winter with the acquisition of Jesús Ferreira and Paul Arriola and the re-signing Albert Rusnák, pragmatically valuing depth and proven productivity at the risk of leaving some observers let down by a relative lack of sizzle. I get the distinct sense that a significant number of Sounders fans are quite tired of hearing all this. And yeah, doing your big-ticket shopping at FC Dallas is inherently less sexy than hitting up Tottenham Hotspur or Boca Juniors. Like I said, competence can be boring. Anyone pining for bigger, bolder swings on the transfer market may want to glance over at the profound struggles former club president Garth Lagerwey and Atlanta United are currently experiencing after a record-breaking offseason shopping spree. Inter Miami has its (drastically different) model, and it may well be pushing the league forward just as Seattle's arrival did all those years ago. It's fundamentally built, however, on the transcendence of Leo Messi – a one-of-one world talent – which is by definition not a replicable blueprint. LAFC sit somewhere between Miami and Seattle on this spectrum, yet have only been around a fraction as long as SSFC and enjoy the particular advantages of being based in Los Angeles, a huge and uniquely attractive market in which to work, not only for players like Hugo Lloris and Olivier Giroud but also the well-heeled, well-connected Hollywood types who populate their ownership group. No one else has figured out how to thrive in this soil quite like they have.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup starts this weekend, and the United States Men's National Team's path to an eighth Gold Cup title kicks off Sunday, June 15 in San Jose, California against Trinidad and Tobago. The USMNT will continue their group stage with back-to-back matches in Texas against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 and Haiti on Sunday, June 22. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino released his 26-player roster last week, and it includes a mix of familiar faces and young talent. Miles Robinson, the hero for the United States in the 2021 Gold Cup final victory over Mexico, appears alongside other stalwart defenders such as Walker Zimmerman, Tim Ream and goalkeeper Matt Turner. Historically, the United States has dominated the group stage, totaling a 40-1-5 record and winning their group in 16 out of 17 Gold Cups, including the most recent competition in 2023. The United States has dominated the series against Trinidad and Tobago, winning 17 of 18 meetings on American soil. At Port of Spain, the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago, the Americans played more than 50 minutes down to 10 men, and Trinidad and Tobago took advantage to record a 2-1 win. With a win Sunday, the United States could equal its longest home winning streak against any opponent, tying with Ecuador, which the U.S. has beaten 16 consecutive times. ET at PayPal Park (San Jose, Calif.) The United States has only faced Saudi Arabia once in the past five years, a scoreless draw in an international friendly in September 2022. Before then, Saudi Arabia appeared in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar where it most notably shocked the soccer world and defeated Argentina early in the group stage, handing the eventual and current reigning World Cup champions their only loss of the tournament. Saudi Arabia enters the Gold Cup still alive in qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, earning a result in three of their last four AFC qualifying matches. The two nations have met four times in Gold Cup action, and the USA has never lost, earning three wins and one draw. The Gold Cup quarterfinals will be held June 28-June 29 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. and U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The semifinals take place July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Sixteen teams will look to make it to Houston, Texas where the final will be played at NRG Stadium on July 6. Mexico won the last time around in 2023, beating a Panama side that outlasted the United States in penalty kicks in the semis. The Americans won the Gold Cup prior in 2021, swiping the trophy from Mexico thanks to Robinson's epic game-winning header in extra time. A post shared by U.S. Soccer MNT (@usmnt)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The much-discussed and widely derided Club World Cup will finally get under way in Miami at 01:00 BST on Sunday. It will be something of a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup in the US, with five of the venues - Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium, Lincoln Financial Field and Lumen Field - also hosting matches next year. Mbappe, Messi & Ramos - big names set for Club World Cup With the big kick-off looming, talk is rife that ticket sales are slow. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami headline the first game, and world governing body Fifa declined to comment when asked by BBC Sport about sales for their match against Al Ahly at the 65,000-capacity Hard Rock Stadium. Some reports, external suggest an offer was made to students at Miami Dade College that if they bought one ticket for $20 (£14.70) they would get four free. Sources have said  the college is a partner of Fifa and tickets being offered may be taken up by students who would not usually have an interest in football. It has been reported that when sales opened in December, the cheapest available was £257. "We have two teams in that game with very different stories: a young team like Inter Miami that is already known around the world, and the team that has won more trophies than any team in Africa, with millions of fans around the world." Tickets for the tournament have been sold under a dynamic pricing model, with prices determined by demand. Some matches, understandably, appear to have attracted more interest than others. Paris-St Germain's opener against Atletico Madrid also appears to be selling well, with the cheapest tickets now priced at £60. A little bit like in 1930, the first World Cup started. "Everyone today speaks about the very first World Cup. "I'm a positive person generally, but they criticise Fifa if the prices are too high, then they criticise Fifa if the prices are too low. Then they criticise Fifa if we make ticketing promotions with students. MLS players have been embroiled in a row with their association regarding bonuses for the tournament Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, external has said there is not "any appetite" for the tournament from "players, clubs and even supporters" - but does this ring true? Speaking to Fifa channels, Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane said playing in the tournament would be a "great experience", Monterrey defender Sergio Ramos said his side were approaching it with "a lot of hunger", and Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez said the competition would be "watched by the whole world". The big European teams involved have all named strong squads, with the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Antoine Griezmann all set to feature. Manchester City, meanwhile, have spent more than £100m on players to bolster their squad in preparation for the competition. Asked how Americans will respond to the event, former US national team boss Jurgen Klinsmann told BBC Sport: "You have big names coming in from South America and the European teams, and mixed in with the Mexican and American teams, you will get some excitement over here. "Obviously, it will not be like that for every game. "It will spark some excitement for the World Cup next summer." But things feel rather low-key in Miami in the build-up to the opening game, with few banners or billboards advertising this global spectacle of 'soccer'. With the action about to begin, Fifa and the Club World Cup itself could do with a spark of magic from Messi to rouse local interest. Fifa has been criticised from multiple angles about the tournament, which has increased to 32 teams and is set to be hosted every four years. This week alone, Spanish La Liga president Javier Tebas, external described the Club World Cup as "absurd" and said Fifa had not "consulted us about anything". Manchester City will be in action 24 days after playing their final game of the 2024-25 domestic season, and City players such as Ballon d'Or winner Rodri and defender Manuel Akanji have previously raised concerns about the relentless fixture schedule. In January, players' union Fifpro and Fifa met to discuss the packed calendar. But senior Fifa sources have told BBC Sport the protection of player welfare has  been at the core of decision-making, pointing to initiatives such as a fund for players, additional substitutes in competitions and permanent concussion substitutes. A £775m prize pot will be split between the teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m, but uneven distribution will mean European clubs earn more for taking part than those from other continents. Meanwhile, Major League Soccer players have been embroiled in a row, external with their association regarding bonuses for the tournament. Earlier this month, the Seattle Sounders team, who are in Group B alongside Champions League winners PSG, warmed up in T-shirts with 'Club World Ca$h Grab' written on the front. Money is clearly a major issue across the board at this Fifa showpiece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among Donald Trump's gilded additions to the Oval Office, one ornament stands out: symbolising power plays in sport and geopolitics. The outlandish, elaborate golden discs form football's newest prize: the Club World Cup that will be handed out in New Jersey on 14 July, after 63 matches across 11 American cities. It was hand-delivered to Mr Trump three months ago by Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president whose name is etched into it. This whole competition - supersizing an old, little-regarded format from seven to 32 clubs - is very much Mr Infantino's creation to reshape world football and extend FIFA's reach into the club game.

The alliance - contentious given Mr Trump's rhetoric and interventions on topics such as immigration and diversity - is defended as fast-tracking decision-making at the highest level. "I think it is absolutely crucial for the success of a World Cup to have a close relationship with the president," Mr Infantino said. But the CWC begins against the backdrop of immigration raids and violent protests in Los Angeles amid concerns fans could be targeted or denied entry to FIFA events. It can appear that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has bailed out Mr Infantino, bankrolling his pet project. There was little interest from FIFA's usual World Cup broadcasters - BBC and ITV in Britain - until loss-making streamer DAZN stepped in with a $1bn (£736m) deal, just around the time Saudi Arabia was handed the hosting of the 2034 World Cup. PIF also owns Al-Hilal, who qualified as Asian Champions League winners for the CWC in a group featuring Real Madrid. While four of Europe's slots went to recent Champions League winners, the other eight went to the best-performing teams ranked by European results in recent years. Follow our channel and never miss an update. And while Liverpool should have made the cut by that measure, FIFA imposed a cap on two teams per country unless they had all qualified as competition winners. So FIFA only has Chelsea and Manchester City, although Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were handed a place as national champions despite not actually winning the main American soccer title. To some, this could seem to be the genesis of a Super League - the aborted European breakaway in 2021 - in a different guise. Champions League organiser UEFA once tried to thwart the CWC, given it could diminish the status of its own competition, before caving-in to FIFA. Chelsea and City have already played 57 matches this season - now up to seven more are being bolted on. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is why - in plans first revealed by Sky News in 2023 - global players' union FIFPRO has launched a legal challenge claiming FIFA has abused a dominant position to risk the health of players. And, given that other FIFA events have already expanded - or are expanding - to 48 finalists, the Club World Cup could be here to stay - and even get even bigger.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool could break the British transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz while Thomas Frank may bring two Brentford stars with him to Spurs Time to sign off – here's a run-down of Friday's main stories: John Brewin takes a look at the Spurs manager's in-tray Club World Cup kicks off amid extreme heat fears … City could loan out Grealish having received no offers Everton have turned their attentions to the Villarreal striker Thierno Barry as David Moyes attempts to improve his forward options for next season. Barry, 22, scored 11 goals in La Liga last season and 19 overall as Villarreal qualified for the Champions League. The France under-21 international is understood to have a release clause of €40m in his contract with the Spanish club but Everton would hope to sign him for less. Barry is currently on international duty at the Under-21 Euros in Slovakia. Moyes' need to upgrade Everton's attack is pressing, with the club having missed out on Liam Delap, and declined to take up an option to sign Armando Broja on a permanent deal from Chelsea. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is expected to leave on a free transfer this summer, which would leave only Beto and the unproven Youssef Chermiti as central striking options. How about Dilated Peoples' “Wirtz comes to Wirtz?” asks Fadden Holden, shouting to be heard over bass-heavy speakers while the DJ nods approvingly. Saudi Arabia currently hosts annual four-team Italian and Spanish Super Cup events, so it makes sense that the Saudi Super Cup is being held in … Hong Kong. The tournament will take place in August at the Hong Kong Stadium, with Al-Ittihad, Al-Qadisiyah, Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr taking part. Tottenham have tempted Thomas Frank across London to become their new manager – now they could swoop for two of his Brentford stars. More than 170 transfers in the top five men's leagues this summer, and we're barely into June. Fabian Barthez had saved David Beckham's penalty, but England were heading for victory regardless. Celtic fans will face further Hampden Park ticket sanctions after the Scottish champions were one of three clubs to be hit with disciplinary charges relating to pyrotechnics. The SPFL has revealed that Celtic, Aberdeen and Partick Thistle face notices of complaint. In March, Celtic and Rangers were hit with an immediate reduction of 500 tickets for the next League Cup match to be played at Hampden as a result of similar offences at the final in December. Celtic were also handed a suspended reduction of 800 tickets, which it appears has been breached. The flares were accompanied by a banner directed at chief executive Michael Nicholson which read: “Fan engagement up in smoke”. “Not quite a holiday, but I met John Collins when doing my Duke of Edinburgh bronze expedition in the Lake District,” writes Chris Little. I went in to ask for help and the Celtic midfield maestro was stood at reception. “His name doesn't exactly lend itself well to chants. An REM-inspired Everybody Wirtz isn't going to get the Kop bouncing, nor a rendition of the Nine Inch Nails song. I guess there's perhaps scope for a spin on this belter…” Nailed it. He's not done yet: James Milner has agreed a one-year extension to his Brighton deal. “I'm really pleased we will have James with us again this season,” said Fabian Hürzeler. “He's a great guy to have in our environment, who is always there for me and the team.” Milner will turn 40 in January and could join an elite group of outfield players to feature in the Premier League after their 40th birthday – including Teddy Sheringham, Ryan Giggs, Kevin Phillips and Gordon Strachan. Milner, who only played four times last season due to injuries, also needs 15 more games to equal Gareth Barry at the top of the Premier League's all-time appearance list. Here's today's Football Daily, by me, on Gianni's big geopolitical headache. Speaking of Inzaghi, he has helped lead Pisa back to Serie A for the first time in 34 years – but won't be there to coach them in the top flight. He's left his role by mutual consent, and is expected to take over at Palermo, returning to the second tier with the CFG-affiliated Sicilian side. I don't have any great tales of meeting footballers on holiday, but I did once spot Pippo Inzaghi at an airport in the Czech Republic. Steven Pressley understands why some Dundee fans were unhappy with his appointment as head coach but believes he will be a better leader for his time away from the front line. The club's selection of the former Rangers, Dundee United, Hearts, Celtic and Scotland defender was not particularly well received among supporters given Pressley's previous role as a manager ended when he was sacked by Carlisle in 2019. For the past four years, the former Falkirk, Coventry, Fleetwood and Pafos manager has been head of individual player development at Brentford while completing a masters degree in strategic leadership. But I am aware there has to be a period of growth before we get success. Make no mistake, I am aware we need to win games and we are working extra hard to do so. Hopefully with that leadership we can bring some form of success.” PA Media. Does anyone here have Club World Cup fever yet? We had been upgraded to first class as a gift. Sat right across the aisle from us was Billy Sims, Heisman Trophy winner and former running back for the Detroit Lions. Mikey Moore is excited to show new Tottenham boss Thomas Frank what he can do – but the teenager's immediate focus is ending an unforgettable breakthrough campaign with another European trophy. The winger was given his chance by Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked last week but with have to reset for his new head coach. “With Ange, I'm thankful to him,” Moore said. “He gave me an opportunity to go and show people what I could do. Thomas Frank is now the main man at Tottenham. John Brewin takes a look at what he needs to sort out. Real Madrid have beaten off plenty of competition to sign teenage sensation Franco Mastantuono from River Plate. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. “It's not a footballers on holiday story but is along those lines,” writes Martin Cruise. “I went back for another swift pint and a rather large gent bumped into me on his way out of the gents at which point I recognised the recently departed Uriah Rennie. It then dawned on me that the entire bar was filled with Premier League referees (your Mike Riley's, Phil Dowd's and so on) on their training activities in what was then the new era of professional refs.” Juventus head coach Igor Tudor has signed a new deal with the club, running until June 2027, with the option of a further year. Tudor will lead Juventus at the Club World Cup, where they will play Manchester City, Al Ain and Wydad AC. Brentford are expected to target an external candidate to replace Thomas Frank despite holding talks with Keith Andrews about stepping up from his role as set-piece coach. The former Republic of Ireland midfielder has emerged as a potential candidate for the post after Frank's departure was confirmed on Thursday night. Andrews joined Brentford last summer and is highly regarded by Brentford but it is understood he is unlikely to be given his first senior role in management despite being made the favourite by some bookmakers. Brentford's owner, Matthew Benham, is believed to have considered promoting Justin Cochrane from his role as Frank's assistant until the 43-year-old former midfielder, who is part of Thomas Tuchel's England staff, opted to join Tottenham instead. That means that Brentford are likely to turn their attention to other candidates thought to include Ipswich's Kieran McKenna - who is a long-term target - and the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic. Tottenham have filed high court proceedings against Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos over a terminated sponsorship agreement. Court records show Spurs filed a commercial claim at the high court against Ineos Automotive on Thursday, though no documents are available. Chemicals firm Ineos agreed a five-year deal with Spurs in 2022 - before Ratcliffe bought a stake in United – for Ineos Grenadier to become the London team's official 4x4 vehicle partner. In March it was announced Ineos had reached a settlement with New Zealand Rugby in relation to a sponsorship deal. The previous month, NZR had said it had launched legal proceedings against Ineos after alleging that the first instalment of 2025 sponsorship money due under a six-year agreement struck in 2021 had not been paid. Chris Boyle reminisces: “When I was nine we stayed at the same resort in Portugal as legendary striker John Aldridge. As a Liverpool-mad kid, this was incredible, even more so as John and his family were very down to earth and friendly. I have happy memories of him and my Dad ‘singing' La Bamba on karaoke. To add to the football-Stella Street vibe, Lee Dixon was also there (from memory he spent the time chasing after his small children and looking harassed) and we bumped into Joe Jordan at a water park. My days of holidaying alongside top flight footballers are highly unlikely to return (and much less appealing in my 40s tbf).” “Anyway, he was really normal, just a humble guy and you could see the glow as he recalled ‘They were happy days' and other bits. “But I didn't bother him again because I didn't want to get all ‘fanboy' and in his face. Fraser Mann emails: “On the topic of meeting footballers on holiday, me and my family shared a lift in a Spanish airport with Pat Jennings some time in the mid 80s. My mum had always had a bit of crush on him and was all over the shop to be stood so near to him. I said, ‘hello Mr Jennings, are you on holiday?' At which point, we all laughed very loudly as if it was the funniest thing anyone has said EVER. Cue awkward silence until the lift door opened and Pat left saying, ‘Be nice to your mum, son.' “A strange encounter with the big handed Irish legend I'll think you'll agree. My mum still can't really talk about it.” I hunted down some of the very few UK-based Chelsea and Man City fans heading over for the Club World Cup and asked “why?”. “People think women are the weaker sex, and we're not. Speaking of which … I was on holiday last week and the former Nottingham Forest and Manchester City manager Frank Clark was at the same hotel. I considered confronting him to ask why he played striker Craig Russell at left-back during his Maine Road days. Then I remember it was 30 years ago and Clark is now in his 80s. This, however, leads to the question … when have you met a footballer on holiday? Will Unwin is on deck to take you through the afternoon's stories. Bayer Leverkusen are expected to make an offer for Manchester City's James McAtee when the transfer window reopens according to multiple reports. City expect a fee of at least £25m plus add-ons for McAtee. Cardiff City are inching towards the appointment of Brian Barry-Murphy as their manager, as a protracted process heads towards the end game. The 46-year-old was appointed as Ruud van Nistelrooy's assistant by Leicester last December but Cardiff are expected to trigger his release. Cardiff have flip-flopped over the decision after holding advanced talks with Des Buckingham, who is out of work after leaving Oxford, before landing on Barry-Murphy, whose only job as a No 1 was at Rochdale. Aaron Ramsey also held discussions about taking the job on a permanent basis but the 34-year-old has agreed to prolong his playing career in Mexico with Pumas with a view of playing at the 2026 World Cup. As an Aussie who lives in the cooler City of Melbourne, I can attest to the temperature gauge getting it massively wrong from time to time. Short drinks break will be handy but not a solution. The wording of this bit of news reminds me of what I used to call the Matt Derbyshire Dilemma a few years ago, which was: would you rather play for Blackburn Rovers or Olympiacos? Gabriel Magalhães has described the Arsenal transfer target Rodrygo as a “phenomenon” and admitted he would like to see him join the north London club. The Real Madrid winger, who plays with Gabriel for Brazil, is of interest to Arsenal this summer as they look to strengthen their attack after falling short in the Premier League race this season. According to reports Rodrygo is questioning his future at Real Madrid amid fierce competition for places. Asked if he knows whether Rodrygo is coming to Arsenal, Gabriel told the Podpah podcast in Brazil: “I don't know. If it was up to me, of course. David Beckham has been awarded a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours. The former England captain, a winner of league titles in four countries and of 115 national team caps, has been awarded the honour for services to sport and to charity. Sir David also won the Champions League as part of Manchester United's treble-winning team in 1999, and since retiring as a player has become a founder and co-owner of American team Inter Miami. He has worked as an ambassador for the worldwide charity UNICEF since 2005 and since last year has been an ambassador for the King's Foundation. Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour. To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true. “It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.” Daly said: “I am greatly honoured to receive an MBE. It's a very proud moment for me and my family.” Frank Rothwell, the owner of Oldham who secured their return to the EFL earlier this month, has become an OBE for services to dementia research. Chelsea's first match at the Club World Cup is against Los Angeles FC where they will meet a familiar foe in Hugo Lloris. Lloris played a pivotal role in getting LAFC to the tournament by making a big save late in extra time during the play-in match against Club América, one of Mexico's perennial powers. The score was tied 1-1 in the 109th minute when Club América's Javairô Dilrosun (who, interestingly, has just signed with LAFC ahead of the Club World Cup) fired a blistering shot from eight yards out after a give-and-go with Diego Valdes. Six minutes later, Denis Bouanga scored to give LAFC a 2-1 victory. Brighton have signed the teenage forward Charalampos Kostoulas, who gave up a Champions League season with Olympiakos to play in the Premier League. “It is a dream for everybody to come here and play football,” the Greece Under-21 striker said. Olympiakos was elevated directly into the lucrative Champions League opening phase — because title-holder Paris Saint-Germain already secured a place by winning the French league — and will play eight games in the single-standings league. Brighton finished eighth in the Premier League and did not qualify for European football. Thomas Frank and Spurs are a good fit on paper but the north London job will be a tough one for the Dane. Frank is tactically flexible but can be a slow starter and has limited experience in managing sides competing in Europe. His record in domestic cups, similarly, is dismal; his past history makes it unlikely a poor league season could be redeemed by other silverware – although the depth of the Spurs squad perhaps means the cups will not be such a low priority. He is leaving an exceptionally well-run club, at which every component worked together to a coherent philosophy. There can be no certainty that any one cog from that system, however important, can achieve success in a different environment, something Chelsea have found as they accumulate more and more parts from Brighton without ever looking like replicating the efficiency of the Brighton model. It may be that such efficiency is not even possible at bigger clubs. Tottenham confirmed the appointment of Thomas Frank last night after holding talks via ­intermediaries and plainly keen to avoid a protracted search for the ­person to lead them forward following a season in which they finished 17th with 38 points. Frank consistently over-achieved in relation to his financial means at Brentford; they have one of the smallest budgets in the division. An excellent ­communicator and noted developer of young ­talent, he has also shown himself to be ­tactically flexible. Thomas Frank has penned a letter to Brentford supporters after deciding to leave the west London club nine years on from when he came in. The time has come for me to move on. But, even as I leave, I know I have left a big piece of my heart at Brentford, not just at the football club but with the community and, of course, the incredible and loyal supporters. I want to extend my profound gratitude to the club for giving me the chance to pursue my dreams and for everyone involved who made the journey such a memorable one. For my family and I, it has been a privilege to be allowed to be part of such a special community - it's an experience and adventure that we will cherish for life. His trust and friendship have meant so much and the fact he gave me a chance in English football means I will always owe him a debt of gratitude. So, while this is a goodbye, I hope the relationships I have built with everybody will be lasting ones and, of course, we will meet again in the wonderful world of football. After missing the 2022 World Cup due to his ACL injury. He returned to the national side in 2024, scoring his first goal for Germany in seven seconds against France to become the second fastest goalscorer in international football history behind Austria's Christoph Baumgartner. Against Spain in the quarter-final, Wirtz came off the bench to score an 89th-minute equalising goal but Spain went on to win in extra-time. A possible British transfer record is nothing to scoff at but the fact Liverpool only spent around £10m on Federico Chiesa last summer combined with the finances that come with winning the Premier League, means the club seem to be happy to spend big to support Arne Slot. With Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving the club, there are likely concerns about where Liverpool's creative output comes from. Liverpool's pursuit of Florian Wirtz has been no secret. The club fought off interest from Manchester City and Bayern Munich with the German only wanting to join Arne Slot's side. Wirtz, who can play across the frontline, is one of the most coveted players in Europe and was understood to be impressed by Liverpool's plans. The 22-year-old has spent his entire senior career at Bayer Leverkusen. According to Opta, only Mohamed Salah (18) and Lamine Yamal (13) recorded more than his 12 assists from open play among players from Europe's top five leagues. Liverpool have agreed a fee with Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz. The German will join the Premier League champions in an £100m deal plus £16m in potential add-ons that would make Wirtz the most expensive British transfer of all time, eclipsing Chelsea's £115m purchase of Moises Caicedo. Add on that temperatures in US are likely to be above 30C and whew. Notable heat events are not guaranteed during the Club World Cup but they are more likely to happen than in the past because of climate breakdown and there is a question over whether enough is being done to adapt to a new reality. It argues that the threshold for cooling breaks should be between 28C and 32C under the WBGT, with options for a second drinks break per half. If the heat rises above 32C, FifPro argues, matches should be rescheduled. First is today's Rumour Mill with Will Unwin detailing a possible move to Aston Villa for Alejandro Garnacho (à la Marcus Rashford) while Manchester United and Liverpool continue their search for a No 9. ​Plus transfer moves and managerial changes are in full swing. How will he fare for the north London side? Where does it leave Brentford, the club he was at for nine years?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reigning 18-time French champions OL Lyonnes are looking to secure the signatures of another two U.S. Women's National Team stars to join forces with international teammate Lindsey Heaps. Former Notre Dame star Korbin Albert is very familiar with Lyon, having spent the last two and a half seasons in the French top tier with Paris Saint-Germain. Albert is expected to switch Paris for Lyon this summer as a free agent, as per ESPN, shortly after being dropped from the USWNT by head coach Emma Hayes for their recent friendly wins against China and Jamaica. Upon Albert's potential move to Lyon, she may yet be joined by international teammate and fellow midfielder Lily Yohannes. The 18-year-old has been a standout performer for the USWNT since Hayes' arrival, with one goal in eight caps to date. “As I keep saying to everyone, she's 17,” Hayes said in May, via ESPN. I think the next two years of development will be important for her. “I think it's been an unbelievable development pathway for her to be at Ajax. Tactically in possession, when she plays for her club team, they generally have the ball against sort of mid-to-low blocks. So, I think she's developed that side of her play.” Exactly what compensation would be required to pry Yohannes away from Ajax is unclear, although she still has another year on her current deal. Not that Lyon is the only team potentially considering signing Yohannes, with ESPN having claimed Women's Super League champions, and Hayes' former side, Chelsea, are also keeping an eye on her. Should Albert and/or Yohannes head for Lyon, they would link up with Heaps, who has called the eight-time UEFA Women's Champions League winners home since 2022 when she joined from the Portland Thorns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead of entering the Gold Cup on a high, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) is limping into this summer's tournament and hoping to get itself back on track. That's because there's a lot going on at the moment. Christian Pulisic is sitting out in order to rest following a long season with AC Milan, a decision that has created drama amid backlash from former USMNT stars like Landon Donovan. Other current USMNT mainstays – including Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Antonee "Jedi" Robinson, Sergino Dest, Gio Reyna, Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi – aren't with the team due to Club World Cup commitments or injury recovery. These absences have forced USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino to call in a green roster – one that averages 16 caps – with even more limited experience in official competition. More pressing, however, are the results from two friendly matches this week. Now, there's not much time to regroup because the USMNT begins Gold Cup competition on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago (6 p.m. ET on FOX) before facing Saudi Arabia and Haiti to round out group play. The negativity surrounding the team seems overwhelming, but players are just trying to get their minds right. "I think it's really easy to look at one game, one half, and be like, ‘Oh this is all going to pieces. They can't come back from this," veteran center back Walker Zimmerman told the TNT broadcast after the drubbing by Switzerland. Six months later, the Atlas Lions inspired a nation and made history by advancing to the World Cup semifinal. "We have to flip the script," Zimmerman continued. USMNT defender Tim Ream chats with midfielder John Tolkin during the team's most recent game, a 4-0 loss to Switzerland. But can this motley crew of unseasoned players quickly recover from disaster and respond? Their charge is not only to win a Gold Cup trophy – players have said that is how they would define success this summer – but more importantly to make a statement at the World Cup on home soil one year from now. "We can lose, but we can win the Gold Cup and arrive at the World Cup and do well." Additionally, the Gold Cup still represents a massive opportunity for young and inexperienced players to make some noise and impress Pochettino enough to become part of his World Cup roster plans. Midfielders Diego Luna and Jack McGlyn, both 21, are examples of that. Luna has proven he can play through a broken nose and has been a consistently energetic presence on the field. "I think if you ask anyone to write down 26 names for next year, there would be a lot of spots that people would objectively say are available," Zimmerman said. Most of all, the players are desperate to put recent results behind them – the USMNT has now lost four straight games and been outscored 9-2 in those contests. They have to find ways to score goals and win games, or this could end up being a deja vu to last summer when the squad didn't make it out of the Copa America group stage. That tournament was also preceded by two tune-up friendlies, including a 5-1 loss to Colombia. "One that I think every player should take seriously with both hands."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giants Jermaine Eluemunor also takes note MetLife Stadium has installed a grass playing surface for the FIFA World Cup matches that will be held from Saturday, June 14 through July 13. The NFLPA and at least one member of the New York Giants have taken notice. The artificial surface at MetLife, which is currently a FieldTurf Core system installed in 2023, has long been a source of controversy. Before the field was upgraded in 2023, there were a number of complaints about the playing surface. The NFLPA has been pushing for grass playing surfaces in all NFL stadiums for several years, pointing to data showing lower injury rates. In fact, 92% of players reportedly prefer grass. The Giants and Jets have said that to date they do not believe they can maintain adequate playing conditions on a grass playing field due to both the heavy use of the surface with two NFL teams, Northeast weather conditions, and the number of non-football events held at the stadium. “I want to get to the point where the experts can tell us that late in the season we can have a safe, playable grass field, and when we get to that point, then maybe we'll make the switch,” Mara said at last year's NFL owners meetings. “With the amount of events in our building, particularly during the football season, having two teams there, and how many times last year we had back-to-back games where it rained during the first game, I can't imagine what a grass field would've looked like on a second day.” FIFA requires grass playing surfaces, and the fact that the event will only last a month makes its installation and maintenance at MetLife feasible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's quest to add another trophy to their growing cabinet gets underway on Monday when they take on LAFC in their Club World Cup opener. Todd Boehly will no doubt be keen to get his hands on a second honour after the Blues secured Conference League glory last month. This includes new signing Liam Delap and star loanee Andrey Santos. However, finance expert Adam Williams has claimed he believes the Club World Cup is a competition the owner would love to make a regular feature for his side, and instead make changes elsewhere. He said: “I think the Club World Cup is a litmus test in terms of what Todd Boehly and Clearlake want at Chelsea. “Boehly has said that the fixture calendar is too crowded and that they need to reduce the number of matches. But what he really means is that there should be fewer less lucrative matches. I think if you look at the research, if you can remove seven or eight competitive matches from the calendar then that can let you have quite a brutal revision when it comes to the size of your squad. I know Chelsea have a massive squad at the moment and that has been one of the hallmarks of this nascent phase under Boehly and Clearlake, but that's not the long-term vision. In my view, they're using their squad now as a player trading base – they are going to continue to trim the fat and make money in the process in the coming years. “Their camp for the Club World Cup is 28 players and they're all on big wages. If they can reduce the total number of matches and replace some of the lost ones with matches like the Club World Cup or money-spinning friendlies in big commercial markets, they are going to be laughing. “Because you're replacing less lucrative matches with more lucrative ones, you're probably at a net neutral position financially in terms of revenue, but your costs are lower because you don't have to pay as significant wages.“ However, Boehly is clearly trying to disrupt the recognised big three in the Premier League, with Williams stating that those in charge at Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool disagree with his way of thinking in terms of the football calendar. I think the received wisdom among clubs like Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool has been that more matches equals more money, which can only be a good thing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Radar: Club World Cup 50 Players to Watch When Mauricio Pochettino was hired to coach the U.S. men's national team in September 2024, the federation amplified their shared “belief that U.S. Soccer is on the cusp of something truly special.” Over the past week, however, his squad couldn't even handle a Turkey and Swiss. Pochettino's side followed an embarrassing fourth-place showing at the Nations League with a pair of consecutive friendly losses. How much of an outlier is this brutal run-up to hosting the World Cup? To look at how a team improved or regressed, we'll use the Elo Ratings system. While FIFA's rankings are pushed the hardest and even used for competition draws, the formula has changed often and still seems unreflective of recent form. The Elo model uses head-to-head results to award points to teams after every game, with the score fully transparent and ranked among every other national team in the world. For example, one-goal defeats to Panama and Canada in March's Concacaf Nations League have more sway over the U.S.'s Elo Rating than Tuesday's loss to Switzerland or January's 3-1 win over Venezuela. That feels a bit more honest than FIFA's latest rankings, which has the USMNT 16th in the world as of April 3. Mexico has risen eight spots, from 32nd to 24th, while Canada has taken a slight dip from 26th to 29th. Using Elo, we hope to answer a simple question: did the games host nations played in the 18 months preceding their World Cup leave them in better or worse position in the global landscape? Most notable was a 3-1 defeat at then-74th ranked Japan, while the program notched credible draws against Denmark and Russia on home soil. Then came the U.S. Cup, a short-lived round robin tournament providing stout competition: Brazil, England and Germany. While the United States lost its opener to Brazil and lost a 4-3 slugfest against Germany, the middle match was an undeniable highlight. The USMNT beat England 2-0 in Foxborough, with Thomas Dooley and Alexi Lalas scoring. The USMNT fell back to earth immediately after, taking one point from its Copa América group. A month later, it finished as runner-up to Mexico in the 1993 Gold Cup, sinking to 55th at year's end after some more worrying friendlies. 1994 began in the same vein, with friendlies ranging from wins over Norway and Mexico to defeats against Sweden, Iceland and Chile. No match from this 18-month stretch carried as much weight, in the Elo ratings and in real life, as the U.S.'s 2-1 win over Colombia. The infamous result that ultimately cost Andrés Escobar his life helped the USMNT advance from its group, coupled with an opening-match draw against Switzerland. While the U.S. needed to enter and host any tournament it could to whip itself into readiness, France kept a fairly lean datebook during its run-up, playing just 15 games compared to its hosting predecessor's 49. France spent the entirety of its prep ranked either third or fourth in the Elo Ratings, averaging roughly one friendly a month against mostly European opposition. In a hosted friendly tournament akin to the U.S. Cup, France struggled, drawing with Brazil and Italy but losing to England. After all, youngsters Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet entered the tournament with just 14 combined international caps. France snapped out of its pre-tournament sleepwalk in a hurry, claiming all nine points on offer from a thin Group C despite Zinedine Zidane being sent off in its second group match. The tale of the 1998 final is largely told through a Brazilian's vantage point, as Ronaldo's pre-match convulsive fit led to Mário Zagallo removing him from his lineup before reinstating him just 45 minutes before kickoff. One of two nations to serve as the first co-hosts in tournament history, Japan also benefitted from the Confederations Cup no longer being a Saudi Arabian-organized standalone. Instead, this was the first installment where it served as a dress rehearsal for hosts a year out from the World Cup, providing meaningful matches in venues that would become familiar to a global audience the following summer. Japan won its group, beating Canada and Cameroon before playing Brazil to a scoreless draw. Japan then beat Australia 1-0 in the semifinal before falling to France in the final by an identical scoreline. As with the previous summer, Japan won its group after drawing with Belgium and beating Russia and Tunisia. As such, Japan finished this stretch in a near-identical standing to where it began at the start of 2001. While it did well to beat Mexico and Australia in its final group games, the blowout saw South Korea finish third in Group A, eliminated on goal difference. Like Japan, South Korea flanked its Confederations Cup appearance with friendlies. Wins over Croatia and the U.S. served as highpoints, while it suffered another 5-0 defeat shortly after the Confederations Cup, this time against Czech Republic. Unlike its co-hosts, however, South Korea participated in the 2002 Concacaf Gold Cup (held in January and February), hoping to bolster its preparations. Ultimately, they lost to eventual runner-up Costa Rica in a 3-1 semifinal before Canada beat them in the consolation game — the two most consequential results from this stretch according to the Elo Ratings. It was South Korea who fared better among the co-hosts. It kicked off its tournament with a 2-0 win over Poland, but a draw against the USMNT left Korean hopes of advancing in the balance entering the final game against Portugal. The visiting favorites did themselves no favors, as João Pinto drew a 29th-minute red card for sliding through the back of Park Ji-sung. Still a few years ahead of his move to Manchester United, Park scored the match-winner in the second half to vault South Korea to its knockout bracket in World Cup history – and famously send the U.S. through in the process. History hasn't been entirely favorable to the ensuing semifinal run. Francesco Totti was sent off in the round of 16 on a controversial call, while Spanish media still believe that then-FIFA executive Jack Warner rigged the quarterfinals by giving the cohosts a favorable referee assignment. No matter: after beating Italy on a golden goal, South Korea toppled Spain in PKs, only to have a storybook run ending with a 1-0 semifinal defeat to Germany. Jurgen Klinsmann had his work cut out for him ahead of Germany's hosting duties, having to fold in a rising generation (including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski) into the established core led by Oliver Kahn, Michael Ballack and Miroslav Klose. Controversially, Klinsmann took the captain's armband off of Kahn and thrust him into a goalkeeper competition with Jens Lehmann, unsettling the program's mainstays. The group made an unconvincing case at its Confederations Cup: wins against Australia, Tunisia and Mexico were overshadowed by a draw against Argentina and a 3-2 defeat to Brazil in a rematch of the 2002 final. Its preparations closed out with some concerning results, namely losses in Slovakia and Turkey. Italy logged a 4-1 win over Germany three months before the tournament, leaving many to wonder if Klinsmann was cut out for international management as the FIFA rankings placed the hosts 22nd. The Elo Ratings' head-to-head model liked them much more than that, though, positioning them 10th entering the 2006 World Cup. Germany left no bones about its group, beating Costa Rica, Poland and Ecuador by a combined 8-2 scoreline. A Podolski brace inside 12 minutes sprung the hosts to an early lead in the round of 16 against Sweden, seeing out that scoreline to book a date with pre-tournament favorite Argentina in the quarterfinal. Lehmann backed his coach's trust with some shootout heroics, working off research notes tucked in his sock before making two saves to send Germany to the semis. Seemingly, Lehmann would have another chance to unfurl paper from his hosiery. Germany went on to beat Portugal in the third place game, while Italy beat France after Zidane's infamous headbutt. Even compared to the plucky USMNT of 1994, no previous World Cup host was a clearer underdog who would've otherwise struggled to qualify than South Africa. Bafana Bafana made the field in 1998 and 2002, but was still in a rebuilding phase as 2009 kicked off. The guarantee of meaningful games provided ample opportunity for growth, between tournament hopefuls like Chile and Serbia wanting to pay the hosts a friendly visit and the Confederations Cup fielding top opponents. South Africa advanced from its Confederations Cup group after beating New Zealand and drawing with Iraq and falling against Spain. It lost to Brazil 1-0 in the semis and 3-2 in a consolation rematch against a Spain side reeling from its shocking defeat to the USMNT. The three losses began a six-match skid in the summer and fall of 2009, followed by friendly losses against Serbia, Germany and Ireland. The New Zealand win was its most impactful result of the build-up, followed by friendly victories over Norway, Jamaica and Colombia. While the tournament opener from Siphiwe Tshabalala was an instant classic, South Africa suffered from receiving an unusually tough draw for a host. South Africa sprung one last surprise by toppling a rudderless France 2-1 in the finale, but a -2 goal differential saw the hosts go out in a tie-breaker with Mexico. Twelve years after Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaká won Brazil's fifth World Cup, Neymar seemed poised to lead his nation to a record-extending sixth. Brazil opened 2013 with a 2-1 friendly loss to England at Wembley, then drew four of its next five games against Italy, Russia, Chile and England again. Pressure was building ahead of the Confederations Cup, but a perfect nine-point group stage against Japan, Mexico and Italy returned Brazil to the ascendency. The hosts ultimately won the tune-up tournament final against Spain, winning six of seven games to close 2013 in pole position. Their 2014 schedule was quite lean: a 5-0 win in South Africa, and a pair of wins against Panama and Serbia immediately before the group stage kicked off. First, the good: Brazil won its group with Mexico, Croatia and Cameroon and weathered a round-of-16 test by eliminating Chile in PKs. Their 2-1 win in the quarterfinal over Colombia was marred by Neymar exiting on a stretcher after taking a knee to his back, ruling him out for the competition. With Neymar injured and Thiago Silva suspended, Brazil was a shell of itself in a 7-1 scoreline that is among the most famous (or infamous, depending on your slant) results in history. That Germany went on to win the final provided no consolation. It's a loss from which Brazil has seemingly never recovered. Rather than play a balanced schedule of home and away matches, as most hosts before had done, Russia played all but two games at home, working to foster a staunch advantage when the tournament rolled around. While friendly results were uneven as the Russians invited likely qualifiers like Brazil, Spain and Argentina, their Confederations Cup was arguably even more worrisome. While Russia notched a 4-2 win in its first friendly after that, it failed to win any of the ensuing seven friendlies before the World Cup. Leaning into the feverish fan-created atmospheres, Russia shocked everyone by holding its own. Wins over Saudi Arabia and Egypt were enough to advance from their group despite a loss to Uruguay. Qatar didn't follow Russia's lead and instead took a page from South Korea's book by looking for additional tournaments. With AFC combining qualification for the World Cup and Asian Cup in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar got meaningful games against regional rivals before accepting an invitation into the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup. Qatar finished third, winning four games before losing to Algeria and beating Egypt on penalties in a third place game. 2022 featured many friendlies against lower-ranked opponents, with a 2-1 win over Panama (in Spain) being the standout result. Qatar went on to make history in 2022, just not how it had intended. It became the first World Cup host to exit a group stage without netting a single point. Its draw was tough, with matches against Netherlands, Senegal and Ecuador. Jeff Rueter  is a senior soccer writer for The Athletic who covers the game in North America, Europe, and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle Sounders FC are no strangers to high-stakes tournament soccer. They'll soon put that experience to the test at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, starting Sunday when storied Brazilian side Botafogo visit Lumen Field (10 pm ET | DAZN.com). This marks Seattle's second foray into the Club World Cup via their 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup title, the first coming in 2023 when they fell 1-0 to Egypt's Al Ahly in Morocco. "This is a well-earned, big deal," head coach Brian Schmetzer told reporters midweek. If I had to do that over again, I would have added one more exhibition game before we had to play Al Ahly. Seattle are part of arguably the most stacked group in the expanded 32-team tournament, highlighted by a dominant LaLiga power in Atlético and reigning UEFA Champions League winners PSG. Botafogo have championship credentials as well, winning last year's Brasileiro Série A and Copa Libertadores. Their squad includes several ex-MLS standouts, including forward Jefferson Savarino (Real Salt Lake) and midfielder Gregore (Inter Miami CF). "In group play, it's really important, when you're playing against really good competition, to have a good first game," midfielder Cristian Roldan said of Sunday's matchup. "So, the first game is extremely important, and I think that's our mentality going into group play. 3 home matches for @SoundersFC in Group B of the @FIFACWC. "We want to show that this league is capable of competing against the very best," Roldan said. "... We already talk about the quality that Botafogo, Atlético and PSG have. But you can minimize that quality by bringing the intensity." For Schmetzer, it's about proving what the Sounders are capable of – starting with a strong performance against Botafogo. "[Success would be] that we're competing and if there's any sort of result, draw or win," said the coach. "Success is measured by, for me internally, just if the guys play to their potential."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome to the dress rehearsal for a year from now when a chunk of the soccer world will descend on Seattle. This one, though, comes with a new twist on an attempt to bring together the international soccer community. A decidedly local angle and an opportunity for Sounders FC that may never come again. And an event that also begs the question: Will anyone really care? “We're all looking at this with a prism of this has never happened and we don't really know how this is going to play out,” said ESPN analyst and former Sounders goalkeeper Kasey Keller. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will kick off on Sunday night when the local side Sounders FC will face Brazilian club Botafogo for the first of six matches to be played at Lumen Field over the next two weeks. For FIFA and local officials, the Club World Cup is essentially a test event for next year when the FIFA Men's World Cup comes to Seattle for six matches over a three-week span that is expected to bring a significant number of international visitors and attention to the city and region. We've been discussing, kind of improvements on how we move people in and around the stadium, and so those things all will be very much examined,” said Peter Tomozawa, CEO of Seattle's organizing committee for next year's tournament. There are strong signs that even the most die-hard soccer fans aren't interested in spending their dollars to see some of these big clubs play in Seattle with uncertainty of how many of the top players for those teams might even see the field, although the initial rosters released for the event show teams are brining the majority of their stars. FIFA has slashed ticket prices in markets around the country, including Seattle, hoping that games don't end up getting played inside significantly empty stadiums. The Sounders went as far as a public protest before their last home match against Minnesota United on June 1. If the Club World Cup sounds familiar, you'd be correct. Their participation lasted one match in Morocco where they were eliminated by Egyptian side Al Ahly. But with the growing interest in club soccer around the world and the Men's World Cup being held in North America next year, FIFA saw an opportunity — both for exposure and financial gain — to launch plans for an expanded tournament for 2025. The 32-team event will follow a similar format to the World Cup, with each team guaranteed three group stage matches, and the top two teams in each group advancing to a knockout bracket. The final will be on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. No idea, but Erling Haaland and Manchester City will be here this summer. Turkey might not qualify either, but Inter Milan midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu might be the best player at his position in the world and will play in Seattle twice. Luka Modric is leaving Real Madrid after the Club World Cup and there's no guarantee he'll be back next year with Croatia. But player participation has come begrudgingly with growing concerns about overuse, especially for European players just finishing a long club season and knowing that next year will be another long campaign with additional matches for those hoping to play in the World Cup itself. “It really is a concern for players' well-being. ,” said Ron Krabill, professor and director of the Global Sports Lab at UW. The favorites are clear and obvious because they are the current powers of world soccer: Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Chelsea. But, depending on the rosters each club brings, an unexpected team could emerge as a contender. Sounders general manager Craig Waibel said the tournament will mean more when it's played next in 2029 because someone will have four years to brag about it. As an enticement for clubs and players to take the competition seriously, FIFA created a $1 billion prize pool for the tournament. But that's also led to issues for at least one team playing in Seattle: the Sounders. When MLS and its players agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 2021, an expanded Club World Cup including MLS teams wasn't even a dream. As part of the prize pool from FIFA, the three MLS teams are ensured of earning at least $9.55 million each from their participation. The teams can earn another $2 million for wins and $1 million for a draw in the group stage, while advancing to the knockout round would garner another $7.5 million. The frustration from players at such a paltry payment structure reached a tipping point on June 1 when Sounders players wore “Club World Ca$h Grab” shirts before their match against Minnesota United and owner Adrian Hanauer reportedly angrily confronting the players after the match. Whatever viewpoint fans take in looking at the tournament is probably fair. An optimist may look at the fact that PSG, Atlético Madrid, River Plate and Inter Milan will play competitive matches in Seattle for likely the only time ever, with two of those teams playing the hometown squad. “My uncle is coming from Germany just to watch these games,” Sounders FC coach Brian Schmetzer said. A pessimist will see high ticket prices that overestimated the interest of the tournament, clubs have no requirement of playing their top players, some odd starts times in order to appease overseas markets and the local side an underdog in two of its three matches. Both views are fair and add to the uncertainty of how this tournament will ultimately be received. “So we're going to have fun and at the end of the day, this is a game, it's a tournament. Seeing River Plate will be the last chance to watch 17-year-old young phenom Franco Mastantuono before his permanent move to Real Madrid. PSG might still be on a celebratory bender after winning the Champions League. And as Keller noted, the resources for the two clubs vastly different, noting that the transfers last year of Alvarez and Conor Gallagher to Atleti were $160 million which might equate to a decade worth of combined salaries for the Sounders. Still, Keller thinks the Sounders can be competitive in all three matches. “I wouldn't be surprised if they sneaked a draw or maybe even a win against somebody that came in sleeping,” Keller said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens call out Landon Donovan for his criticism of players pulling out of the USMNT, in the wake of the 4-0 defeat to Switzerland. Are you or a loved one "getting Concacafed?" Are you experiencing symptoms of a referee giving you a yellow card for getting punched by another player? Have you felt confusion upon watching another man somersault across the grass in anguish after you shook his hand to congratulate him on a nice play? Ever seen a group of ball boys shrug their shoulders and sit, immobile, after a goalkeeper literally punted the ball into the Atlantic Ocean? Arnold's newsletter celebrates the conundrum that is Concacaf -- a region that features two of the richest federations in all of the sport, the United States and Mexico; another one that mostly plays hockey, Canada; and then a bunch of other soccer-loving nations with varying (low) levels of resources and degrees of professionalism. This is the same federation within which Lionel Messi plays his club ball and the likes of Christian Pulisic and Alphonso Davies represent their countries. But what actually happens in Concacaf, from minute one through 90? It's a question with competitive consequences in the Gold Cup, which begins Saturday, for the U.S. men's national team, Mexico and Canada -- all of whom also hope to make it deep into next summer's World Cup. How different is the sport played here, compared with over there? We'll start with the place where it seems Concacaf is most different from everywhere else: its apparent tolerance for violence. Because there aren't many games in any one international tournament, we're using data from the past two Gold Cups, Copas América and Euros. And then we're using only this past season of Premier League data, since there are way more games. This should give us a sense of how Concacaf stacks up against the two best regions for international soccer and then the gold standard for club soccer. Though the Copa América has a reputation for being one big rock fight, there aren't as many fouls as in North America, and the referees are way quicker on the draw with their yellow and red cards. Part of the reason for the similar data is that a few Concacaf teams played in last summer's Copa América, but that's not enough to skew the numbers much. Now, take a look at our next graph: The possession game is more prevalent in Europe, but in the Premier League, teams are coming up against much more athletic players and much more aggressive pressing systems than in the Euros. So, in the Euros, it's not that these teams are better at passing than Premier League clubs; it's just a lot easier to pass. However, the average Gold Cup team attempts around 420 passes per game and completes 82% of them. Those are, nearly exactly, the same numbers that relegated Leicester City put up in the most recent Premier League season. Although the passing numbers are quite similar, the major area where Concacaf and CONMEBOL differ is in how often dribbles are attempted. Copa America teams attempt 21.2 take-ons per game -- the most of the four competitions we're looking at -- while Gold Cup squads try to beat their opponents on the dribble 17.7 times per game, second fewest in our dataset. This is where Concacaf sits on its own -- but not for the reasons you might think. When I say "aggression" here, I don't mean, "How much do you try to injure your opponents?" Instead, I mean: "How aggressively are teams trying to move the ball forward?" The longer passing and trigger-happy approach also leads to more moments of transition. Those possession and speed numbers are almost exactly what Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth averaged this past season. Tyler Adams was born to play in this tournament --- and yet, he never has. Depending on how serious his foot injury is, it's possible he never will. All right, so we now know that there are lots of fouls and very few cards at the Gold Cup. Broadly, this is what Gold Cup games look like. We know how teams are getting the ball forward, what midfield play tends to look like, and how frequently shots are being attempted. If there are two basic tactical takeaways from soccer's still-fledgling analytics movement, they are: (1) stop shooting from outside the box and (2) stop crossing so much. And even when crosses lead to shots, those shots tend to be with your head, and headers are way less likely to turn into goals than shots with your feet. The hallmark of every analytical revolution in sports was something obvious: For baseball players, getting on base is good, no matter how you do it; passing a football is easier than running; 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers; shots from close to the goal are more likely to go in. Well, as of yet, it doesn't appear as if anyone has told anyone in Concacaf any of these things. But in the Gold Cup, goals saved is right around expectation. The same kind of talent-level disparity doesn't exist in any kind of consistent way for keepers. And then there's pressure on the ball. Perhaps because defenders in the other regions are more talented, or their tactics are more fine-tuned, or because possession play isn't so hectic, the Gold Cup averages the fewest shots under what Stats Perform defines as high pressure, but the most shots under either moderate or low pressure. Defensive pressure, or even the possibility of defensive pressure, has a large effect on shot conversion -- and there's just not as much of it in the Gold Cup, so we get more goals. Most teams in Germany aren't employing typical underdog strategies, so Bayern don't have to figure out how to break down low blocks. But they're also way more talented than everyone else in the league thanks to their massive resource advantage, so they're not playing games where they can't just expect to dominate the ball. Then, in Europe, they play teams that challenge their claim to possession or fine-tune their own counterattacking strategies -- neither of which Bayern get any practice with at home. There's probably some similar kind of translatability problem for the likes of the U.S., Mexico and even Canada. Plus, Concacaf is quite different from what all of the USMNT's best players experience on a week in, week out basis for their club teams in Europe these days. But, uh, yeah: Mauricio Pochettino's team has been outshot 17 to 4 -- to the tune of 0.14 expected goals for and 3.2 xG against; one goal for, six against -- across the two first halves of the recent Turkiye and Switzerland matches. Also, the players playing this summer will only vaguely resemble the players who are playing next summer. Given the trending direction of recent results, that's probably a good thing, too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What should be a festive start to the FIFA Club World Cup in Seattle this Sunday has instead created fear and uncertainty for some fans. This comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suggested on social media that it would be involved in security at the matches. SEATTLE, Wash. - What should be a festive kickoff to the FIFA Club World Cup in Seattle this Sunday has instead sparked fear and uncertainty among some fans after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suggested on social media it would be involved in security at Club World Cup matches. But for some fans, the excitement is being overshadowed by rumors and social media posts suggesting increased immigration enforcement presence at matches — not just in Seattle, but across the country. Earlier this week, CBP shared a now-deleted post on its official channels stating, "Let the games begin – the first FIFA Club World Cup games starts on June 14 in Miami. CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games." The post has since been taken down but is still being circulated by outlets such as FOX Sports 940 AM in Miami. According to FOX's affiliate in Florida, FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed CBP agents would be working alongside Miami-Dade Sheriff's deputies to provide security for the matches in Florida. Concerns grew further after reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents advised non-citizens to bring proof of legal status to the matches. While that advisory appears specific to Miami, the uncertainty has reached fans in Seattle as well. Washington Governor Bob Ferguson addressed those concerns saying, "I'm not getting communication from the federal government about what they're doing. I want to be very clear about that," Ferguson said. A spokesperson said the city has been in contact with Gov. The office emphasized that Seattle does not coordinate or assist federal agencies in immigration enforcement. In comparison, a ticket to see Paris Saint-Germain — featuring some of the most well-known players in international soccer — costs around $117 – compared to $350 a year ago. While it's unclear whether the enforcement rumors are affecting sales, sports analyst Nico Moreno of Pulso Sports said the drop in demand isn't surprising. "But when I'm hearing that there's basically a fire sale on tickets, that people are getting free tickets if they bought the 300 level — people are being brought down from 300 levels down — it makes me feel like it's going to be a Portland vs. Sounders atmosphere." In a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, "U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup 26™ is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. During the 2023 Copa América final, hundreds of fans breached Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, an incident attributed to a lack of security personnel.
