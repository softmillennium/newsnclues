                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A column chronicling events and conversations on the awards circuit. The Primetime Emmys nominating ballot is live, voting began yesterday, and all this phase one voting, FYC events, and furious jockeying for attention by seemingly every member of the White Lotus cast is coming to a head. Meanwhile the official ballot brought the sad confirmation, as reported by Deadline, that in the Outstanding Talk Series there were only 13 entries, one short of triggering a 14th nomination so that means there will be only 3 nominees this year and thus you are only allowed to vote for 3. The Daily Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert were nominated in the category last year, as they all were the year before, with Daily Show winning both times (including with past host, Trevor Noah). One of them, along with 9 other hopefuls on a list that also includes The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Real Time With Bill Maher, and John Mulaney's weekly Netflix series are in danger of being blanked in the once robust category. This continues to cause annual consternation among those in Late Night, but if I were still on the Board Of Governors (as I was for 6 years representing the Writers Branch) I would just simply vote to set a minimum number of 4 nominees and a maximum number of 5 and be done with it. How 'Hacks' Recruited Julianne Nicholson To Play A Kooky Influencer This Season 2025-26 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Tonys, Emmys, Oscars & More Therefore knowing the dwindling odds here, and the fact that no broadcast network series has even managed a single win since Late Show With David Letterman in 2002 (from 2003 it has been either Daily Show in various incarnations, a couple for Colbert Report, both Comedy Central, or HBO's stranglehold with Last Week With John Oliver which finally was forced to move to Scripted Variety Series where it now beats SNL),  late nighter's are hedging their bets and also trying to find refuge – and Emmys – in the Outstanding Short Form Comedy, Drama, Variety Series category. Of those 14, more than one third of them come from Late Night: Overtime With Bill Maher; Late Night With Seth Meyers: Corrections; The Tonight Show During Commercial Break; The Daily Show: Desi Lydic Foxsplains, and the brand new entry, The Rabbit Hole With Jimmy Kimmel. As opposed to Fallon's Tonight Show  cleverly trying to win an Emmy for their commercial breaks since for years  they haven't been able to get nominated for what is actually on the show itself, Kimmel's shorts called The Rabbit Hole With Jimmy Kimmel are satirical takeoffs on various conspiracy theories. They are produced outside the series itself under the guidance of JKL executive producer and head writer Molly McNearney and writer/producer Jesse Joyce, both of whom joined me on a zoom earlier this week to talk about the concept that debuted on the JKL You Tube channel a couple of months ago. “Jesse is an impeccable, meticulous researcher, and he's often trying to get bits like this into our show. Unfortunately, we don't have time for a six-minute conspiracy bit in our monologues,” McNearney told me. Jesse was very passionate about writing these and putting them together and Jimmy was excited to parody these conspiracy theorists online, and you know, at a time where we have a president who speaks in conspiracy theories, it felt like a very significant time to parody.” Kimmel's tag line is “I'm just asking questions” and it leads to wild, but meticulously researched places such as tying the Moderna vaccine to Auntie Em from The Wizard Of Oz,  or the size of Elon Musk's “tiny testicles” to a line Nixon says on the Watergate tapes describing someone as “a little nuts”. Time travel, Windmills, waffle houses and more are other starting points for going down the ‘rabbit hole' with long and winding crazy conspiracy theories. Taking an average of 2 full 10 hour days just to connect the dots and do the extensive research, Joyce claims they are easy and dumb but that he can make a plausible argument out of anything. “If you go deep enough, because it's like the whole thing with conspiracies is just taking something random and small and just assigning tremendous value to it,” he says. “If you allow your brain to do that, you can make all kinds of spurious connections to nonsense, and yeah, and my head just kind of does that. The way they work is you have to lay a lot of track to get the fullest effect,” at which point McNearney noted you can take information and manipulate people very easily, you can just kind of make “truth” out of anything. A recent example would be Trump reposting some MAGA supporter's theory that Joe Biden was executed years ago and it was really a robot running the country as President Biden. Joyce points out conspiracy theories have been around throughout history by people ill-informed on just about everything. “Now, because of Twitter and YouTube and everything I have to hear about it all day long, from all these morons. It feels overwhelming, like they're everywhere, but I feel like there have always been just as many conspiracy dingbats,” he says. McNearney says their You Tube channel has 21 million subscribers and a lot of viewers are watching their show, or parts of it, online so viewing habits have really changed. “The priority, every day, is to put all the best material on our show, but we also know that a lot of people are watching it on their phones, and they're not watching an hourlong show at home on the couch anymore. So, we are trying to make it as easy to digest as possible online, and we do it with our monologue and the best moments of our guest interviews,” she said. “And then something like Rabbit Hole gets to live entirely online, which we think is where it belongs, you know, at the center of misinformation, the internet.” Check out a recent episode of The Rabbit Hole below: “But It would really be great if Jimmy won an Emmy for conspiracy theories, you know?” Speaking of conspiracy theories how is this for one? “Probably more so in the first decade,” she told me. Great answer, and one this Emmy winner (for Mare Of Easttown) certainly doesn't have to use much these days. A lot of people have definitely heard of Julianne Nicholson in her three decade career, and this year she is having quite a season with lots of awards buzz for not one, but two genuine shots at nominations. Of course she is no stranger to the Emmys. She already has one for her moving role as Lori Ross in 2021's Limited Series, Mare Of Easttown as Supporting Actress in a Limited Series, Movie or Anthology. A double win this year would land her Emmys in all three different acting categories, a feat that certainly confirms her versatility as an actor who can switch from genre to genre and drama to comedy with a great deal of success. The nominations have to come first and that would be the same kind of testament to Nicholson's prodigious talents, as if we already didn't know this. In terms of the roles, she really loved being asked to do such a wild character on Hacks, and has her “Dance Mom” figured out. “I think she just wants to dance, to start, but I think there is something a little unfulfilled in her, and she is just ill-equipped to deal with, you know, the trappings, and that was what was so much fun, to be able to do so…you know, that arc, that very extreme arc, happens in three pretty short episodes,” she said. “You see the whole roller coaster for her, and I just think those creators, those writers, they're just so smart and fearless about what they ask of their storytelling and their actors to do, and it just always pays off, as far as I can tell.” Normally, I feel like my work is sort of, I don't know, heart-centered or head-centered, and so, to be able to just let loose in your body, in that way, was so fun, and it is exhausting. I cannot imagine how Lucille Ball did that so many times. And she also really got to switch gears by playing a villain, a rare female villain in Paradise in which she co-stars with Sterling K. Brown and James Marsden. “Again, it's so fun to play something like I've never done before. I think she's fascinating,” Nicholson says about the character nicknamed Sinatra. “I think that it's fun to be the boss. It's fun to be all those things without having to be over the top, or physically intimidatingor raising your voice. Yes that is a word, and also she is showing us a tech billionaire as villain, something that in the past few months has been increasingly emulated in the world for real, more than ever, but Nicholson said it wasn't what they were thinking. “None of what's happening now was even on our minds when we were actually making it, and to have it sort of be playing out is definitely alarming, to say the least. I think they surpass even, you know, our entertainment.” Nicholson also is really happy about the names of these two characters this season. You think it could be many things, but ultimately, I think it was the president's dad, Cal's dad, who said that I'm like Sinatra because his son, President Cal, was like Peter Lawford (Sinatra's Rat Pack friend and co-star). Nicholson certainly is busy as she also plays a top CIA head in the feature film, The Amateur with Rami Malek, and completed a BBC series, Dope Girls in England where she lives. She hopes that one finds its way to the U.S. as well. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Okay, yes, it's true that there is a literal Supernatural episode titled "Jump the Shark," but, ironically, that was nowhere close to the actual shark-jumping moment that would later shift the series' tone into what would essentially become parody over time. There are a lot of opinions about when exactly Supernatural began to turn for the worst. Some say that anything after Season 5 could be discarded as the original mytharc was complete and series creator Eric Kripke stepped down as showrunner. Others say it was the Leviathan arc or the fact that Sam (Jared Padalecki) didn't look for Dean (Jensen Ackles) when he was trapped in Purgatory. After being killed in mortal combat against the angel Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) in the Season 9 finale, "Do You Believe In Miracles?," Dean opened his eyes to reveal himself to have become a demon. Having taken on the Mark of Cain in order to battle Metatron and Abaddon (Alaina Huffman), Dean learned that the mark was (apparently) irreversible and would ultimately turn him into a demon upon his death, cursing him to live forever. This led to the very short-lived Demon Dean (or "Deanmon") arc in Season 10's opening episodes, which, frankly, betrayed what so many people loved about the show. For years, Supernatural had pushed Dean into becoming more cozy with certain monsters and demons. It was these small compromises that led to Dean becoming the very thing he swore to hunt, all coming to a head the moment he opens his newly blackened eyes at the end of Season 9. For starters, the series never actually intended to turn Dean into a demon. Rather, that scene from the third season was a way for Dean to wrestle with his own death after making a demon deal in "All Hell Breaks Loose" to bring Sam back from the dead. Furthermore, Supernatural didn't even commit to Demon Dean. Rather than turning him into a cold-blooded monster (as so many demons are), he's portrayed really as just another jerk with black eyes. To make it worse, Dean is human again after only a few episodes, but the show would never be the same. It was an interesting medium to explore those tendencies that already existed in the character, and it was a promising new direction for the series. However, when it came to Demon Dean, the whole thing was terribly inconsistent. Why was Demon Dean all bark with no real bite? In the end, Demon Dean was nothing but shock and awe. It never contributed anything substantial to Dean's long-term arc, and it only opened the door further for the show to assassinate his character. In many ways, Demon Dean is a perfect example of how the second half of Supernatural's 15-season run would often introduce a new plotline, character, or story, only to forget about it entirely. Of course, what it did manage to do was give the series precedent to change Dean into someone his younger self would hardly recognize. Wanting to kill Jack (Alexander Calvert) for no reason after years of befriending "friendly" monsters, saying "yes" to becoming possessed by Michael at the end of Season 13, and even killing Death (Julian Richings) at the end of Season 10 (as if the Winchesters never learned anything from their consequences) all occurred after Dean was transformed into a demon. Demon Dean represents the gradual shift in Supernatural as the show became more of a parody of what made it great originally. The early seasons were great because it was a road horror show that followed two brothers as they hunted ghosts, monsters, and demons, only to eventually take on the Devil (Mark Pellegrino) himself. Even when the show fumbled to find a new voice in Seasons 6 and 7, it maintained its grip on who Sam and Dean were (for the most part). Season 8 continued to offer more promise for the show, but by the end of Season 9, it felt that the show — and Sam and Dean as characters — had become a spoof of what it once was. As the show went on, Dean felt more like a stock character (compared to his younger self), and while we still got some meaty material in select episodes, the show grew beyond what made it work so well at first. So much of this can be traced back to that brief Demon Dean arc. It was a moment where the show, just threw an idea at the wall to see if it would stick. This same technique would occur over and over again as the show ran for more seasons, and it's no wonder that Dean's arc had to ultimately be resolved on the spin-off series, The Winchesters. Make no mistake, Supernatural had great moments throughout its entire run, but there's a reason that the first half of the show is far more beloved than the second — and with plotlines like Demon Dean, we can see why.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supposed sightings of highly advanced aircraft zipping through our skies gave us hope that maybe one day we would be able to make friends with a celestial neighbor. Or, a lot of those sightings could have been fictionalized by the government to distract from their secret projects. This idea comes to us in the form of a report, not from some Internet forum board filled with crackpots, but from actual investigative journalists pushing their work in The Wall Street Journal. When, in reality, it was all stuff fictionalized by the Pentagon to distract the public from what was really going on. And the “what was really going on part” is just secret projects developing technology that they wanted to keep secret. Kirkpatrick says he launched an internal investigation and found that the U.S. government fed us strange tales of UFO sightings to throw people off the scent of classified weapons programs. Take one 1967 incident at a nuclear missile bunker, for example. A guard saw a “reddish-orange oval” floating near the front gate, and not long after, the base's nukes mysteriously shut down. But the real culprit was an experimental electromagnetic pulse generator that glowed orange when charged. According to the report, even military brass got fooled by some of these distractions. For decades, new commanders of top-secret Air Force programs were shown a photo of a supposed alien spacecraft and told their mission was to reverse-engineer it. And many officers didn't find that out until way later, if ever. The answer to all of that is probably yes and maybe some no, but also probably more yeses than nos. But considering how the federal government has spent the past eight years basically screaming at us that aliens are real and that they regularly visit us, and yet we still don't seem to care about it, I don't think we're going to care if we ultimately receive a definitive answer on any of this. Those big-headed, gray-skinned freaks better start blowing up some landmarks if they want us to truly start caring about them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Are you passionate about abandoned villages and eerie sites with decaying buildings? Photographers are often intrigued by deserted places that were once bustling (or had big plans to be), such as Hashima Island in Japan, once a hub for the rich, and Burj Al Babas, in Turkey, a Disney-style ghost town with 587 abandoned castles. If you're a fan of ghost towns and abandoned structures, there's a lesser-known village worth adding to your bucket list of places to take your camera for uncanny photographs. A remote Texas town is facing serious trouble thanks to an abandoned oil well. Let's explore what this means for the people living there. The so-called UFO village in Taiwan has attracted photography lovers for years thanks to its unique houses, most of which have been abandoned for decades. Here's everything you should know about this bizarre yet eerily cool site, from its construction in the 1970s to the many paranormal stories associated with it and valuable tips for those planning to visit. Located in the remote region of Sanzhi in Taiwan, the UFO village, also known as Sanzhi Pod City, Wanli UFO Village, and Sanzhi UFO Houses, is an abandoned site that was created to attract plenty of tourists but never achieved success. Built in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this vacation resort was meant to attract visitors thanks to its unique houses designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, which are shaped like flying saucers and cubes. Lovers of bizarre buildings, such as the famous Kunsthofpassage's singing wall in Dresden, will surely fall in love with these houses shaped like UFOs, cubes, and hovering saucers. The accommodations featured bright colors and were intended to look as if made of a single piece. Unfortunately, Taiwan's UFO village project was never truly successful. On top of this, there seem to have been legal and bureaucratic problems concerning permits and ownership rights of the land. Work on the vacation resorts resumed again in 1989 and 2010. However, the project was eventually abandoned due to a lack of funds. However, another reason contributed significantly to the site's downfall: eerie stories about paranormal activity. It's no secret that many Taiwanese people are highly superstitious. Unfortunately, the UFO village soon became known among locals due to strange stories and eerie accidents. People reported strange lights and noises, which, although difficult to verify, surely didn't help advertise the site. Many Taiwanese believe that when graves are not properly taken care of, the deceased buried there may come back, causing great misfortune. Rumors spread about body parts found during construction work, builders falling ill, and unexplained accidents. While the UFO village was never truly used for its initial purpose, it remains relatively popular among photographers and those passionate about eerie and spooky places. Remember that while the village is considered mostly abandoned, some people still live here, so respect their privacy and avoid taking pictures of their homes. Google Maps tends to be reliable in the country, but you can always ask locals for extra help. Abandoned villages have always fascinated tourists with their spooky and eerie vibes. There are plenty of options, from Vulture City, a ghost town in Arizona, to Terlingua, Texas, one of the USA's most underrated ghost towns. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Cancun International Airport revealed a promising stat involving expensive taxis. The US Embassy didn't take kindly to Canada's recent travel warning. Nature lovers should be cautious when flying for a camping trip, as these popular items are banned in both carry-on and checked bags. A U.S. airline just announced it will cease all operations, leaving passengers stranded.</p>

But as supplies of this surface water have dried up over the past two decades — reaching record lows — more and more people have been pumping groundwater from far below the surface, mainly for agricultural use. To get a better idea of how much groundwater is being extracted, Jay Famiglietti, director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative at Arizona State University, and his colleagues turned to data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite missions. These satellites track changes in Earth's gravity field to measure shifts in the amount of water above and below the ground, and when combined with data on snowpack, surface water and soil moisture, this information can allow scientists to estimate how much groundwater has been depleted. The researchers estimate that since 2003, pumping from wells has drained about 28 million acre feet (34 cubic kilometers) of groundwater from the Colorado River Basin. In these largely rural areas, farms aren't usually hooked up to municipal water systems, and instead rely on water pumped from wells on the property. Because the wells are private, there is often no municipal, county- or state-level measurement of how much water they are drawing up.

Famiglietti and his colleagues estimate that annual groundwater losses in the basin averaged more than 1.2 million acre-feet (1.5 cubic kilometers) and if the trend continues, it could lead to water shortages and limit food production. "We're passing a critical point where it is getting more and more expensive to go deeper into the aquifer, and the water quality is dropping," Famiglietti said. Dozens of wells have dried up in the area. Collapsing aquifers have caused land subsidence, and created fissures. The groundwater won't run out, he said, but neither GRACE satellite data nor measurements of water use will tell us exactly how much water is left in aquifers. "It's almost like it's an unknowable number in the same way that if someone said how many grains of sand are on the beach, you could make some assumptions and make some guesses but you can never actually know the exact amount of sand grains," Mitchell said. They saw similar patterns, finding that there was a period of high groundwater use as irrigation expanded between the 1940s and 1970s. Related: Atlantic ocean currents are weakening — and it could make the climate in some regions unrecognizable But since then, the picture has differed depending on how areas are managed. In unmanaged areas, no agency tracks how much groundwater is pumped, so agencies don't know when to replenish the aquifers. High extraction in unmanaged areas is driving the overall draining of groundwater, Scanlon told Live Science. Drilling deeper wells is one solution, but there are problems with that, Famiglietti said. At some point, it will cost millions of dollars for a deep-enough well that will have high energy costs to pump water, he said, and that water is likely to require treatment. "As you go deeper into the groundwater, that water has been sitting around in contact with soil and rocks for a long time, so it's dissolving solids and salts," Famiglietti said. Another option is to reduce water use, by, for example, changing what is farmed, to shift from water-intensive crops like alfalfa, Famiglietti said. "It can't be business as usual," he said. "We have to think about what our priorities are for water use." Every expert Live Science talked with suggested that extending the area covered by active water management areas would help — first, by keeping tabs on what is being used where, and then trying to replace what is used. As part of such schemes, water could be brought in from elsewhere, Scanlon said. For example, this already happens when San Antonio buys water and pipes it from East Texas more than 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. —Atlantic ocean currents are weakening — and it could make the climate in some regions unrecognizable —Over half of the world's largest lakes and reservoirs are losing water —'Precipitation, the source of all fresh water, can no longer be relied upon': Global water cycle pushed out of balance 'for 1st time in human history' He said Scanlon's research shows that "we're doing OK in the active management areas, and we're not doing so hot in the areas where we don't have some kind of framework in place." A legislative bill to extend the areas that are actively managed has been proposed in Arizona, but similar ones have stalled after facing opposition. Those opposed say restricting water doesn't protect existing agricultural use of groundwater and will stifle economic growth. Some also object to water use being decided at the state level when they would prefer smaller water districts with locally elected directors. "But it's hard because trust in governments is at an all-time low.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and researcher into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), the modern term for UFO sightings, suggests that humanity may soon have to confront the reality of alien existence and enter a new phase of comprehension. This comes amid increasing revelations about supposed encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Notably, an odd, spherical object found in Colombia is thought by some scientists to be a fragment of UFO technology. The artifact features symbols reminiscent of ancient scripts, such as runes, and scientists have employed artificial intelligence in attempts to decode the cryptic writing. "One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true," she remarked, noting that it leads to confusion when something arises that doesn't "fit our model of the world." Mossbridge herself remains doubtful about the sphere being a genuine UFO, despite public conviction. "The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project," she commented. Well, I think it's partly the same reason. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us." Conversely, Dr. Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere, found no evidence suggesting human creation. More testing is needed to establish its origin," he stated. According to Mail Online, his research team utilized AI to help decode the design, interpreting it as: "The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness - individual consciousness." They suggested: "We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth-especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline." Often brushed off as merely an art project, experts now believe that the "alien" mummies of Peru may have been victims of murder. Scientists studying the enigmatic three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have made new discoveries they assert confirm the specimens are '100% real'.

A second posted: “Supernatural isn't even ON Netflix in Germany but amazon prime instead.” Someone else echoed similar sentiments: “Supernatural isn't even on Netflix in my country (Bulgaria) and I think you should fix that immediately.” A fourth disgruntled fan said: “You are so right. Another person noted: “supernatural ain't even ur show bro [sic].” Others were furious at Supernatural being removed from Netflix after having access to it on the streamer. One irate Supernatural fan wrote: “@netflix Can you give us one good reason why you are discontinuing Supernatural on your service? “It still has and always will have a rabid following, with new fans popping up all the time. “Yeah...so don't take Supernatural away from us,” said a second. A third wrote: “aren't you removing spn from netflix in the us... [sic].” Supernatural is currently available to watch on Prime Video in the UK for those with a membership. For a fee, you can also watch the fantasy series on Apple TV+ or YouTube. Netflix US currently has Supernatural available on its service, but is scheduled to leave the platform on December 18, according to CBR. During its time on screens, Supernatural became the longest-running American live-action fantasy TV show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brooklyn Beckham has been feuding with his family over reports that he's fell out with him famous parents, David and Victoria. After the news of him reportedly not planning to attend his dad's pending knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list. We spoke to celebrity pyschic Inbaal Honigman in collaboration with https://www.casino.org/uk/ about her hot take on the family family feud. "At this stage, and for the next four weeks, the Tarot predicts that things can only intensify and deteriorate before they start to recover. "Blocking each other's socials, sending public barbed comments, and taking their sibling rivalry to the max, the coming month brings no relief from this strife." She explained: "This situation is not a permanent one. There are hurt feelings all over, and some things are going to get worse before they get better. In such a big family, it's easy for a sibling to feel left out, and instead of sharing and communicating, they choose to act out. Brooklyn isolated, and in his hurt, and most likely did some things that caused the rift to escalate. "They'll make amends, and a healing will start, but not in the next few weeks. But the ultimate question this week is will Brooklyn attend his father's knighthood ceremony? "Unfortunately, the Tarot doesn't show Brooklyn at his father's knighthood ceremony. "One of the brothers is trying to advocate for this presently. Brooklyn's younger siblings are reaching out and asking him to turn up to the event, because those photos are for life, and the siblings know how sad it would make David, if he's not able to share his special moment with all his children. But his firstborn won't be able to make it that day." Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz's relationship is reportedly being prioritised over his relationship with his family, and some fans have been wondering if they marriage will last the tension. They value stability and love sharing their lives with each other. "The 3 of Wands Tarot card indicates that temptation is never too far away, but their family values and mutual love keep them together. "Nicola herself would like to see Brooklyn reconcile with his family." Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A devastating air crash occurred on Thursday afternoon when Air India Flight AI 171 (Boeing 787 Dreamliner), crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The plane, which was bound for London, crashed into a medical college complex, killing 241 people and leaving only one survivor. Former Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was among the passengers. Speculation grows online, blaming Pakistan, Khalistanis and more In the absence of confirmed information, social media has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Various users have suggested sabotage, pointing fingers at Pakistan's intelligence agency, Kashmiri separatists, and pro-Khalistani groups, especially in the wake of a recent terror attack in Pahalgam. Additionally, questions have been raised about Air India's use of a Turkish firm for maintaining its wide-body aircraft, though no evidence has surfaced linking this to the crash. Thursday's tragedy has brought fresh attention to Boeing's long-standing manufacturing and safety issues, particularly involving its 787 Dreamliner. Although Boeing maintained a strong safety record for 14 years, recent incidents have raised serious concerns. That year, the entire fleet was grounded due to incidents of battery fires. Later, Boeing had to suspend all Dreamliner deliveries for almost two years because of manufacturing defects, including structural gaps and use of non-compliant materials. Concerns about Boeing's practices grew even further earlier this year when John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's South Carolina plant, was found dead shortly after testifying in a legal case involving Boeing. Although authorities ruled his death a suicide and found no signs of foul play, many social media users have connected his death to Boeing's internal issues. His earlier warnings about poor production quality have resurfaced in public discussions following Thursday's crash. Boeing is still recovering from the fallout of two previous disasters involving its 737 Max aircraft, which crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. In May this year, the company reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice that allowed it to avoid criminal prosecution for those incidents. Despite Boeing's assurances that it has corrected past errors, critics continue to question the company's approach to safety and quality control. A detailed investigation into the Ahmedabad crash has begun, with Indian authorities expected to work alongside international aviation experts. Boeing has confirmed that it will cooperate fully with the inquiry. Disclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.</p>
