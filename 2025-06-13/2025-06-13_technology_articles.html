                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Agents of the Trump administration are increasingly using social media posts to crack down on immigrants, tourists, and even some U.S. citizens. Last month, a leaked document showed the State Department had crafted a new standard for reviewing the social media accounts of any foreign students planning to attend or even visit Harvard University. Legal immigrants may have benefits denied based on social media activity, and people expressing opinions or acting contrary to Trump are being detained at airports. That's when I was invited to use Block Party. It's not, by its nature, a politically charged app. Privatizing your social media accounts helps keep big tech from building data profiles based on your activity, which it then uses for targeted advertising, but it may not be enough to completely deter a visit from Customs and Border Protection as you muscle through airport security after coming to the States. [Editor's note: Getting thrown into another bin for targeted advertising isn't great either, but it's better than getting thrown into Guantanamo.] At the very least, it may make the jobs of federal agencies—or anybody looking for dirt on you based on your online activity—a little harder. For the time being, that might be enough to help you avoid being held up by U.S. officials for hours in an airport. You can simply delete your profiles, but as somebody who still needs to remain active on social media, Block Party is one of the better options I've personally used to get into the weeds of my accounts' esoteric privacy settings. It even helps you find settings in some apps to keep AI from scraping your posts. According to a Politico report on the leaked State Department document, the U.S. government imagines foreign students' lack of a social presence or privatized social media “may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.” The Trump administration may ascribe this same standard to U.S. citizens. Already, there are concerning examples of agents targeting supposed Trump opponents. Left-wing influencer Hasan Piker said in May that he was detained and questioned for hours by Homeland Security after he came back to Chicago from France. In April, immigration agents detained Michigan-based attorney Amir Makled at an airport for more than an hour as he returned home from the Dominican Republic. However, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's proclamation that privatizing social media was somehow an indication of “evasiveness,” it's still a good idea to privatize your socials before crossing the border to the U.S. And it's not just protesters who need to think long and hard about what thoughts of theirs are shared online. After Trump's inauguration, she said she's received interest from both current and former government workers from multiple federal agencies, afraid their previously innocuous social media posts could be used as ammunition for right-wing groups. Government workers weren't just trying to avoid the eyes of Trump and DOGE. Chou gave an example of people who worked in the Department of Justice's civil rights division who were trying to avoid attacks from right-wing groups online. You can find a loose gaggle of tutorials online for turning on social media privacy settings, but even an experienced user will be surprised by just how many settings there are to limit. You may also want to look into subscriptions such as DeleteMe or Kanary, which work to eliminate information data brokers have on you and remove data from some websites. Block Party is more concerned with restricting the data big tech companies can garner from your social accounts. Block Party currently works with X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Venmo, Instagram, Reddit, Strava, YouTube, Bluesky, and Google. Additionally, Block Party will only impact the mobile versions of TikTok and Snapchat. Chou said her team is planning to support more apps in the future. Some settings can be done for you with the tap of a button, but various settings will take some attention on your part. On LinkedIn, Block Party can automatically turn off settings to “represent company,” a sneaky setting used for sponsored ads about your employer. Even using Block Party, the process of tuning all your socials is time-consuming. Block Party recommends you change YouTube settings to limit viewing history. She said she offers Block Party free to staff, but even that may not be enough in this age, where her activities as an advocate are receiving more and more scrutiny. Beyond massaging your social accounts, travelers need to start considering device security. VPNs, which help hide your IP address and keep you anonymous when online, are also good to have on hand. Non-violent political opinions posted to social media still don't meet grounds for an arrest just because Trump is in office. At the same time, Trump's administration has continued to ignore court decrees, and his flaunting of the law may turn on American citizens as well. Again, knowing your rights can still lead to delays. “If there's anything remotely controversial, I would delete that post, privatize the account, or even shut down the account,” Cope said. When I asked Jankowicz whether privatizing your social media can make it harder to organize, she responded bluntly: ”Yes.” “Researchers are a lot more reticent to be on things like Signal group chats or on email chains and message boards,” she said. “The toll it takes on attempting to muster a collaborative response on anything that's happening to the community is really difficult.” Privatizing your social media can't be a panacea for your travel anxieties, especially if you still want to use these apps to communicate with friends or organize for causes you care about. The best it can do is make a government operator's job harder, and since there are so many accounts to monitor, you may slip through the dragnet.

While some welcome the change, other experts warn that this move could make it even harder to access scientific information in Trump's America. "The FEMA thing has not been a very successful experiment," Trump said. The world's richest man navigates a treacherous period, marked by an insult-filled public feud with Donald Trump, a figure he significantly helped return to the White House.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a founder, time is the one resource you can't raise. That's why TechCrunch All Stage — happening July 15 in Boston's SoWa Power Station — is designed to make every minute count. Startups don't have time for fluffy panels or surface-level networking. Every element of TechCrunch All Stage is curated with builders in mind — from breakout sessions that dive into the real mechanics of scaling, to pitch feedback that doesn't pull punches, to after-hours events where honest convos happen over drinks instead of decks. You might sit in on a roundtable about refining your GTM strategy, led by someone who just exited. You'll hear from Charles Hudson, founder and managing partner of Precursor Ventures, about what VCs look for within YOU, not just your company. TechCrunch All Stage pulls in top investors, but not to hide them behind booths or panels. For founders, that means organic access to people who write checks and know what it's like to be in your shoes. It's not about handing over a pitch deck and hoping for the best. No one expects you to perfect your elevator pitch for 10 hours straight. What you will do is spend a full day immersed in startup momentum — getting live feedback, listening to raw stories from fellow founders, and trading ideas that make you rethink your next move in the best way. If you're a founder, this isn't just another event to attend. And don't forget: Early-bird pricing ends June 22 — save up to $210 when you grab your pass now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, United States Customs and Border Protection confirmed to 404 Media that it has been flying Predator drones over Los Angeles amid the LA protests. The military drones, a CBP statement said, “are supporting our federal law enforcement partners in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with aerial support of their operations.” State-level law enforcement agencies across the US use various types of drones and other vehicles, like helicopters, to conduct aerial surveillance, and other agencies use drones in their operations as well. And, in the intervening years, researchers have tracked Department of Homeland Security Predator drones flying over various US cities with no clear explanation. “If the federal government portrays immigration as a national security issue, we shouldn't be surprised if it openly uses the tools of national security—i.e., military hardware—in response.” Carrying powerful cameras and other sensors, Predator drones can record clear, detailed footage of events like protests from high altitudes. CBP's “Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is providing aerial support to federal law enforcement partners conducting operations in the Greater Los Angeles area,” CBP told WIRED in a statement responding to questions about whether the operation over LA is routine or anomalous. “AMO's efforts are focused on situational awareness and officer safety support as requested.” CBP told 404 Media this week that “AMO is not engaged in the surveillance of first amendment activities.” That statement aligns with a commitment the US Department of Homeland Security made in December 2015. In practice, though, it is unclear how the Predator surveillance could “support” ICE agents and other federal law enforcement without monitoring the protests and capturing images of protesters. While researchers note that the use of Predator drones over LA is not unprecedented—and, at this point, perhaps not surprising—they emphasize that this pattern of activity over time only makes it more likely that the federal government will deploy such monitoring in the future, regardless of how a state is handling a situation. “It's not new or even all that unexpected from a spooked Trump administration, but it's still a terrible use of military technology on civilian populations,” says UAV researcher Faine Greenwood.

Best Travel Tote Bag OverallAway The Everywhere ToteRead more Bean Zip Hunter's Tote Bag With StrapRead more It seems like totes don't want to work these days. You want something spacious, wipeable, and tough enough to survive TSA. They don't collapse under pressure, don't mind getting dirty, and, most importantly, carry your baggage (emotional or otherwise). For business travelers and solo flyers who pack light, the Away Everywhere Tote is the one-bag solution for back-to-back meetings, red-eye flights, and weekend getaways. Made from water-resistant nylon and accented with leather trim, it was clearly designed by someone who knows the realities of travel: fumbling through security lines, sprinting to trains, dodging coffee spills. The dimensions are dialed in to meet most airlines' personal item requirements, and it comes in a variety of low-key tones, from coastal blue to clay pink. A full top zipper keeps your essentials secure. There's a trolley sleeve that slides over a rolling luggage handle (though be warned: it looks like the exterior zip pocket, which has caused me more than one accidental drop). Just know this: There's no dedicated water bottle pocket, which feels like a strange omission in 2025. Bean's Field Tote is all grit and no gimmicks: a thick, double-layered polyester shell, burly double-stitched seams, and handles that feel industrial. Inside, a thermoplastic lining shrugs off moisture, mud, and mystery goo with wipe-clean ease. It's a single, cavernous compartment, with no fussy pockets. There's an open-top version, but we love the zip-top model for travel. WIRED director Michael Calore tested the extra-large, 53-liter version, and it's massive enough for a week's worth of produce, a couple half-gallon cartons of oat milk, and a 12-pack of hard kombucha if you're also planning on going grocery shopping during your vacation. If you're shopping for a travel tote that's as stylish as it is packable, the Longchamp Le Pliage Xtra M is a jet-setter's dream. This updated model of the best-selling Le Pliage is ideal for slipping under the seat in front of you or sightseeing through a new city. The rich leather trim and nylon body complement most outfits, and it comes in eight sophisticated shades (though the cognac brown is a standout). The base is 7.5 inches deep, so while it doesn't look that big in pictures, it holds an astonishing amount of stuff—I've packed enough clothes in it for a full weekend trip. I usually have concerns about vegan leather cracking and breaking with use, but Cincha's soft pebbled fabric does not look or feel obviously plastic. It has stood up to several months of use being tossed in and around car trunks without getting scuffed or cracking. mesh water bottle holders in the interior, a laptop sleeve that holds a 13-inch laptop, and three interior pockets (one that zips shut). There is one exterior zip pocket that fits my iPhone for easy access. As far as carrying options go, it has two grab handles, two hidden fabric shoulder straps that tuck away into zip pockets, and my favorite accessory—two loops for the separate travel belt so you can strap it to the rest of your luggage. However, it is more than 2 pounds heavier than a Longchamp Le Pliage, so this is strictly for when you can sling it around on top of your carry-on. The Cuyana System Tote is a modular gear-hauler that shape-shifts with your itinerary. Designed to outlast the churn of fast fashion, this travel tote starts minimal, but the genius lies in its add-ons. A laptop sleeve or insert organizer creates a structure on the go, with dedicated slots for your computer, water bottle, and other work essentials. Instead of stitched-on straps prone to failure, the System Tote's handles are cut directly from its leather body, minimizing points of wear. The Classic Easy Tote ($298) offers a zippered alternative. What sets BaubleBar apart is its playful personalization. The process is super user-friendly, with predesignated spots to help you visualize your picks. Choose from zodiac signs, cutesy foods, initials, and more. Just note that it's a final sale, so be sure of your design before ordering. The large size fits everything you need for a beach day trip, and the medium and small options are better for light shopping or city exploring. It closes with just a snap button, which isn't the most secure for crowded areas. I recently took this versatile and large tote from Topo Designs to Colorado for a long weekend as a stand-in for my ski boot bag (yes, Arapahoe Basin is still open!) Come July, this tote will make the perfect bag for my cook kit on a summer camping road trip. When you have a tote this stylish and durable the question is not whether it's coming on the trip but what you're going to use it for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time in decades, active-duty US Marines are rolling into Los Angeles—not for disaster relief or training drills, but to guard federal buildings during a protest crackdown that legal experts say threatens long-standing limits on military power at home. Mobilized under Title 10 orders, the Marines have been commanded to protect federal property and personnel from mounting protests over aggressive immigration raids and neighborhood sweeps. It is a rare and forceful use of federal military power on US soil. The mobilization follows Trump's June 7 order that federalized as many as 4,000 California national guardsmen, overriding the objections of state officials and igniting a high-stakes legal fight. Protests began Friday in Westlake, an immigrant-heavy neighborhood near downtown LA, where residents rallied in response to sweeping ICE raids that targeted day laborers outside local businesses. Demonstrators marched, held signs, and chanted for several hours before tensions escalated after police declared an unlawful assembly and advanced on the crowd. Widespread protests are expected in LA and at some 2,000 other locations around the US this weekend. While the president holds broad emergency powers, legal scholars say that without invoking the Insurrection Act—a statute that permits domestic troop deployments only in cases of a rebellion or civil rights violations—federal law sharply limits what active-duty forces can do. Federal troops are prohibited from arresting civilians, searching property, and collecting evidence. Unless a crime is committed by a service member or on military property, Title 10 forces are likewise banned from engaging in any kind of forensics for the benefit of civilian police—unless they are willing to put in writing that such evidence was obtained by consent. That said, there are numerous scenarios in which the military can provide assistance to police, including by giving them “information” obtained “in the normal course” of their duties, unless applicable privacy laws prohibit it. Military members can also provide police with a wide variety of assistance so long as it's in a “private capacity” and they're off duty. And while military personnel are naturally expected to maintain order and discipline at all times, under no circumstances are they required to stand down when their lives, or the lives of others, are in immediate danger. Still, enforcement of these rules in the field is far from guaranteed. Legal experts warn that adherence often varies in chaotic environments. Trump administration officials have also demonstrated a willingness to skirt the law. Last week, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem asked the Pentagon to authorize military assistance in conducting arrests and to deploy drone surveillance, according to a letter obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle—a move experts say directly contradicts standing legal prohibitions. At a press conference on Thursday, Noem stated the federal government was on a mission to “liberate” Los Angeles from “socialists” and the “leadership” of California governor Gavin Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass. Unlike the National Guard, which is well trained for domestic crowd control, active-duty Marines generally receive relatively little instruction in handling civil unrest. Those who do typically belong to military police or specialized security units. Nonetheless, the Marine Corps has published footage online showing various task forces training with riot-control tactics and “nonlethal” weapons. In a statement on Wednesday, US Northern Command, which oversees military support to nonmilitary authorities in the contiguous 48 states, confirmed the Marines had undergone training in all “mission essential tasks,” including “de-escalation” and “crowd control.” They will reportedly be accompanied by legal and law enforcement experts. Constitutional experts warn that deploying military forces against civilian demonstrators blurs the line between law enforcement and military power, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for unchecked presidential authority. The risk deepens, they say, if federal troops overstep their legal bounds. If lines are crossed, it could open a door that may not close easily—clearing the way for future crackdowns that erode Americans' hard-won civil liberties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>> The design patterns we propose share a common guiding principle: once an LLM agent has ingested untrusted input, it must be constrained so that it is impossible for that input to trigger any consequential actions—that is, actions with negative side effects on the system or its environment.This is the key thing people need to understand about why prompt injection is such a critical issue, especially now everyone is wiring LLMs together with tools and MCP servers and building "agents". Take the article's example "send today's schedule to my boss John Doe" where the product isn't entirely guarded by the Plan-Then-Execute model (injections can still mutate email body).But if you combine it with the symbolic data store that is blind, it becomes more like:    "send today's schedule to my boss John Doe" --> $var1 = find_contact("John Doe") $var2 = summarize_schedule("today") send_email(recipient: $var1, body: $var2) In this case you're pretty decently protected from prompt injection.I suppose though this isn't that different from the "Code-Then-Execute" pattern later on...

I suppose though this isn't that different from the "Code-Then-Execute" pattern later on... i think basically all of them involve reducing the "agency" of the agents though - which is a fine tradeoff - but i think one should be aware that the Big Model folks dont try to engineer any of these and just collect data to keep reducing injection risk. the tradeoff of capability maxxing vs efficiency/security often tends to be won by the capabilitymaxxers in terms of product adoption/marketing.eg the SWE Agent case study recommends Dual LLM with strict data formatting - would like to see this benchmarked in terms of how much of a perfomance an agent like this would be, perhaps doable by forking openai codex and implementing the dual llm. eg the SWE Agent case study recommends Dual LLM with strict data formatting - would like to see this benchmarked in terms of how much of a perfomance an agent like this would be, perhaps doable by forking openai codex and implementing the dual llm. These patterns impose intentional constraints on agents, explicitly limiting their ability to perform arbitrary tasks. I imagine a lot of people will ignore this advice! The problem with prompt injection is that the attack itself is the same as SQL injection - concatenation trusted and untrusted strings together -  but so far all of our attempts at implementing a solution similar to parameterized queries (such as system prompts and prompt delimiters) have failed. Long ago I encountered a predecessor's "web scripting language" product... it worked based on repeatedly evaluating a string and substituting the result, until it stopped mutating.</p>

However, one that's a little easier to overlook and forget about is the number of USB ports you've got. There are a few devices that'll do that for you, but a really good one is this HP USB-C Dock, which can turn one USB-C port into 11 different ports, making it really easy to use more accessories. This means you can do more creative tasks, add more webcams, or just fill them with play-dough if you want to. Anyway, this awesome device is currently 54% off, which means it's down to just $105 at the moment. This device is incredibly easy to use, and it's highly compatible. You get not only extra USB ports, but also two DisplayPorts, one HDMI port, and one gigabit Ethernet port as well. This is pretty much the perfect device for anyone who commutes but needs more ports, or those who want more things attached to their PC but can't afford a proper upgrade for whatever reason. It's just really convenient, and it also makes these ports a lot easier to get to than they are normally. Well, with this thing plugged in, you don't have to deal with that, you can access a bunch of essential ports on your desk without having to get a load of dust and all the random things your cats drag around on you. We'd recommend acting quickly if you're hoping to get your hands on this though, as we're not expecting the 54% discount to last very long.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 10 years ago, scientists observed ripples in spacetime created by the collision of two black holes that took place 1.3 billion years ago. The first direct detection of gravitational waves opened up an entirely new way of seeing the universe, allowing us to observe a once invisible side of the cosmos. Today, the ability to track the frequencies produced by the most notable events that shape our surrounding cosmos is at risk due to drastic budget cuts targeting a breakthrough observatory. The budget request allocates $29 million instead of $48 million for LIGO, and shuts down one of its two interferometers. The twin interferometers are situated 1,865 miles apart (3,002 kilometers), with one facility in Washington State and another in Louisiana. The enormous research facilities operate in unison as a single observatory designed to detect gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime that travel at the speed of light. It detects gravitational waves by measuring incredibly small distortions in spacetime. Using its laser interferometers, it splits a laser beam into two and sends each of them down two long vacuum-sealed arms. The beams travel back and forth through each arm, bouncing between precisely configured mirrors. Each beam monitors the distance between the mirrors and detects tiny changes caused by gravitational waves, which can stretch space in one direction and compress it in the other. The lasers can discern movements between their mirrors with an accuracy of 1/10,000th the width of a proton. Researchers from Caltech and MIT, with funding and oversight from the National Science Foundation, completed construction of LIGO—one of the world's most sophisticated scientific observatories—in 1999. Scientists spent years searching for gravitational waves and coming up empty. Gravitational waves are caused by the merger of black holes, the collision of neutron stars, and asymmetric supernovae. Three researchers behind LIGO's discovery were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for their role in the detection of gravitational waves: physicists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne. These ripples in spacetime were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, and could only be confirmed decades later. Since then, the twin LIGO interferometers—sometimes in coordination with the Virgo observatory in Italy—have detected hundreds of additional gravitational wave signals. If one of LIGO's twin interferometers is shut down, as is suggested by the proposed budget, researchers would have trouble distinguishing between a black hole collision and a nearby seismic tremor, according to Science. Killing off one of the laser interferometers would hinder our newfound ability to listen in to the soft ripples of spacetime that echo through the cosmos.

Valve just released a Steam Client Beta that runs on Apple Silicon. This move will improve Steam's performance on Apple computers, especially as it removes the additional overhead for Rosetta 2. Valve also has no choice but to create a native version for Steam, especially as Apple is largely sunsetting Rosetta 2 after macOS 27. That means most apps designed for x86 systems will no longer work with macOS, unless their developers create a version that runs natively on Apple Silicon. The company said it will only retain a few portions of Rosetta to run older games that are no longer updated by their developers. This update means that Steam will have better performance, improving the gaming experience on your macOS device. Notably, it's also the only public Arm version of Steam going. However, it doesn't mean that you can now start playing Windows-only games on your Apple computer. Despite that, this change is slowly making Apple devices more conducive for gaming. The phasing out of Rosetta 2 might disappoint a few users, but it is high time that developers start building apps specifically for Apple Silicon. After all, it's already been five years since the first M1 chip arrived on the MacBook Air, and relying on a translation layer is certainly holding back the hardware from performing at its maximum potential. This will restart Steam and download the updated version (Steam Version: 1749753892 or higher) that natively runs on Apple Silicon.

A new theoretical air-gap attack dubbed SmartAttack has been cooked up by researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the NegevBeer Sheva, Israel, proposing that smartwatches could be leveraged as receivers for ultra-sonic covert communication in air-gapped systems, highlighting an emerging threat to the networks. As per the paper, air-gapped systems are generally considered secure due to their physical isolation from external networks, a measure used to prevent unauthorized access and cyberattacks. Air-gapped systems take different forms, including actual physical isolation or 'logical' isolation, where the segregation is implemented using other means such as encryption. The paper, authored by Mordechai Guri, PhD (Head of Offensive-Cyber Research Lab), focuses on the former physical implementation of air-gap security. He describes smartwatches as "an underexplored yet effective attack vector," and in the paper proposes a new method that uses smartwatches as a receiver for ultrasonic covert communication in air-gapped environments. According to the paper, extensive experimentation demonstrates that the attack can successfully transmit data over distances up to and possibly beyond 6 meters, with data transfer rates of 50 bits per second. Despite the theoretical threat, any such attack would be enormously difficult to pull off. An adversary would still need to infiltrate the secured network and implant malware; to that end, the research cites previous incidents where air-gap networks have been compromised by supply chain attacks, insider threats, or infected removable media. Implanted malware would remain dormant or operate stealthily, gathering sensitive information such as keystrokes, encryption keys, biometric data, or user credentials. The information is then modulated onto ultrasonic signals, broadcast at an inaudible frequency via the computer's speakers so as to evade human detection. That's because the attack also requires a compromised smartwatch belonging to an employee or visitor with access to the secure environment. The paper envisions using extensive smartwatch connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, or even email, to achieve this. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Even with malware in place on both the air-gapped network and the requisite smartwatch, ultrasonic data exfiltration is limited by factors such as position, signal reception, and strength, notably because a smartwatch is worn on the wrist and as such tends to move more or less constantly. Obvious measures include prohibiting the use of smartwatches and similarly capable audio devices in air-gapped network environments, while other more sophisticated measures extend to deploying ultrasonic monitoring systems, using ultrasonic jamming, and even integrating ultrasonic firewalls within computers used in such networks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I'm talking with Gupta in the WIRED office during a prelaunch demo of Yupp, which comes out of stealth mode today. Journalistic ethics forbid accepting gifts from sources, so I politely decline. The website looks similar to other generative AI tools like ChatGPT. The main difference is that every time users ask Yupp a question, they'll see two answers, generated by two different models and displayed side by side. Yupp routes prompts to a pair of large language models, choosing from a pool of over 500 models that includes products from leading US generative AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as international releases, like models from Alibaba, DeepSeek, and Mistral. For their effort, they earn a digital scratch card with Yupp credits. In my testing, the Yupp credits on the scratch cards typically ranged from zero to around 250, though they occasionally went higher. Not sure where to start while testing this web app, I turned to the range of prewritten topics flickering beneath Yupp's prompt bar, which spanned from news topics, like David Hogg leaving the Democratic National Committee, to ideas for image-creation prompts, like generating a crochet-looking surfer. I was interested in how it would pull from news reports and other sources to generate the analysis about a political issue. It generated two answers, one from Perplexity's Sonar, on the left side, and one from an “AI agent” for news built by Yupp, on the right. AI agents are buzzy right now; they're basically task-based AI programs that can perform a string of simple operations on your behalf when given a single prompt. In addition to having more sources, the answer on the right side included more context about what Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass has been doing. “Crypto and stablecoin allow us to instantly reach anywhere in the world,” Gupta says. While I didn't earn much money, the free outputs did include answers generated by newly released models that are often locked behind subscription paywalls. If someone wants to use a free chatbot and doesn't mind the friction of providing feedback as the web interface flips between models, Yupp could be worth trying out. Both models spit out wrong answers initially, though subsequent tries got it right. Still, he sees the side-by-side outputs as potentially helpful for users who are concerned about AI-generated errors, which are still quite prevalent, and want another point of comparison. “‘Every AI for everyone' is kind of our tagline,” says Gupta. “We have organized all the AI models we can find today.” Yupp's website encourages developers to reach out if they want their language or image model added to the options. It doesn't currently have any deals with AI model builders and provides these responses by making API calls. He sees the data trade-off in this situation for users as more explicit than past consumer apps, like Twitter—which he's quick to tell me that he was the 27th employee at and now has one of that company's cofounders, Biz Stone, as one of his backers. “You provide feedback data, that data is going to be used in an anonymized way and sent to the model builders.” “Crowdsourced human evaluations is what we're doing here,” Gupta says. He estimates the amount of cash users can make will add up to enough for a few cups of coffee a month. Though, this kind of data labeling, often called reinforcement learning with human feedback in the AI industry, is extremely valuable for companies as they release iterative models and fine tune the outputs. The main competitor to Yupp is a website called LMArena, which is quite popular with AI insiders for getting feedback on new models and bragging rights if a new release rises to the top of the pack. Whenever a powerful model is added to LMArena, it often stokes rumors about which major company is trying to test its new release in stealth. “This is a two-sided product with network effects of consumers helping the model builders,” Gupta says. “And model builders, hopefully, are improving the models and submitting them back to the consumers.” He shows me a beta version of Yupp's leaderboard, which goes live today and includes an overall ranking of the models alongside more granular data. The rankings can be filtered by how well a model performs with specific demographic information users share during the sign-up process, like their age, or on a particular prompt category, like health-care-related questions. It's a fairly common belief, and marketing point, among people working at AI companies, despite many researchers still questioning whether the underlying technology behind large language models will ever be able to produce AGI. Gupta wants Yupp users, who may be anxious about the future of humanity, to envision themselves as actively shaping these algorithms and improving their quality. “It's better than free, because you are doing this great thing for AI's future,” he says. And even more users might just want extra cash and be willing to spend a few hours giving feedback during their chatbot conversations.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will be among the first hyperscalers to deploy AMD's latest Instinct MI350X-series GPUs as well as its Pensando Pollara 400GbE network interface card, which is the industry's first Ultra Ethernet-compliant NIC, AMD disclosed at its Advancing AI event. Systems featuring AMD's Instinct MI350X-series GPUs as well as Pensando Pollara 400GbE NICs will be broadly available at OCI and possibly other cloud service providers in the second half of this year, according to the company. AMD's Pensando Pollara 400GbE NICs — just like other Ultra Ethernet-compliant network hardware — are designed for massive scale-out environments containing up to a million AI processors or GPUs and promise an up to six times performance boost for AI workloads. AMD claims that its Pollara 400GbE card offers a 10% higher RDMA performance compared to Nvidia's CX7 and 20% higher RDMA performance than Broadcom's Thor2 solution. In addition, UEC 1.0 features like efficient load-balancing, selective retransmission, and path-aware congestion control can further improve RDMA performance by 25% compared to traditional RoCEv2. The Pensando Pollara 400GbE NIC is based on an in-house designed specialized processor with customizable hardware that supports RDMA, adjustable transport protocols, and offloading of communication libraries. The NIC can intelligently split data streams across multiple routes to avoid bottlenecks and dynamically reroute traffic away from overloaded network paths to ensure consistent throughput across large-scale GPU deployments. In addition, AMD's Pollara 400GbE card features failover technology that rapidly detects and bypasses the connection to preserve high-speed GPU-to-GPU links. Such capabilities are crucial for maintaining cluster utilization and reducing latencies in environments with tens of thousands of interconnected accelerators. While Oracle will be the first big hyperscaler to deploy AMD's Pollara 400GbE NICs (as it will probably own the largest AMD Instinct MI355X-based cluster), other companies that plan large-scale AMD Instinct deployments will follow soon, popularizing adoption of Ultra Ethernet gear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will at least double performance compared to existing MI355X-based solutions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works. UPDATE 6/12: As it turns out, AMD's Helios has 72 GPUs, not 128 GPUs. Updating the story to reflect changes.AMD gave a preview of its first in-house designed rack-scale solution, Helios, at its Advancing AI event on Thursday. The system is set to be based on the company's next-generation EPYC 'Venice' processors, will use its Instinct MI400-series accelerator, and will rely on network connections featuring the upcoming Pensando network cards. Overall, the company says that the flagship MI400X is 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, which is a remarkable progress given that the MI400X will be released about three years after the MI300X. When it comes to rack-scale solutions for AI, AMD clearly trails behind Nvidia. This is going to change a bit this year as cloud service providers (such as Oracle OCI), OEMs, and ODMs will build and deploy rack-scale solutions based on the Instinct MI350X-series GPUs, but those systems will not be designed by AMD, and they will have to interconnect each 8-way system using Ethernet, not low-latency high-bandwidth interconnects like NVLink. The real change will occur next year with the first AMD-designed rack-scale system called Helios, which will use Zen 6-powered EPYC 'Venice' CPUs, CDNA 'Next'-based Instinct MI400-series GPUs, and Pensando 'Vulcano' network interface cards (NICs) that are rumored to increase the maximum scale-up world size to beyond eight GPUs, which will greatly enhance their capabilities for training and inference. The system will adhere to OCP standards and enable next-generation interconnects such as Ultra Ethernet and Ultra Accelerator Link, supporting demanding AI workloads. "So let me introduce the Helios AI rack," said Andrew Dieckman, corporate VP and general manager of AMD's data center GPU business. "Helios is one of the system solutions that we are working on based on the Instinct MI400-series GPU, so it is a fully integrated AI rack with EPYC CPUs, Instinct MI400-series GPUs, Pensando NICs, and then our ROCm stack. It is a unified architecture designed for both frontier model training as well as massive scale inference [that] delivers leadership compute density, memory bandwidth, scale out interconnect, all built in an open OCP-compliant standard supporting Ultra Ethernet and UALink." From a performance point of view, AMD's flagship Instinct MI400-series AI GPU (we will refer to it as to Instinct MI400X, though this is not the official name, and we will also call the CDNA Next as CDNA 5) doubles performance from the Instinct MI355X and increases memory capacity by 50% and bandwidth by more than 100%. While the MI355X delivers 10 dense FP4 PFLOPS, the MI400X is projected to hit 20 dense FP4 PFLOPS. Overall, the company says that the flagship MI400X is 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, which is a remarkable progress given that the MI400X will be released about three years after the MI300X. "When you look at our product roadmap and how we continue to accelerate, with MI355X, we have taken a major leap forward [compared to the MI300X]: we are delivering 3X the amount of performance on a broad set of models and workloads, and that is a significant uptick from the previous trajectory we were on from the MI300X with the MI325X," said Dieckman. "Now, with the Instinct MI400X and Helios, we bend that curve even further, and Helios is designed to deliver up to 10X more AI performance on the the most advanced frontier models in the high end."

However, when it comes to comparison with Nvidia's next-generation Rubin R200 that delivers 50 dense FP4 PFLOPS, AMD's MI400X will be around 2.5 times slower. Still, AMD will have an ace up its sleeve, which is memory bandwidth and capacity (see tables for details). Similarly, Helios will outperform Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra-based NVL72 and Rubin-based NVL144. However, it remains to be seen how Helios will stack against NVL144 in real-world applications. Also, it will be extremely hard to beat Nvidia's NVL576 both in terms of compute performance and memory bandwidth in 2027, though by that time, AMD will likely roll out something new. At least, this is what AMD communicated at its Advancing AI event this week: the company plans to continue evolving its integrated AI platforms with next-generation GPUs, CPUs, and networking technology, extending its roadmap well into 2027 and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The startup also said its co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is stepping down from his role to join Meta and help the bigger company with its AI work. “Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI. As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts. We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson for Meta told TechCrunch. Jason Droege, Scale's current chief strategy officer, will hop in as interim CEO. Wang will continue at the data-labeling firm as a director on its board. As my colleague Max Zeff wrote on Wednesday, this investment is a way for Meta to improve its AI efforts as its rivals Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic rush ahead, and the social media company's own AI model releases trail the competition. For the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that's used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.
