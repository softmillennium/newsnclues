                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) is warning President Donald Trump that acting on his threats to take up arms with Israel in its war with Iran would be an unconstitutional circumventing of Congress to start a war that the American public overwhelmingly doesn't want. Shortly after Israel launched unprompted strikes on numerous sites in Tehran on Friday, President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that “the U.S. will defend itself and Israel if Iran retaliates.” He has since made numerous threats to Iran, insisting that they capitulate with his administration's demands for a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left” of the country. These and other statements by the president suggest that Trump would dispatch the U.S. military to fight alongside Israel whenever he wants, Tlaib pointed out — the same way that Trump conducted weeks of unauthorized strikes on Yemen earlier this year, causing hundreds of casualties, progressive lawmakers have previously said. “The president cannot circumvent congressional war powers and unilaterally send U.S. troops to war with Iran,” said Tlaib in a post on social media on Friday. The American people do not want another endless war in the Middle East that will cost lives and tear their families apart,” she went on. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that the U.S. was not involved in Israel's attacks, which struck numerous residential buildings across Tehran, and said that the strikes were “unilateral.” However, Trump has seemingly been eager to take credit for involvement in the strikes. Iranian-born analyst Trita Parsi and executive vice president for the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft said that officials' remarks indicate that Israel is attempting to manipulate the U.S. into becoming involved in a war with Iran — a war that has long been a goal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, numerous analysts and experts have previously noted Per Politico, the Pentagon has moved two warships capable of defending against ballistic and cruise missiles closer toward Israel as it prepares for retaliatory strikes. The U.S. had provided similar support when Israel and Iran swapped a series of strikes last year. U.S. involvement in war with Iran is indeed a highly unpopular prospect. A poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs last year found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans oppose using U.S. troops to defend Israel if Iran attacked it. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found “all-time low” sympathy for Israelis over Palestinians, marking the continuation of a longtime trend that began even before Israel embarked on its genocide in Gaza.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke separately with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on June 13, amid a sweeping Israeli air assault on Iran that killed top military officials and targeted the country's nuclear infrastructure. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed that several senior commanders were killed, including aerospace chief Amir Ali Hajizadeh. During his call with Pezeshkian, Putin expressed condolences for what the Kremlin described as "numerous civilian casualties" and condemned Israel's actions as violations of the UN Charter and international law. The conversations took place just hours after Russia launched its own missile and drone assault on Ukraine. At least four civilians were killed and 24 injured in Russian attacks across multiple regions on June 13, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia has deepened military and political ties with Tehran since the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine. Iran has supplied Moscow with thousands of Shahed-type attack drones and short-range ballistic missiles used in routine strikes on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry responded to the Middle East escalation by expressing concern about broader regional instability but reiterated that "the Iranian regime supports Russia in its illegal war of aggression" and provides it with "weapons to kill Ukrainians." Kyiv warned that the fallout could destabilize international security and trigger economic shocks. Global oil prices soared over 10% after the Israeli operation — a development that could enhance revenues for Russia, whose war budget is largely financed by energy exports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among other concerns, the US military parade will produce as much pollution as created to heat 300 homes for a year Donald Trump's military parade this weekend will bring thousands of troops out to march, while dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers roll down the streets and fighter jets hum overhead. It will also produce more than 2m kilograms of planet-heating pollution – equivalent to the amount created by producing of 67m plastic bags or by the energy used to power about 300 homes in one year, according to a review by the progressive thinktank Institute for Policy Studies and the Guardian. The large quantity of emissions this activity is estimated to produce is equivalent to those from flying 4,700 people from North Carolina – where the parade helicopters are based – to the nation's capital in first class. Hanna Homestead, research analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies, noted the same kinds of vehicles deployed for the parade have also been used to transport napalm and other supplies to Vietnam, and are now being used by Israel in its siege on Gaza. “So we're spending money to glorify a gas-guzzling equipment used for war, genocide and planetary destruction,” she said, “at the same time as critical services for populations at home and around the world are being slashed.” Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Anna Kelley, said the parade “will honor all of the military men and women who have bravely served our country, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom”. The president reportedly sought to throw a similar tribute during his first term, inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, but was thwarted by the then secretary of defense, James Mattis. Trump's parade this year has inspired “No Kings” protests across the country. “This parade comes alongside proposals for a $1tn Pentagon budget, along with massive cuts to healthcare, food programs, and an ideological attack on climate programs both in the Pentagon and across government,” she said. Military forces' contribution to global carbon emissions has come under greater scrutiny in recent years. The world's militaries produce at least 5.5% of greenhouse gas emissions – more than the total footprint of Japan – one 2022 estimate found.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Zheng Zhi, a former Chinese military doctor currently living in exile in Canada, traveled to Taiwan for several screenings of the award-winning documentary “State Organs” from June 4 to 15, which features Zheng's eyewitness account as a resident doctor in a Chinese military hospital. Millions of troops may be mobilized to the front line of the Taiwan Strait, including possibly 2 million to 3 million logistics personnel, he said. The Chinese military solution was to put surrendered or captured Taiwanese soldiers in detention, draw their blood, and use it for wounded Chinese soldiers, according to Zheng. So if Chinese Communist Party (CCP) attacks Taiwan and the Taiwanese military surrenders, “the first thing they might face is having their blood taken because a large blood supply is needed to sustain a war,” Zheng said. Using container trucks and airplanes, the blood could be quickly transported to the frontlines to “immediately set up a field hospital,” he added. There are “no technical barriers,” Zheng told The Epoch Times. It's hard for someone in a normal country to grasp such a level of cruelty, he said, pointing out that “the CCP has no human moral baseline.” “State Organs,” directed by Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Raymond Zhang, focuses on two families in search of their missing relatives amid a nationwide persecution of the faith in Falun Gong, which both disappeared individuals practiced. He told The Epoch Times it pained him to think that he has friends who went to China for liver and heart transplants. For all such detained Falun Gong practitioners in China, their organs are “state organs,” he said, adding that the regime is “killing on demand.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's foreign minister said that Israel will “deeply regret” its attack. Trump warned Iran earlier today to agree to a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left.” It's unclear if scheduled nuclear talks between the US and Iran will go ahead this weekend. Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's highest-ranking military officer, was also killed. • Nuclear targets: Netanyahu said “Operation Rising Lion” struck Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz, nuclear scientists, and what he called “the heart of Iran's ballistic missiles program.” Israeli authorities discussed “the price we'll have to pay” before launching their overnight attack on Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “Regarding the price — I said there will be a price, and we are trying to reduce it in various ways I will not elaborate on. But it is important for me that you citizens will help reduce it by, not being euphoric … and simply obey the instructions (of the Home Front Command) and stay next to safe spaces, because we and you want to minimize harm to life as much as possible,” he said. Discussing the possibility of a counterstrike from Iran, Netanyahu said: “I tell you there will be. We have hit a considerable part of the Iranian military leadership. “I told (US President Donald) Trump surprise is the element of success,” he added. “It created, of course, chaos in Iran but we all need to assume there will be a counterattack against us. Israel's decision to strike Iran in the early hours of Friday morning was “not made lightly,” Israel's UN envoy Danny Doron said a news conference on Friday. “The decision to act last night was not made lightly. It followed repeated violations by the Iranian regime, continued deception and an absence of meaningful international consequences,” Doron said Doron said that his country has “nothing against” the people of Iran, telling journalists: “I'm telling to the Iranian people very directly that we have nothing against them. “What they will do now, I leave it to President Trump, he makes his own decisions independently.” He speaks very persuasively and very firmly and said Iran should not have nuclear weapons, they should not have enrichment capabilities,” Netanyahu added. Iranian air defenses shot down an Israeli drone in the vicinity of Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), an underground nuclear facility located some 20 miles northeast of the city of Qom, Iranian state media Press TV reported Friday evening local time. This was reported around the same time that Press TV said the Hamedan Airbase in western Iran was hit by Israeli airstrikes. Fardiz, a city in north-central Iran, was also targeted by Israeli strikes, Press TV reported. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment The Israeli military has said that it is working to intercept a missile launched “from Yemen toward Israeli territory” on Friday evening. “Aerial defense systems are operating to intercept the threat,” it said. President Donald Trump told Reuters it's uncertain whether Iran's nuclear program exists following Israel's strikes and that US talks with Iran are still planned for Sunday, although he isn't sure they'll happen. In another phone interview with NBC News, Trump reiterated that Iran “may have another opportunity” to strike a nuclear deal and implied that Iranians are reaching out to him. Press TV reported that missiles were intercepted south of Tehran, as the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) reported that west Tehran was being hit by new strikes. Karaj, a city near Tehran, was also targeted, IRIB wrote. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. Israel is committed to guaranteeing that there is no nuclear weapons program left in Iran, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, told CNN. “Maybe now the Iranians will be in a better position to actually succumb and give up on their nuclear program. But if not, we are committed to seeing this operation through to the point where there is no nuclear weapons program left in Iran,” he continued. Israel deployed reservist troops throughout the country before attacking Iran overnight, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Friday. Iraq's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Fuad Hussein, urged Iran to continue talks with the United States after Israel's attacks on Iran, according to a statement released by Iraq's foreign ministry. Hussein also “urged the Iranian side to continue pursuing dialogue with the United States through Omani mediation, in order to reach solutions that would help de-escalate tensions and enhance security and stability in the region.” Nuclear talks: Iran and the US have recently held several rounds of nuclear talks, most recently meeting in Rome in late May. A sixth round of nuclear deal talks was scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday. Radiation levels at Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz remain “unchanged,” according to the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The type of radioactive contamination present inside the facility, mainly alpha particles, can be managed with appropriate protective measures,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement on X. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog confirmed that Natanz had been hit amid Israel's attack on Iran, but said earlier it had not observed an increase in radiation levels in the area. Iran summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran to deliver a warning to the United States, accusing Washington of complicity in Israel's attack. “It is unthinkable that the Zionist regime's aggressive actions against Iran were carried out without cooperation, coordination, and at least a green light from the US, and in this regard, the US must be held accountable for its illegal behavior in this regard,” the Iranian representative told Nadine Lozano, the Swiss Ambassador to Tehran, according to a statement published on state run IRNA. Iran also warned against any US support for Israel during Tehran's response, “including by preventing Iran from exercising its right to legitimate defense,” the statement said. “In such situations, decision-makers must ask themselves not only what the gains and costs of military action will be, but also what the cost of inaction would be. And multiple intelligence, military and congressional officials with access to classified intelligence told CNN that no direct evidence was found indicating Iran was directly involved. Sa'ar added that he has spoken to a number of his international counterparts, including foreign ministers from India, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, Paraguay, Panama, and Cyprus, as well as the European Union. President Donald Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu several times on Thursday, including prior to Israel launching unprecedented strikes on Iran, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. The source said special envoy Steve Witkoff is “ready” to meet Iranian officials when they are — whether it be in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled or at some date thereafter. Iran's paralysis following Israel's massive strike against its nuclear facilities is unlikely to last, Iran experts say, warning that Tehran will imminently retaliate as a “Rubicon has been crossed.” “Iran's leadership is likely reeling, but that paralysis is unlikely to last,” Sina Toossi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said in a statement to CNN. “A large-scale retaliation, likely involving drone and missile strikes into Israeli territory, appears imminent,” Toossi said, adding that “rather than crippling Iran's military and nuclear capabilities, Israel's escalation risks fueling nationalist sentiment, solidifying internal cohesion and triggering a dangerous cycle of retaliation, all while increasing the likelihood of American entanglement.” Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN that it would be difficult for Iran not to retaliate, adding that Iran's response is likely to be bigger than its attack in October, which saw Iranian missiles attack Israeli military sites. In its attack, Israel has “tried to kill off several of the norms around the use of force and international law, to essentially bring it down to a situation where it is law of the jungle,” Parsi said. Toossi added that Trump has warned Israel not to strike. “Whether that was a strategic ruse or genuine restraint is now irrelevant. The State Department stood up a task force to track developments and coordinate efforts in the need of any US evacuations from the Middle East on Thursday, before Israel carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, two State Department officials said. Why this matters: The task force serves as a convening mechanism for the department's wide intake of information and is standard practice when there is heightened security concerns. As of Friday, multiple embassies in the region were actively reviewing their posture, but officials said there had been no decision to further draw down personnel. One senior US diplomat saying that would only come if there was the expectation that US facilities and personnel in the country were going to be targeted in Iran's retaliation. “The leaders reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense, and agreed that a diplomatic resolution, rather than military action, was the way forward,” it added. President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Israel's attacks on Iran are “great for the market” because it means Iran won't have a nuclear weapon. “I think ultimately, it would be great for the market because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Trump told the newspaper he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday, plans to speak again today, and that his team was aware of Israel's plan to attack. When asked how much advance notice the United States had received, Trump said: “Heads-up? Trump described the Israeli operation as “a very successful attack, to put it mildly.” Iran has no choice but to retaliate against Israel's attack, US foreign policy expert and former US State Department adviser Vali Nasr told CNN's Becky Anderson, adding that it may take the shape of a prolonged war of attrition. Washington has long sought to limit Tehran's nuclear capacity, with the most recent negotiations in Rome last month ending with no agreement. A sixth round of US-Iran talks had been scheduled for Sunday in Oman — and it's not clear if it will go ahead. “Trump misunderstood Iran,” Nasr said, and now, “instead of talking, we're going to see use of weapons as a tool in the negotiations.” Israel will “come to deeply regret” its “reckless aggression” in attacking Iran, the Iranian foreign minister said in a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Friday. Abbas Araghchi called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, calling on the body to “strongly condemn this act of aggression” and “take urgent and concrete measures to hold this Israeli regime fully accountable for its crimes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has held phone conversations with his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the escalation in the Middle East following the Israeli strike against Iran. Israel launched a major attack on Iran overnight targeting nuclear facilities and various military installations. The strikes continued into the day, inflicting considerable material damage and casualties on Iran's top military leadership and, reportedly, high-profile nuclear scientists. Russia “condemns Israel's actions, which violate the UN Charter and international law,” Putin stressed, according to the statement. At the same time, the Russian leader expressed a readiness to mediate and to “continue to contribute to the de-escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel.” The Israeli attack comes after five rounds of US-Iranian talks about Tehran's nuclear program that effectively stalled and failed to produce any tangible result. The sixth round of negotiations was expected to take place in Oman on Sunday. Iran has vowed to retaliate for the attack, insisting that it “cannot have been carried out without the coordination and authorization of the United States.” US President Donald Trump claimed he knew about the impending strikes beforehand, describing them as “very successful.” Trump also suggested Tehran brought the attack upon itself through its alleged reluctance to strike a nuclear deal. “We gave them a chance and they didn't take it. A lot more,” he said, commenting on the attack. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The G7 summit is being held in Kananaskis, Alta., next week amid a burgeoning trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press They know that U.S. President Donald Trump is in attack-dog mode on tariffs, defence spending and other issues and that lashing out against him could backfire. “They aren't looking for a fight with Trump,” he said. The non-American members of the G7 – Canada, Japan, Italy, France, Germany and Britain – know from experience that Mr. Trump can be a force of disruption at the summits, as he was in 2017 in Taormina, Sicily. Mr. Trump left it early after a spat about trade with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. One option is to present a united front against Mr. Trump on tariffs, China, defence spending, support for Ukraine – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend – and other issues. Another option is to go soft on demands for fear of triggering Mr. Trump's wrath, which could see him unleash another round of tariffs. Carney should ignore any antics from Trump at G7 and focus on business, Chrétien says Certainly, the six have plenty of reasons to be wary of Mr. Trump – and furious with him – for the turmoil he has inflicted on global trade. Since taking office in January, he has imposed double- and triple-digit tariffs on America's trading partners, reversed or lowered them several times, then threatened to reimpose them, as he did in May with his vow to hit the EU with a 50-per-cent trade tax (now suspended until July 9). Today there is a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on most countries, though not Canada and Mexico, plus a 25-per-cent levy on autos. Early this month, Mr. Trump doubled the tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent, a level high enough to cripple Canadian exports of both products. Since all the non-U.S. G7 members, plus the European Union itself (whose leaders will also be in Kananaskis), are in various stages of negotiating new trade deals with the White House, they will be wary of jeopardizing any progress they have made so far by angering Mr. Trump. If it does, the EU would almost certainly plunge into recession. “Tariffs are the keystone of his approach to the world, and no international meeting is going to change this,” said trade lawyer Lawrence Herman of Toronto's Herman & Associates. “Until the Trump ascendancy, G7 leaders tended to find consensus on major issues. Since convincing Mr. Trump to back down on tariffs seems like a long shot, progress elsewhere may be pursued. Carney lays out defence boost, says era of U.S. dominance over NATO's current defence spending target for its 32 member states is 2 per cent of GDP. NATO, whose own summit will be held June 24-26 in the Dutch city of The Hague, is set to embrace that figure, though it could be fudged by allowing 3.5 per cent in hard military spending and the rest for infrastructure, cybersecurity and other outlays not directly related to weapons or military headcounts. Defence spending in much of Western Europe, especially Germany, is surging. Still, some countries will resist doubling their military budgets. They will have to consider their positions carefully ahead of the G7 and NATO summits, since Mr. Trump has been insistent since his first term as president that the U.S. will no longer support a NATO full of cheapskates. Italy will almost certainly argue that it already has one of the biggest militaries in Europe, including two aircraft carriers and an order for 115 Lockheed Martin F-35s, the most advanced fighter jets in the NATO arsenal, suggesting that its relatively small military budget in no way means it is an inefficient spender. Lesser said they might strive for a common front on the relationship with China in areas such as intellectual property, investment screening and disapproval of Beijing's support for Moscow as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents dressed in vests and helmets climbed out of their blacked-out vehicle, he did his best to warn his fellow illegal migrants camped outside the hardware store in search of work. La migra!” he screamed, before sprinting away from the scene. Like the 100 or so men who gather daily outside the DIY shop in Westlake, Los Angeles, that morning Abraham had been hoping to pick up a day's work from customers in need of help for their home improvements. Nicaragua-born Abraham managed to escape but not everyone was so lucky. At least 40 men, some of whom had lived in the US for decades, were handcuffed and detained by ICE agents who had raided a string of workplaces and Home Depot locations that morning, sparking a wave of volatile protests which have gripped Los Angeles and spread to more than 35 other cities. Despite the pervasive threat of deportation, Abraham was back at the Home Depot parking lot on Wednesday morning to resume his search for work. While officials had initially focused their efforts on those with criminal records, Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr Trump's hardline immigration policy, instructed ICE field officers to begin widening their nets. It is a move that has drawn fierce opposition from not only Mr Trump's political opponents such as Gavin Newsom, the Democrat governor, but also from some of the Republican leader's supporters, with Florida State Senator Ileana Garcia, the co-founder of Latinas for Trump, saying the move was “not what we voted for”. While demonstrations have brought parts of the state to a standstill, the ICE raids have continued at pace, with uniformed officers chasing farmworkers through fields and turning up at churches to arrest migrants. Obdulio, another undocumented worker who managed to flee the Home Depot raid on Friday, had also returned on Wednesday despite seeing at least a dozen people “grabbed” by ICE agents. “You can't confront them because they're going to take you away, so what we did was shout at people to run and we kept running,” he says. Obdulio, 48, who did not want to give his last name, told The Telegraph: “We are still in fear because we've heard ICE is still roaming here.” Standing on the other side of the Westlake Home Depot car park, Edwin Cuadra, who is from Guatemala and has a green card, recounted how he saw ICE agents arriving on Friday morning in his car's wing mirror. “Those who don't have papers had to escape, they started running,” he says. The number of people out looking for work has since dwindled, he says, because migrants are terrified they will be caught. On the sixth day of demonstrations in Los Angeles, a largely peaceful protest of around 1,000 protesters briefly became chaotic when police on horseback charged at protesters and hit them with wooden rods before the area's 8pm curfew came into effect. Officers fired rubber bullets and pepper balls into the crowd before carrying out dozens of arrests and packing protesters into police vans, but the streets downtown were mostly quiet by 9pm. In recent days demonstrations across the city at times became violent, with some agitators setting fire to cars and throwing Molotov cocktails, fireworks and rocks at police. Some of the thousands of National Guard troops controversially deployed by Mr Trump despite governor Gavin Newsom insisting they were not needed have been assisting ICE officers as they round up illegal migrants on raids, standing by with their rifles as agents arrest and detain people. “Democracy is under assault right before our eyes,” he said on Tuesday. “California may be first, but it clearly won't end here.” The Department of Homeland Security released an Uncle Sam style poster on social media on Wednesday urging members of the public to report “foreign invaders”. As ICE raids continued in spite of the protests, on Monday morning a Home Depot in Huntington Park, around eight miles away from the Westlake branch, was targeted. Eduardo Baz, 45, who illegally crossed into the US from Honduras 20 years ago, was lucky to have escaped. On Wednesday morning he was one of a handful of migrants who had returned to the car park hoping to pick up work. “All these years later, they can send you home in one swoop.”</p>

MOSCOW, June 12. /TASS/. Operators of fiber-optic drones of the Bars-27 detachment of the Volunteer corps as part of Battlegroup South have hit a Ukrainian UAV control point and a camouflaged mortar in the Kramatorsk direction, the press service of the corps told TASS.

"Bars-27 detachment fighters in the Kramatorsk direction first shot down the enemy's DJI Matrice 30 reconnaissance drone, after which they exposed the launch point and hit it with a fiber-optic drone," the press service said.

The detachment fighters also attacked the Ukrainian army's camouflaged mortar position with drones as it was detected by the air when the crew was camouflaging the position.</p>

The Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association released Thursday a statement on the internet and election reporting, saying member companies will push accurate information on elections as fears grow that inaccurate posts on social media could influence elections. The statement adds that members will review how they have reported elections and reference the fact-checking methods that have been deployed overseas. The internet plays host to much information that is either false or of uncertain veracity, including on social media. The news media group expressed concern that by significantly influencing elections, such information “could lead to the self-destruction of democracy.” According to the statement, member companies “will review from the ground up how they report on elections, and proactively report in a way that provides information voters can rely on in decision-making, by making reference to international fact-checking methods and taking other measures.” In 1966, the group issued a statement saying that there were no restrictions on election coverage so long as it was not false and did not distort the facts. Additionally, the group announced Thursday that it would create an account on X, where it will publish articles from member companies that verify the accuracy of election-related information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. In a televised speech, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared success. Shapiro served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East until January—charged with, among other things, considering scenarios in which tensions between Israel and Iran escalated into all-out war and preparing U.S. options for responding. Now a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, Shapiro has also served as U.S. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity. How much more serious are they than were the Israeli attacks on Iran in April and October of last year? The full extent of Israel's strikes on Iran has not yet been revealed. But they are orders of magnitude beyond what Israel achieved in its April and October 2024 attacks. It is already clear that Israel was able to strike key nuclear sites, such as the Natanz enrichment facility, locations associated with possible weaponization research, ballistic missile launch sites, and numerous senior regime leaders and figures involved in Iran's nuclear program. That is far more extensive than almost anyone forecast. But Iran will probably try to match any losses they suffered in the civilian sphere, in addition to attacking Israeli military, intelligence, and leadership targets. So far, the Trump administration has firmly distanced itself from these strikes. By distancing himself from Netanyahu's decision, Trump is seeking to deter Iran from directing any response against the United States. Trump may also hope that he can keep nuclear negotiations alive. But his dream of a diplomatic resolution which ends Iranian nuclear enrichment appears dead. Rubio's statement was intended to signal to Iran that the United States was not involved, and that Israel acted unilaterally. The omission of Israel is a further indication that Washington does not want to be seen as having endorsed the Israeli action. But it is inconceivable that U.S. officials did not have prior knowledge. Rubio's statement does not mean the United States won't assist in Israel's defense. Why did Israel decide to strike now, despite Trump's apparent wishes? Netanyahu has long promised Israelis that he won't let Iran develop a nuclear weapon. And I think he sensed that Israel might never have a better opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. It then destroyed Iran's Russian-provided S-300 air defense batteries—Tehran's most sophisticated—in October. Those two successes, combined with the fall of Iran's key regional ally, the Assad regime in Syria, have left Iran with far less ability to defend its nuclear sites or retaliate. How can we expect the Iranian response to unfold? This is in keeping with how it responded to past Israeli actions. After Israel killed a key Iranian leader in Damascus in April 2024, Iran lobbed over 300 munitions, including over 100 medium range ballistic missiles, at Israel. In April, Israel was able to avoid serious damage thanks to both its own air defenses and those of a U.S.-led coalition. But the October attack scored a few dozen hits that caused relatively minor damage. And earlier in June, Iran specifically pledged to strike Israel's own nuclear facilities in response to this kind of attack. By concentrating its defenses on certain sensitive sites and civilian populations, Israel, with U.S. support, will probably attempt to prevent its air defenses from being saturated and minimize damage, as it did against Iran's two previous attacks. The United States has positioned two THAAD (Theater High-Altitude Area Defense) batteries in Israel to help. Israel will also almost certainly face additional attacks from the Houthis in Yemen. Hezbollah, even in its weakened state, might be called upon to retaliate as well. And Hezbollah's reduced capabilities will limit its impact, as might pressure from the new Lebanese government. Will Israel respond to Iran's retaliation with more strikes? So a successful defense against Iranian missiles could have a deescalatory effect, whereas significant casualties will almost certainly lead Israel to seek to strike Iran again. But Israel showed little interest in such coordination this time, and Trump may also find it is not worthwhile. This could mean Iran finds it more difficult to move down the escalation ladder. Israel should expect an ongoing series of asymmetric attacks, such as cyber operations and terrorist attacks against its embassies, travelers, and businesses. Trump has made clear that Washington was not involved in the Israeli strikes and warned Iran not to target U.S. forces. But Iran may choose not to attack actors other than Israel, in order to keep them out of the war. Let's say that Iran does attack the United States, prompting U.S. retaliation, or that Washington decides to get directly involved to prevent an Iranian nuclear breakout. How might an American attack on Iran play out? Some of the assets that would facilitate an American strike are already available. Additional aircraft, such as fighter squadrons, tankers, and search and rescue helicopters, would likely also be deployed to bases in the region. The United States also has unique capabilities it could employ if it intended to target Iran's deeply buried enrichment facility at Fordow. Iran possesses an arsenal of thousands of close-range ballistic missiles and drones that it could launch at American bases in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It used such missiles to attack U.S. forces following Washington's assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, in 2020. Shiite militia groups in Iraq and Syria, armed with Iranian drones, could fire at U.S. bases as they did for several months following October 7, 2023. Troops and personnel at these locations may need to spend significant periods in shelters. Air defense assets at specific locations could be outnumbered by incoming munitions. American forces would have to be prepared to strike militias that attack them, as they did several times last year. Could Iran or its partners decide to attack Arab states, as they have in the past? But if the United States gets involved, Iran might well fire close-range ballistic missiles at civilian locations or energy infrastructure in the Gulf states, in order to exact a price for what they would see as complicity with a U.S. attack. Iran would also consider an effort to shut down the Strait of Hormuz to oil and gas tankers using a naval blockade, sea mines, limpet mines deployed by fast boats, or some combination thereof. Saudi Arabia and the UAE possess significant air defense assets, but all of these countries would still be vulnerable to strikes. What does this war mean for the future of Iran's nuclear program? Most estimates suggested Israel, on its own, could set back the Iranian nuclear program by several months. Public reports have estimated that U.S. strikes, meanwhile, could set the Iranian nuclear program back by up to a year. But those timelines assume Iran immediately starts rebuilding, and they do not take into account additional delays that could occur based on economic or political factors. Those estimates also do not account for the impact of deterrence or potential restrikes. But it is likely that Iran will now make a desperate run to nuclear breakout. Trump, in turn, will be faced with a decision about whether to intervene militarily to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon. That decision will split his advisers and political base, given his long-stated determination to keep the United States out of Middle East wars.
