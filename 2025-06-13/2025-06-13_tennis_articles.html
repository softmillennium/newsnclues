                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As you might expect, Rafael Nadal was one of the millions who watched the historic Roland Garros final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday. “It was a match for the ages,” said Nadal. It was a spectacular final, very exciting. “I feel for Jannik,” added the 22-time major champion. “Despite the fact that it was an incredibly difficult match for him, he maintained an impeccable attitude and carried himself well.” Between them, Sinner and Alcaraz have won the past six Grand Slam titles (all four in 2024, and the first two of 2025) and seven of the past eight. “Tennis is more important than any player,” opined Nadal. New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them,” he said of Sinner and Alcaraz, the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings.

It is something he feels perfectly happy to do. “I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis. This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that.” Nadal retired from professional tennis last November, after representing Spain in the Davis Cup for the final time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Men's singles semifinals of the ATP Libema Open in Den Bosch, Netherlands are set after a couple of upsets on Friday. 1 seed Daniil Medvedev, while Gabriel Diallo overcame a 0-3 head-to-head record to defeat Karen Khachanov. 2 seed Ugo Humbert take advantage of the draw seemingly opening up? Who do you think will reach the final? It's good to see Ugo Humbert back in shape after struggling with an arm injury over the clay season. But now it seems like this situation is behind him and we're also on a court that fits him extremely well. His game thrives on surfaces that are fast and slick, but it's not going to be that easy to neutralize the big weapons of Gabriel Diallo. Humbert's flatter ball at the Canadian's backhand might be the key here, even if Diallo's playing with a lot of confidence after saving match points to beat Jordan Thompson. Reilly Opelka lost in the final qualifying round to Mark Lajal, really struggling to manage his giant body against balls bouncing low in his backhand corner. Now he's facing Zizou Bergs, who had to raise his level from where it was at the start of the week and has done just that. The Belgian has so many grass-court tools and his slices probably make it uncomfortable enough for Opelka here. 700 play a ferret if he could see it from the stands. Always pleased by a beautiful one-handed backhand or classic volleying technique. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American lucky loser Reilly Opelka put up an intense battle to stun top seed Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5) 7-6(5) and reach the Libema Open semifinal in Den Bosch on Friday. Medvedev, who on Thursday edged a first-set tiebreak against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, hit three double faults in the second-set tiebreak and five overall, compared to no such error by Opelka, who also hit 24 aces. Former Wimbledon junior champion Opelka will contest an ATP grasscourt semi-final for the second time in his career, having reached the same stage at Newport last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raducanu has already locked in a return to the top of the British rankings after beating Rebecca Sramkova in straight sets yesterday. The former US Open champion will surpass Katie Boulter, who was knocked out by Diana Shnaider in the last eight. She won the first set but allowed her Russian opponent to fight back and claim a 2-6 6-3 6-2 victory. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Raducanu had a commanding lead at one point in the second set, having been outclassed in the first, but Zheng held her nerve to come back and win 6-2 6-4. Not the result Raducanu wanted, but she comes away from the tournament with many positives to take as Wimbledon edges closer. Raducanu will be bitterly disappointed after losing the game on a double fault. Raducanu has got off to a stormer in the second set as she looks to keep her Queen's campaign going. She broke Zheng straight away before holding her own serve, and leads 2-0 in the second set currently. During the break in play between sets, Raducanu is receiving treatment on her back. The physio came out to check in on the Brit, and she has just made her way off court for a medical timeout. Qinwen Zheng claims the first set 6-2 and it's a difficult task from here on in for Raducanu against the Olympic champion. Qinwen Zheng has stamped her authority on this match. But Raducanu is battling and has the home crowd on her side. Emma Raducanu is due to get going any minute now against Qinwen Zheng in the quarter-finals at Queen's. Fourth seed Elena Rybakina is in a spot of bother in her Queen's quarter-final clash against German qualifier Tatjana Maria. She also has the serve to move 5-3 in front. After this match, Emma Raducanu will face top seed Qinwen Zheng for a spot in the semi-finals... Madison Keys is safely through to the semi-finals at Queen's Club after coming from behind to beat Diana Shnaider. Once that match concludes, it will be the turn of Emma Raducanu and Qinwen Zheng. John McEnroe has claimed that Carlos Alcaraz is the only tennis player he would buy a ticket to watch. "Carlos is the most talented young man I have ever seen hold a racket, Jannik [Sinner] is not far behind," said the American. I am struck by the sound of Jannik's ball. Shnaider won the opening set at a canter but Keys is battling back, having raced to a three-game lead in set two. It looks like it will go to a decider unless Shnaider can pull off a run of successive games. Defending champion Tommy Paul is among several big names who have pulled out of the men's tournament at Queen's Club. He had been nursing several injuries at the French Open and will be looking to return to full fitness ahead of Wimbledon. Lorenzo Musetti has also withdrawn from the ATP 500 event due to a leg muscle injury. Matteo Berrettini, meanwhile, will not be playing because of an abdominal problem. Nick Kyrgios has given himself a bold new look two months after celebrating his 30th birthday. Kyrgios revealed his new buzzcut in a short Instagram video, turning his head to show it off from multiple angles. Wimbledon chief Sally Bolton has confirmed that security measures will be ramped up at SW19 this year. "But we have in place, and have had for many years, processes for ensuring the safety of our players. We are putting in place measures that are reflective of the threat and risk profile at the time." Novak Djokovic has revealed that he has always felt closer to Rafael Nadal than Roger Federer in a candid interview. He said: "Just because someone is my biggest rival doesn't mean I wish them harm, hate them, or want to do anything else on the court to defeat them. Novak Djokovic has emotionally admitted that he felt like an 'unwanted child' in comparison to Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. He told Failures of Champions: "I acted and still felt like an unwanted child. Then I thought the fans would accept me if I acted differently, but that wasn't the case either. "I was the little guy, the third guy who came along and said: 'I'm going to be No 1'. Emma Raducanu sent a classy message to Katie Boulter after surpassing her doubles partner as Britain's top-ranked female player. Following her victory over Rebecca Sramkova at Queen's Club, she wrote a message on the camera lens which read: "Long live Boultercanu." Raducanu also revealed that she wanted to rekindle her partnership with Boulter, having enjoyed their brief run in the doubles tournament. "I really want to play with Katie again in the future," she said. Hello and welcome to Express Sport's live coverage of the latest tennis news with Queen's Club taking centre stage once again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daria Saville has highlighted that Novak Djokovic is facing similar questions about retirement, which bothered Serena Williams. The 38-year-old has often discussed his future in different press conferences. Djokovic's most recent appearance was at the French Open, where he was knocked out after losing in the semifinal to Jannik Sinner in straight sets with a score of 6-4, 7-5, 7-6. "That's why I was a bit more emotional, even in the end. I don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career. Saville recently appeared on the Australian Open official YouTube channel podcast, where she emphasised that Djokovic is now facing something similar to what Serena faced during her final playing days. The 31-year-old also highlighted that, as a player, it is not easy to know when the right time is to retire. “It's pretty hard going to every press [conference] and hearing people asking him the same questions. “That's what people did to Serena [Williams]. The funny thing as a player is I don't think you know yourself. I kind of feel that he'll be there, I don't think that's how he'd want to go out. I think he doesn't know where his body is. It would be hard to know, how the hell do you even retire? This article first appeared on TennisUpToDate.com and was syndicated with permission.</p>

Wimbledon is on the way, and whether you're planning to watch on TV, brave the famous queues or are lucky enough to have a ticket, it's an exciting time for tennis fans everywhere. 

For those attending in person, one big question (other than how many strawberries with cream you can possibly consume in one day) is what to wear. After all, while it's mainly about the tennis action on court, Wimbledon has always been a place to see and be seen, with celebrities from Sienna Miller to the Princess of Wales snapped on Centre Court in stunning outfits.

The dress code for Wimbledon is generally smart casual - you don't want to go too over-the-top (this is not Royal Ascot) but at the same time, it's a nice opportunity to don a beautiful dress or some on-trend tailoring. Shoes-wise, think practical: if you're up on Murray Mound, you don't want to sink into the grass, and the day tends to involve quite a lot of walking around. 

With the other accessories, you can go to town - think bold jewellery, chic handbags and a useful sun hat (although nothing too large, as you'll be very unpopular if you block someone else's view of the tennis action). As for what to avoid - clothes with political slogans or big company logos are banned - although you probably weren't going to wear that anyway. Here's what we suggest instead...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark White shares his analysis as French police finally try to stop small boats Britain's brightest tennis talents, Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper, enter Wimbledon as the nation's top-ranked players in their respective categories. "Draper has revealed that Raducanu's historic 2021 US Open triumph served as powerful motivation for his own career.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It marks a new initiative to reinvigorate tennis in the country, whilst also furthering the already-established brand associated with this tournament. However, the latter has already seen some of its notable stars pull out injured, with Tommy Paul, Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti the three outstanding names to have ruled themselves out. In fact, it just seems like Alexander Bublik would prefer to play elsewhere. Having been registered for both Queen's and Halle, the latter was likely always his primary destination given he has played there the last two years in a row, winning the title in 2023. And, with Halle seeing some of their star power drop out as well, a spot has opened up for the man who soared into the French Open quarter-finals just earlier this month. He'll be hoping to maintain that form despite the stark shift in surface. After thriving on the clay of Roland Garros, Bublik will be freshly backed as someone to support heading into the grass-court season. Bublik's win over Draper led him to claim that he was enjoying ‘the best moment' of his life, but there might still be more to come. After all, should he convert this newfound energy, and apply it into a real effort to improve and compete, Bublik has everything needed to be a huge threat on grass and at Wimbledon. It's just a shame that the Queen's crowd won't be treated to his enigmatic, unpredictable play style.</p>

But those are worries for another week. Sinner and Alcaraz competed for over five hours on Sunday, Alcaraz ultimately rallying from two sets down and saving three match points to defend his Roland Garros title.© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. It hasn't hurt that, even before it was over, their Roland Garros final had entered the G-MOAT—greatest match of all time—conversation. I saw the chatter begin online late in the fifth set, when it became clear that Sinner wasn't going away, and that this would be more than just a legendary comeback by Alcaraz.The match belongs in the best-ever conversation. In terms of quality and drama—the two categories that count—Sinner-Alcaraz was as good as anything that has come before in tennis. A definitive ranking of the all-time greatest matches, by men or women, in the entirety of tennis history, is a longer-term project—or an impossibility, depending on your point of view. I'll also stipulate that this is a subjective exercise, and not meant to speak for anything other than my personal preferences.

A post shared by Carlos Alcaraz Garfia (@carlitosalcarazz) All went deep into a fifth; Alcaraz-Djokovic was the only one that didn't continue past 5-5 in the deciding set. All of them except Gonzalez-Pasarell and 2018 Djokovic-Nadal were Grand Slam finals, and only Pasarell wasn't a Grand Slam champion. All but two were played on Centre Court at Wimbledon. That makes Sinner vs. Alcaraz, the only one at Roland Garros, an outlier in a good way. Court Philippe Chatrier deserves an all-time great contest.I'll start by eliminating Gonzalez-Pasarell. Yes, it lasted 112 games, but it was a first-round match.Next, I'll eliminate Djokovic-Nadal in Australia, because there was some sense at the time that, at five hours and 53 minutes, it was slightly too long, and that the tennis was slightly too attritional—“brutal,” in the parlance of that moment. (As I said, this is a subjective exercise. )I'll continue by eliminating Borg v. McEnroe because…I guess because it didn't really come to life until the fourth-set tiebreaker.

A post shared by Rafa Nadal (@rafaelnadal) I'll eliminate Djokovic-Federer, because…I don't know…because it's tough to think that this was Federer's last Slam final, and he lost it after having two match points? On the first day, they raced to beat a curfew, and it only made their play sharper and, especially in Nadal's case, more aggressive. Djokovic's hair's-breadth victory, which he saved with one of his handy running forehand passes late in the fifth, was an appropriate microcosm of their rivalry. And if it wasn't a final, it felt like one to both men—they knew their opponent two days later would be surprise finalist Kevin Anderson. Djokovic indeed went on to beat the South African in straights.Alcaraz-Sinner was as brilliantly played and theatrically thrilling as any match on the list. 2, on Chatrier's wide expanse of red, in front of a French crowd that lives to amp up the tension. The young players' super-charged mix of pace, finesse and athleticism made it feel like the next step in the game's evolution, and especially its evolution on clay. It featured a goal-line stand in the fourth set from Alcaraz, and a goal-line stand from Sinner in the fifth. I'll eliminate Alcaraz-Djokovic because two of the sets were 6-1.That leaves Nadal-Federer 2008 Wimbledon, Djokovic-Nadal 2018 Wimbledon, and Alcaraz-Sinner.Most people probably don't have the Djokovic-Nadal Wimbledon semi from 2018 at the top of their list.

A post shared by Jannik Sinner (@janniksin) If there's a hesitation about calling Sinner-Alcaraz the greatest match ever, it's probably due to their youth. Someday, we may rank them alongside the Big 3. But their names don't conjure the same sense of historical awe yet.Which brings me to Nadal-Federer at Wimbledon in 2008. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, it was brilliantly played; at the time, I thought it was the highest-quality match I'd ever seen. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, one player was trying to invade the other's surface—Nadal succeeded where Sinner failed. In both matches, there was a flurry of shots that saved match points in the fourth set, and sent it to a fifth. And both matches came to a climactic conclusion. Where Alcaraz and Sinner were playing their first Slam final, Nadal and Federer had been contesting them for two years, and had been building to this collision that whole time. 1 from Federer for the first time, prove he wasn't just a dirt-baller, and etch their names together forever.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wild cards have been announced for the men's ATP 500 event at the HSBC Championships – including Cam Norrie, Billy Harris and Dan Evans. The Queen's Club gets set for a second week of world class tennis from 16-22 June after the conclusion of its first women's event for over 50 years. Harris was one of the breakout stars of the grass court season last summer – making semi-finals in Surbiton, Nottingham and Eastbourne, as well as a quarter-final at Queen's. The big serving Brit is currently ranked just outside the world's top 100 and could tick off that milestone with another good run in West London. Heading straight from a second round appearance in Ilkley to the HSBC Championships, Harris will be hoping he can spark his grass court season alight when he returns to the venue that saw him reach his first ATP 500 semi-final almost 12 months ago. Evans will be heading back to British soil following a run to the second round of the Libema Open. With two grass court tournaments already under his belt this summer, Evans could be one to watch next week as he looks to cause an upset in West London. This year's final four have been decided ahead of two thrilling match-ups at Saturday's HSBC Championships semi-finals. Emma Raducanu's bid to be crowned the first WTA champion at The Queen's Club in 52 years came to an end at the hands of top seed and world No.7 Qinwen Zheng.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight-year-old Reese Brantmeier stared out her classroom window at a pair of tennis courts, where overgrown weeds sprouted from cracks in the green and red surface. A rusted fence surrounded the neglected space outside of Washington Elementary in Whitewater, Wisconsin. There was no net; only the empty poles, faded white lines — and memories. Frustration consumed the fourth grader when she packed her gear into her mom's car to take tennis lessons in Lake Geneva, 45 minutes away. A teammate on her basketball team had picked up tennis, but hated making the 45-minute commute alone, so she asked Brantmeier to join her. Brantmeier enjoyed it enough to keep going, but the future UNC women's tennis star wished she could play in Whitewater. Even as her tennis skills and ambition have outgrown Wisconsin, Brantmeier hasn't forgotten the sight of those courts outside her classroom window. She thought about the courts as she qualified for the U.S. Open at 14, and again at 16. They remained on her mind when a dispute with the NCAA over prize money cost her the first semester of her freshman year — and as she led UNC to its first-ever national championship in spring 2023. They were certainly on her mind when a torn meniscus ripped her away from the sport and shattered North Carolina's chances of going back-to-back — and when she sued the NCAA over those prize money rules. Andnow, as the 20-year-old Brantmeier works to come back from a second meniscus injury and earn a U.S. Open doubles wild card at a playoff in Orlando on Tuesday, the thought of those courts has not abandoned her. “Since she was in the fourth grade,” Her mother, Becky, said, “she said, ‘I'm gonna become famous, and I'm gonna fix those courts. Now, the rusted chain-link fence is gone. The weeds and cracks, too — replaced with new, smooth asphalt. It's not completed, yet, still a work in progress. North Carolina returned its entire starting lineup from the 2023 NCAA title run, and was aiming for a fifth-straight indoor title that February, with hopes of an NCAA repeat in the spring. Her mother could see the pain on Brantmeier's face. To avoid putting pressure on the rest of the team, Brantmeier stayed, and played standing still, even though it meant watching Scotty cover the court like a singles match. UNC finished off USC, but lost to N.C. State, 4-3, the next day without Brantmeier. It moved back into place on its own, so she could be back competing in two weeks. An MRI back in Chapel Hill revealed a bucket-handle tear of her meniscus, a notoriously slow-healing injury. She settled on the repair, at her doctors' recommendation. That repair usually takes four or five permanent sutures. Brantmeier required 12, a record for her surgeon. She was bedridden in her mother's hotel room. “It was the most pain I've ever been in,” she said. Then came blood clots, which set back the healing process. “I told her I'd stay there until she had one day without complications,” Becky said. Walking to class on crutches exhausted Brantmeier. She skipped some days because of the pain. “Somebody gets injured, something gets taken away, their attitude goes south,” head coach Brian Kalbas said. First, Texas A&M took the doubles point, clinching on Court 1 — where Brantmeier should've been playing. This wasn't the first time she'd faced that question. In the fall of her freshman year, before her first individual tournament, the NCAA began investigating some of her prize money and expenses from high school. Prior to college enrollment, athletes can accept up to $10,000 per calendar year in prize money from professional tournaments. Beyond that, they can only accept money to cover “actual and necessary expenses” — like meals, lodging, equipment and “other reasonable expenses.” Brantmeier's family said they never received an itemization of what was being disputed, only random questions — particularly related to the nearly $49,000 for making it to the third round of the 2021 U.S. Open singles qualifying tournament and the main draw in doubles. Her mother had bought a receipt scanner to track their expenses. The NCAA questioned if it was necessary, as well as a racket restringing outside of a 14-day competition window and a hotel room 16-year-old Brantmeier shared with her mother at the U.S. Open. The NCAA refused to certify her amateur status for four months, rendering her ineligible for the fall semester. “I had come to college to play tennis and that was all I'd done my whole life,” Brantmeier said. “So not being able to do that, I kind of was a little lost. The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment. At the end of winter break, the NCAA ruled she had to pay $5,100 to a charity of her choice. Then she could finally play college tennis. Brantmeier donated the money to the Patrick Ryan Memorial Tennis Foundation — aimed at promoting tennis in Wisconsin. She asked him to resurface the courts in her hometown. After her donation, Brantmeier found out it needed more work. Networked with pro players and UNC donors. A year later, she turned to the work during her injury. “I hadn't thought about tennis for myself in a long time,” Brantmeier said. The legal action seeks a change in the prize money rules, specifically the ban on athletes' ability to receive money for outside competitions beyond expenses. “When the distinction was you cannot make money at all [and] that was the line that they drew, that's a fair distinction between amateur and pro,” Brantmeier said. Eight months after the surgery, Brantmeier's knee still hurt. It made strange noises when she moved. So, back under the knife she went. This time, surgeons removed her meniscus, resetting all progress. “Ending up now without my meniscus, knowing that I could have done that earlier and played for the team by the end of the spring, was really tough to know,” Brantmeier said. She woke up from her procedure in October and felt she could walk on her knee immediately. She came back early to school from winter break to train, but only played one practice set. “But it was to a point if I'm physically cleared, it's gonna be tough regardless, you've just got to rip the Bandaid off.” She won her first match in straight sets. It was the most fun she'd had playing tennis since she was a kid making those commutes to Lake Geneva. 1 singles player in the nation at top-ranked Georgia in February to lead the team to a 4-3 victory. She finished the regular season with a 14-1 singles record and ranked No. In doubles, Brantmeier and her partner, freshman Alanis Hamilton, ranked No. At the height of her game, she led UNC to the NCAA Tournament quarterfinals in May. Then, after hitting a serve in her singles match against LSU, Brantmeier landed awkwardly. She called an injury timeout, but the pain in her knee was too much. This time, it was a slight tear in her medial meniscus — the remaining pad of cartilage in her knee. Two days later, UNC's season ended in the NCAA semifinals with a 4-0 loss to Georgia. “She has been playing such good tennis — the best tennis I've seen all semester,” senior teammate Lindsay Zink said. “It's been tough to see her get reinjured, but I know she's gonna come back better than ever.” Washington Elementary principal Tom Grosinske stood outside the Whitewater school in May. He took out his phone and hit record. “Hey Reese, it's Mr. G here,” Gronsinske said in the video. “I thought you wanted to see something pretty awesome.” Every time there's changes on those no-longer-abandoned courts, he records an update and sends it to Brantmeier. “Everyone has a vision — a hero or someone [they've] admired,” Gregory Stewart, an assistant coach for the girls' tennis team at Whitewater High, said. Weeks have passed since Brantmeier's latest injury, but she's returned to training. Meanwhile, Brantmeier v. NCAA is proceeding to discovery. On July 7, nearly seven weeks before the U.S. Open, a judge will decide whether to certify it as a class action suit. If granted, a trial is expected to follow in the summer of 2026. And as for those courts in Whitewater? Brantmeier has raised more than $159,000 in three years. Until the crew broke ground this summer, a green sign decorated the fence outside as a reminder that she hadn't forgotten. Help us renovate these courts and bring tennis back to the East side. That name is apropos for the Whitewater tennis court reclamation project, but also for Brantmeier's ongoing journey through the tennis world. The former appears close to a positive resolution. The latter appears to be just getting started — again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tommy Paul enjoyed a four-game winning streak at the French Open, making it to the quarter-finals, but was ultimately defeated by eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz crushed Paul, 6-0, 6-1, 6-4, beating him for the fourth time in a row en route to his second consecutive Roland Garros title. I sadly am still recovering from an abdominal strain and need more time to get fully fit. “I look forward to getting back on the grass soon. The triumph marked his third career title, having picked up a maiden ATP crown at Stockholm in 2021, and clinching his second in 2024 at the Dallas Open. Paul won Queen's while only dropping one set throughout the tournament, which came in the quarter-final against Jack Draper. After defeating Sebastian Baez and Alejandro Tabilo in the first two rounds, he played the British home hope in their fifth career meeting. Draper forced a third set in the match, but wasn't able to get over the line against a red-hot Paul, who he had beaten in three of their previous four clashes. In an all-American semi-final, Paul was able to best his compatriot Sebastian Korda 6-4, 7-6, to book his place in the final. He got off to a hot start in his showdown with Musetti on Centre Court, taking the first set 6-1, and despite the Italian's best efforts in the second set, he emerged victorious in London.</p>
