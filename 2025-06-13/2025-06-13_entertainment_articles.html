                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While spending six weeks filming their two new Hallmark Channel movies in Spain, Alison Sweeney and Ashley Williams picked up some great new wardrobe pieces — straight from the costume department. But they didn't just take a couple of things. During an interview with EntertainmentNow about filming “To Barcelona, With Love,” which debuted on June 7, and “To Barcelona, Forever,” premiering on June 14, the stars and longtime friends laughed as they admitted to taking their characters' entire wardrobes home with them. “I literally kept everything,” Williams said, laughing and covering her face. While Williams and Sweeney clearly loved the wardrobe pieces enough to wear them all in real life, they both said that the clothes created and selected for them were critical for getting to know their characters. She's unaware that the writer who translated her book into Spanish — Sweeney's character, American expat Erica — secretly revised the love story set in her adopted city, Barcelona. Through lots of highs and lows, the two eventually develop a kinship (and one winds up in a blossoming romance), leading to the second movie, which takes place six months later. During their chat with EntertainmentNow, Sweeney told Williams, “You brought in such a brilliant costume designer for us, because she really encapsulated our characters and gave us the physicality of like, what they wear and how they dress and how they look — before we even set foot on stage. And that helped me a lot to define who Erica is. And then, you know, just developing that along as we went was really so much fun for me.” Williams replied, “Shout out to Julia Schklair — she is a costume designer I actually worked with like 15 or 20 years ago on a TV show and we've kept in touch. When the clothes fit, everything else, so many other things go into place and shout out to her, because she just did an unbelievable job. She made me feel very at home in the character.” So that was, you know, a fun challenge for us at storytellers.” Williams then teased, “There's a family theme in the second movie that's not there at all in the first movie and it provides a lot of comedy.”</p>

This will be the second A24 project for Johnson, who stars in Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, which is due out this October.

Sources stress it is still very early, but if a deal closes this would mark his return to A24 after helming The Whale, which won Brendan Fraser an Oscar. Set in turn-of-the-millennium Southern California, the story follows an alienated young man who comes under the influence of a motivational guru, whose intoxicating charm masks his morally questionable methods of manipulation and his own concealed darkness. The pic will be produced and financed by A24. Stacey Sher's Shiny Penny Productions will produce alongside Johnson and Dany Garcia's Seven Bucks Productions, with Jacob Epstein and Justin Wolf to exec produce via Lighthouse Management and Media. Next up for Aronofsky is the Sony thriller Caught Stealing, starring Austin Butler and Zoe Kravitz. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Ryan Coogler is thanking fellow filmmaker Christopher Nolan for not only inspiring him, but also making the world a better place thanks to Nolan's art. “Sinners” director Coogler selected Nolan's directorial debut “Following” while visiting the Criterion Closet in the below video, and couldn't help but praise Nolan for changing cinema. I've come to know his wife [producer Emma Thomas]. The world is richer because they're making movies.” Coogler added that Nolan is a “mentor of mine,” no doubt since they both share indie filmmaking roots, have gone on to helm large IP installments (the “Black Panther” and “Dark Knight” respective trilogies), and also direct original blockbusters. Related Stories ‘How to Train Your Dragon' Built a Better Toothless by Leaning Into His Panther DNA ‘Materialists' Could Be Headed for a Swoon-Worthy Box Office Debut The film centers on an aspiring writer who stalks people to find inspiration. “A lot of the Christopher Nolan trademarks are here in this movie.” Coogler also selected “Thief” by Michael Mann as being a film “in discussion” with “Following.” Mann's 1981 feature “Thief” is a neo-noir heist movie starring the late James Caan. “I do think that in observing Chris' movies, I think that Michael Mann is a big influence,” Coogler said. And “Thief” also changed the game for crafts in filmmaking: Coogler added, “What I heard is that…a rumor about this film is this is the movie that made wetdowns a thing. A wetdown, if you don't know, is when you've got enough money to (this is probably a waste of water) to have a truck wet your streets down, and what it does is it makes, for nighttime photography, it makes the streets reflective.” Coogler previously thanked Nolan, along with auteur Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino, for helping inspire “Sinners.” Coogler wrote in a letter shared with IndieWire, “I had the gift of the opportunity of making a film inspired by my family and my ancestry, but it was always a film that we wanted to make for audiences, in theaters. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Celine Song has found her next project, “Damage,” a series she's currently developing for HBO set in the world of competitive E-Sports. The “Materialists” and “Past Lives” filmmaker told Variety in an interview that she's currently developing the series for HBO, but she declined to share any other specific plot information. Song is writing, directing, and serving as executive producer on the series. Song will team with “The Last of Us” and “Chernobyl” creator Craig Mazin on the series, who is also joining as an executive producer. And A24, which produced both of Song's films, is co-producing the series with HBO. Mazin, Jacqueline Lesko, and Cecil O'Connor are non-writing executive producers on behalf of their company, and Song's collaborator David Hinojosa is also a non-writing executive producer. It's a big departure for Song, whose first two features have been indie love triangles (Song might disagree), though “Materialists” specifically has generated plenty of conversation for how it blends genres. “Past Lives” from 2023 was nominated for two Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, and it served as a breakout role for lead Greta Lee. Her latest feature “Materialists,” which opens wide in theaters today from A24, stars Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal and stars Johnson as a romantic matchmaker. Hollywood, though, has seen video games become one of the biggest new realms to find intellectual property, so it only makes sense that HBO would want a piece of the action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Directed by Elegance Bratton, Move Ya Body digs into the origins of house music on the South Side of Chicago, where Lawrence and his peers crafted a new sound with emerging synth technology and perfected it in underground clubs like the Warehouse. The birth of house music in the 1980s was also, in part, a response to the heyday, and unceremonious downfall, of disco, another genre that had distinctly Black origins before garnering more mainstream attention via white artists and culture. Lawrence happened to be working as an usher at Chicago's Comisky Park on Disco Demolition Night in 1979, when a largely white crowd rioted after blowing up a crate of disco records. Bell-bottom pants and the leisure suits were a way for us to feel together, when we had matching tops and bottoms. All of these things were being said in a way that was looking down on everything that brought us joy.” In an email to Rolling Stone, Bratton calls Disco Demolition Night an “ideological lynching” that was “meant to remind Blacks, queers, and femmes to stay in their place.” Pointedly, he adds: “The same forces that conspired to destroy Black dance music in the late 1970s are alive and well. Today, they call themselves MAGA…  It feels so easy to just give these lunatics what they want but in Vince there is a powerful rebuke of the status quo. Move Ya Body is set to screen Friday, June 13, as part of the Tribeca Film Festival, with additional showings scheduled through the weekend. Along with Lawrence, the film features interviews with other house luminaries including Marshall Jefferson, “Screamin'” Rachael Cain, Byron Stingily, Lady D, Kevin Aviance, and Lori Branch. Nelly, Ashanti Trailer Offers a Look at the Newlywed Couple Navigating Parenthood and Their Careers Bruce Springsteen Says Without Brian Wilson There'd Be No 'Racing in the Street' Trump ‘Doesn't Speak With Precision,' Justice Department Tells Judge In explaining why he wanted to make Move Ya Body, Bratton says it was as much about his love of music as it was a desire to “make sure the pioneers of house can get their roses while they are still here.” I want to show through Move Ya Body that partying is political. If they weren't scared of our collective power then they wouldn't spend so much time trying to keep us apart.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Gordon has shared a reworked version of “Bye Bye,” the lead single from 2024's The Collective, that's now a protest song against President Donald J. Trump. Check out the song's music video, co-directed by Gordon and Vice Cooler, below. “[Producer and collaborator] Justin Raisen had this idea to redo ‘Bye Bye' starting at the end of the song,” explained Gordon. “When I was thinking of lyric ideas, it occurred to me to use words taken from a site that had all the words that Trump has essentially banned, meaning any grant or piece of a project or proposal for research that includes any of those words would be immediately disregarded or ‘cancelled.' The new track arrives ahead of the “No Kings” protests that are expected to happen nationwide on Saturday, June 14. Proceeds from the sale of both “Bye Bye 25!” and its promotional T-shirt will be donated to reproductive rights nonprofit Noise for Now. Among the words rattled off in the song are “female,” “climate change,” “Hispanic,” “women,” “mental health,” and “immigrants.” Organizations that have been affected so far by the president's administrative orders and policies include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and NASA, among others. Those nods marked the first time Gordon was ever in the running for a Grammy, as neither she nor Sonic Youth were ever nominated prior.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Justin Bieber stays busy recording the long-awaited follow-up to his 2021 Justice album, his backing gorup, We the Band, dropped their debut single on Friday morning (June 13). The Earth, Wind & Fire-esque slow-burn R&B jam “One & Only” showcases the group's smooth, soulful vocals and retro '70s funk style. The slick accompanying performance video was directed by Zev York in collaboration with Nick DeMoura, who was the choreographer and creative director for JB's 2023 Believe world tour. The group consisting of bassist/vocalist Harv, DJ Tay James, guitarist/vocalist Julian Michael, drummer Devin “Stixx” Taylor and keyboardist Dr. O backed up Bieber on his 2015 Purpose world tour as well as his 2022 Justice world tour, which prematurely ended in Sept. 2022 after the singer revealed that he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and suffering from partial facial paralysis. According to a release announcing the song, Tay James met Bieber in 2009 after graduating from college, snagging a gig as the singer's official DJ, followed by bassist Harv taking on the role of music director in Bieber's live band, which he filled out with Taylor and Michael. In 2021, Harv co-wrote and co-produced Bieber's Billboard Hot 100 No. “To create our own music that represents who we are as musicians with the support of a global powerhouse like Avex is incredibly exciting for all of us. At press time no additional information was available on Bieber's next studio album, which the singer has been teasing for much of the past year via videos and pictures from the recording studio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Brandi Glanville hasn't had the best couple of years, as she has experienced some notable health issues. Her son, Jake, graduated from high school. She posted on Instagram, “And just like that it's Graduation Day!!! A post shared by Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville) He did so with a video montage, which also included his wife, LeAnn Rimes. A post shared by Eddie Cibrian (@eddiecibrian) It continued, “Congrats, my boy.” LeAnn also shared the post on her social media as she congratulated her stepson. She said on her podcast, “I went over there to my ex's house [for Christmas] because of my kids. Like, I would take a bullet for them.” Brandi then said, “What was I gonna do? Stay over here in my house, be lonely during Christmas, or go be with, like, my beloved children and my in-laws, who I'm obsessed with and love?” She added, “I can step in there as long as everyone's happy and everyone's in one place and the kids are happy and we're having a good time and the food is good.” This was a massive scandal at the time, but the three are now on good terms. Naturally, Brandi's divorce and the events that led to it became a topic while she was on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” However, she hasn't been on the series since 2015 and has recently spoken openly about her non-existent relationship with Bravo and Andy Cohen.</p>
