The direct conversion of methane into valuable unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4) attracts growing attention. Non-thermal plasma offers a promising approach for this process under mild conditions. However, the competing formation of C2H6 and excessive dehydrogenation limit the selectivity toward C2H2 and C2H4. Herein, we develop a promising shielded bifunctional nanoreactor with a hollow structure and mesoporous channels (Na2WO4-Mn3O4/m-SiO2) that effectively limits CH4 overactivation and promotes selective coupling to form C2H2 and C2H4 under plasma activation, achieving 39% CH4 conversion with 42.3% C2H2 and C2H4 fraction. This nanoreactor features isolated Na2WO4 embedded within the channels and Mn3O4 confined in the cavity of the SiO2 hollow nanospheres, enabling internal tandem catalysis at co-located active sites. Na2WO4 induces the conversion of diffused CH4 and CH3 into reactive intermediates (*CH and *CH2), which subsequently couple on the Mn3O4 surface to form C2H2 and C2H4. Furthermore, the mesoporous channels inhibit the plasma discharge within the nanoreactor, preventing deep dehydrogenation of CHx species to solid carbon. This nanoreactor demonstrates a highly selective route for the nonoxidative conversion of methane to valuable C2 hydrocarbons, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of catalysts for plasma-driven chemical processes. Unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons, crucial building blocks in the chemical industry, are primarily produced from the energy-intensive processing of crude oil. The development of sustainable alternatives via gas conversion has attracted increasing interest1,2. While conventional gas conversion methods rely on indirect syngas routes, direct methane conversion to unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons offers a more attractive pathway3,4. Direct conversion of CH4 to value-added fuels and chemicals can be achieved through either nonoxidative or oxidative catalytic routes5,6,7. The nonoxidative pathway offers high C2 selectivity and atom utilization efficiency but demands endothermic conditions (up to 1100 °C), incurring substantial energy costs and CO2 emissions1. In contrast, oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) can significantly lower the reaction temperature to ~600 °C in the presence of O28,9. However, this method suffers from overoxidation of CH4 to thermodynamically favored CO and CO2, limiting the yield of unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons8,10. These challenges highlight the urgent need for innovative strategies to enhance methane activation and coupling efficiency. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) offers a promising solution for the homolytic activation of CH4 into radicals, enabling nonoxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) under mild conditions11,12. Among NTP techniques, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) has been extensively explored for methane coupling. However, the main challenge is the limited control over product distribution, particularly in achieving selective production of unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons, such as acetylene (C2H2) and ethylene (C2H4). Instead, ethane (C2H6) is predominantly produced in NOCM using DBD reactors11,13,14,15,16. This selectivity issue originates from the significantly longer lifetime of CH3 radicals (>1 ms) compared to CH2 (<30 ns) and CH (<5 ns) radicals, which favors undesired reaction pathways17. Integrating tailored catalysts into DBD reactors has great potential to enhance selectivity toward targeted products14,18,19. Ideally, such catalysts would regulate the dehydrogenation process and selectively stabilize CH and CH2 intermediates, directing the reaction toward the formation of C2H2 and C2H4. The plasma-catalytic NOCM process involves heterogeneous surface reactions, highlighting the importance of the rational design of catalysts with tailored active sites and morphologies to maximize performance. In conventional OCM, Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 have proven effective in CH4 activation and C-C coupling20. Specifically, Na2WO4 generates reactive oxygen species to activate CH4, while Mn2O3-supported O species promote the coupling of *CH3 intermediates21,22,23. Given their critical roles in methane coupling, integrating Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 into plasma-catalytic NOCM offers a promising avenue to enhance the production of unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons through their synergistic effects – a strategy that remains underexplored. Notably, Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 function at distinct stages of the methane coupling pathway. Plasma pre-activates CH4, facilitating Na2WO4-mediated enhancement of CHx dehydrogenation into *CH and *CH2 surface species, while Mn2O3 promotes subsequent coupling of these intermediates to form C2H2 and C2H4. Inspired by this synergistic interplay, we propose that a tandem plasma-catalysis system using spatially structured Na2WO4-MnOx catalysts—designed to sequentially optimize dehydrogenation and coupling steps—could potentially achieve enhanced efficiency in C2 hydrocarbon formation compared to plasma-catalysis systems using randomly structured catalysts. To address the challenges of overactivation and selectivity control in plasma-assisted methane coupling, we propose a promising assembled nanoreactor (Na2WO4-Mn3O4/m-SiO2, denoted as WMO/m-SiO2) designed for integration into a DBD plasma reactor (Supplementary Fig. This nanoreactor features a hollow structure with mesoporous channels, accessibility to reactants both internally and externally. This design provides a shielding effect for CH4 molecules within the channels, preventing excessive dehydrogenation by plasma-generated reactive species. Furthermore, the WMO/m-SiO2 reactor demonstrates tandem catalytic functionality, significantly enhancing selectivity toward target C2 products. Specifically, Na2WO4 located within the m-SiO2 channels initiates CH4 activation, generating *CH2 and *CH surface intermediates. Concurrently, Mn3O4 species confined within the cavity of the SiO2 spheres promote facile coupling of these CH and CH2 intermediates to form C2H2 and C2H4. Our study demonstrates significantly enhanced C2H2 and C2H4 yields compared to conventional catalysts under analogous DBD plasma conditions. This work offers a strategy to overcome critical limitations in plasma-catalysis, advancing efficient methane conversion to high-value C2 hydrocarbons. The synthesized mesoporous SiO2 (m-SiO2) featured interconnected nanospheres with diameters ranging from 95 to 135 nm (Fig. Each nanosphere exhibited a hollow structure with a cavity diameter of ~65 nm and a shell thickness of ~20 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2b), along with a relatively high specific surface area of 240 m2 g−1 (Supplementary Table 1). Loading manganese and tungsten species onto m-SiO2 did not affect the hollow structure, and the resulting WMO/m-SiO2 nanoreactor retained surface porosity with particles localized both within the cavity and on the external surface (Fig. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the presence of Mn3O4 and amorphous SiO2 in the WMO/m-SiO2 composite (Supplementary Fig. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that the dispersed particles on the shell and cavity walls of m-SiO2 were Na2WO4 and Mn3O4, respectively (Fig. The measured lattice spacings of 0.38 and 0.25 nm corresponded to Na2WO4 (111) and Mn3O4 (211), respectively (Fig. Notably, although XRD confirmed the presence of Mn3O4 (Supplementary Fig. 4), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elemental distribution mapping (Supplementary Figs. 5, 6) of WMO/m-SiO2 revealed negligible Mn and W signals compared to WMO/SiO2 and WMO/ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil-5). Unless otherwise specified, WMO/m-SiO2, WMO/SiO2, and WMO/ZSM-5 refer to samples with 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn loaded on the support material. These findings indicate that Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 particles are predominantly encapsulated within the m-SiO2 spheres. Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) scans in Fig. 1f further confirmed the presence of Mn species inside the m-SiO2 cavity. a TEM image and particle size distribution of m-SiO2. b SEM image of WMO/m-SiO2. c Production rate and molar fraction of C2H4 and C2H2 within C2-C3 hydrocarbons (Conditions: 1 bar, specific energy input (SEI) 5.1 kJ L−1, where SEI is defined as plasma discharge power divided by the gas flow rate; Feed gas 5 vol% CH4/Ar, total flow rate 200 mL min−1, discharge power 17 W, experiment duration 60 min). Error bars (standard deviation) in the figure were obtained from three sampling runs. d, e TEM and HRTEM images of WMO/m-SiO2. f EDS line scans (from Point 1 to Point 2) from Fig. g Pore size distributions of m-SiO2, WMO/m-SiO2, WMO/ZSM-5, and WMO/SiO2. h Production rate of C2-C3 hydrocarbons and methane conversion for catalysis-only, plasma-only and plasma-catalysis systems. We evaluated CH4 conversion under three different conditions: plasma-only (no catalyst, no external heating), catalysis-only (external heating at 250 °C, no plasma), and plasma-catalysis (coupled plasma and catalysts, no external heating). Under plasma-only and plasma-catalysis conditions, the measured temperature was ~250 °C. In plasma-only mode, C2-C3 hydrocarbons dominated, with a maximum production of 31.2 μmol min−1 at a CH4 conversion of 33% (Supplementary Figs. Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms were excluded due to negligible concentrations (<5% relative selectivity compared to C2 products). A synchronized increase in C2H2 and C2H4 proportions was observed, which can be attributed to the closely aligned energetic thresholds of electron-induced CH4 conversion into CH2 and CH species13. WMO/m-SiO2 exhibited no catalytic activity for methane conversion at 250 °C in the absence of plasma. However, under NTP conditions with WMO/m-SiO2, the production of C2H4 and C2H2 significantly increased to 30.3 μmol g−1 min−1 (12.8 μmol g−1 min−1 for C2H4 and 17.5 μmol g−1 min−1 for C2H2), surpassing WMO/SiO2 and WMO/ZSM-5 by factors of ~5 and 3.4, respectively (Fig. With the WMO/m-SiO2 nanoreactor, the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the C2–C3 range increased significantly from 17.7% (plasma-only) to 42.3% (Fig. Simultaneously, the total yield of C2H4 increased markedly from 2.6 to 6.4 μmol min−1, while C2H2 increased from 3.1 to 8.8 μmol min−1. Notably, all three catalysts selectively promoted C2H4 and C2H2 production via deep dehydrogenation and coupling of CH4, rather than promoting overall methane conversion (Fig. The pore sizes of m-SiO2 and WMO/m-SiO2 ranged from 20 to 40 nm, distinct from those of WMO/SiO2 and WMO/ZSM-5 (Fig. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, WMO/ZSM-5 exhibited the highest surface area of 226 m2 g−1, significantly exceeding that of WMO/m-SiO2 (67 m2 g−1). However, plasma-only and plasma-catalysis conditions (using WMO/ZSM-5, WMO/SiO2 and WMO/m-SiO2) exhibited similar discharge properties (Supplementary Figs. Additionally, packing the discharge zone with silica supports yielded consistent C2H2 and C2H4 levels (Supplementary Fig. Furthermore, despite its lower surface area, WMO/m-SiO2 demonstrated better CH4 coupling efficiency to C2H2 and C2H4, highlighting the critical role of its unique hollow mesoporous structure in enhancing the synergistic interaction between NTP and catalysis. TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images depict the morphology of the catalysts and the location of metal oxide particles, respectively (Fig. The metal oxide particles were selectively deposited in three configurations: (1) exclusively inside m-SiO2 (In-m-SiO2), (2) partially distributed within m-SiO2 (Both-m-SiO2), and (3) predominantly deposited on the exterior of m-SiO2 (Out-m-SiO2). For both “In-m-SiO2” and “Both-m-SiO2”, the Mn3O4 sizes ranged from 5 to 35 nm (Supplementary Fig. TEM analysis of Both-m-SiO2 revealed a significant reduction in the Si signal around Particle 1 (50–90 nm), while no similar decrease was observed near Particle 2 (150–200 nm) (Fig. Moreover, the Mn signal intensified in both particle types, suggesting that Particle 1 and Particle 2 are located on the exterior and interior surfaces of the m-SiO2 nanosphere, respectively (Fig. XRD patterns further confirmed the spatial distribution of Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 particles. Samples with higher diffraction intensities and more pronounced peaks corresponded to increased exposure of Mn3O4 species on the external surface of m-SiO2 (Supplementary Fig. a TEM image and EDS spectra of spent catalysts In-m-SiO2, Out-m-SiO2, and Both-m-SiO2 (after 60 min of reaction). b Schematic illustration of the role of m-SiO2 and the effect of catalyst position on methane coupling. c Mn3+/(Mn3++Mn2+) ratio for fresh and spent catalysts. d Yields of C2H2 and C2H4 (defined as the product of CH4 conversion and the selectivity of C2H2 and C2H4) and equivalent carbon deposition rate (ECR, defined as the solid carbon selectivity on the catalyst divided by the methane conversion) (Conditions: 1 bar, SEI 5.1 kJ L−1, total flow rate 200 mL min−1, discharge power 17 W, experiment duration 60 min). EDS analysis of Particle 1 (internal) revealed weaker carbon and stronger oxygen signals compared to Particle 2 (external) (Fig. This suggests that m-SiO2 protects Mn3O4 particles from direct exposure to CH4 plasma. This shielding effect arises from the “Debye shielding” mechanism, where plasma discharge cannot penetrate the mesopores of m-SiO2 due to their pore diameters being smaller than the Debye length (typically hundreds of nanometers)19,24,25. Thus, the shielded internal cavity prevents the reduction of Mn3O4 particles and mitigates direct carbon deposition. This hypothesis is further supported by the observed decrease in the Mn3+/(Mn3++Mn2+) ratio as more manganese oxide particles are located outside the m-SiO2 layer (Fig. Previous studies have shown that low-valent metal catalysts (oxides, carbides, or metals) are highly effective for the deep dehydrogenation of CH426,27. Consistent with these findings, Supplementary Fig. 19 shows that Mn3O4 particles exhibited a stronger carbon signal than the m-SiO2 surface. Furthermore, as Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 particles are encapsulated within m-SiO2 nanospheres, the yield of C2H2 and C2H4 decreased from 7.0% (WMO/m-SiO2) to 4.5% (Na2WO4-Mn3O4, denoted as WMO). This trend implies that converting an equivalent amount of methane leads to more carbon deposition when fewer encapsulated Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 particles are present (Fig. The 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 catalyst achieved a combined C2H4 and C2H2 selectivity of 18.1%, surpassing that of Na2WO4/m-SiO2 (14.5%), 5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 (13.2%) and plasma-only conditions (7.9%) (Fig. A comparison of CH4 conversion and C2-C3 hydrocarbon distribution in the DBD reactor with previous studies is provided in Supplementary Table 2. The 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 (WMO/m-SiO2) catalyst demonstrated the high selectivity for C2H2 and C2H4, while maintaining competitive methane conversion. Among reported studies, this work achieved a lower energy cost (EC) for CH4 conversion (6.8 MJ/mol), demonstrating the effectiveness of the catalyst in plasma-catalytic NOCM reaction. Notably, the catalyst exhibited stable performance for over 25 h (Supplementary Figs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XRD analyses confirmed that the dominant oxidation states of tungsten and manganese species in WMO/m-SiO2, as well as in 5% Mn/m-SiO2 and 1% Na2WO4/m-SiO2, remained unchanged after the reaction (Supplementary Figs. 21 shows that increasing the Na2WO4 loading from 0.5 to 5% increased carbon deposition from 16.4 to 24.6%. In contrast, higher Mn3O4 content reduced carbon deposition. These findings suggest that Na2WO4/m-SiO2 more effectively promotes the further dehydrogenation of methane compared to Mn3O4/m-SiO2. a Selectivity of products (carbon deposited on the catalyst, C2H4 and C2H2) for plasma-only and plasma-catalysis systems (Conditions: 1 bar, SEI 5.1 kJ L−1, total flow rate 200 mL min−1, discharge power 17 W, experiment duration 60 min). Error bars (standard deviation) in the figure were obtained from three sampling runs. b Selectivity of carbon deposited on the catalyst and selectivity of C2H4 and C2H2 for reduced WMO/m-SiO2 (reduced at 450 °C with H2). c Mn 2p XPS spectra of reduced WMO/m-SiO2 (pretreated with H2 for 5, 10, 20, and 25 min). d IR spectra of WMO/m-SiO2 (black), Mn3O4/m-SiO2 (blue), and Na2WO4/m-SiO2 (red) under plasma-catalysis conditions. e Quasi-in situ DRIFT spectra of catalysts after plasma-catalytic NOCM reaction. f CH2D2 and C2HD3 species generated under plasma-only and plasma-catalysis (with WMO/m-SiO2) conditions (feed gas 2.5 vol% CH4-2.5 vol% CD4/Ar, SEI 5.1 kJ L−1, total flow rate 200 mL min−1; experiment duration 60 min). The involvement of catalyst-bound oxygen species is well established in methane dehydrogenation5,9 and the coupling of intermediate species28,29,30, highlighting their crucial roles in these reactions. To investigate this effect, we pretreated WMO/m-SiO2 with H2 at 450 °C for different durations, generating a series of WMO/m-SiO2 samples with varying oxygen contents. H2 pretreatment at 450 °C primarily reduced Mn3O4 but not tungsten species, as evidenced by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and XPS (Fig. H2 treatment resulted in increased carbon deposition and decreased selectivity for C2H4 and C2H2 when the WMO/m-SiO2 nanoreactor was reduced for 5–20 min, accompanied by a decline in Mn3+ content and oxygen loading within the catalyst (Fig. These observations align with the trend that increasing the Mn content (β) from 2 to 10% in 1% Na2WO4-β Mn3O4/m-SiO2 slightly enhanced the production of C2-C3 hydrocarbons (Supplementary Fig. These findings suggest that MnOx acts as an oxygen carrier, promoting the coupling of active species (CHx and H) and reducing methane cracking. This highlights the importance of optimizing oxygen content in catalysts to maximize performance. In situ plasma-coupled Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to investigate plasma-assisted surface reactions on WMO/m-SiO2, 5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 and 1% Na2WO4/m-SiO2. As shown in Supplementary Fig. These absorbed ≡C-H and =C-H bands are associated with key intermediates involved in the formation of C2H2 and C2H4 during the catalytic process31. Additional IR bands at 1465, 1585, 1708, 3265, and 3320 cm−1 correspond to C = C stretching vibrations on the catalyst surface (Fig. Notably, WMO/m-SiO2 exhibited the highest intensities for peaks associated with ≡C-H, =C-H, and C=C compared to catalysts containing only Mn or W. This finding suggests that the synergistic interaction between Mn3O4 and Na2WO4 sites effectively promotes the formation of surface-adsorbed *CH and *CH2 groups, ultimately enhancing the yield of C2H4 and C2H2. Quasi-in situ DRIFTS characterization provided further insights into the types of adsorbed species remaining on the catalyst surface after the reaction (Supplementary Figs. 3e, several key peaks were observed, including C–H stretching from *CH3 (2960 and 2872 cm−1)34, C–H stretching from *CH2 (2930 cm−1)34, C=C bonds (1585 and 1465 cm−1)32,33 and C-H bond bending/deformation modes (1384 cm−1)35. In this study, the angles (∠1 = 12°, ∠2 = 0°, and ∠3 = 3°) between the standard slope and tangents (peak 2960 to peak 2930 cm−1) were used to measure the relative proportions of absorbed *CH3 and *CH2 species on the catalyst surface. These species serve as precursors for the formation of ethane and ethylene, respectively36. Among the catalysts, 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 exhibited the highest *CH2 intensity, followed by 1% Na2WO4/m-SiO2 and 5% Mn/m-SiO2. Notably, compared to 1% Na2WO4/m-SiO2, 5% Mn/m-SiO2 promoted the formation of surface C=C (1585 and 1465 cm−1), indicating that *CH2 formation predominantly occurred at W sites, while Mn sites facilitated the coupling of CH2 to form C=C bonds. Although the internal Mn3O4 sites are not directly exposed to plasma (Supplementary Fig. 3), varying the Mn3O4 loading within the m-SiO2 spheres led to observable changes in product distribution and the relative intensity of adsorbed *CH3 and *CH2 species (Supplementary Figs. This suggests that CHx radicals can diffuse or migrate at least 20 nm to reach Mn3O4 sites within their lifetime, enabling them to access the interior of the catalyst for subsequent reactions. Methane isotopic labeling experiments, conducted using a parallel flow of CH4 and CD4, revealed an increase in CH3 and CH2 radicals during the plasma-catalyzed reaction over WMO/m-SiO2 compared to the plasma-only condition (Fig. Detailed experimental procedures are provided in the Methods section, and the corresponding conversions of CD4 and CH4, along with product distributions, are shown in Supplementary Fig. The experiment was designed to probe the complex dynamics within the discharge field, where multiple collisions and coupling reactions occur, leading to the reversible activation of C-H bonds, facilitating the reformation of nascent methane from activated CxHy intermediates36. This behavior contrasts with the essentially irreversible C-H activation in traditional OCM29. The detection of mixed CH2D2 and CHD3 isotopes during plasma-catalyzed NOCM on WMO/m-SiO2 confirmed this mechanism. Compared to the plasma-only system, the plasma-catalytic system with WMO/m-SiO2 demonstrated significantly higher production of CH2D2 and CHD3 (Fig. This result suggests that WMO/m-SiO2 enhances the activation of CH4 and the generation of CH3/CD3 and CH2/CD2 radicals. The enriched pool of CH2 species ultimately promotes dimerization into C2H2 and C2H411. In summary, the synergistic interaction between Mn3O4 and Na2WO4 sites in the WMO/m-SiO2 nanoreactor effectively promotes the formation of surface-adsorbed *CH and *CH2 species, as well as gas-phase CH2 radicals, leading to enhanced yields of C2H2 and C2H4. Synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to elucidate the chemical state and local structure of the WMO/m-SiO2 catalysts. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Mn K-edge (Mn3O4/m-SiO2) and W K-edge (Na2WO4/m-SiO2) in WMO/m-SiO2 closely resembled those of the individual Mn3O4/m-SiO2 and Na2WO4/m-SiO2 reference catalysts (Supplementary Fig. This observation, in substantial contrast to the combined Na2WO4-Mn3O4 spectrum, strongly suggests the presence of isolated Mn3O4 and Na2WO4 active sites dispersed on the m-SiO2 support. Further validation was provided by Fourier transform (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) results (Fig. The peaks at 1.4 Å (Fig. 4b) mainly represent the single scattering of Mn−O and W–O bonds, respectively, confirming the existence of isolated Mn and W species and the absence of direct Mn-W binding in the WMO/m-SiO2 catalyst. The bond lengths for Mn–O and W–O in WMO/m-SiO2 were determined to be 1.86 and 1.69 Å, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). The proposed Mn-O model exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental spectra, as evidenced by its superior fit in the XANES analysis and negligible deviations from DFT calculations (Supplementary Figs. a Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS spectrum of Mn and the DFT-optimized structure of Mn3O4 on WMO/m-SiO2. b FT-EXAFS spectra of W and DFT-optimized structure of Na2WO4 on WMO/m-SiO2. c DFT-optimized geometries of *CH4 dehydrogenation to *CH3, *CH2, and *CH on Mn3O4 (211) and Na2WO4 (111) surfaces. d DFT-optimized geometries of *CH3 to C2H4 on Mn3O4 (211) and Na2WO4 (111) surfaces. e DFT-optimized geometries of *CH2 coupled to C2H2 on Mn3O4 (211) and Na2WO4 (111) surfaces. f DFT-optimized geometries of intermediates in the plasma-catalytic conversion of CH4 to radicals, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. g Wavelet transform plots of the Mn K-edge and W K-edge. h Schematic illustration of C2H2 and C2H4 formation pathways on WMO/m-SiO2. To elucidate the fundamental mechanism of C2H2 and C2H4 production within WMO/m-SiO2, spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were employed to unravel the distinct roles of its components during plasma-catalytic NOCM reaction. Based on experimental results (Fig. 3), we selected Mn3O4 (211) and Na2WO4 (111) surfaces as model systems (Supplementary Fig. The calculated binding energies of reaction intermediates involved in CH4 dehydrogenation and subsequent coupling to C2H2 and C2H4 are presented in Supplementary Tables 4, 5. Notably, the binding strength of the CxHy intermediates followed the order of Mn3O4 (211) > Na2WO4 (111), with intermediates binding via C or C-C on both surfaces (Supplementary Figs. The calculated Gibbs free energy change profiles for CH4 dehydrogenation and intermediate active species coupling on the Mn3O4 (211) and Na2WO4 (111) catalysts are shown in Fig. 4c), the Na2WO4 (111) surface can facilitate CH4 dehydrogenation to produce *CH3, *CH2, and *CH species. The most challenging step was *CH3 dehydrogenation, with an uphill energy of 0.22 eV, followed by *CH2 dehydrogenation, with an uphill energy of 0.19 eV on the Na2WO4 (111) surface. In contrast, CH4 dehydrogenation on the Mn3O4 (211) surface required significantly higher uphill energy (0.73 and 0.75 eV) for producing *CH2 and *CH species, respectively. In addition, the reaction energy barriers for *CH3 → *CH2 + *H and *CH2 → *CH + *H were calculated (Supplementary Table 8). These two elementary reactions were identified as the rate-determining steps in CH4 dehydrogenation to generate *CH3, *CH2, and *CH species on both surfaces (Fig. 4c), with energy barriers of 0.97 and 0.69 eV on Na2WO4 (111), significantly lower than those on Mn3O4 (211) (1.93 and 2.02 eV). This indicates that the Na2WO4(111) surface is more effective in facilitating CH4 dehydrogenation, consistent with experimental results (Supplementary Fig. The Mn3O4 (211) surface was found to be more favorable for coupling *CH2 and *CH species to generate C2H4 and C2H2 (Fig. 4e), with uphill energies of 0.49 and 0.19 eV, respectively. In contrast, on the Na2WO4 (111) surface, the most difficult steps were *CH3 dehydrogenation (Fig. 4e), with significantly higher uphill energies of 0.73 and 2.52 eV, respectively. In addition, we investigated CH4 dehydrogenation and radical coupling reactions under plasma-only conditions (Fig. The results suggest that plasma-driven NOCM without a catalyst favors the production of C2H6, in stack contrast to plasma-catalyzed reactions. To elucidate the role of SiO2 in the WMO/m-SiO2 nanoreactor, SiO2/Mn3O4 (211) and SiO2/Na2WO4 (111) models were built (Supplementary Figs. The calculated binding energies of reaction intermediates involved in CH4 dehydrogenation and subsequent coupling to form C2H2 and C2H4 are presented in Supplementary Tables 6 and 7, with the most stable adsorption configurations illustrated in Supplementary Figs. Notably, SiO2/Na2WO4 (111) exhibited significantly weaker binding for *C2H2 compared to the isolated Na2WO4 (111) surface, with adsorption energies of −0.54 versus −0.95 eV, respectively (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, SiO2/Mn3O4 (211) favored the desorption of *C2H4 compared to pure Mn3O4 (211), with an adsorption energy of −0.62 eV (compared to −1.58 eV on pure Na2WO4 (111)). In summary, DFT calculations reveal that Na2WO4 facilitates CH4 dehydrogenation to *CH or *CH2 intermediates, while Mn3O4 promotes the coupling of *CH and *CH2 to form C2H2 and C2H4, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of SiO2 in combination with Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 enhances the desorption of the generated *C2H2 and *C2H4 species. These findings are consistent with experimental observations. The enhanced catalytic performance of Na2WO4-Mn3O4/m-SiO2, compared to Na2WO4/m-SiO2 and Mn3O4/m-SiO2, highlights the synergistic effects between Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 sites (Supplementary Fig. Quasi-in situ DRIFTS characterization (Fig. 31, 32) indicates that W sites promote *CH2 generation, while Mn sites facilitate the coupling of *CH2 to form C=C bonds. If radicals were fully converted at Na2WO4 before reaching Mn3O4 sites within m-SiO2, significant carbon deposition would be expected on Na2WO4. However, compared to Na2WO4/m-SiO2, the 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 catalyst exhibits lower carbon accumulation (Supplementary Fig. These findings suggest that radicals initially generated on Na2WO4 sites undergo further transformation into *CH and *CH2, which subsequently migrate to Mn3O4 sites for coupling reactions to produce C2H2 and C2H4. Wavelet transforms of the EXAFS spectra at the Mn K-edge and W K-edge for WMO/m-SiO2, 5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2, and 1% Na2WO4/m-SiO2 reveal similar Mn−O and W−O scattering peaks at (4.1, 1.4 Å) and (3.9, 1.2 Å), respectively (Fig. These findings indicate that Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 are independently distributed on the m-SiO2 support, consistent with TEM observations (Supplementary Fig. Notably, TEM analysis also demonstrates the close spatial proximity of Na2WO4 and Mn3O4, providing potential pathways for intermediate species migration. DFT calculations further reveal that the adsorption energies of *CH and *CH2 on Mn3O4 are −5.21 and −3.96 eV, respectively, significantly stronger than those on Na2WO4 (−3.27 and −3.08 eV) (Supplementary Tables 6, 7). Notably, when supported on m-SiO2, the adsorption energy gap increases, suggesting that radicals preferentially stabilize on Mn3O4 rather than remaining on Na2WO4 (Supplementary Fig. This thermodynamic preference, combined with the close proximity of two active sites, indicates that *CH and *CH2 species likely undergo surface diffusion or desorption-reabsorption migration, facilitating C-C coupling on Mn3O4. Similar bifunctional catalysis mechanisms have been reported in thermal catalysis systems, where intermediate spillover between distinct active sites enhances reaction efficiency37,38. The distribution and synergy between Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 sites further facilitate the sequential activation of C-H bonds and C-C coupling within the WMO/m-SiO2 nanoreactor. Herein, a tandem reaction mechanism is proposed for CH4 conversion to C2H2 and C2H4 (Fig. 3h): (I) CH4 dissociation and CH3 diffusion: Energetic electrons from the plasma induce CH4 dissociation into CHx fragments, which subsequently diffuse toward the interior of the silica sphere due to the concentration gradient across m-SiO2. (II) Dehydrogenation at Na2WO4 sites (support on the channel): *CH3 species undergo dehydrogenation at W sites, forming surface-adsorbed *CH and *CH2 species. (III) Surface species coupling on Mn sites: *CH and *CH2 species migrate from Na2WO4 to Mn3O4 sites, leading to C-C coupling for C2H2 and C2H4 production. Notably, the mesoporous channels of m-SiO2 restrict plasma penetration into the interior of m-SiO2, thereby mitigating excessive CH4 activation (e.g., methane cracking) and suppressing carbon deposition. This structural confinement, combined with the synergistic tandem catalysis of Na2WO4 and Mn3O4, significantly enhances the yield of C2 products. Moreover, the shielding effect of the nanoreactor reduces plasma-induced product decomposition and recombination, further enhancing selectivity. This work presents a promising nanoreactor catalyst design strategy that significantly improves the yield and selectivity of C2H2 and C2H4 through plasma-catalytic NOCM under mild conditions. The nanoreactor features a hollow nanosphere structure with Na2WO4 nanoparticles anchored on the interconnected channels and monodispersed Mn3O4 nanocrystals hosted within the internal cavity. By positioning the nanoreactors in the discharge area, methane conversion reached 34%, with a selectivity of 42.3% toward C2H2 and C2H4. This represents a nearly 4.5-fold increase in yield and a fourfold increase in selectivity for unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons compared to the plasma-only system. Importantly, no deactivation was observed during the 25-h catalyst stability test. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Na2WO4 promotes the dehydrogenation of diffused CH4 and CH3, leading to the formation of *CH and *CH2 intermediates. These species subsequently undergo C-C coupling on the Mn3O4 surface to form C2H2 and C2H4. The excellent catalytic performance, supported by in situ plasma-coupled FTIR characterization, is further corroborated by DFT calculations. These calculations demonstrate that a tandem catalytic effect is achieved through the isolated Na2WO4 and Mn3O4 active sites, which are responsible for the enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, the mesoporous nanoreactor design prevents the reduction of internal Mn3O4 by CH4 plasma through the Debye shielding effect. This reduces carbon deposition on the catalyst and protects the generated *CH and *CH2 intermediates from further decomposition due to the absence of plasma discharge within the mesopores. This catalyst design strategy offers significant potential for advancing plasma-catalysis. It enables highly selective and directional conversion, improving the energy efficiency of plasma-catalytic systems and paving the way for a high-value route to transform methane into unsaturated light olefins under mild conditions. Mesoporous SiO2 (m-SiO2) was synthesized using a double template method in an ethanol solution. First, ethanol and polyacrylic acid were added to a vial and stirred for 30 min. Then, diluted ammonia water was added to the above solution, followed by the introduction of polyether, and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min. After that, ethyl orthosilicate was added dropwise to the vial, resulting in a suspension after 4 h of stirring. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged and washed three times with ethanol. Finally, the precursors were evaporated overnight and calcination at 550 °C. α Na2WO4/m-SiO2, β Mn3O4/m-SiO2, and α Na2WO4-β Mn3O4/m-SiO2 (where α and β denote the respective weight percentages of each metal oxide) were synthesized using the incipient wetness method. The Mn loading on the m-SiO2 support varied from 2 to 10 wt% (2, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt%), while the Na2WO4 loading ranged from 0.5 to 5% (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 wt%). For the preparation of Na2WO4/m-SiO2 and Mn3O4/m-SiO2, aqueous solutions of manganese nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·4H2O) or sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O) were mixed with m-SiO2 in a water bath. The mixture was stirred until it reached a paste-like consistency and then dried overnight at 70 °C. Subsequently, the dried samples were calcined in air at 550 °C. A two-step impregnation method was used for the synthesis of β Na2WO4-α Mn3O4/m-SiO2 (denoted as WMO/m-SiO2). First, Mn3O4/m-SiO2 was prepared as described above. Then, Na2WO4 was loaded onto the Mn3O4/m-SiO2 using the same drying and calcination procedures. This method was also used to prepare 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/SiO2 and 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/ZSM-5. Before testing, all catalysts were crushed and sieved to obtain particles with sizes between 30 and 60 mesh. Three types of catalysts with varying Mn3O4 locations were prepared: In-m-SiO2, where Mn3O4 was deposited exclusively within the mesopores of m-SiO2; Both-m-SiO2, where Mn3O4 was partially distributed within the mesopores and on the exterior surface of m-SiO2; Out-m-SiO2, where Mn3O4 was primarily located on the exterior surface of m-SiO2. In-m-SiO2 was synthesized as described above. Both-m-SiO2 was prepared using a rapid heating and drying method, where Na2WO4 was first loaded onto m-SiO2, followed by the deposition of Mn3O4. The precursors were rapidly heated from room temperature to 300 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 for 2 h and then calcined at 550 °C. Out-m-SiO2 was synthesized by mechanically mixing pre-synthesized Mn-O and Na-W-O precursors. Specifically, solutions of Mn or W were dissolved in deionized water and stirred at 50 °C for 3 h. After drying overnight, the precursors were mechanically mixed with m-SiO2 and calcined at 550 °C. The performance of the catalyst in the thermal catalytic NOCM reaction (denoted as catalyst only) was evaluated in a DBD reactor (plasma off) equipped with heating tape and operated at atmospheric pressure. The reactor was loaded with 1% Na2WO4-5% Mn3O4/m-SiO2 and secured with quartz wool on both ends. Prior to testing, the catalyst was pretreated with argon (200 mL min−1) at 100 °C for 20 min to remove impurities. The temperature was then increased to 250 °C and monitored using a K-type thermocouple placed within the catalyst bed. A diluted methane feed (5 vol% CH4 in Ar) at a total flow rate of 200 mL min−1 was used to minimize mass transfer limitations and accurately evaluate the intrinsic catalytic activity. The feed gas was preheated to 30 °C, and the experiments were conducted for 60 min. For plasma-catalysis and plasma-only conditions, the DBD reactor was operated without external heating. The experimental procedure involved the following steps: (1) The catalyst was pretreated with argon (100 mL min−1) at 100 °C for 20 min, followed by cooling to room temperature. (2) A 5 vol% CH4/Ar mixture (200 mL min−1) flowed through the DBD reactor for 10 min before switching on the plasma. (3) The plasma was ignited at an SEI of 5.1 kJ L−1 (calculated as the discharge power divided by the gas flow rate) and maintained at a discharge power of 17 W with a flow rate of 200 mL min−1 for 60 min. (4) After switching off the plasma, the DBD reactor was purged with argon (100 mL min−1) for 10 min. (5) The spent catalyst was removed, and a 10 vol% O2/Ar mixture (100 mL min−1) was introduced to oxidize solid carbon deposited in the DBD reactor. This step was carried out at an SEI of 6.14 kJ L−1 until no CO or CO2 was detected in the exhaust gas. (6) The spent catalyst was reintroduced into the cleaned reactor, and a 10 vol% O2/Ar mixture (100 mL min−1) was used to oxidize carbon deposited on the catalyst. This step was continued, and no CO or CO2 were detected in the exhaust gas. The amount of carbon deposited was calculated using the equation NC = V × (CCO2 + CCO) × 22.4, where V is the total volume of exhaust gas during the oxidation process, and CCO2 and CCO are the concentrations of CO2 and CO in the exhaust gas, respectively. To avoid interfering with the plasma field, the reactor temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer. To investigate the relative contributions of CH2 and CH3 radicals to CH4 decomposition, isotopic labeling experiments were conducted. The catalyst was first pretreated in a 5 vol% CH4/Ar mixture (discharge power 17 W, flow rate 200 mL min−1) for 60 min and then cooled to room temperature. Next, argon (200 mL min−1) was flowed through the reactor for 10 min to purge residual gases. A gas mixture of 2.5 vol% CD4 and 2.5 vol% CH4 in argon (200 mL min−1) was subsequently introduced into the DBD reactor for 10 min. The plasma was then switched on and sustained for 60 min, during which mass spectrometric signals at m/z = 15, 18, and 19 were monitored. The concentrations of CH4 and CD4 in the mixture were determined using mass spectrometry. From these measurements, the conversion of CH4 and CD4, as well as the selectivity of the product, was determined. Under plasma discharge conditions, CH4 and CD4 dissociate into radicals including CH3, CH2, CH, CD3, CD2, CD, H, and D. These radicals recombine to form isotopically labeled methane species, such as CD3H (m/z = 19), and CD2H2 (m/z = 18). The formation of CD3H and CD2H2 results from the recombination reactions of CD3 with H and CD2 with two H atoms, respectively. The signals at m/z = 15 and m/z = 19 reflect the concentrations of CH4 and CD3H, respectively. When analyzing the peak intensity of CD2H2, it is critical to consider the contribution of CD4 fragmentation (m/z = 20), which generates CD3 (m/z = 18). Specifically, the signal at m/z = 18 reflects contributions from both CD2H2 and the CD3 fragment derived from CD4 fragmentation. To elucidate plasma-induced surface reactions during the plasma-catalytic NOCM process, we employed in situ plasma-coupled FTIR spectroscopy using a custom-designed plasma gas cell19. The experimental procedure is described in detail as follows: (I) Prior to analysis, each sample was pretreated with argon plasma (99.999% purity) at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 in a DBD reactor at 100 °C for 20 min to remove residual surface species. (II) A 5% CH4/Ar mixture (40 mL min−1) was introduced to purge the cell for 30 min. During this step, the temperature was decreased from 100 to 35 °C, after which the IR background spectrum was collected. (III) The plasma was switched on, and the plasma-catalytic NOCM was conducted for 15 min. (IV) After switching off the gas flow, IR spectra were collected every 3 min for a total duration of 18 min. Quasi-in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) analysis was conducted using an FTIR spectrometer (IS50, Thermo Fisher Co. Ltd.) equipped with a liquid nitrogen N2-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector. The background spectrum was obtained by pretreating the catalyst with Ar plasma in a DBD reactor under conditions identical to those used in the plasma-catalytic NOCM experiments (SEI = 5.1 kJ L−1, flow rate = 200 mL min−1). Following pretreatment, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature before conducting the quasi-in situ DRIFTS measurements. To avoid air exposure, the pretreated catalysts were transferred from the DBD reactor to the DRIFT cell within a glovebox. Subsequently, the spent catalysts were then transferred from the DBD reactor to the DRIFT cell within a glovebox, and IR spectra were collected at room temperature. Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT)39,40 calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code41. The exchange-correlation interactions between electrons were described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)42,43. Following convergence tests, plane-wave pseudopotentials with kinetic cutoff energy of 420 eV44 for Mn3O4 and 500 eV45 for Na2WO4 method were employed within the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. To minimize interactions between the slab and its periodic images, a vacuum layer of ~15 Å was added above the slab. During geometry optimization, the bottom two atomic layers were fixed, while all other atoms and adsorbates were allowed to relax until the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. A convergence criterion of 1 × 10−5 eV/atom was used for structural optimization. Brillouin zone integration was performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid with a Methfessel-Paxton smearing width (σ) of 0.2 eV. Due to the presence of localized 3d states on Mn, the electronic structure of Mn was treated within the DFT + U formalism with a U-J parameter of 4.00 eV46. In addition, to account for weak interactions within the catalyst, van der Waals corrections were incorporated using the DFT-PBE-D3 method47.
