            Israel has agreed to allow some food into Gaza before a newly-approved mechanism for aid deliveries is up and running later this month, the head of the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation told CNN.
    


            Jake Wood, the foundation's executive director, said he did not yet know when or how many aid trucks Israel would allow into Gaza, but he called conditions there “clearly urgent” and said he expects “positive updates on that in the coming days.”
    


            The Israeli government, which has blocked aid to Gaza for nearly 11 weeks, has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the matter.
    


            The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will run a new, tightly controlled mechanism for Gaza aid deliveries that has been approved by Israel and the United States, which both countries say is designed to prevent Hamas from stealing aid.
    


            The United Nations' major aid organizations say, however, that there is no evidence of any significant diversion of aid in Gaza and are refusing to participate in the new aid mechanism, warning it risks displacing Palestinians and increasing the dangers they face.
    


            The UN's aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said Friday that time should not be wasted on an alternative Gaza aid plan, writing on X: “To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let's not waste time: We already have a plan.”
    


            In his first interview since launching the foundation, Wood addressed criticisms by the UN and other aid groups and urged them to reconsider.
    


            “This plan is not perfect, but this plan will be feeding people by the end of the month, in a scenario where no one has allowed aid in over the course of the last 10 weeks,” Wood said.

            “Ultimately, the community is going to face a choice. This is going to be the mechanism by which aid can be distributed in Gaza. Are you willing to participate? The answer is going to be, you know, pretty critical to whether or not this ramps up to sufficiently feed 2.2 million people in a very desperate situation.”
    


            Without the support of the major UN agencies, Wood said it is “hard to say” whether his foundation will be able to distribute enough aid to feed Gaza's population of 2.1 million. He said the foundation currently plans to provide 300 million meals in its first 90 days, which he acknowledged is “not sufficient.”
    


            Wood said he believes much of the humanitarian community's opposition to the new mechanism is based on misinformation, including what he says are false claims about the Israeli military providing direct security for aid distribution sites and biometric data being shared with the Israeli government.
    


            “I cannot blame the humanitarian community for crying foul amid that misinformation. I would not have participated in a plan that did those same things. However, that is not the plan,” Wood said.
    


            He added that he “unequivocally … will not be a part of anything that forcibly dislocates or displaces the Palestinian population.”
    


            The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will initially launch four distribution sites: three in southern Gaza and one in central Gaza, Wood said – even though much of the strip's population is in the central and northern areas.
    


            The UN has previously warned that focusing on these locations could be seen as encouraging Israel's publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.
    


            According to Wood, Israel has also agreed to allow the foundation to establish two sites in northern Gaza, which he believes can be operational within the first 30 days of the foundation's operations.
    


            The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is only expected to be able to feed about 60% of Gaza's population in its first weeks. Wood said it is not clear how long it will take to be able to cover the needs of the entire population.
    


            Pressed on Israel's claims that Hamas is stealing humanitarian aid – which Hamas and aid organizations deny – Wood said “it doesn't really matter.”

            “Israel controls access to Gaza, and if, if it is their belief that there is a large percentage of aid that is being interdicted by Hamas and other non-state actors … then we have no choice but to create a mechanism which operates in that construct and in that framing,” Wood said.
    


            “I think, as with most situations, there's three sides to every story. There's one side, there's the other side, and then there's the truth somewhere in between. I'm not here to render judgment on either of those. I'm here to solve a problem and feed people.”
    


            The foundation's operations will be secured by a private American security contractor, UG Solutions, which also manned a vehicle checkpoint in Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year.
    


            Wood, a US Marine Corps veteran, said the contractors will be responsible for guarding aid trucks from the Gaza border to the distribution sites and will not be involved in distributing the aid to civilians.
    


            Wood said they would be operating “under strict rules of engagement,” which he declined to share for operational security, but said they would abide by international laws and norms.

            If you glance at the PGA Championship leaderboard, you will see a raft of familiar names. There is Scottie Scheffler tied for fifth place, Matt Fitzpatrick tied for second place; further down, there is Bryson DeChambeau tied for 17th, Tommy Fleetwood and Jon Rahm tied for 27th while Rory McIlroy is languishing in a tie for 62nd.
    


            But above them all sits a less familiar name, that of Jhonattan Vegas who is holding a two-shot lead at the halfway point of the PGA Championship.
    


            The 40-year-old Venezuelan, who is ranked No. 70 in the world, has enjoyed a dream start to the tournament, finishing 8-under par through the first 36 holes. In the process, Vegas has made history, becoming the first Venezuelan to hold a lead at a major.

PGA Championship: Rakes, snakes, an ace and Vegas reigns supreme in second round



            And it's been a long journey to the top – he was already playing golf by the time he was two years old. His father had grown up caddying near a golf course and passed his love for the sport onto his son.
    


            “As a kid, I would hit anything that I could find. Rocks, broomstick, everything,” Vegas told reporters after his opening round on Thursday. “I would grab anything that I could swing and I would do it. Feel like I was a good athlete as a young kid, so that's kind of how things started.
    


            “We grew up near a nine-hole golf course owned by the oil companies, and we had access to a course and plus the love of my dad for the game, put it together and we started playing.”
    


            After becoming one of the best junior players in Venezuela, the teenaged Vegas moved to the USA to further his fledgling career, learning English and eventually studying at the Universtiy of Texas.
    


            Early in his professional career he made more history, becoming the first Venezuelan to ever claim a PGA Tour event when he won the Bob Hope Classic in 2011. Becoming such a visible Venezuelan figure, and a national hero, meant that his success was inevitably drawn into the country's politics.
    


            Golf itself was bound up in Venezuela's politics too; former president Hugo Chavez closed several of the country's golf courses that belonged to state-oil company PDVSA and dismissed the sport as “bourgeois,” per Reuters.
    


            More recently, a series of injuries have threatened to derail Vegas' career. He barely played any golf at all during the 2022-23 season and underwent two surgeries to treat elbow and shoulder injuries.
    


            First, a piece of bone broke off and got stuck in his elbow joint, forcing him to have surgery. Doctors told him his elbow would never fully heal and then complications from that injury caused shoulder issues for which he underwent another surgery.
    


            Such injuries contributed to a long seven-year spell where Vegas failed to notch up any wins. But in July 2024, he returned to winning ways at the 3M Open, ensuring, most importantly for him, that his younger son, Louis, could experience his dad winning a trophy for the first time. 



            And now, Vegas is enjoying his best ever performance at a major. He followed up his first round of 64 with a second round of 70, marking the first time in 17 major championship starts he has put together two consecutive under-par rounds.

The US Department of Homeland Security is considering being part of a reality TV show in which migrants compete against each other for American citizenship, the agency's assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, has said.

In each episode, contestants would take part in American-themed challenges such as digging for gold in California and assembling a car at a plant in Detroit, according to the pitch, which has been seen by a number of outlets. It would reportedly conclude with a town hall meeting and a final vote to select the winner.

The idea for the series, which has the working title ‘The American', comes from Rob Worsoff, the producer behind reality shows such as ‘The Millionaire Matchmaker', ‘Duck Dynasty', and ‘The Biggest Loser'.

The Daily Mail, which was one of the first outlets to report on the development on Thursday, claimed that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has been pushing for the series to be made.

McLaughlin denied the report in a post on X on Friday, calling it “false” and “an affront to journalism.” Noem is not “even aware” of the reality TV show pitch, she insisted.

The DHS receives hundreds of TV show proposals every year and each of them “undergoes a thorough vetting process prior to denial or approval,” the assistant secretary said. The pitch for ‘The American' “has not received approval or denial by staff,” she added.

The pitch reportedly says: “contestants will represent a wide demographic of ages, ethnicities, and talents. We will join in the laughter, tears, frustration and joy – hearing their backstories – as we are reminded of how amazing it is to be American, through the eyes of 12 wonderful people, who want nothing more than to have what we have – and what we often take for granted: the freedom, opportunity and honor of what it means to be American.”

Worsoff, who immigrated to the US from Canada, told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that none of the losers in the show would be penalized or face deportation. “This is not ‘The Hunger Games' for immigrants,” he said.

In an interview with CNN, Worsoff noted that he first pitched the idea for the series to the DHS during the administration of US President Barack Obama. He added that he recently held three meetings with DHS officials regarding the show. “I feel like we are trending in a good way,” he said.

The top Russian and US diplomats have shared their assessments of the Istanbul talks in a phone call, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. Sergey Lavrov and Marco Rubio welcomed the negotiations and underscored the readiness of the sides to work together toward peace in the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, according to the ministry.

The conversation took place on Saturday at the initiative of the US, according to the statement. Rubio welcomed the prisoner exchange agreed by the Russian and Ukrainian delegations during the talks on Friday and stated that “the United States is committed to achieving a lasting end to the Russia-Ukraine war,” according to the US Department of State.

Lavrov praised the “positive role” America played in bringing Kiev to the negotiating table and agreeing to resume the Istanbul peace process. He also expressed Moscow's readiness to work with Washington on this.

In addition, Lavrov and Rubio discussed other international and regional issues, as well as Russia-US bilateral contacts, the ministry said, without providing further details.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky initially ruled out any talks with Moscow unless Russia agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin has rejected Kiev's demands, arguing that Ukraine would use the pause to regroup and rearm its military.

However, Zelensky agreed to talks after US President Donald Trump expressed his support for Putin's initiative and urged Kiev to agree to it “immediately.”

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Friday, following President Vladimir Putin's proposal to resume peace talks without any preconditions.

The peace process between the two nations was disrupted in spring 2022 after several rounds of talks in Belarus and Türkiye, when Kiev unilaterally walked away from the negotiations. David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation at the time, later stated that the decision was made after a visit to Kiev by then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who he said told the Ukrainian government to not sign anything and “just fight.”

US President Donald Trump has said Washington will impose new sanctions on Russia if it fails to reach a peace settlement with Ukraine. His remarks came shortly after the two countries held their first direct negotiations since 2022.

In an interview aired on Friday, Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked Trump whether he would introduce new sanctions on Moscow. “Honestly, I will if we're not going to make a deal,” the president said. “Nobody uses leverage better than me.”

Trump added that the US would assess the outcome of Friday's Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul. “We'll see what happens. It will be crushing for Russia because they're having a hard time with the economy,” he claimed. He also argued that his plan to boost domestic oil production would lower global prices, undermining Russia's energy exports.

Trump claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “tired” from the conflict and said he would schedule a meeting with him sometime in the future. “I have a very good relationship with Putin. I think we'll make a deal. We have to get together.”

As Trump has been trying to broker a deal between Russia and Ukraine, a group of senators led by Lindsey Graham has drafted a bill to impose sanctions on Moscow and levy tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, gas, and uranium.

The head of Russia's negotiating team in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky, said the two sides had agreed upon a major prisoner swap involving 1,000 POWs from each side, as well as continuing contacts once each side has prepared a detailed ceasefire proposal.

NEW YORK, May 17. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has said that he is confident that it is possible to organize and hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin for settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.

""I think we'll make a deal. We have to get together, and I think we'll probably schedule it up,"" he told Fox News when asked a corresponding question.

Trump added that his meetings with Vladimir Zelensky were not easy. ""I had a real rough session with Zelensky because I didn't like what he said, and he was not making it easy. And I always said he doesn't have the cards, and he doesn't have the cards, and, you know, I'm being honest,"" he said in an interview with Fox News recorded during the American leader's visit to Abu Dhabi.

The US president also said that a peaceful settlement will be negotiated through his mediation. ""I think we'll do it fast,"" he noted.

Direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, their first since 2022, were held in Istanbul on May 16, lasting nearly two hours. Head of the Russian delegation Vladimir Medinsky, who serves as a Russian presidential aide, said after the talks that the Russian side is satisfied with their results and is ready to continue contacts. According to Russia's chief negotiator, the sides agreed to exchange 1,000 Russian POWs for 1,000 Ukrainian POWs. He also said that Ukraine had requested direct talks between the two countries' leaders and the Russian side had ""taken note of this request."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 15. /TASS/. Russia's stance at negotiations on the situation in Ukraine has been modified if compared to 2022 and adjustments are due to the situation on the ground, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told journalists on Thursday.

""Yes, there are adjustments in Russia's stance. These changes are due to developments on the ground,"" she said.

Zakharova noted that the Ukrainian territory diminishes every time the Kiev regime disrupts the negotiating process.

""If you want to grasp the connection between the negotiating process and territories, I should remind you of a statement made by the Russian Foreign Minister [Sergey Lavrov] on September 28, 2024,"" Zakharova said.

According to her, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated at that time that Ukraine would have preserved a part of Donbass if the agreements reached at the April 2022 negotiations in Istanbul were observed.

""However, Sergey Lavrov added that each time when any agreement backed by Russia is breached, Ukraine becomes smaller,"" Zakharova said. ""I think it would be wise to keep this quote in mind for everyone trying to find a connection between the negotiating process and the size of the [Ukrainian] territory.""

Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin in the early hours of May 11, Putin urged Kiev to resume direct talks suspended in 2022, without preconditions. The plan is to start dialogue in Istanbul on May 15. Putin also recalled that Russia had declared multiple ceasefires that Kiev consistently broke, including a recent truce during the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War.

Vladimir Zelensky, in turn, announced plans to travel to Istanbul on Thursday, following US President Donald Trump's call on Ukraine to immediately accept Putin's offer for talks. Prior to that, Zelensky had insisted that a 30-day ceasefire should precede any negotiations with Moscow.

The Russian delegation at the negotiations in Istanbul is led by Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky. The Russian team of negotiators also includes Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Robert Prevost's maternal grandparents came to US from Caribbean and at one point identified as Black

Evidence that the Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV's bloodlines reflect the US's legacy of immigration – and complicated relationship with race – has continued to emerge since he recently became the first American ever elected to lead the Roman Catholic church.

The family history service Ancestry recently announced that a team helmed by senior genealogist Kyle Betit had determined Leo's paternal grandfather, John R Prevost, immigrated to the US from north-eastern Sicily.

That revelation came as Leo used his first address to world diplomats on Friday to say that migrants' dignity must be respected. Some interpreted the remarks to mean Leo may be willing to clash with the Donald Trump White House's policies seeking to generally crack down on immigration to the US.

“My own story is that of a citizen, the descendant of immigrants, who in turn chose to emigrate,” Leo told ambassadors at the Vatican.

The information about Leo's Sicilian roots surfaced in part on a form in 1940 that Prevost – living in Chicago at the time – was required to fill out because he was a foreign national and had not become a naturalized US citizen.

The form, along with other relevant genealogical records, indicated that Prevost was born on 24 June 1876 in Milazzo, a province of Messina, Italy, and named Salvatore Giovanni Gaetano Riggitano. The document alluded to his arrival in New York on the steamship Perugia in May 1903, one of roughly 4 million Italians – the bulk of them Sicilians like Riggitano – who immigrated to the US between 1880 and 1915 in hopes of fleeing poverty, political upheaval as well as other hardships, Ancestry's research showed.

Riggitano eventually adopted John as his first name, anglicizing the one given to him at birth, and took the surname of his wife, Suzanne Prevost, as his own. He taught Italian, French and Spanish. Eventually, he lived in Chicago with his wife and family, according to his résumé, newspaper articles and advertisements, birth records and census information, all of which were consulted by the Utah-based Ancestry.

Betit said that one of the Prevosts' sons, Louis Marius, eventually married Mildred Agnes Martinez.

Mildred's father, Joseph, was evidently born on the island containing the Dominican Republic and Haiti. And for a time, Joseph lived with Mildred's mother, Louise, in New Orleans's Seventh Ward, a bastion in the city for people who were Creole, a term utilized there to describe those of mixed race, according to other genealogists.

The Martinezes – the future pontiff's maternal grandparents – at one point identified as Black. But by 1920, when racial oppression was rampant as well as often violent throughout the US south (and not yet deemed unconstitutional by the country's federal supreme court), the Martinezes had moved north to Chicago. And, as other similarly situated families in the US did, they switched their racial identity to white.

Louis and Mildred Prevost raised three sons within the Catholic faith in Chicago, the youngest of whom was Robert. Robert Prevost was ordained a priest in 1982; became the worldwide leader of the Catholic religious order colloquially known as the Augustinians; led a Peruvian diocese; was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2023; and headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops around the world.

On 8 May, after a two-day conclave in Rome, about 460 miles from his paternal grandfather's Italian homeland, Leo was elected to succeed the late Francis as head of the worldwide Catholic church and its 1.4 billion members.

“We often see parallels between the past and the present,” Betit said in a statement. “In the case of the new pope, his grandfather journeyed from Italy to America, and [his] journey brought him back to Italy as pope.”

His predecessor frequently clashed on the topic of immigration with Trump, who won a second US presidency in November in large part by promising to carry out mass deportations.

The first few months of Trump's second presidential term have indeed been marked by steady news of immigration-related detentions and removals in the US. In fact, on Friday, his administration drew a supreme court ruling rejecting its efforts to resume deporting Venezuelans under an 18th-century wartime law.

As a cardinal, Robert Prevost, for his part, had gone on social media before becoming pope and reposted an opinion column criticizing an assertion by JD Vance, Trump's vice-president, that taking care of one's own people before turning to others was consistent with the teachings of Catholicism.

And, during his speech on Friday at the Vatican to ambassadors, he said: “All of us, in the course of our lives, can find ourselves healthy or sick, employed or unemployed, living in our native land or in a foreign country, yet our dignity always remains unchanged. It is the dignity of a creature willed and loved by God.”

Vance was scheduled to lead a delegation of US officials at Leo's inaugural mass on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israel says intensified bombings are part of campaign expansion to ‘achieve all of the war goals in Gaza'

At least 140 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the last 24 hours, a deadly escalation as Israel seemed poised to launch a major offensive in the besieged territory.

Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 300 people since Thursday, Palestinian health officials said, one of the deadliest periods in the war since ceasefire talks broke down in March. The intensified bombing campaigns came as Israel's total blockade on humanitarian aid has prompted fears of a famine in the Palestinian territory.

“Since midnight, we have received 58 martyrs, while a large number of victims remain under the rubble. The situation inside the hospital is catastrophic,” said Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza early on Saturday. The death toll in the last 24 hours was at least 146, according to Reuters.

The escalation in attacks was condemned by the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday, who said the bombing campaign was meant to displace Palestinians and that it was equivalent to ethnic cleansing.

“This latest barrage of bombs … and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,” he said.

Turk's comments were also echoed by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who called for a permanent ceasefire while speaking at an Arab League summit in Baghdad on Saturday.

Israel said the bombardments were the initial phases of Operation Gideon's Chariots, an expansion of the campaign in Gaza meant to “achieve all of the war goals in Gaza”. The strikes were accompanied by a large troop buildup along Gaza's borders, aimed at establishing “operational control” of parts of Gaza.

The campaign, as well as the aid blockade on the territory, was meant to force Hamas to release hostages, Israeli officials said. The terrorist organisation took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people. Fifty-seven hostages are still held by Hamas.

The attacks came as Donald Trump departed the Middle East after a four-day visit to Arab Gulf countries, during which Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar made pledges to invest billions in the US.

Hopes that Trump's visit might bring renewed progress on truce talks in Gaza were dashed after Trump reiterated his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”. This was seen as a likely nod to his plan of the US assuming control over the Palestinian territory and turning it into the “riviera of the Middle East”.

A January ceasefire broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to ending the war. Prospects of a lasting truce seemed further away as Israel's security cabinet approved plans in early May that could involve seizing the entire Gaza Strip.

Gaza ceasefire talks were also expected to dominate the Arab League summit, where Arab officials met on Saturday. The Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said that attending ministers would endorse a reconstruction plan for Gaza, a contrast to Trump's offer to take over the Palestinian territory. Ministers later pledged $40m in reconstruction funds for Gaza and Lebanon.

Later on Saturday Hamas confirmed a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks with Israel was under way in Qatar's Doha. A group official, Taher al-Nono, told Reuters both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”.

Israel's offensive in Gaza, launched in retaliation for the October 2023 attacks, has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Widespread hunger and malnutrition among children have also soared, after Israel cut off vital humanitarian aid to the territory on 2 March. There is little medical care in Gaza, due to scarce supplies and repeated Israeli strikes on hospitals and medical facilities.

The UN aid chief, Tom Fletcher, urged a resumption of aid to Gaza in a speech to the UN security council on Tuesday, where he said famine loomed.
 Israel has consistently denied that its 10-week blockade is causing hunger in Gaza. However, Trump acknowledged on Thursday that “a lot of people are starving in Gaza”.

Israel, which claims Hamas hijacks aid to fund its military, has proposed a plan to distribute aid from hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and guarded by Israeli troops. The US has backed the plan, and a body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is set to begin carrying out the plan by the end of the month.

Aid groups described the plan as unworkable and potentially unlawful as it could lead to forced displacement. They urged Israel to lift its blockade and to rely on the UN and other existing humanitarian bodies, which have long experience in transporting aid into Gaza.

“We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors,” Fletcher said. “We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians, and not to Hamas.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Homeland security department reviewing ‘out-of-the-box' pitch in which immigrants would compete for citizenship

The US Department of Homeland Security is reportedly considering an “out-of-the-box” pitch to participate in a television gameshow that would have immigrants compete to obtain US citizenship.

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin described the pitch to the New York Times as a “celebration of being an American” and said the show would include challenges based on American traditions.

In a statement, McLaughlin said: “We need to revive patriotism and civic duty in this country, and we're happy to review out-of-the-box pitches. This pitch has not received approval or rejection by staff.”

News of the project surfaced as Donald Trump, himself a former reality TV star, carries out a sprawling immigration crackdown that has ensnared undocumented immigrants as well as lawful permanent residents, refugees and those with temporary status and pending court cases. In some cases, US citizen children have been deported alongside an undocumented parent.

Overseeing the deportation effort as homeland security secretary is Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota who has drawn sharp criticism for her “made-for-TV”-style approach to immigration enforcement. Shortly after she was sworn in, Noem appeared in tactical gear for a ride-along with immigration agents.

She also traveled to El Salvador, where, well-coiffed and wearing a $50,000 Rolex watch, she posed in a notorious prison housing hundreds of men deported by the Trump administration without due process.

The idea for the reality show was pitched by Rob Worsoff, the Canadian-born producer and writer who worked on Duck Dynasty, a reality TV show about a Louisiana hunting family popular with Trump supporters.

In an interview, Worsoff told the New York Times that the proposal originated from his own experience with the naturalization process to become a US citizen. Describing the project, he said one of the challenges might center on Nasa to see which participant could assemble and launch a rocket first.

The Wall Street Journal reviewed a 36-page slide deck laying out Worsoff's idea, which he said he pitched to the department during the Obama administration and again during the Biden administration.

According to the Journal, his proposal includes one-hour episodes and begins with immigrants sailing to Ellis Island, once a key point of entry for millions of people arriving in the US. Other challenges entail a gold-rush competition set in San Francisco and an auto-assembly-line contest in Detroit.

The show would conclude with the winner being sworn in as a US citizen.

“This isn't The Hunger Games for immigrants,” Worsoff told the Journal, stressing that losing contestants would not face deportation. “This is not: ‘Hey, if you lose, we are shipping you out on a boat out of the country.'”

The idea was first reported by the Daily Mail, though the department in its statement strongly refuted that Noem was aware of the pitch.

McLaughlin said the department receives hundreds of pitches a year for potential television shows, including for documentaries about immigration and border-security enforcement operations as well as white-collar investigations.

“Each proposal undergoes a thorough vetting process prior to denial or approval,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Los Angeles FC (LAFC) are to host Mexico's Club America on May 31 in their FIFA Club World Cup qualification playoff, FIFA said on Friday.

The winner would face Chelsea in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 16, Esperance from Tunisia in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 20, and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando, Florida, on June 25. 

The play-in game is needed to complete the 32-team lineup of the tournament that starts on June 14 because another Mexican side, Club Leon, was removed. Leon broke tournament integrity rules by being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca, also from Mexico.

FIFA announced the date and venue 10 days after Leon's appeal against expulsion was lost at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.

LAFC's 22,000-seat home, BMO Stadium — next to the LA Memorial Coliseum and shared with US National Women's Soccer League club Angel City — would stage the game at 7:30pm.

The Club World Cup entry for LAFC or Club America is worth an initial US$9.55 million from FIFA for a CONCACAF region team, plus a share of the US$1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament. It is being played in 11 US cities.

FIFA in March ruled to expel Leon, which qualified by winning the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League.

FIFA said LAFC would be in the playoff because it was the beaten finalist against Leon, while America was the next best-ranked team in its Club World Cup confederation ranking.

It was unclear why America, one of Mexico's best-supported teams, is eligible when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the four-year qualifying period through last year.

Mexico already has Pachuca and Monterrey in the tournament, which has been heavily promoted by FIFA president Gianni Infantino with US President Donald Trump.

Trump has said he would attend the July 13 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to present the gold trophy. It has spent much of the past few weeks in the Oval Office at the White House.

Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen is playing a single game of chess against 140,000 people worldwide in a mega-match that could overturn expectations by ending in a draw in the next few days.

Billed as “Magnus Carlsen vs The World,” the online match began April 4 on Chess.com, the world's largest chess Web site, and is the first-ever online freestyle game to feature a world champion.

While Chess.com had predicted Carlsen would win by a wide margin, his Team World opposition could force a draw if it checks Carlsen's king three times.

“Right now we're heading toward a draw by perpetual check,” Carlsen said in a statement on Friday. 

“I felt that I was a little bit better, early in the opening, then maybe I didn't play that precisely. Honestly, since then, they haven't given me a single chance. So now, I think, it's just heading toward the draw,” he said. 

“Overall, ‘the world' has played very, very sound chess from the start. Maybe not going for most enterprising options, but kind of keeping it more in vein with normal chess, which isn't always the best strategy, but it worked out well this time,” he added. 

As a freestyle match, the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king are randomly shuffled around the board while the pawns remain in their usual spots. It is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorization.

Team World votes on each move, and each side has 24 hours to make their play. Carlsen is playing the white pieces.

“For most of the world, it is their first chance to say they've played a chess game against Magnus Carlsen,” said Mike Klein, a senior journalist with Chess.com. 

“I think ‘the world' is going to be kind of tickled pink to be able to say, ‘I was part of a draw against Magnus Carlsen,” he said. 

Klein has played, and lost, to Carlsen twice in blitz matches in a hotel bar when the Norwegian was bored during some downtime in a world championship.

“He beat me twice without much effort, so I would have happily signed up for a draw in any of those games,” Klein said.

A grandmaster at 13, Carlsen has a celebrity status that few other chess players have.

The 34-year-old became the world's top-ranked player in 2011 and has won five World Chess Championships. 

He achieved the highest-ever chess rating of 2882 in 2014 and has remained the undisputed world No. 1 for more than a decade.

Last year, he garnered headlines for quitting a tournament in New York after refusing to change out of the jeans he wore to the competition. He later accepted a US$200 fine, and officials agreed to loosen the dress code.

Carlsen auctioned the jeans off for charity and donated the winning US$36,100 bid to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a national youth-mentoring charity that carries out its mission through local chapters across 5,000 communities nationwide.

This is the third “vs. The World” record-setting online game. 

In 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played against more than 50,000 people on the Microsoft Network.

A few top-ranked players helped steer the world's moves, but Kasparov won after four months and hailed it as “the greatest game in the history of chess.”

Klein was a summer camp chess teacher at the time.

“We would start class each day by checking out Kasparov's next move and talking about it and spending a few minutes each morning deciding what we'd reply,” Klein said.

Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand won his “vs. The World” match last year against nearly 70,000 players on Chess.com.

The goal of the Carlsen match was to break Anand's 70,000-player mark, and ended up doubling it.

Taiwan is indispensable to regional and global security, and is a reliable partner that would not be shaken by threats or coercion, former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said in a lecture to students and faculty at the University of Cambridge on Friday.

After visiting Denmark to speak at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Tuesday last week, Tsai arrived in the UK on Thursday to meet with members of the British parliament and gave a lecture titled “Defending Democracy in the New World Order” at University of Cambridge's Centre for Geopolitics on Friday.

Past assumptions about alliances and the role of major powers are being questioned, while authoritarian threats loom larger than ever, so democracies must be even more committed to tackling the challenges of a shifting world order, which would require wisdom from leaders and collaboration from the whole of society, Tsai said.

Authoritarian regimes remain in power due to their undemocratic nature, and with democratic backsliding, they are becoming stronger and more confident, she said, adding that they are colluding in pursuit of their self-interest and expansionist agendas, and influencing politics in democracies.

It is time to adapt, as the rules for engagement have changed, Tsai said.

Democracies' collective strategy must also evolve, she said.

“Authoritarian aggression should not be encouraged, and compromises with authoritarians would only embolden more aggressive behaviors and demands,” Tsai said.

Democracies cannot secure peace through compromising with authoritarians, as it just makes them more daring, she said, citing lessons learned from World War II.

“A strong and united democratic front is required to deter authoritarians that are threatening our security and democratic way of life,” Tsai said.

Democracies must now navigate a new world order, as the decades-old trade and economic relationships, and security alliances are in critical need of rebalancing and redistribution of responsibilities, she said.

US President Donald Trump and his administration have been calling for their democratic allies to take greater responsibilities and invest more in regional security — a reminder for democracies to work even harder together to safeguard their collective security, Tsai said.

Democracies are undergoing a readjustment process to increase individual and collective capabilities, and redistribute responsibilities among partners, she said.

“While authoritarian regimes are working with each other to further their expansionists' agendas, democracies need to be even more united,” Tsai said.

“Defending democracy has a price, and it would not be a free ride for anyone,” she said. “In this case, Taiwan stands ready to be a partner and contribute to making us more resilient amidst these challenges.”

Taiwan knows resilience well, as it has experienced authoritarian rule in the past and now faces intensified threats and intimidation from across the Taiwan Strait from people who seek to exploit the imperfection of democracy, Tsai said.

China thinks that by using military intrusions and cyberattacks, Taiwanese would be debilitated by fear, but Taiwanese have built resilience instead, she said.

The nation has over the past eight years built resilience on multiple fronts, including continued efforts to improve defense capabilities, Tsai said, adding that Taiwan has also fortified its digital infrastructure to withstand cyberattacks, and coordinated with civil society and international corporations to counter disinformation and cognitive warfare.

“Taiwan is indispensable to regional and global security, not only because Taiwan is a major contributor to global supply chains and technology products, but [because] of [its] strategic importance,” she said.

“Without Taiwan, the region will be less secure and less defendable. Democracies like the US, Japan and South Korea will perhaps invest even more in the region to counter China,” she added.

As the world order undergoes transformation, Taiwan would remain a steadfast partner to the international community, and its reliability is not measured by slogans, but by its actions even in the presence of extraordinary pressure, Tsai said.

“Democracy, resilience and partnerships are the foundation of our collective future,” she said. “Threats and coercion will never shake Taiwan's determination to engage and contribute to the world.”



                                                                                Former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Monday called for greater cooperation between Taiwan, Lithuania and the EU to counter threats to information security, including attacks on undersea cables and other critical infrastructure.
In a speech at Vilnius University in the Lithuanian capital, Tsai highlighted recent incidents in which vital undersea cables — essential for cross-border data transmission — were severed in the Taiwan Strait and the Baltic Sea over the past year.
Taiwanese authorities suspect Chinese sabotage in the incidents near Taiwan's waters, while EU leaders have said Russia is the likely culprit behind similar breaches in the Baltic.

The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office said that Liu Tsai-hsuan was entrusted with the care of a one-year-old boy, nicknamed Kai Kai (剴剴), in August 2023 by the Child Welfare League Foundation.

Speaking at a reception organized by the Lithuania-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group welcoming her on her first visit to the Baltic state, Tsai said that while she was president from 2016 to last year, many Lithuanian “friends” visited Taiwan.
“And I told myself I have to be here. I am very happy that I am here, a wonderful country and wonderful people,” Tsai said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he still believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to strike a deal to end the war in Ukraine, but warned that if negotiations fail, his administration will move forward with sanctions against Moscow. 

""Honestly, I will (impose sanctions), if we're not gonna make a deal,"" Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier in an interview published on May 16. ""This is turkey time, we're talking turkey, and we'll see what happens. This would be crushing for Russia because they're having a hard time now with the economy, oil prices are low."" 

Trump's comments come as peace talks in Istanbul on May 16 ended with no breakthrough, and Russia once again issued sweeping demands, including Ukraine's adoption of neutral status, dropping claims for war reparations from Moscow and the recognition of its loss of Crimea and four occupied regions none of which Russia fully controls. 

European leaders, who have been working in coordination with Washington to pressure the Kremlin, voiced frustration with Russia's posture and confusion over Trump's shifting signals in recent weeks. While the U.S. and Europe had appeared united in pushing for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, Trump has since emphasized the need for direct engagement with Putin and has been non-committal on new sanctions.

""I always felt there can't be a meeting without me because I don't think a deal's going to get through... There's a lot of hatred on both sides,"" Trump said, reiterating that he intends to meet Putin soon. ""I have a very good relationship with Putin. I think we'll make a deal. We have to get together, and I think we'll probably schedule it.""

He also claimed that Putin is ready to negotiate. ""Putin is at the table,"" Trump said, although he was not physically present during the talks. ""He wanted this meeting... I think Putin is tired of this whole thing. And he's not looking good, and he wants to look good.""

Asked whether Putin was the main obstacle to peace, Trump instead pointed to President Volodymyr Zelensky. “Look, I had a really rough session with Zelensky. He didn't make it easy and I always said that he doesn't have the cards (to win)... you are dealing with the massive army,” he said. 

Ukraine continues to insist on a ceasefire, supported by the U.S. and Europe, saying that a halt to active warfare must come before any real peace talks are possible. Russia has so far rejected a truce four times — on March 11, March 25, May 11 and the most recent one on May 16 in Istanbul.

Ukrainian security service drones struck an ammunition depot used by Russia's 126th Coastal Defense Brigade near the village of Perevalne in occupied Crimea, causing a large explosion and fire, a security source told the Kyiv Independent on May 17.

The depot, located near a key highway between Simferopol and Alushta, reportedly housed military equipment, ammunition, and fuel storage facilities. Local residents reportedly described thick smoke over the military compound.

""The Security Service of Ukraine continues to effectively strike legitimate military targets in Russian-occupied Crimea. Efforts to degrade (Russia's) military capabilities will continue,"" the source said.

The strike reportedly caused significant damage and prompted Russian forces to block traffic along the Simferopol–Alushta highway, which passes close to the affected area. There are also reports of Russian military personnel killed in the blast, the source said.

Russia has not officially commented on the incident. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

Ukraine has ramped up long-range drone strikes and sabotage operations in occupied Crimea in recent months, targeting Russian military infrastructure and logistics hubs. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on April 7 that Ukraine is increasing production across ""the full range of drones: from Mavics to long-range drones,"" as well as ground-based robotic systems.

Ukraine and Russia have increasingly relied on drone warfare throughout the war, deploying aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for reconnaissance and strike operations. Zelensky also noted progress in Ukraine's capacity for ""deep strikes"" — long-range drone attacks targeting Russian military infrastructure far behind the front lines. 


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information
          should be available to all.
        


          Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can

The World Pride 2025 welcome concert, with pop icon Shakira performing at Nationals Stadium, isn't until May 31. But for host city Washington D.C., the festivities start with a string of localized Pride events beginning with Trans Pride on Saturday.

Hundreds of LGBTQ+ rallies, seminars, parties, after-parties and after-after-parties are planned for the next three weeks across the nation's capital, including Black Pride and Latin Pride. It all culminates in a two-day closing festival on June 7 and 8 with a parade, rally and concerts on Pennsylvania Avenue by Cynthia Erivo and Doechii.

The biannual international event typically draws more than a million visitors from around the world and across the LGBTQ+ spectrum. But this year's events will carry both a special resonance and a particular sense of community-wide anxiety due to the policies of President Donald Trump's administration.

Trump's public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Egale Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against travelling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals will face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration's strict binary view of gender status.

“I think it's a fair assumption that the international numbers won't be as high due to the climate and the uncertainties,” said Ryan Bos, executive director of the Capital Pride Alliance. “At the same time we know that there's an urgency and importance to showing up and making sure we remain visible and seen and protect our freedoms.“

Opposition to transgender rights was a key point for Trump's presidential campaign last year and he's been following through since returning to the White House in January, with orders to recognize people as being only male or female, keep transgender girls and women out of sports competitions for females, oust transgender military troops, restrict federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19 and threaten research funding for institutions that provide the care.

All the efforts are being challenged in court; judges have put some policies on hold but are currently letting the push to remove transgender service members move forward. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found support for some of his efforts.

In February, Trump launched a takeover at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, publicly promising to purge drag shows from the institution's stages. Within days of that takeover, the Kennedy Center abruptly pulled out of plans to host the International Pride Orchestra as part of a week-long series of World Pride crossover events entitled Tapestry of Pride. In the wake of that cancellation, the Capital Pride Alliance cancelled the entire week and moved some of the Tapestry events to alternate venues.

Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year's events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump's policies. But others have called for a mobilization to flood the capital, arguing that establishing a presence in potentially hostile spaces is the precise and proud history of the community.

“We've been here before. There is nothing new under the sun,” said D.C. Council Member Zachary Parker, who is gay. “While this is uncharted territory a fight for humanity is not new to those in the LGBTQ+ community.”

A recent editorial in the The Blade by Argentinian activist Mariano Ruiz argued for “the symbolic weight of showing up anyway,” despite the legitimate concerns.

“If we set the precedent that global LGBTQI+ events cannot happen under right-wing or anti-LGBTQI+ governments, we will effectively disqualify a growing list of countries from hosting,” Ruiz wrote. “To those who say attending World Pride in D.C. normalizes Trump's policies, I say: What greater statement than queer, trans, intersex, and nonbinary people from around the world gathering defiantly in his capital? What more powerful declaration than standing visible where he would rather we vanish?”

The last World Pride, in 2023, drew more than 1 million visitors to Sydney, Australia, according to estimates. It's too early to tell whether the numbers this year will match those, but organizers admit they are expecting international attendance to be impacted.

Destination D.C., which tracks hotel booking numbers, estimated that bookings for this year during World Pride are about 10 per cent behind the same period in 2024, but the organization notes in a statement that the numbers may be skewed by a “major citywide convention” last year that coincided with what would be the final week of World Pride this year.

Still, as the date approaches, organizers and advocates are predicting a memorable party. If international participation is measurably down this year, as many are predicting, the hope is that domestic participants will make a point of attending.

“The revolution is now,” said Parker, the D.C. council member. “There is no greater demonstration of resistance than being present and being you, and that is what World Pride is going to represent for millions of folks.”

Moira Dann is a former Globe and Mail editor turned author, currently living in Victoria. Her most recent book is Fat Camp Summer: Advice I Would Have Given My Parents.

One early spring evening in 1971, when I was 13, my mother called me to our dining room table in suburban Montreal, slid a colourful, glossy brochure out of a white envelope, and pushed it to me across the table.

It was a brochure for Camp Stanley, “a non-medical slim-down camp for girls” in the Catskill Mountains of New York. The brochure featured photographs of idyllic summer-camp scenarios (smiling girls swimming, playing tennis, softball, and golf; eating meals together at long tables; expressionless girls in an outdoor exercise class). Additional photos offered Camp Stanley program specifics: weigh-ins on a doctor's-office scale, as well as before-and-after photos of campers' successful weight loss. 

My mother pitched Camp Stanley to me (“Daddy and I thought you'd like it, and it would help you”) and ended by saying she'd arranged a phone call between me and camp founder, Gussie Mason. I said that wouldn't be necessary because “I'm not going to any fat camp!” And I stomped out of the house in tears.

This kind of insolent defiance was unheard of in my adolescent world. My mother called after me, but I ignored her, my heart pounding with anger. I walked around for as long as I could, but it got dark, cooled off, and my options were limited. When I finally went home, my argument with my mother escalated into a near fist fight, as I grabbed her wrists to stop her whacking with a rolled-up newspaper, as if I were a dog. When I dashed into my room and locked the door, I could still hear her yelling. 

Soon after, my father arrived home, mediated a truce, and got my mother and I to agree to apologize to each other. “But not tonight,” he said. He fed me first, making me tea and cinnamon toast.

Exhausted, and seeing no way out as I had no agency, I capitulated: “Okay Dad, I'll go.” I remember telling my friends I was off to camp that summer, but didn't say what kind. 

To my surprise, I made a new group of friends at Camp Stanley, all of us dealing with varying levels of largely unarticulated self-loathing, loneliness, fear, hunger, fatigue, alienation and rage. 

Ms. Mason wrote a book: Help Your Child Lose Weight and Keep It Off. Right off the top, she said: “Let's talk plainly. Your child is fat, and you would like to help your child lose weight. Well, I can help you.” This message (note the F-word front-and-centre) was at the core of Camp Stanley. Campers used the F-word comfortably among ourselves as a descriptor (“these are my fat pants”) but not (as we often heard the word from others) as a pejorative and never as a slur. 

Things have changed, and that's good. Recently released Canadian Medical Association Journal guidelines for managing pediatric obesity recommend “using appropriate language” when talking to children and families about obesity. “Health care providers should … avoid using negative, stigmatizing language.” Like the F-word.

I was sent to Camp Stanley the summer I turned 14. I was overweight, but I didn't consider myself fat; it was nothing I didn't think I could get under control myself with a summer of swimming, dancing, playing solo tennis against a backboard, and enjoying bratwursts with mustard (using a hot dog bun as a holder only). 

I was blindsided by being sent to Camp Stanley. I learned later the nuances of this decision, but not before damage was done. It would have been great if my parents had talked to me and had included me in any discussion of family circumstances that led to the Camp Stanley solution. I could well be wrong, but I like to think I might have bought in if it hadn't been sprung on me. 

The CMAJ guidelines recommend “caring for children with obesity and families in a respectful, participatory manner.” They suggest the “5 As”: ask, assess, advise, agree, assist. Ask about health and growth, not about weight. Assess comfort level, mental health, lived experience, and consider potential difficulties and barriers to healthy weight maintenance. Advise the family on how to improve health outcomes that aren't necessarily weight loss, have the family agree on a plan of action, and then assist however possible.

Much better than my experience, about which I still have nightmares. 

After a long drive, I was dropped off into a regimented environment with my duffel bag, a new tennis racket, and two golf clubs. There were calorie limitations (1,200 to 1,500 per day) and scheduled activity most of the day: three one-hour blocks for a “major activity” (swimming, tennis, or “Slimnastics”) and three one-hour blocks for a “minor” activity, such as golf, fencing, track, badminton, baseball, archery and volleyball (among others). Meals, snacks and rest time were scheduled. I fell into bed at night, asleep before my head hit the pillow.

I often felt lonely, frightened and anxious at Camp Stanley, and would probably have been sleepless if I hadn't been so exhausted. I often felt hungry and used my stash of (permitted) sugarless gum to stave off hunger pangs. Worst of all, I felt abandoned, sent away from home to be fixed because I didn't look right. That was the feeling that choked me up, made me cry in bed at night. 

There was a weigh-in once a week on Sunday morning, sometimes followed by tears. Girls who didn't lose as much as desired were advised to consider increasing their activity or lowering their calorie count to 900 calories a day – or both. It was clear to all who had undertaken this: on their breakfast tray was a plate with two hard-boiled eggs and a packet with two pieces of Melba toast.

It would have been much more humane to have access to what the CMAJ now recommends: a “multidisciplinary team” to offer medical and psychological advice as well as counsel on diet, exercise and help keeping everything in perspective, for both the child and the family. This might not always be available or easy, but it's a worthy aspirational goal. 

I lost some weight at Camp Stanley: 12 pounds total. Incrementally, it didn't feel like much at those weigh-ins, even though my clothing size diminished. After I got home, determined not to be sent back to Camp Stanley, I made some bad choices – the Grapefruit Diet, liquid diets (remember Metrecal? SlimFast?) and extremely low-calorie diets. Mercifully, I never veered toward anorexia or bulimia and I mostly managed, in my adult life, to maintain a healthy weight, using diet and exercise, each to extremes sometimes. I went to WeightWatchers intermittently, until Oprah Winfrey joined the board and became a spokesperson. While I thought the structure and camaraderie worthwhile, I was suspicious of the ever-changing point system, the ever-expanding food product line, and I didn't think Oprah needed my money. 

Some obesity treatment options are available now that weren‘t around in the 1970s. Bariatric surgery and weight-loss drugs (such as Ozempic and Wegovy) should be considered, according to the CMAJ's new clinical practice guidelines. 

This worries me. My own lack of agency as an adolescent saw me sent to a fat camp against my will. That's nothing compared to having surgery before being old enough to say no or being put on drugs whose full long-term effects are still being revealed – drugs you might have to take for the rest of your life. 

I know adults who've had bariatric surgery with varying results and difficult side effects. Ozempic works quickly on weight, as I discovered since taking it for diabetes. People I hadn't seen for a while would struggle for a way to comment on the change in my appearance while silently wondering if I was ill, so I volunteered that my physical changes were “deliberate.” 

I wonder if the real reason I resist normalizing weight-loss drugs is because I want weight loss to be as difficult for everybody as it has traditionally been for me. And then I imagine myself in 1971: How would I have reacted if I'd been offered a prescription for weight loss rather than directed to a summer at Camp Stanley? I think I probably would have led the way, running to the pharmacy.

To me, the most notable elements of the new CMAJ guidelines are the recognition of how complex a disease obesity is, as well as the evident insightful compassion motivating the guideline formulation: compassion for the suffering child and adolescent, compassion for the affected family, and compassion for the health care providers faced with this long-term chronic disease. 

Children need to feel certain their parents are motivated by love and will always act in the best interests of the family and the children, overweight or not. This is the optimal circumstance to undertake a child's weight control journey, with the best counsel and support of appropriate health care providers.

I couldn't stay mad at my parents, although I stayed fearful throughout my teens of being “sent back.” I resist saying fat camp messed me up (because the stoic in me says there are people with real problems), but it did. It broke my childhood belief that I was worthy, and worthy of my parents' unconditional love. 

If you have an overweight child in your circle, love them like crazy and make sure they know you love them, no matter what. Don't try to fix them, unless they ask for help. 

If they do, take an approach that's non-judgmental and encourage discussion with the child, other family members, and health care professionals in considering obesity management options – all of them. Don't use words such as “fat” or “obese,” particularly if the child hates them.

And try not make any child feel as though they have to be “fixed” to be lovable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Opinion: Mark Carney tells Canadians how to play Mouse Trap properly","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/opinion/article-prime-minister-mark-carney-governing-style-mouse-trap/","Sat, 17 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Prime Minister Mark Carney gestures toward his cabinet, not seen, as he prepares to speak to reporters following a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, on May 13.Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press

Maybe you, like me, had a friend who owned the board game Mouse Trap when you were a kid, and perhaps you also coveted that thing all the way down to the deepest chamber of your heart. 

But in case you don't know this mesmerizing little wonder, it's a Rube Goldberg machine turned into a kids' game with janky little plastic pieces mounted on a cardboard base. If you land in the right spot, you get to kick off a chain reaction: boot kicks over bucket, ball rolls down ramp, lever rises, army guy launches through the air. 

And if – only if – all of those mechanisms work exactly right, at the end a little net will descend on your opponents' mouse figures, trapping them so you can win. 

I started thinking about that game as Mark Carney assembled his cabinet and the first real sense of what his government might be and do began to surface from the election haze. 

There are a few things the Prime Minister took pains to emphasize this week, like critic quotes on a movie poster that help you understand how you're supposed to think about the things you're seeing. 

One of those ideas is that he is not here to putter. Mr. Carney underlined that his cabinet was sworn in faster and Parliament is returning sooner than those things usually happen after an election, and that the Throne Speech in less than two weeks will lay out his government's mission.

“So we're going to go hard,” he said on Tuesday at Rideau Hall, standing before his freshly minted front bench – the real one built for purpose, not the trivia quiz curiosity he assembled out of found parts when he took over as Liberal Leader shortly before triggering the election campaign. 

Mussio: For Carney to succeed, he must convince Canada's elite that it's time for change

The second big understanding the Prime Minister wanted to land this week is that when the boss changes and focus sharpens, everything is different. CTV's Vassy Kapelos interviewed Mr. Carney, and when she questioned how much would really change given that he has many of the same prominent ministers Canadians have been hearing from for the past several years, his answer was, “Well, first off, now you're hearing from me. I'm a new prime minister.”

She kept pressing him on how his government would deliver something different when his top lieutenants were the people swearing up and down six months ago that Justin Trudeau was doing the Lord's work. The Prime Minister said she was fixating on the wrong thing. 

“If I may, you are going into process and personnel,” he said. “I'm going to results.” 

He underlined this same idea throughout the leadership race and election campaign, when he would say repeatedly that his government would focus on outcomes, rather than programs created or dollars spent. This clearly implied, but left elegantly unstated, the fact that the Trudeau government really loved touting that it had created this program or shovelled that amount of money out the door. What became of it all after the giant novelty cheque handover and the applause was of much less interest. 

That government, in other words, really enjoyed the ball rolling down the ramp and the little army guy flying through the air, and always wanted credit for that part of things. Mr. Carney is telling Canadians that the net falling on the mouse at the end is all that matters, and that is what he and his government are focused on. 

And as for precisely which end results people should judge him by, he laid that out this week too. A reporter asked the Prime Minister what success would look like on the cost of living, or what barometer people should use to judge his government's success. 

“Canadians will hold account by their experience at the grocery store, when they're paying their electricity bill, when they or their children are looking for a place to live,” he said, adding, “And then, of course, accountability comes at the ballot box.”

So Mr. Carney says that this government will do things better because it has different leadership – him – and is fixated on results, not seeking credit for effort along the way. He sets the bar for success on those results at Canadians feeling like they can afford their lives more comfortably – even as the economic damage and inflationary strain of U.S. tariffs is quietly accumulating in the national bloodstream at this very moment. 

The Prime Minister led his party to a wildly improbable election win by promising to handle the greatest existential threat Canada has faced in decades. And he said he would do that while simultaneously refashioning the Canadian economy to work better for its citizens and to absorb the damage dished out by the White House mad king. 

On Wednesday, when Mr. Carney's new cabinet gathered for the first time, it was one of those rare moments when the ritual and rigidity of politics couldn't slam a lid on the human stuff. Most of the new ministers and secretaries of state had first-day-of-school face: glowing, overwhelmed, frozen and vibrating all at once.

One of the journalists remarked to colleagues, in a bless-their-hearts voice, that this would be the very best day for the new cabinet members because it would only get harder.

Mr. Carney himself has not looked for one moment even slightly fazed to suddenly find himself Prime Minister. But even for the unflappable, the very beginning of things – when the game board is set up for you, when you can tell yourself that all the little mechanisms are going to function exactly as you expect, when the end result is still a possibility you can pluck out of the future air – is the easiest part.

New German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be traveling to Rome to meet with Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. Meanwhile, the business-focused FDP party has a new leader after a poor election result. DW has more.

Here are all the top news stories from Germany on May 17.

A Lufthansa flight from Germany to Spain last year went without a pilot for 10 minutes after its co-pilot lost consciousness while the captain was in the restroom, the German news agency DPA reported on Saturday, citing a report from Spain's accident investigation authority CIAIAC.

The Airbus A321, which was carrying 199 passengers and six crew members from Frankfurt to Seville, ended up making a safe but unplanned landing in Madrid after the incident so the sick co-pilot could be quickly brought to a hospital, according to the report.

During the health emergency, the plane's autopilot ensured the jet was able to fly safely despite the fact that the unconscious co-pilot seemed to have unintentionally operated the controls.

The captain first unsuccessfully tried entering a regular code alerting anyone in the cockpit to open the door before resorting to an emergency code that would have allowed him to open it himself.

But shortly before the door would have opened automatically, the co-pilot managed to let the captain in despite his state, the DPA reported.

A growing number of people in Germany is looking for alternatives to US goods and services amid widespread rejection of the policies of President Donald Trump, a survey released on Saturday has shown. 

The trend comes as the Trump administration seems to many in Germany and Europe to be turning its back both on the European continent and on democratic values once thought to be held in common with the US.

Among other things, the support given to Germany's far-right AfD party by leading US figures is seen widely as symptomatic of a concerning political shift.

 Altogether 34.3% of respondents said they were already using fewer US goods and services, with more than 17% saying they intended to reduce their consumption yet further, the Innofact poll said.

More than a third of respondents said they wanted to find or consider alternatives to US-made smartphones, while 30% of those surveyed were averse to using US computer hardware and wanted to limit or cease using social media services such as Instagram and X.

The messaging app WhatsApp, which, like Instagram, is owned by US tech giant Meta, appears however to have established itself as more vital to people's lives, with just under 17% saying they could imagine using an alternative.

Indeed, 36.3% of respondents said they thought US services such as WhatApp and Amazon were now so integral to society that they are indispensable.

The survey, conducted online on behalf of the Verivox comparison portal, was participated in by a total of 1,015 people aged 18 to 79 from April 30 to May 2, 2025.

Entrepreneur Nicole Büttner has been elected as the new secretary general of Germany's neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP).

She received 80% of the votes cast at a party conference in Berlin. This is her first political role on a national level, despite having been a member of the FDP for 20 years.

After the FDP failed to reenter the Bundestag in February's elections, gaining just 4.3% of the vote, the party has elected new leadership.

Büttner is managing director of the Berlin-based AI company Merantix Momentum and is also a member of the board of the German Startups Association.

The new party chairman, Christian Dürr, nominated Büttner for the position and she replaces former Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, who withdrew from politics in February.

Dürr is succeeding former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who left his role in the party leadership after the FDP's electoral defeat.

Austria's interior minister has said he supports Germany's tougher border control measures. 

""We expressly welcome these controls as we can see that the number of illegal migrants is falling significantly,"" Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said during a visit from German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt on Friday. 

Karner also said Austria would deepen its cooperation with Germany in the future to allow for deportations to Syria and Afghanistan.

Last week, Germany's new government ordered increased border checks with all neighboring countries, including Austria. 

Germany also authorized turning away asylum-seekers at its borders, except for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children.

Germany argues that since it is surrounded only by EU member states (plus Switzerland), which are safe countries, any potential asylum applicants should have to present their case before they reach Germany. 

This would respect EU legislation, known as the Dublin agreement, which says that asylum-seekers need to apply for protection in the first EU state they enter. 

Karner did not answer the question posed by two journalists as to what will actually happen to people sent back to Austria from Germany, according to Austria's state broadcaster ORF. Like Germany, Austria is also surrounded by EU member states as well as Switzerland.

Earlier this year, Austria said it wouldn't accept any migrants turned away from Germany and forced back across the border to Austria. 

In Berlin's Neukölln district, a 28-year-old man stabbed a police officer in the neck, causing life-threatening injuries.

According to a post on X by the police, the man had tampered with a police vehicle in front of a station. When an officer approached him late Friday evening, he allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed the officer. The police stated that the man had previously tried to file a report at the station.

The officer is currently undergoing emergency surgery at a clinic, and his life is in danger, according to the post. The homicide squad has taken over the investigation.

Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner bid farewell to his business-focused Free Democratic Party (FDP) by heavily criticizing Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government.

On Friday, Lindner stepped down as chairman of the pro-business party after leading it to a disastrous result in February's national election, leaving the FDP without a seat in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament.

At a party conference, Lindner said the ""majority of voters voted for less state and more freedom. What is now being delivered is more state and more debt.""

In March, Merz's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats, who were in talks to form a coalition, pushed through the outgoing Bundestag a debt reform to create a €500 billion ($558 billion) fund for infrastructure and to ease constitutionally enshrined borrowing rules to allow higher spending on defense.

""If the Merz government does not flank this new fiscal policy with reforms, then this decision on direction will first come back like a boomerang in economic terms and then at the ballot box in 2029,"" Lindner added.

In November, Lindner was fired as finance minister, leading the FDP to withdraw from former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition. This triggered the early election.

On Friday evening, Christian Dürr, the party's former parliamentary leader, was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman, receiving 82% of the vote.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will receive German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Rome on Saturday.

Merz is traveling to the Italian capital on the occasion of the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV on Sunday and will use the opportunity for a bilateral meeting with Meloni on the eve of the event in the Vatican.

Merz is a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party. Meloni is Italy's first female prime minister since World War II and holds strong conservative views on issues such as migration.

Merz's visit comes after a media report suggesting that the German government has downgraded the importance of diplomacy with Italy caused a stir in Rome.

On Thursday, the conservative German daily Die Welt reported that an early draft of the new German government's coalition agreement listed Italy as an important partner and member of an expanded European axis, alongside France and Poland.

However, in the final agreement, Rome is no longer mentioned in this context. According to the newspaper, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), Merz's coalition partner, reportedly insisted on the change.

Lars Klingbeil, a member of the SPD who serves as vice chancellor and finance minister, will be accompanying Merz on the trip to Italy.

Several high-ranking Italian politicians have expressed outrage at the news. 

However, a German Foreign Office spokesman denied the report, stating that Italy is welcome as a member of the Weimar Plus format. This is an extension of the Weimar Triangle diplomatic forum with representatives from Germany, France and Poland.

Guten Tag and welcome to our coverage of political developments in Germany on Saturday, May 17, 2025.

Since officially taking office, Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has largely focused on setting up his foreign policy agenda.

On Saturday, he will travel to Rome to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

The former FBI director had posted on Instagram a photo of seashells arranged to form the shapes ""86 47."" Trump supporters interpreted it as a call to ""assassinate"" the president.

Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed on Friday by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that supporters of President Donald Trump claimed was a veiled threat on the president's life.

The now-deleted post showed seashells arranged to form the shapes ""86 47."" Comey posted it with a comment: ""Cool shell formation on my beach walk.""

Trump supporters interpreted it as a call to harm the 47th president.

Merriam-Webster dictionary says 86 is slang meaning ""to throw out,"" ""to get rid of"" or ""to refuse service to."" The dictionary publisher also said one of the recent adoptions also means ""to kill,"" although it adds: ""We do not enter this sense, due to its relative recency and sparseness of use.""

Comey said he was unaware of any violent connotation, adding ""I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.""

Despite his explanation, Trump and top administration officials rejected Comey's defense.

""He knew exactly what that meant,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Friday. Labeling Comey a ""dirty cop,"" Trump said the former FBI director was calling for the ""assassination of the president.""

The president added that any legal action would be decided by Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Comey's interview on X, saying she would ""take all measures necessary to ensure the protection"" of the president.

Current FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency would ""provide all necessary support.""

Meanwhile, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said, ""We fully support the Secret Service investigation into Comey's threat on President Trump's life.""

The president and the former FBI director have a contentious relationship.

During his first term, Trump fired Comey in 2017, as the latter investigated the Trump 2016 presidential campaign's possible collusion with Russia.

Comey has also long been a vocal critic of the president. In a 2018 interview, he called Trump ""morally unfit"" to lead.

The Israel Defense Forces has said it is preparing to expand operations in Gaza. Meanwhile, the US is developing a plan to move 1 million Palestinians to Libya, according to a US media report. DW has more.

Here is a roundup of developments in Israel, Gaza and the wider Middle East region on Saturday, May 17:

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani has urged Israel to stop its military offensive in Gaza, saying Palestinian civilians must no longer pay the price of war.

""We have to tell the Israeli government: 'That's enough,'"" Tajani said in a statement. ""We no longer want to see the Palestinian population suffer. Stop the attacks, let's secure a ceasefire, free the hostages, but leave in peace a people who are victims of Hamas.""

His remarks came after Israel's military said it was mobilizing to expand operations in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health authorities meanwhile said at least 146 people had been killed in the past 24 hours in continuing Israeli airstrikes.

Tajani is due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on Saturday. The Italian government has been one of Israel's most vocal supporters within Europe, but calls for a ceasefire have been growing amid the devastation being wrought on Gaza.

A new round of indirect negotiations with Israel has begun in Doha ""without any preconditions,"" a senior Hamas official has said, adding that the talks were aimed at ending the war in Gaza.

""This round of negotiations began without any preconditions from either side, and the negotiations are open to discussing all issues,"" senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said.

""Hamas will present its viewpoint on all issues, especially ending the war, [Israel's] withdrawal and prisoner exchange.""

A two-month ceasefire in Gaza fell apart when Israel resumed its operations in the enclave on March 18, severely intensifying its blockade. Other attempts to stop the war, even temporarily, failed to materialize.

UN agencies have warned that Israel's total aid blockade on the territory has created critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines, with warnings of famine on the rise.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz argued that the intensified campaign was what brought Hamas back to the negotiating table.

""With the opening of Operation 'Gideon's Chariots' in Gaza, which is being led by the IDF command with great force, the Hamas delegation in Doha announced a return to negotiations on a hostage deal, in contrast to the recalcitrant position they had taken up until that moment,"" he claimed.

Previous negotiations to end the war had often failed, as Hamas remains adamant that any deal must involve a permanent end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

Negotiations for the release of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza have been ongoing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week that he had instructed a negotiating team to head to the Qatari capital.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Saturday called for pressure to stop Israel's ""massacre in Gaza"" as forces continue to expand their offensive.

Sanchez added that Madrid is planning a UN resolution requesting a world court ruling on aid access to the Palestinian territory.

He told an Arab League summit in Baghdad that the war triggered by Hamas' October 2023 attack on Israel has led to ""unacceptable numbers"" of victims in Gaza, violating the ""principle of humanity.""

""The extremely grave humanitarian crisis Gaza has endured since October 2023 has caused more than 50,000 dead, 100,000 wounded and 2 million displaced,"" Sanchez said.

World leaders should ""intensify our pressure on Israel to halt the massacre in Gaza, particularly through the channels afforded to us by international law.""

Spain will ""submit to the United Nations General Assembly a proposal to ask the International Court of Justice to rule on Israel's compliance with its international obligations on humanitarian aid access to Gaza"", which has been under a complete aid blockade since March 2, according to Sanchez.

He added his country would also back another draft UN resolution calling on Israel to ""end the humanitarian blockade"" and guarantee ""full and unrestricted access for humanitarian aid"" to enter Gaza.

Speaking in Baghdad on Saturday, he said promoting ""a political solution"" to the conflict was a priority. ""The only path toward peace in the region"" is ""the implementation of the two-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he said. ""I wish once again to urge other countries to recognize the State of Palestine.""

In the last 24 hours, 153 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip. 

That's according to a Hamas-controlled Health Ministry post on the Telegram messaging app. 

The ministry said 459 people were injured and that a number of people are still trapped under rubble. 

The figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. 

The latest death toll comes as Israel has intensified its attacks on Gaza. 

After heavy strikes in the north of Gaza on Beit Lahia and the Jabalia refugee camp, Israel's military on Friday ordered people in Gaza to move south.

But residents in Khan Younis, in the south of Gaza, told Reuters news agency that tanks were advancing toward their city. 

The Israeli military said an offensive had been launched, code-named Gideon's Chariots, to pursue Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's aim of eliminating Hamas.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has slammed US President Donald Trump for ""lying"" about his intent of using US power to bring about peace in Gaza, while also calling Israel a ""cancerous tumor.""

In his first reaction to Trump's recent visit to the Gulf, Khamenei said in a televised address: ""Trump claimed he wants to use power to achieve peace. He and the American officials, and American administrations, have used power to support the massacre in Gaza, to ignite wars wherever they could and to back their own mercenaries.""

Khamenei also referred to the US allegedly providing Israel with 10-ton bombs, which he said Israel was using to ""drop on Gaza children, hospitals, houses of people in Lebanon and anywhere else when they can.""

In February, Israel's Defense Ministry said it had taken delivery of a shipment of 2,000-pound (900 kg) bombs — thus, 1-ton bombs and not 10-ton bombs — from the United States after Trump lifted a suspension on their export imposed by his predecessor, Joe Biden. The bombs, nonetheless, still have a huge destructive impact in built-up areas.

""With the determination of the region's nations, America must and will leave this region,"" Khamenei said, criticizing what he called a failed US model aimed at keeping Gulf states dependent on US support.

In his televised address, he also referred to the ""Zionist regime"" of Israel, saying it was ""a lethal, dangerous, cancerous tumor"" that ""should be certainly eradicated, and it will be.""

Khamenei has frequently called for the destruction of Israel.

The director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, Marwan Sultan, has called the situation there ""catastrophic"" after nearby Israeli strikes overnight.

These caused the ""collapse of ceilings and cracks in the walls,"" Sultan told AFP news agency on Saturday.

""The operating rooms and intensive care units are completely full, and we are unable to receive any more critical cases,"" he said. 

The hospital was suffering a ""severe shortage of blood units, medicines, medical and therapeutic supplies and surgical procedures,"" he added.

Sultan said doctors had been forced to source blood for transfusions from other patients and even from themselves ""due to the impossibility of donations from citizens due to malnutrition.""

The last facility providing cancer treatment across Gaza, the European Hospital in Khan Younis, was ""out of service"" after being struck by Israeli forces, the international medical charity Doctors Without Borders said on Thursday.

""This was one of the last remaining lifelines in Gaza's shattered healthcare system,"" the MSF wrote on X. 

Israeli forces launched 670 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza between October 2023 and March 2025, according to the World Health Organization, affecting 122 facilities.

Israel has repeatedly said Hamas hides its operations in and under hospitals. 

Gaza's Hamas-led Health Ministry has said 43% of essential drugs are out of stock and that hospitals are overwhelmed by critical shortages of medical equipment. 

Israel's 10-week humanitarian blockade means medical supplies have not entered the Gaza Strip since March 2, 2025. 

In its most recent update, the UN's humanitarian agency, OCHA, said only one patient had been evacuated out of Gaza since April 22, 2025.

It estimates that some 10,500 patients, including 4,000 children, need medical treatment abroad. 

Edan Alexander, the dual Israeli-American citizen who was released earlier this week by Hamas, has returned home to his grandmother's house.

""Our Edan is home, in Grandma Varda's house where he spent Friday dinners as a lone soldier,"" his parents said in a statement posted on X by Bring Them Home, an organization lobbying for the return of those taken hostage by Hamas during the October 2023 attacks. 

Alexander will continue to receive treatment for injuries, said his parents, Adi and Yael Alexander, including injuries to his hands caused when a tunnel collapsed on him.

Adi Alexander said earlier in the week that Edan was gaunt and his skin was in ""terrible condition"" from lack of sunshine and bedbug bites during his 19 months of captivity.

Hamas released Edan Alexander on Monday, but he spent four days in a Tel Aviv hospital before returning home.

Alexander's parents said in the statement that they would continue to fight to bring home the 58 hostages still held in Gaza. 

Only 21 of the hostages have been confirmed as alive, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. The fates of another three are unknown.

Hamas has insisted it will only release these hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza.

Netanyahu has previously justified Israel's latest offensive on Gaza by saying it would pressure the Palestinian militant group to release the remaining hostages.

But speaking on Tuesday, Netanyahu said there is ""no way"" Israel will halt its war in Gaza, even if a deal is reached to release more hostages.

He said the destruction of Hamas remains the Israeli mission.

Israeli airstrikes killed at least 58 Palestinians overnight, health officials in Gaza said on Saturday. 

Over 300 people have been killed since Thursday in one of the deadliest phases since the truce collapsed in March, as Israel prepares for a major ground offensive. 

Marwan Al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, said the hospital had received 58 bodies since midnight. He added that ""a large number of victims remain under the rubble.""

Israel's military has confirmed ongoing strikes and troop mobilizations as part of Operation Gideon's Wagons, aimed at defeating Hamas and recovering hostages.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said in early May that his government is planning an intensive offensive against Hamas. Meanwhile, Israel's security cabinet approved plans that could involve seizing the entire Gaza Strip and controlling aid. 

The United Nations has warned that famine is imminent after 76 days without aid deliveries, with UN aid chief Tom Fletcher calling for the Security Council to act to ""prevent genocide.""

Arab League ministers are to meet in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, on Saturday for an annual summit. 

Gaza is expected to top the agenda, especially after Israel started ramping up its offensive and spoke of the ""conquest"" of the territory earlier this week.

Arab national security and counterterrorism are also priorities, an Iraqi government spokesperson said ahead of the meeting.

Among the attendees are Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and UN chief Antonio Guterres. 

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has sharply criticized Israel's Gaza offensive, is expected to address the summit as a guest.

Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda, will miss Baghdad's summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit.

Sudan's military leader, Abdel-Fattah Burhan, will also be absent, although Sudan will be represented by a delegation.

Burhan is reportedly frustrated over the Arab League's failure to respond to his request for an emergency meeting about nations interfering in Sudanese internal matters.

Sudan's military has accuse the United Arab Emirates of providing arms to the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. It has been fighting the RSF for more than two years in a devastating civil war. 

The summit will also consider five Iraqi-backed initiatives, according to Iraq's government, which is hosting the summit for the first time in more than a decade.

These are the setting up of a joint Arab security cooperation room, Arab centers to fight terrorism, drugs and organized crime and also establishing a fund to support Arab recovery and reconstruction after crises.

The meeting comes against a volatile regional backdrop and as Arab economies face renewed uncertainty amid falling oil prices.

US President Donald Trump chose not to vist Israel on his tour of the Middle East this week.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already visited the White House twice since Trump's inauguration.

But some Israeli commentators believe Trump's absence is a sign that something isn't quite right between the two leaders. 

Tania Krämer, DW's correspondent in Jerusalem, explores whether Trump and Netanyahu have fallen out over Gaza.

Tom Fletcher, the United Nations' aid chief, said time should not be wasted on an alternative US-backed proposal to deliver assistance to Gaza.

""To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let's not waste time. We already have a plan,"" he said in a statement as Israel blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza for the 75th consecutive day.

He also said that the UN has a proven plan and 160,000 pallets of relief supplies ready to enter the Palestinian enclave.

""We have thousands of trucks of food at the border. Let us in. Let us work,"" he wrote on X.

Seven European countries have called on Israel to ""reverse its current policy"" and ""immediately"" lift its aid blockade of the Gaza Strip.

In a joint statement, the leaders of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Norway said they would not remain silent in the face of ""the man-made humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes in Gaza.""

""More than 50,000 men, women, and children have lost their lives. Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,"" the leaders warned.

They also called on the government of Israel ""to refrain from further military operations"" and rejected any plans of ""forced displacement or the expulsion of the Palestinian people.""

The letter was released as Israel ramps up its offensive in Gaza.

The Trump administration is developing a plan to permanently resettle up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza in Libya, according to five sources who spoke with US broadcaster NBC News.

The plan is being considered seriously enough that the administration has discussed it with Libya's leadership. In exchange for resettling Palestinians, the administration would release billions of dollars of frozen US funds to Libya, the sources say.

According to the NBC sources, no final agreement has been reached, and Israel has been kept informed of the administration's discussions.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has considered Libya as a potential destination for immigrants whom it wants to deport from the US. However, plans to send one group of immigrants to Libya this month were stalled by a US federal judge.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it is moving toward a new stage of operations in the Gaza Strip.

""The IDF has begun conducting extensive strikes and mobilizing troops to achieve operational control in the areas of Gaza, over the past day,"" the military wrote in a social media post.

According to the IDF, this is part of the preparations to expand operations and fulfill the objectives of the war, including releasing Israeli hostages in Gaza and dismantling Hamas.

Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, is classified as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, Germany and several other countries. Hamas carried out the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostage. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week vowed to continue Gaza operations ""with full force.""

According to Israeli media, this would occur after the conclusion of US President Donald Trump's visit to the region if a new Gaza agreement had not been reached by that time.

Trump has since concluded his multi-day trip to the Gulf region, yet a new Gaza deal remains elusive.

According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, almost 53,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began in October 2023. Although Israel and the US have criticized Gaza health figures, the UN and other international bodies view them as broadly reliable.

International organizations have criticized Israel's operations in Gaza and the blocking of aid, with the Council of Europe on Friday saying that Gaza is suffering from ""deliberate starvation.""

UN rights chief Volker Türk has also criticized Israel's attacks on Gaza as ""ethnic cleansing.""

The Israel Defense Forces said it is ""conducting extensive strikes"" and ""mobilizing troops"" in the Gaza Strip.

This announcement follows an intense bombing campaign by Israel.

On Friday, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that at least 100 people had been killed in the northern Gaza Strip since Thursday evening following multiple Israeli airstrikes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Behind Trump and DOGE's Reckless Destruction Is a Determination to Crush Workers","https://truthout.org/articles/behind-trump-and-doges-reckless-destruction-is-a-determination-to-crush-workers/","Sat, 17 May 2025 15:15:10 GMT","

The future of collective bargaining and labor rights in the United States is on the table.

Even the most alarmed predictions of left-leaning commentators failed to capture the extremity of the onslaught that flooded forth from the second Trump administration in its first few months. Only recently has the real severity of that opening assault come into better focus. That relentlessness was very much by design, a well-worn page of Steve Bannon's playbook: To “flood the zone” is to leave your opponents reeling and unable to mount a response to any single atrocity.

But looking past the immediate fray, the routes taken by the Trump administration's bewildering blitzkrieg do have a common logic. What unites these excesses is that they all represent new fronts in the waging of unrestricted class warfare against labor and working people, a strategy calibrated to the interests of capital. This administration has tactically dispensed with long-standing precedents, trampled guardrails against authoritarianism, thrown open the door for wanton profiteering and maneuvered to strike a severe blow to the labor movement.

If history is any indication, the capitalist class is willing to accede to dictatorship as long as it can secure the regime's collaboration in pursuing its unattainable aim of infinite profit. The first 100 days of the second reign of Trump unambiguously set the terms: Agents of capital can be certain they can count on the administration's help in the struggle against workers' collective power. Trump and his collaborators have already signaled that they are willing to discard with democracy and sacrifice human life without compunction — even if the lives lost potentially number in the millions. They proceed as if they're entering the final stretch, and before them lies the realization of the ultimate aims of the reactionary right: permanent hierarchy and corporate rule, mutually interlocking with untrammeled powers of state repression.

In thinking about the second Trump administration's abuses of power, it's difficult to get a handle on the full implications. Are we really witnessing the unfolding of a neo-fascist regime? Even if we set aside the most ominous portents and parallels, it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that the extent of damage already impacting civil rights and U.S. institutions is staggering, thanks in no small part to Elon Musk's so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE).

Timi Iwayemi is a research director at the Revolving Door Project, a legal and media watchdog for corporate influence that has been tracking the fusillade of DOGE news. “All this is essentially what the Revolving Door Project has preached against,” Iwayemi said. “It's the logical endpoint of governing by corporate power.”

“We know that there is a real material impact from these cuts which really affect the lives of Americans all over the country,” he said. “For people who have criticized [the notion of] the ‘revolving door' and said it's fine to install businesspeople in government — I think this should be a moment of reflection for them.”

Iwayemi said that programmatic class warfare lies behind the apparent reckless folly. Above all, what unites the administration's chaotic gestures is a deep hostility to labor. We're witnessing, he said, the expression of the ruling class's “impulses to push back against workers and discipline workers, and to satisfy the forces behind this project.” This, Iwayemi says, “is a scheme to discipline workers — a scheme to crown the executive and the president as essentially the Supreme Leader.”

The many assaults on federal civil servants are serving as a way to undermine public-sector unions, which comprise about half of unionized workers in the U.S. and have been not quite as badly gouged by decades of anti-union attacks as the decimated private sector membership. While federal public sector workers are legally barred from striking, many other public workers are not, and the sector remains a major bastion of the labor movement, in large part by persisting as unionization rates have drastically collapsed. Capital is hoping to land a decisive blow akin to the PATCO strikebreaking, when Ronald Reagan's infamous firing of air traffic controllers heavily curtailed public sector strikes.

Trump is pursuing an analogous plan, but his administration's ambitions are larger by orders of magnitude. A recent advance is Trump's new, second effort to institute a rule that would deem a large number of federal employees “at-will” and therefore fireable without reason. Trump now claims he can fire workers who “refuse to advance the policy interests of the President” — a threat he has already made good on elsewhere, perhaps nowhere as egregiously as in his dismissal of the Justice Department officials who had been tasked with criminally investigating him. In a show of unrestrained contempt, he's already illegally canceled union contracts for tens of thousands of TSA employees and hundreds of thousands of workers elsewhere, citing “national security,” a nonsensical rationale for what amounts to an obscene abuse of power.

Even more extreme are the administration's moves to neutralize the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB is an inevitable target, but its current position is extraordinarily precarious. Trump, in a heedless violation of the National Labor Relations Act, fired Biden-appointed board members, rendering the NLRB nonfunctional. The wholesale elimination of the NLRB is a worst-case scenario that is now on the verge of being realized, with the likely complicity of the Supreme Court.

Writing on Substack, labor journalist Hamilton Nolan warned of severe and imminent consequences: If labor regulation enforcement ceases, he argued, there will follow an implosion of labor rights, a lock-in of massive unaccountable corporate power, and finally the proliferation of deeply entrenched corruption into institutions.

As a prologue to this, it would seem, Trump is already lining his pockets with cryptocurrency by openly selling access to the White House to his top investors. Not to mention that his new regime is essentially defined by its yawning multitude of conflicts of interest. It's clear that its strikes on labor are coming in tandem with the sort of systematic corporate-government melding (which is, incidentally, a definition of fascism, offered by someone who would know) that is intended to enrich investors at the expense of the civil service and the U.S. public. It's often been noted that the central characteristic of the Trump administration, reflective of the man himself, is its eagerly corrupt self-dealing; this ends up pairing nicely with an extreme hostility to labor that also pleases the capitalist class, such that those two overarching ambitions go, naturally, hand in hand.

And there are other signs of sabotage and dirty tricks: A whistleblower revealed that the DOGE team has been illicitly siphoning confidential data about ongoing labor dispute cases — information that would be of obvious utility to labor's opponents. DOGE has attempted similar data grabs at the Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration (SSA), but the exact motives remain unclear.

Though they also have a strong basis in racist ideology and are in many ways a political stunt aimed at pleasing a reactionary base, the Gestapo-like disappearances executed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been no exception. There is clear evidence that, in addition to asylum seekers, green card and visa holders, U.S. citizens, and innocent families (which is not to say that criminals should be extrajudicially kidnapped and rendered to El Salvador either), deportations and arrests have explicitly targeted labor organizers.

In the case of the detentions in Albion, New York, as The Intercept reported, ICE agents deliberately and knowing targeted workers actively engaged in a major precedent-setting labor rights battle against agricultural industry interests. The agents showed up, according to a witness, with an actual list of names of union workers.

Another telling sign of Trump's sanctioning of outright criminal risks and hostilities against workers was the recent literal decimation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration — the agency has been effectively eradicated as a regulatory force, losing the vast majority of its staff and halting numerous active investigations and oversight procedures. Clearly, Trump is signaling that corporations should feel free to take the gloves off in their treatment of their workers and their product and safety standards.

As the Trump administration goes out of its way to advertise that it will condone and facilitate companies' running roughshod over labor, capital can be observed salivating at the prospects. In the same article, Nolan described how the business lobby has already sent Attorney General Pam Bondi at least one literal wish list of labor law decisions they'd like overturned. This made-to-order corruption would grant bosses sweeping new powers to propagandize workers in “captive audience” meetings and ignore obligations to recognize unions, among others. Without Trump's utter contempt for the rule of law, achieving such gains would have been the slow procedural work of many years, if doing so was even possible.

Nolan wrote that the presumptuous wish list is “a well-thought-out attempt by an organization representing the majority of America's business class to opportunistically use the poisonous lawlessness of the Trump administration [so] they can more easily exploit and oppress their own employees.… This is organized crime in action, except that none of it is ‘crime' anymore, because the government charged with enforcing the law has decided that laws are not real.”

To further prepare the ground for corporate despotism, the Trump administration is plotting vast, aggressive and unprecedented deregulatory schemes. But capital also wants to expand its reach and colonize new territories for profit. This is the idea behind the eternal quest to privatize the SSA in order to open up a lucrative retirement plan market. If the ruling class gets its way, Medicare and Medicaid would share that fate: condemned to absorption into the abysmal and fatally inadequate private health care system.

But some companies, tech in particular, are working a different angle for extracting profit by slashing and selling off the last of the nation's stalwart but ragged social programs. It's become clear that even several of the biggest names in the industry, among them Musk's X, still fail to make anything like a profit. Some, Tesla included, rely on absurdly large federal subsidies and overvaluations — indicative of a tech bubble. The same is true in the AI field; OpenAI operates at a staggering loss.

However, as Iwayemi shrewdly pointed out, the savvier operators may be formulating an exit plan. “Tech folks have realized that government contracts are a very smart way to secure long-term sustainability, like [startup defense contractors] Palantir and Anduril,” he said. Already there are active plans to force the adoption of AI systems into some SSA functions, and the intrusion of AI into state administration will not stop there.

If we really are witnessing the advent of the most significant existential threat to labor rights in living memory, we might ask: Where is the outcry from those targeted? Nolan argued in an article for In These Times that the U.S. labor movement evolved around a supporting legal framework for bargaining and has consequently found that its ability and willingness to strike have atrophied with disuse.

Iwayemi also described sensing an uncomfortable silence. “There's an expectation that the unions would come together and respond to these attacks on their workers and their people,” he said. And in their defense, they are not immobilized. It's true that court challenges have been filed, and judicial challenges are steadily mounting. But these are slow processes, and Trump is already off inflicting damage elsewhere. The administration has unambiguously ceased to play by the rules. Despite the risks, argued Nolan, even federal worker unions are left with no choice but to strike — against the law, in some cases, but also against the wishes of intractable and immobilized union leadership if necessary.

The gravity of the circumstances — and, in many cases, an intractable and sluggish, and anti-militant labor leadership — may justify a more confrontational approach. To those who comprehend the extreme and unprecedented nature of the threat to the movement, it's hard to argue otherwise.

Joe Burns, a veteran labor lawyer, union leader, negotiator and author, has long argued in his numerous writings that modern unions are in desperate need of a militant revitalization, a recognition of their true power — otherwise, they're at risk of being dismantled and neutralized entirely in capital's unrestricted class war. This has never been more true than in this moment. After decades of undermining by corporations and a complicit state, contemporary unions have been hampered by “decades of bureaucratization and business unionism” and are now, in many cases, simply, “not up to the fight,” as Burns told C.J. Polychroniou in an interview with Truthout. “Many opted for accommodation with employers in labor management programs rather than fighting our way out of the problem.”

In his books Class Struggle Unionism and Strike Back, Burns has made a convincing and influential case for militant and active leaderships and rank-and-file and grassroots labor action that does not always conform to frameworks imposed from the top down; those frameworks, after all, have been designed and installed to systematically sap labor of its primary weapon. This is “class struggle unionism” — i.e. organizing that is rooted in an understanding of capital's antagonism to labor, over more accommodationist tactics.

It is time, many would argue, for public employee unions, now facing a potentially existential threat, to surpass self-imposed boundaries in response. A 2023 strike at Rutgers University by three unions, Rutgers AAUP-AFT, Rutgers Adjunct Faculty Union and AAUP-Biomedical and Health Sciences of New Jersey, was notable for being a major action by employees of the public university — the first strike in Rutgers's over 250 years. After five days, the historic walkout won a new contract with 43 percent and 33 percent pay raises for adjunct professors and graduate student workers, respectively. The effort was led by a newly militant adjunct union that pursued a strike in lieu of the less organizing-focused bargaining of previous leaderships, representative of a wave of militant nontenured adjunct and graduate student organizing at the time.

The power of a union ultimately reduces to its ability to threaten and act on the stoppage of work. Engaging that power is far easier said than organized and done, of course. Still, it's worrying to feel like this time around we may be erring on the side of the timid, passive and (if understandably) scared. Yet we're at a time when the only thing that seems appropriate is for everyone to make the loudest noise that they possibly can. These are uniquely threatening and extenuating circumstances.

“None of [Trump's] Republican predecessors in the White House for the past half century ever considered doing something this outrageous.… Through every step of an increasingly aggressive series of tests of the labor movement's power, the administration has learned that there are no real consequences,” Nolan writes. Capital speaks only the language of profit. The only thing it fears is that profit's interruption.

Burns, Nolan, and others in this dire moment are calling upon organized labor to again realize its fundamental structural power, and to cease to play by the rules of an already rigged game — rules that the Trump administration has stopped even making a show of respecting. It is time for labor to answer in kind. “We need a fundamentally different type of labor movement. One willing to violate the restrictions of labor law, confront the powers that be and is deeply rooted in the working class,” as Burns told Truthout:

When workers get in motion, great things can happen. Whether it be private sector workers in the 1930s or public employees in the 1960s, when workers begin striking in large numbers, they can quickly transform the landscape.… Only class struggle unionism, with its worker-led militancy and willingness to challenge the status quo, holds any hope for changing the political equation.

The cause of labor remains the hope of the world. That hope remains, if we can seize it. Beyond union members, we should hope that all organizers, protesters and everyday people can access a sense of their own power, as the moment calls for nothing less than everything we've got. At this juncture, perhaps we should remind ourselves of all that is now on the table. The future of collective bargaining and workers' rights in the United States is one thing. Another is the scale of human harm and suffering that is being inflicted and that we must allay amid the reckless closures, layoffs, funding cuts and administrative havoc.

The ruling is not a repudiation of Alien Enemies Act deportations and focuses solely on migrants' due process rights. 

For the second time in less than a month, the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday ruled against the Trump administration's dubious use of an 18th century law to deport immigrants including at least one person with protected status without due process.

In a 7-2 ruling — with far-right Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito dissenting — the high court found that President Donald Trump violated Venezuelan migrants' right to due process as a class by trying to fast-track their deportation to the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison in El Salvador by invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act during peacetime.

The ruling is not a repudiation of Alien Enemies Act deportations and focuses solely on migrants' due process rights.

“The detainees' interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty,” the court's opinion states. “Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.”

“But it is not optimal for this court, far removed from the circumstances on the ground, to determine in the first instance the precise process necessary to satisfy the Constitution in this case,” the court continued and, referring to the federal appellate court that “erred in dismissing the detainees' appeal for lack of jurisdiction,” said that “we remand the case to the 5th Circuit for that purpose.”

Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project and lead counsel in the case, said Friday that “the court's decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government's attempt to hurry people away to a gulag-type prison in El Salvador.”

“The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance,” Gelernt added.

The Supreme Court opinion noted the case of Kilmar Abrego García, a Maryland man with protected status who was wrongfully deported to CECOT in March. Last month, the high court unanimously ruled that Trump must facilitate Abrego García's return to the United States. The Trump administration has resisted the order, despite the president proclaiming that “if the Supreme Court said, ‘Bring somebody back,' I would do that.”

Steve Vadeck, a professor at Georgetown Law Center, told CNN Friday that “because lower courts have blocked use of the [Alien Enemies Act] in every other district in which the president has sought to invoke it, that means it's effectively pausing all removals under the act until the 5th Circuit — and, presumably, the Supreme Court itself — conclusively resolves whether they're legal and how much process is due if so.”

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines — who was appointed by Trump — issued the first court ruling supporting Alien Enemies Act deportations.

The Trump administration set up a tip line to assist in slashing programs focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.

This story was originally published by ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Days after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency sent an email to the entire workforce with details about the agency's plans to close diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and included a plea for help.

“Employees are requested to please notify” the EPA or the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government's human resources agency, “of any other agency office, sub-unit, personnel position description, contract, or program focusing exclusively on DEI,” the email from then-acting Administrator James Payne said.

No employees in the agency, then more than 15,000 people strong, responded to that plea, ProPublica learned via a public records request.

Trump has made ending diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs a hallmark effort of his second term. Many federal employees, however, are declining to assist the administration with this goal. He signed an executive order on his first day back in office that labeled DEI initiatives — which broadly aim to promote greater diversity, largely within the workplace — as “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” and ordered them halted. His pressure campaign to end DEI efforts has also extended to companies and organizations outside the government, with billions of dollars in federal funding for universities frozen as part of the fight.

Corbin Darling retired from the EPA this year after more than three decades with the agency, including managing environmental justice programs in a number of Western states.

“I'm not surprised that nobody turned in their colleagues or other programs in response to that request,” he said, adding that his former co-workers understood that addressing pollution that disproportionately impacted communities of color was important to the agency's work. “That's part of the mission — it has been for decades,” Darling said.

Payne's note to agency employees listed two email addresses — one belonging to the EPA and one to the Office of Personnel Management — where EPA employees could send details about DEI efforts. ProPublica submitted public records requests to both agencies for the contents of the inboxes from the start of the administration through April 1.

The Office of Personnel Management didn't respond to the request, although the Freedom of Information Act requires that it do so within 20 business days. The agency also did not answer questions about whether it received any reports to its anti-DEI inbox.

The EPA, meanwhile, checked its inbox and confirmed that zero employees had filed reports. “Some emails received in that inbox did come from EPA addresses but none of them called out colleagues who were still working on DEI matters,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement in May.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“The optimist in me would like to believe that maybe it is because, as an agency, we are generally dedicated to our mission and understand that DEIA is intrinsic in that,” a current EPA employee who requested anonymity said. “On the flip side, they've done such a good job immediately dismantling DEIA in the agency that folks who are up in arms might have just been assuaged.”

Although DEI programs are often internal to a workplace, the administration also put a target on environmental justice initiatives, which acknowledge the fact that public health and environmental harm disproportionately fall on poorer areas and communities of color. Environmental justice has been part of the EPA's mandate for years but greatly expanded under the Biden administration.

Research has shown, for example, that municipalities have planted fewer trees and maintained less green space in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of people of color, leading to more intense heat. And heavy industry has often been zoned or sited near Latino, Black and Native American communities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was confirmed in late January, has boasted about cutting more than $22 billion in environmental justice and DEI grants and contracts. “Many American communities are suffering with serious unresolved environmental issues, but under the ‘environmental justice' banner, the previous administration's EPA showered billions on ideological allies, instead of directing those resources into solving environmental problems and making meaningful change,” he wrote in an April opinion piece in the New York Post.

The EPA spokesperson said employees with more than 50% of their duties dedicated to either environmental justice work or DEI were targeted for layoffs. The agency “is taking the next step to terminate the Biden-Harris Administration's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Environmental Justice arms of the agency,” the spokesperson said.

EPA environmental justice offices worked on a range of initiatives, such as meeting with historically underserved communities to help them participate in agency decision-making and dispersing grants to fund mitigation of the carcinogenic gas radon or removal of lead pipes, Darling explained.

“A sea change isn't the right word because it's more of a draining of the sea,” Darling said. “It has devastated the program.”

ST. LOUIS—Storm systems sweeping across parts of the Midwest and South have left at least 21 dead, many of them in Kentucky, where what appeared to be a devastating tornado crumbled buildings and flipped a car over on an interstate.

In Kentucky, some 14 people were killed by severe weather, and the death toll is likely to rise, according to Gov. Andy Beshear. Local authorities in Laurel County, in the state's southeast, said nine people were killed after a tornado touched down.

Laurel County resident Chris Cromer said he got the first of two tornado alerts on his phone around 11:30 p.m. or so, about a half-hour before the tornado struck. He and his wife grabbed their dog, jumped in their car, went to a relative's nearby home and got into a crawlspace.

“We could hear and feel the vibration of the tornado coming through,” said Cromer, 46.

His home is intact, though a piece of the roof got ripped off and windows were broken. A house two doors down is destroyed, along with others in the Sunshine Hills neighborhood, Cromer said.

“It's one of those things that you see on the news in other areas, and you feel bad for people — then, when it happens, it's just surreal,“ he said, describing a landscape of destruction. ”It makes you be thankful to be alive, really.”

Rescuers were “on the ground all night looking for possible survivors,” and the search was continuing into the morning, Sheriff's Office spokesperson Deputy Gilbert Acciardo. An emergency shelter was set up at a local high school and donations of food and other necessities were arriving.

The National Weather Service hadn't yet confirmed that a tornado struck, but meteorologist Philomon Geertson said it was likely. It ripped across the largely rural area and extended to the London Corbin Airport shortly before midnight.

“Lives have been changed forever here tonight. This is a time we come together, and we pray for this community,” London Mayor Randall Weddle told WKYT-TV. “I have never personally witnessed what I‘ve witnessed here tonight.”

It's the latest severe weather to cause deaths and widespread damage in Kentucky. Two months ago, at least 24 people died in a round of storms that swelled creeks and submerged roads. Hundreds of people were rescued, and most of the deaths were caused by vehicles getting stuck in high water.

The latest Kentucky storms were part of a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, knocked out power to several hundred thousand customers in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heat wave to Texas.

St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed five deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes were affected.

“This is truly, truly devastating,” Spencer said. An overnight curfew was imposed Friday in the neighborhoods with the most damage.

The total number of people injured was not immediately known, but hospitals in the area reported receiving dozens of patients, with some in serious condition.

National Weather Service radar indicated a likely tornado touched down between 2:30 p.m. and 2:50 p.m. in Clayton, Missouri, in the St. Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St. Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 World's Fair and Olympic Games the same year.

Three people needed aid after part of the Centennial Christian Church crumbled, City of St. Louis Fire Department Battalion Chief William Pollihan told The Associated Press.

Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law, Patricia Penelton, died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir.

John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St. Louis student, said he and his girlfriend were at the St. Louis Art Museum during the storm and were hustled into the basement with about 150 other people.

“You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,” he said. “A lot of people were caught outside.”

The Saint Louis Zoo remained closed Saturday because of damage, but spokesperson Christy Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staffers, guests or animals.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON—Republicans were dealt a major blow on May 16 when the House Budget Committee failed to advance a multi-trillion-dollar budget package.

Created through a process that does not require support from Democrats, the package would fund President Donald Trump's agenda items on the border, energy, and more while making permanent the tax cuts passed during his first presidency. It would also raise the debt ceiling to $4 trillion.

The result is a hiccup in the process known as reconciliation, which could let Republicans pass the bill with their slim Senate majority without being thwarted by a filibuster.

But reconciliation is governed by stringent rules, including the Byrd rule. That rule requires the bill's provisions to have some connection to the budget. Reconciliation bills also cannot increase the federal deficit after 10 years. That means permanent spending increases must be offset by cuts—a concern raised by budget hawks like Norman.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 capped SALT deductions from federal taxes at $10,000 per household. Some Republicans think that is far too low.

While the final draft of the reconciliation bill raises the SALT deduction cap to $30,000, this figure has not been enough for some Republicans, who want to raise the cap further. They said existing tax burden is too heavy on their constituents.

After leaving a May 15 meeting with GOP leadership, Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), an outspoken SALT Republican, said lawmakers have still “got a lot of work to do.”

SALT expansion has met with resistance from fiscal conservatives, including Norman.

“If you raise the SALT cap from [$10,000] to [$30,000] to whatever, pay for it,” he told reporters minutes ahead of the budget committee vote.

On X, Roy wrote that a change to the SALT cap amounts to “subsidizing blue state high-tax jurisdictions.”

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) is among the SALT-aligned moderates who have taken issue with expansive cuts to Medicaid.

She told The Epoch Times on May 15 that she expected a deal to emerge on SALT.

Republicans are seeking significant savings in Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicaid-related provisions would save $625 billion over 10 years, and added that the bill would also lead to about 7.6 million people becoming ineligible for the program.

Amid May 16 negotiations, Scalise confirmed to reporters that conservative Republicans are seeking further adjustments to Medicaid, particularly the timing of proposed work requirements for program eligibility.

Moderate Republicans such as Malliotakis have opposed large Medicaid cuts amid fears of an electoral backlash in 2026.

Democrats have made Medicaid the focal point of their crusade against the GOP's bill, which turns up the heat on Republicans in battleground districts.

Republicans have said that their changes to the program would merely make illegal immigrants ineligible for Medicaid, prevent fraud in the program, and impose stricter requirements on non-working adults seeking benefits.

Some Republicans have said Medicaid measures will bring pain to their supporters.

Trump has consistently said that neither the bill nor his administration will adversely affect Medicaid for U.S. beneficiaries.

Norman told reporters amid negotiations that he wants to see those programs “end now.”

The current bill phases out IRA electricity production and generation credits after 2028. Certain production credits for wind energy would be eliminated starting in 2027, while some others would end at later dates. Many credits would be repealed after 2025.

The exact estimates of the bill's deficit effects vary.

Some Republicans have raised concerns about the timing of projected costs and savings.

After meeting with Scalise and Johnson on May 15, Roy told reporters that the bill had “too much back load in the savings and too much front load in the tax policy.”

Some are concerned about the bill's length.

Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) told members to go home for the weekend.

“Know that the weekend is yours and your family's,” he said.

A few hours later, the committee announced it would reconvene at 10 p.m. on May 18, a Sunday.

Meanwhile, there are signals of opposition in the Senate, which would consider the package if the House passes it.

“A failure to suspend or increase the debt limit would wreak havoc on our financial system and diminish America's security and global leadership position,” he wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","At least 21 dead after tornado-spawning storms move across central US","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/17/weather/tornadoes-severe-weather-deaths-climate-hnk","Sat, 17 May 2025 09:35:00 GMT","


            A violent, tornado-spawning storm system tore across the central US, leaving at least 21 people dead in Missouri and southeastern Kentucky as it cut a path of destruction through several states.
    


            The 14 deaths in Kentucky come on the heels of fatalities reported hours earlier on Friday in the St. Louis area, which endured widespread destruction. Seven people were reported dead in Missouri.
    


            In all, large tornadoes have been reported in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.
    


            The storms damaged homes and downed power lines across the Midwest and Great Lakes, brought by the same system that produced destructive storms and tornadoes Thursday.
    


            About 540,000 homes and businesses across a dozen states were without power as of midday Saturday, with Missouri, Kentucky and Michigan among the hardest hit, according to Poweroutage.us.
    


            It's part of a multi-day spate of widespread severe weather that will stretch into early next week. As the system that generated deadly tornadoes in Missouri and Kentucky loses strength, another round of severe storms is expected near the border with Mexico, thrusting more than 20 million Americans across the Southwest in the risk zone.
    


Storm kills at least 5 in St. Louis as millions remain under the threat of strong tornadoes and violent winds



            Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said on social media Saturday at least 14 people had died there “but sadly, this number is expected to grow as we receive more information. Please pray for all of our affected families.”
    


            Mahala Watts told CNN affiliate WLKY her family was watching the news after 11 p.m. Friday when their phones started blaring with tornado warnings. She grabbed the dog, and her family took cover in the bathroom in the center of their home in Laurel County.
    


            The storm suddenly roared over her house – as the family was “breathing in all the debris.” They got on their hands and knees, Watts told the station. A bathroom mirror fell on Watts before the roar went silent.
    


            “We were just kind of praying, you know, scared it was going to come back,” she said. “We had no idea the roof was gone. The fridge was blocking the bathroom door.”
    


            Watts told WLKY her family climbed over the refrigerator and stood outside in the dark, fearing another hit. Cars were overturned and debris was strewn about. They used a relative's car to get to a hospital where they sought refuge in a hospital before making it to a hotel after the storm passed.
    


            Earlier Saturday, Laurel County sheriff's spokesperson Deputy Gilbert Acciardo had reported nine deaths after a possible tornado in southeastern Kentucky.
    


            Drone video over London, Kentucky, at daylight Saturday showed a vast wasteland of damaged and overturned vehicles and flattened homes as first responders searched heaps of rubble for possible survivors.
    


            In separate video from Laurel County, first responders are seen descending on the Sunshine Hills area, a barren landscape of twisted cars, downed trees and piles of debris.
    


            Deaths were also announced by London Mayor Randall Weddle, CNN affiliate WKYT reported. London is about 75 miles south of Lexington, in Kentucky's Laurel County.
    


            “I have never personally witnessed what I‘ve witnessed here tonight. There's a lot of devastation,” Weddle told WKYT.
    


            The National Weather Service reported a radar-confirmed, “large, extremely dangerous” tornado sweeping east across lower Kentucky shortly after midnight.
    


            Video and photos from southeastern Kentucky show a trail of destruction that began in Pulaski County before moving east into neighboring Laurel County.
    


            The Laurel County Fiscal Court posted videos of widespread damage to buildings, cars, trees and infrastructure in the wake of the possible tornado.
    


            Police in Corbin, south of London, were responding to mutual aid calls for tornado victims and described the devastation as overwhelming.
    


            “Stop and pray for Laurel County residents and victims of the tornado that touched down there,” the department wrote.
    


            Heavy damage can be seen in Somerset, a city in Pulaski County to the west of London, where emergency officials urged residents to stay indoors.
    


            “The southern side of the city has been hit by a possible tornado!” the Somerset Fire Department posted on social media around 11 p.m. Friday. “Please avoid the area, poles and power lines are down!”
    


            Pulaski County Judge Executive Marshall Todd declared a state of emergency, and crews are working on cleanup efforts, county spokesperson John Alexander told CNN.
    


            A storm that produced a devastating tornado in the St. Louis area Friday afternoon has left five people dead and many others injured, according to local authorities. Two others died elsewhere in Missouri.
    


            “We're just a city that's really grieving,” the city's new mayor, Cara Spencer, told reporters Saturday. About 5,000 buildings have been impacted by the severe weather but she noted, “This community is coming together in a truly, truly amazing way.”
    


            Spencer called the event “one of the worst storms” in the city's history. A curfew will remain in place overnight and thousands of homes and businesses still had no power. Nearly 40 people were injured, the mayor said.
    


            First responders looking for victims or people in distress searched about 4,000 residences. More technical searches with boom microphones and cameras were being conducted Saturday.
    


            Gov. Mike Kehoe said he has a﻿lready been in contact with federal officials about disaster relief.
    


            One victim was identified as Patricia Pendleton, her family told CNN affiliate KMOV, which reported the storm caused a roof to collapse at Centennial Christian Church. She had been at the church serving lunches before the storm.
    


            Ben Herzog, a science and operations officer with the National Weather Service, said a tornado warning was issued at 2:34 p.m Friday and a “likely tornado” touched down seven to eight minutes after that. He said the agency was surveying the damage and had no information on the intensity, but estimates are that winds reached 100 mph.
    


            His message for residents: “I think the biggest thing would be staying away if you don't need to be around.”
    


            Sarah Russell, commissioner of the City Emergency Management Agency in St. Louis, said the citywide system of tornado sirens was being replaced and had undergone testing on Thursday. She said residents were encouraged to rely on multiple warning systems, including mobile apps and weather radio.
    


            Some of the tornado sirens did not go off, which will be investigated, said Russell. “We're looking into that,” she told reporters Saturday. The focus now is on life-saving measures in the community, she added.
    


            Fifteen patients with storm-related injuries went to St. Louis Children's Hospital and three were admitted, officials said. Additionally, Barnes-Jewish Hospital received between 50 and 60 people injured in the storm; most have been discharged.
    


            More than 130 miles to the south, in Scott County, two others were killed during Friday's storms, Sheriff Derick Wheetley announced on social media.
    


            Several others were taken to medical facilities, “with injuries ranging from minor to severe,” the sheriff added.
    


            “The tornado moved from the eastern part of the county, leaving behind a trail of destruction, with multiple homes completely lost and areas left unrecognizable,” the sheriff said.
    


            As the system that hit Missouri and Kentucky weakens and pushes across the Southeast, another round of severe storms threatens the Great Plains and Texas.
    


            The threat of level three out of five severe storms will impact the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex Saturday evening, with large hail, damaging winds and the potential for tornadoes.
    


            The possibility of more severe weather stretches through Tuesday in the Great Plains and the lower Mississippi River Valley.
    


            The Plains will remain the main focus of severe weather on Sunday and Monday as well, with damaging storms possible in much of Oklahoma and Kansas. The severe thunderstorm threat will then shift back into parts of the Mississippi Valley on Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump is digging up old immigration policies to help his crackdown. Here's a timeline for how we got here","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/17/us/immigration-policies-us-history-timeline","Sat, 17 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","


            President Donald Trump wasted no time enacting his immigration crackdown after being inaugurated for a second term. On the campaign trail, he promised mass deportations and more arrests — and to do it, he's resurrecting old policies.
    


            Immigration policy being at the forefront of politics is nothing new. From the nation's founding to modern day, the policies enacted over time reveal shifting priorities — from establishing the first basis of what it takes to immigrate to the US, to regulating the flow of arrivals, to addressing national security concerns in the wake of wars and 9/11.
    


            Members of the Trump administration are “very, very familiar with our immigration laws throughout the country's history and (are) looking back to see what provision they might use to achieve their current policies on immigration,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the US Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.
    


            But, according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS, about 52% of Americans say Trump has gone too far in deporting undocumented immigrants and 57% say they do not believe the federal government is being careful in following the law while carrying out deportations.
    


            In fact, while weighing the issue before the election, some young voters told CNN current laws don't keep up with the times and they wanted to see bipartisan reform. The problem: accomplishing a comprehensive overhaul of the system is no easy task in an increasingly divided political climate.
    


Here's a look at how we got here:



1790






            The first Congress passed the first naturalization act. It ratified the recently written Constitution, granting the power to establish a “uniform Rule of Naturalization” for “free white person” who lived in the United States for at least two years.
    


1798






            The Alien Enemies Act gave the government the authority to detain and deport people who were not US citizens and deemed a threat during wartime, plus allowed the government to bypass some of the protocols in the immigration statutes. It was part of four laws, collectively known as the Alien and Sedition Acts, that were passed when the US was on the verge on conflict with France. It could be invoked by a president if the US was at war with another country, or if a foreign nation or government invaded, or threatened to invade, the US. The Sedition act also permitted deportations of anyone who was deemed a threat or who published false writing against the US.
    


                    1868
                





            Ratified by the states in 1868, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship to all people “born or naturalized in the United States,” including Black Americans and former slaves, according to the Constitution.
    


1849 through 1870s






            Large numbers of Chinese immigrants began arriving during the California Gold Rush. The mass migration of speculators swelled California's population to more than quadruple in size in about a decade's time, growing to more than 370,000 people by 1860. So, when economic panic ensued in the US in the 1870s, White citizens scapegoated Chinese immigrants for taking away jobs.
    


1882






            Signed into law by President Chester Arthur, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the first and only federal law to prevent a specific nationality of people from becoming US citizens. It blocked Chinese workers from coming legally to the country, and blocked Chinese immigrants who were already living here from becoming US citizens. The Library of Congress called it the “first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history.”
    


1891






            The Immigration Act of 1891 gave the federal government authority over the immigration process, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Prior to this law, immigrants were required to be processed by individual states.
    


1892






            Ellis Island opened to accommodate the federal government's new authority, according to the National Park Service. Between its opening on January 1, 1892, and when it closed in 1954, Ellis Island received more than 12 million people, NPS said.
    


1917﻿






            The United States passed its strictest immigration law of its time, the Immigration Act of 1917 — two months before the US entered World War I.
    


            The law restricted the immigration of many people from the Middle East and Asia — including modern-day India, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Southeast Asia and the Asian-Pacific islands. To keep these people out, the law raised the tax imposed on most adult entrants. It also imposed a literacy test, requiring newcomers older than 16 years old to show basic reading comprehension in any language. Many of these provisions paved the way for another immigration policy in the future, the State Department's Office of the Historian said.
    


Some context: With World War I in full swing, US lawmakers who drafted and passed the Immigration Act of 1917 characterized it as necessary for the country's security. The Office of the Historian said that “the uncertainty generated over national security” during the war made it possible for the act to be signed into law. But it didn't pass unopposed. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed it, arguing the law prevented good people from joining American society. Congress overrode the veto.
    


1921






            The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 was the first time the US set a cap on the number of immigrants allowed into the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The quota applied only to people coming from outside the Western Hemisphere, MPI said. Most people from Asia were still barred, per the Immigration Act of 1917. It came during a time of growing isolationism, immigration fears and increased global displacement during and after WWI, the NPS said.
    


1924






            The Immigration Act of 1924 reflected desires to tamp down on overall immigration, “but also try to shift the origins of immigration back to the western and northern European origin,” Gelatt said.
    


            The act lowered the quotas, according to the Office of the Historian, and included people of British descent whose families lived in the US for a long time in the calculations. This meant more visas were available for people from the British Isles and Western Europe, the office said. Immigrants from Asia were still excluded, it said.
    


            Republican Sen. David Reed of Pennsylvania, one of the lead sponsors of the bill, wrote in The New York Times that year that the US would become “a more homogeneous nation.” He wrote that excluding people from certain countries “implies no reflection upon the merit of the excluded peoples. It is merely a recognition of their fundamental dissimilarity from ourselves.”
    


            “This was a period where eugenics was sort of cutting-edge science,” Gelatt said. “There was a concern that these were lower quality people, basically, who were coming from eastern and southern Europe.”
    


1929-1934






            During the Great Depression, federal and local authorities rounded up large numbers of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans, forcing them to leave their homes on the Arizona, California and Texas borders and relocate to Mexico. Many Americans at the time blamed Mexican communities for taking away jobs and public assistance resources. The USCIS notes many people also returned to Mexico voluntarily, but state and local officials often used coercive methods or threats.
    


                    1933
                





            President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) during the Great Depression, unifying the federal government's immigration and naturalization responsibilities into one agency, according to the USCIS.
    


1942






            In the wake of the US entering World War II, Roosevelt signed an executive order targeting Japanese-Americans to be put into “relocation centers” or “internment camps.” As a result, approximately 120,000 Japanese-Americans were forced to evacuate their homes and leave their jobs to live in the camps that were surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, conditions that are now drawing comparisons to modern-day detention facilities.
    


1943






            The Chinese Exclusion Act and other related measures were repealed with the Magnuson Act of 1943, the Library of Congress said, establishing quotas for immigrants from China and making them eligible to receive citizenship. A State Department history notes the move was “in the interests of aiding the morale of a wartime ally during World War II.”
    


1952






            The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 amended the 1924 measure and laid the foundation of modern immigration law, according to the USCIS.
    


            It continued the national origins quota system but ended the exclusion of immigrants from Asia and got rid of laws that prevented Asian immigrants from receiving citizenship, the Office of the Historian said.
    


            But caveats still made the law discriminatory in practice. For example, the law used race instead of nationality in its quotas of Asian countries, which only received 100 visas each year, the office said. Further, if an immigrant had at least one Asian parent, they counted toward the quota from the country of their ethnicity or against a general — also restrictive — quota for the so-called “Asia-Pacific Triangle.” This applied regardless of where the immigrant was coming from and even if they were a citizen of another country, according to a policy brief from the Immigration Policy Center and the Office of the Historian.
    


            It also laid out legal framework to deport people in the US illegally, according to USCIS, and prioritized skilled workers and family reunification, which is still used today, the office said.
    


                    1945-1952
                





            In the early years of the Cold War, the debate around immigration was intertwined with the debate about foreign policy and national security. During deliberations about the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, some lawmakers wanted more liberal immigration laws, fearing that a restrictive quota system would lead to tension with other countries, the Office of the Historian outlined. However, other lawmakers were concerned about communism infiltrating the US, the office said.
    


                    1954
                





“Operation Wetback” was an aggressive and unprecedented sweep by US Border Patrol agents in the mid-1950s that plucked Mexican laborers from fields and ranches in targeted raids, bused them to detention centers along the border and ultimately sent many of them deep into the interior of Mexico, some by airlift, others on cargo boats that typically hauled bananas. During his first campaign in 2015, Trump cited the operation as a model for how he would carry out mass deportations.
    


                    1959-1961
                





            More than 200,000 people fled Cuba in the span of three years after Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution. As a result, the Cuban Refugee Program — established in 1961 — helped relocate hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in Miami across the US during the next two decades, the Library of Congress said.
    


                    1962
                





            The Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 helped provide funding and resources for refugees who came to the United States, including resettling them in the US and providing aid through international organizations. It also allowed nearly 20,000 refugees into the country between 1960 and 1965, extending the terms of the Fair Share Refugee Act which Congress passed in 1960, according to USCIS.
    


                    1965
                





            Parts of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 have made their way into modern immigration policy. The bill was spearheaded by President John F. Kennedy who wanted immigration reform, specifically to get rid of bans based on national origin, according to his letters to lawmakers. The law was ultimately signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, after Kennedy's assassination. It made several changes to immigration policy — but also several miscalculations that have had lasting consequences in which politics has since made it difficult to correct, experts said.
    


            The law abolished quotas, established a preference system prioritizing immigrants' skills and family reunification and opened the door to more non-European immigration. However, it still favored immigrants from western and northern Europe over eastern and southern Europe and had very low levels of permissible immigration from other countries — especially from Asian and African countries, Gelatt said.
    


            Notably, the law placed a cap on the number of available visas, but did not include the immediate relatives of someone who is already in the country as part of the count. During debates around the 1965 act, some members of Congress were worried that eliminating national origins quotas would shift the origins of immigrants away from Europe, Gelatt said. Their concerns were stated in “rather racist terms,” she said.
    


            In fact, when Johnson signed the bill into law under the Statue of Liberty, he said it wasn't a “revolutionary bill” and told Americans it “wouldn't reshape the structure of our daily lives” but that it “corrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American Nation.” By promoting immigration through family ties, the idea was that immigration would “replicate the racial and national origins of current residents of the United States,” Gelatt said. That's not what happened in practice.
    


            There were enough other pathways into the country — including student or temporary visas, for example — for immigrants from other parts of the world to also sponsor their own family members, leading to “a very large increase in immigration from Latin America and from various Asian countries,” Gelatt said.
    


            There was also an effect on illegal immigration. The new cap on the immigrants from the Western Hemisphere was lower than the number of people who wanted to come to the US, Gelatt said. That “served over time to shift some immigration flows” from happening “within the law, to causing those to happen outside of the law,” especially from Mexico, she said.
    


            According to data compiled by the Migration Policy Institute, immigrants from the Americas became the largest portion of the total immigrant population from 1980 onward, a shift from a majority European-born population.
    


                    1980
                





            President Jimmy Carter signed the Refugee Act of 1980 as an amendment to the 1965 law to standardize the process of letting refugees into the US. The law provided the “first statutory basis for asylum,” according to the USCIS, and increased the number of refugees allowed in each year. Moving forward, the president and Congress also had the power to set how many refugees would be admitted annually, the law said.
    


                    1986
                





            Six years later, President Ronald Reagan tried to address undocumented immigration with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 which set up restrictions on employers. It made it illegal for people to knowingly hire undocumented immigrants and established an “employment verification system,” according to the bill. It also gave more money to the Border Patrol and other federal agencies.
    


                    1990
                





            The Immigration Act of 1990 was the first significant revision of immigration policy since the Immigration and Nationality Act and tried to address some of the 1965 law's pitfalls by creating more avenues for skilled and educated workers. It defined three categories of immigration, based on family, employment and diversity, the MPI said. It set a cap of 700,000 total immigrant visas for fiscal years 1992-1994, but still did not include the immediate family members of US citizens in that count.
    


            Notably, the 1990 law also set up five categories of employment visas, targeting skilled workers, according to the MPI, and used a lottery system to determine which H-1B petitions would proceed further.
    


            If that sounds familiar, it's because it is. “Most of the rules that we're operating under, in terms of legal immigration, were set in 1990,” Gelatt said.
    


            Additionally, the 1990 law created Temporary Protected Status, which has been a big topic in immigration policy today, she said. TPS applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore the protections are limited to people already in the United States. Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections.
    


                    1996
                





            The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act put in place measures that intensified the law enforcement focus of US immigration laws, Gelatt said. It expanded the number of immigrants with criminal convictions eligible to be deported, introduced expedited removal procedures and put restrictions on many unauthorized immigrants from legalizing though family relationships, she said.
    


                    2001
                





            Terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, putting new emphasis on national security, border security and immigration. After the attacks, immigration was reframed as a “critical part of our national security infrastructure and so the emphasis on vetting and screening of immigrants just really increased,” Gelatt said, adding that there has also been a focus on integrating government databases since then.
    


                    2002
                





            The Homeland Security Act of 2002 overhauled the federal government's role in immigration in response to the 9/11 attacks and disbanded the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Among other national security functions, it created the Department of Homeland Security, noting a shift toward border security and counterterrorism. In 2003, the functions of the INS were put into three new agencies within DHS — US Citizenship and Immigration Services, US Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as outlined in the bill.
    


                    2006
                





            The Secure Fence Act under President George W. Bush authorized construction of about 700 miles of barriers and surveillance along the US-Mexico border. In an effort to “make our borders more secure,” Bush, at the time, called it an “important step toward immigration reform,” according to a White House fact sheet.
    


                    2012
                





            The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was introduced by President Barack Obama. It allowed certain immigrants who were brought to the US as children to receive renewable protection from deportation and be eligible for work permits, obtain drivers licenses and enroll in college. However, the program didn't give them a path to become US citizens or legal permanent residents — something immigrant rights advocates have criticized, saying it left people in limbo.
    


                    2017-2021
                





            When President Donald Trump took office for this first term, he took a series of controversial actions aimed at reducing illegal immigration and enhancing border security.
    


            Here are some of them:
    


                    2021
                





            Biden reversed many of Trump's immigration policies, including the travel ban and limits on asylum seekers. He also stopped border wall construction and established a task force for family reunification. Toward the end of his term, Biden spent a lot of time trying to defend his administration's immigration actions against Republican attacks. Biden often pointed to a comprehensive, bipartisan border deal that failed in the Senate twice, at the direction of then-candidate Trump.
    


                    2025
                





            Now more than 100 days into his second term, Trump has pushed legal boundaries in trying to enact his immigration promises — one of which was to complete “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”
    


            To do it, Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador. It has only been invoked three times in US history — all during war. The Supreme Court has paused these deportations. Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the US southern border to bolster military presence and send migrants to Guantanamo Bay, and has kicked off the process to end birthright citizenship, which was met with legal challenges.
    


            The administration has also terminated hundreds of students' visas under a rarely used provision that allows for revocation if a person's presence in the US “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The administration has said the students are sympathizing with Hamas. Some of the students challenged the move in court, but the government later backed down in the legal fight.

MIAMI (AP) — Colombia's government has applied to join a China-based development bank, another sign of Latin America's drift away from the U.S. as the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts, trade barriers and crackdown on immigration spurs many leaders in the region to seek closer ties with Washington's geopolitical rival.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrapped up a visit to China this week with a stop in Shanghai, where he met with former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, the head of the New Development Bank. 

The multilateral lender was set up a decade ago as a project of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — the so-called BRICS nations of major developing markets — as a counter to U.S.-dominated institutions like the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. 

To date, the New Development Bank has approved loans for 122 infrastructure projects totaling more than $40 billion in areas such as transport, sanitation and clean energy, according to Rousseff.

Petro, speaking to reporters in China on Saturday, said that Colombia is committed to purchasing $512 million worth of shares in the bank. He said that he was especially excited by the possibility of securing the New Development Bank's support for a 120-kilometer (75-mile) canal, or railway, connecting Colombia's Atlantic and Pacific Ocean coastlines that he said would position the country at the “heart” of trade between South America and Asia.

Colombia is the second Latin American country to try and join the bank after tiny Uruguay sought membership in 2021. 




But Colombia's traditional role as a staunch U.S. ally and caretaker in the war on drugs is likely to raise eyebrows in Washington. The U.S. State Department this week said that it would “vigorously oppose” financing of projects linked to China's Belt and Road Initiative in Latin America. Petro signed up to the initiative during a summit with fellow leftist leaders from Brazil and China.

Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, said he wouldn't be dissuaded by U.S. pressure and reaffirmed that Colombia seeks to remain neutral in a new era of geopolitical wrangling.

“We made this decision freely,” Petro told reporters from Shanghai. “With the United States we can speak face to face, with China too.”

BASEL, Switzerland (AP) — The world's largest live music event has reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with the grand final on Saturday of the Eurovision Song Contest, a celebration of music and unity ruffled by discord over Israel's participation.

A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland. 

But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland — or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.

Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture “Bara Bada Bastu,” followed by Austrian singer JJ's pop-opera song “Wasted Love.”

French chanteuse Louane has risen up the odds with “maman,” as has Dutch singer Claude with soulful ballad “C'est La Vie” and Finland's Erika Vikman with the innuendo-laden “Ich Komme.” Estonia's Tommy Cash is also a contender with his highly caffeinated dance-pop song “Espresso Macchiato.”

Israel's Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic “New Day Will Rise,” but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.




Acts from 26 countries — trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals — will perform to some 160 million viewers for the continent's pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display has been spared by musicians who have 3 minutes to win over millions of viewers who, along with national juries of music professionals, pick the winner.

The live show is also set to feature a guest performance by nonbinary Swiss singer Nemo — who won last year's contest in Sweden — and a face-off between two fan favorites: Baby Lasagna of Croatia, the 2024 runner up with “Rim Tim Tagi Dim,” and Finland's Käärijä, whose rap-pop party anthem “Cha Cha Cha” came second in 2023.

There are also rumors of an appearance by Celine Dion. Before she was a global star, the Canadian chanteuse won Eurovision in 1988, competing for Switzerland. She sent a video message to one of the semifinals, where three singers performed her winning song, “Ne partez pas sans moi” (Don't Leave Without Me).

Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision, said the competition has become more diverse over the years, both musically and linguistically. There are songs in 20 languages this year, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Albanian, Latvian and Maltese.

“In the past it was about having a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English,” he said. But in the past decade “we've seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.”

“In recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn't succeeded,” he added. “An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days.”

This year's contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel's participation. Dozens of former participants, including Switzerland's Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded.

Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year's event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member.

A pro-Palestinian demonstration is planned for Saturday evening in central Basel, about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the St. Jakobshalle arena contest venue.

A group of Israel supporters gathered in Basel's cathedral square on Saturday to root for Raphael and to show that “Jews belong in public spaces in Switzerland,” said Zurich resident Rebecca Laes-Kushner.

She said “it would be such a strong statement against antisemitism,” if Raphael won.

“This is supposed to be about music, not about hate,” she said.

The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, tightened the contest's code of conduct this year, calling on participants to respect Eurovision's values of “universality, diversity, equality and inclusivity” and its political neutrality.

After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country's flag.

Axel Åhman, one third of favorites KAJ, acknowledged that it's tough to keep Eurovision an unpolitical event.

“The world always seeps in in some sense,” he told the AP. “But we're here to represent Sweden and we have prepared for this for all our lives and want to make the best of our moment as artists in this huge and legendary competition. 

“So our main focus is there, and the politics (we) try to leave that to the EBU and those actually making the decisions.”

Eurovision director Martin Green told reporters that the organizers' goal was to ”re-establish a sense of unity, calm and togetherness this year in a difficult world.”

“All 37 delegations, in difficult times, have behaved impeccably,” he said.

MIAMI (AP) — In the sordid annals of Colombia's underworld, Diego Marín stood out as the ultimate survivor.

Time and again, the reputed henchman for the Cali cartel evaded capture — or worse fates — as he built a money-laundering network stretching across four continents. He did so, authorities have alleged, with ruthlessness, street smarts and a willingness to bribe a slew of South American police officers and politicians.

All the while, Marín had an even more powerful ally in his corner: the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

For years, the elite narcotics agency claimed it was investigating the Colombian importer, telling the U.S. Justice Department he was among DEA's top targets. In reality, the relationship was more fraught, with Marín briefly signed up as an informant even as he assiduously corrupted agents with a movable feast of prostitutes, fine dining and expensive gifts, an Associated Press investigation found.

In return, at least one of those agents helped Marín launder money and smuggle contraband — throwing law enforcement off his tracks. As the DEA looked the other way, Marín's business flourished into a criminal empire that generated up to $100 million a year, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

The AP's findings — based on interviews with current and former agents, as well as a trove of highly sensitive Justice Department files — offer an unprecedented glimpse into the fraud, shoddy oversight and profligate DEA spending that enabled Marín's ascent. The corruption was so extensive, the officials said, that it reminded them of one of the most infamous law enforcement scandals in U.S. history — the FBI's unscrupulous dealings with Whitey Bulger, the Boston mob boss.




“It's an embarrassment for the DEA,” said retired Colombian Gen. Juan Carlos Buitrago, who spent years trying to take down Marín only to see his own career derailed by the pursuit. “They ended up creating a monster.”

After decades in the shadows, Marín has recently become front-page news in Colombia, where he's been dubbed the “Contraband Czar” over bribery charges that led to his arrest last year in Spain. Among the revelations aired in Colombian media: Marín provided a private plane and an illegal $125,000 campaign donation to President Gustavo Petro. 

Marín attorneys declined to comment. The DEA did not respond to requests for comment.

The revelations are the latest stain for an agency at a crossroads under President Donald Trump. DEA agents already have been redirected to assist in immigration enforcement, and the Justice Department is considering merging the DEA with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — a restructuring that could change how the U.S. fights the drug war.

Marín, 62, learned to hustle from an early age. He was raised in Palestina, a western frontier town settled by devout Catholics who eked out a modest existence from the surrounding coffee farms. To help provide for his family, as a kid he sold candies in the town's plaza.

It's not precisely known how he got into the drug business. But it was sometime during Colombia's bloody cocaine wars, an era popularized by drug lord Pablo Escobar's infamous phrase of “plata o plomo”: money or bullets.

His first brush with the law came in 1993, when he was arrested on accusations of hiding dope money in Colombia-bound home appliances for the leaders of the Cali cartel, Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela, Escobar's main rivals. The evidence, obtained through wiretapped phone calls, tracked with DEA's own intelligence at the time that Marín was involved in drug trafficking, according to Colombian court records.

Colombian authorities declined to charge him and the case fell apart when a police officer — himself later convicted of leaking confidential information to the cartel — recanted his testimony against Marín.

In the ensuing years, the U.S. government records show, Marín sought to line the pockets of law enforcement. An FBI report from 2020 said Marín “paid everyone off” as he developed a niche in what's known as trade-based money laundering, a complex method of hiding and moving drug proceeds through the use of offshore shell companies and misvalued cargo shipments.

Even as he amassed a fortune, Marín was careful to eschew the narco bling of infamous drug lords. Few photographs are known to exist of him. He carefully avoided opening bank accounts and limited his electronic communications.

“He was pretty much untouchable,” said Luis Sierra, a longtime U.S. criminal investigator who served as the Homeland Security Investigations attaché to Bogota. “His tradecraft was compromising and corrupting Colombian — and even a few U.S. — officials.”

Buitrago, the Colombian general who investigated Marín, said he obtained reliable intelligence that Marín had offered $5 million to officials to have him ousted. Buitrago retired rather than accept an unwanted transfer.

“The message was clear: I had to get out of the way or I had to get out of the way,” Buitrago said. “It's incalculable the number of institutions he co-opted.”

Over time, authorities said, those relationships helped Marín emerge as a key money launderer to remnants of the defunct Cali cartel.

In that role, they said, contraband he smuggled would end up converted into pesos at Colombia's ubiquitous “San Andresitos”: informal shopping areas packed full of budget-priced electronics and appliances. The name is a play on the Colombian island of San Andres, a duty-free zone in the Caribbean.

That sophisticated system was starting to draw scrutiny from law enforcement when Marín befriended an impressionable, up-and-coming DEA agent.

Special Agent José Irizarry — a former air marshal from Puerto Rico hired by the DEA in 2009 despite failing a polygraph — landed a coveted overseas post in Cartagena, Colombia, in part because he was bilingual. He met Marín in 2011, not long after the head of Colombia's police publicly identified Marín as a major smuggler.

The DEA's elite Special Operations Division also had pegged Marín as a major player. The agency even sought to classify him as a so-called Consolidated Priority Target, reserved for the most prolific drug traffickers and money launderers, according to hundreds of pages of Justice Department reports obtained by the AP. The investigative records, which include FBI interview notes, internal DEA memos and private text messages among agents, show Marín had been on the radar of at least five federal law enforcement agencies by the time Irizarry was charged.

But Irizarry believed Marín could be more valuable as an informant. “Marín would come over and they would play cards and have girls over,” according to an investigative IRS report. The meetings in Colombia were the first of many that would flout DEA rules forbidding agents from socializing with informants.

Soon, the government records show, Marín tried to compromise the DEA, showering Irizarry with expensive Hublot watches, luxury cars and a $750,000 condo.

Instead of providing Irizarry with intelligence, Marín gave him a Tiffany ring for his Colombian wife, as well as $5,000 in cash so the agent could buy a gift for his mistress. One internal government record said Marín “viewed Irizarry like a son.”

Irizarry began protecting Marín and his organization, signing him up as an informant in 2013. “He would pay me,” Irizarry told the AP, “and if he ever needed me, he had me.”

Irizarry helped Marín expand his empire, the government records show, by steering undercover DEA wire transfers to his associates, providing safe passage for containers full of contraband and even seeking to throw off other federal agencies.

Once, the records show, Irizarry told a suspicious federal investigator that “people make up stories about Marín,” calling him an “open book.”

Irizarry avoided suspicion in part by exploiting a powerful Justice Department tool that long lacked proper oversight.

That tool, known as an Attorney General Exempt Operation, or AGEO, gives DEA authority to launder money on behalf of cartels with the goal of carrying out major seizures and arrests. Like actual money launderers, the DEA charges hefty commissions for the transactions — money that agents can spend more freely than government funds.

The DEA has long refused to discuss the stings, which involve setting up front companies, buying property and making wire transfers on behalf of cartels. But internal records show the number of such money laundering operations ballooned at one point to 53 around the country.

In 2011, Irizarry and other agents launched an AGEO to target Marín. In a memo spelling out the operation, they wrote to top Justice Department officials that they hoped to strike “a devastating blow” against Marín, whom they described as a “primary launderer” and investor in cocaine shipments leaving Colombia. They gave the operation a now-ironic name: White Wash.

Marín, however, was only a target on paper. And two years later, Irizarry and his Miami-based colleagues quietly converted him to an informant, a process that typically involves careful vetting and supervisory sign-off.

All the while, income generated by White Wash allowed Irizarry and other agents to party around the world with Marín in what the agents described as a blur of booze, drugs, prostitutes and high-end dining.

“It was a very fun game that we were playing,” Irizarry said.

The debauchery also included tickets to premier tennis and soccer matches in Spain, Caribbean cruises on a yacht seized from drug traffickers and lap dances at a strip club in the Dominican Republic paid for by a hitman nicknamed Iguana. The same “sicario,” Irizarry told authorities, boasted of killing 15 people on Marín's behalf.

The atmosphere was captured in a 42-second video clip obtained by the AP in which Marín can be seen lording over booze-filled revelry at a Madrid restaurant.

“It's your birthday, bro,” an agent shouts to a colleague as a cellphone camera pans the private salon and a reggaeton beat livens the mood.

Also captured on camera is a longtime DEA informant who was charged last year in Texas with failing to pay taxes on more than $3.8 million in snitch money.

The clip was shot in April 2018, at the apex of Marín's power, when he had even become the godfather of Irizarry's twins.  

The agents running White Wash ultimately claimed that the operation generated 125 arrests and the seizure of $107 million in assets and nearly 9 tons of cocaine. However, a 216-page DEA audit in 2020 found White Wash's statistics were wildly inflated, and a memo prepared for then-DEA Administrator Anne Milgram described the operation as a “mirage.”

For instance, a large chunk of the operation's total seized assets — some $30 million — was attributed to two stolen Van Gogh paintings recovered by Italian investigators in the villa of notorious drug trafficker Raffaele Imperiale. In the end, the audit attributed just five convictions to White Wash.

White Wash seized only $1.3 million in illicit funds — a little more than the $900,000 tab DEA agents racked up in travel, according to the audit. Paid DEA informants helped hide much of the partying, as agents would falsely book unneeded hotel rooms and charge alcohol and dinners to them.

To this day, the U.S. government is unable to account for another $19 million in DEA-laundered funds tied to White Wash.

After so many years with so little oversight, Irizarry grew overconfident. 

In 2016, he tried to block authorities in Colombia from seizing a container of Marín's that was later revealed to contain $3 million in contraband liquor, cigarettes and clothing. Irizarry falsely told U.S. customs officials the shipment was part of an undercover DEA operation, the government records show.

Within days, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia kicked him out of the country. Irizarry was indicted in 2020 and pleaded guilty to 19 counts of money laundering. He's now serving a more than 12-year federal sentence. None of his colleagues was charged, but more than a dozen were either disciplined or investigated.

“I messed up,” Irizarry told the AP. “The indictment paints a picture of me, the corrupt agent that did this entire scheme. But it doesn't talk about the rest of DEA. I wasn't the mastermind.”

Marín's good fortune also appears to have run out. Last year, he was arrested in Spain on a Colombian warrant over bribes he allegedly paid to three public officials to provide safe passage for dozens of containers arriving each week, some of them from China. After being released on bail, he fled to Portugal, where he was rearrested and is seeking asylum.

The allegations tying him to Petro, the Colombian president, recall some of the darkest episodes of that country's long fight against cocaine and corruption. The money he's accused of giving Petro's 2022 presidential campaign was received by a close aide, though the president has said he later ordered it returned.

“I know how hard Marín fought to get to me,” Petro said on X in February, “thinking I was like the others.”

FREEDOM, Maine (AP) — Heather Donahue is walking through the woods once again. The star of the successful low-budget horror movie “ The Blair Witch Project ” has an on-screen history of getting into scary situations in a forest.

But this time she is merely picking up an old soda can someone carelessly left on a trail. And she wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

“For me, reading fairy tales, I always wanted to live in the forest,” said Donahue, 51, who moved on from acting long ago and now lives in rural Maine. “It is absolutely as magical as it seemed in those storybooks.”

But the last several months of Donahue's time in the Maine woods have been anything but magical, or peaceful. 

In a twist of fate harkening back to her movie career, Donahue has been embroiled in a spat with locals in her tiny, 700-resident town of Freedom that hinges on her marking trees with the kind of orange blazes that help people find their way in the dense forests.

Donahue had been a member of the town's governing body, its Select Board, but lost a recall election recently after a controversy about whether a rural road that cuts through the woods is public or private. The matter remains unresolved, with the town and abutting landowners fighting it out in court.




The road in question is Beaver Ridge Road, a narrow, partially hilly stretch flanked by wild plants and songbirds that goes from paved to gravel to dirt as it stretches deeper into the forest. Several abutters of the road say the unimproved section is private and to use it for activities such as all-terrain vehicle riding constitutes trespassing. Donahue, and the town itself, hold that the entire road is public.

Donahue painted the orange blazes using historical maps to show what she holds is the center of a public easement. Abutting property owners were incensed and the first successful recall petition drive in the town's 212-year history followed. Donahue was removed in April and an election to pick her successor is planned for next month.

Tyler Hadyniak, one of the abutting property owners, said the recall wasn't just about the orange blazes or the woodland trail. He said it addressed a pattern of behavior by Donahue that chafed longer-established residents in the year since she took office.

“I was relieved that the recall was successful. I thought Heather's demeanor and behavior toward others was just unbecoming of a town official,” Hadyniak said.

Donahue, who is originally from Pennsylvania and has spent long stretches of time living in California and traveling abroad, said she is aware of her status as what she called “a lady from away.” 

She arrived in Maine after a winding journey in which she struggled with alcoholism, left acting, became a medical marijuana farmer and wrote a memoir.

Donahue said she came to the Pine Tree State eight years ago, overcame her addiction and bought land in Freedom in 2020. Recently, she has worked as a life coach and shared her passions for gardening and medicinal plants with anyone who will listen.

She isn't especially interested in reliving the glory of starring in “The Blair Witch Project,” which was released in 1999 and is one of the most successful independent movies of all time. The film sparked a resurgence of interest in “found footage” style horror movies, wowed critics and polarized audiences with its homespun take on terror. It also led Donahue to years of legal wrangling over compensation and the right to her likeness.

Donahue makes occasional tongue-in-cheek references to the movie in passing, but also said it struck her several years ago that her life was inseparable from the film in ways that weren't entirely comfortable: “I had this really difficult moment of realizing my obituary was written for me when I was 25.”

Ordinarily, the hottest gossip in Freedom concerns the peskiness of the local blackflies or the quality of the fishing on Sandy Pond. But the row over the road has become the talk of the sleepy town some 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of the state capital of Augusta. 

Donahue has defenders in town, including Bob Kanzler, who served on a local roads committee and agrees the disputed path is public.

“Heather has done a wonderful job in researching these discontinued roads in town,” Kanzler said. “I know the road is public.”

Despite the ongoing battle over the road, Donahue said she has found peace in Maine. And she's not going anywhere.

“I mean, this is where humans flourish,” she said of the Freedom woods. “I've figured out a way to do a lot with very little. That was all kind of centered around being able to walk in the woods.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans. 

Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.

At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February. 

“There's so much confusion, they've made it very complicated,” said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center. 

At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.

If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions. 

Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.

The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.




Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10. 

Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan. 

Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.

Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.

To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.

Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. 

The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.

“We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,” Abrams said.

While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.

The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.

The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.

It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.

Nothing has changed yet. 

President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in “improper” activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.

Borrowers enrolled in PSLF should keep up with payments to make progress toward loan forgiveness, said Sarah Austin, policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

“There could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,” said Austin. 

An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments. 

Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.

Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times. 

“We've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,” Abrams said. 

If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences. 

“If you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,” said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.

Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.

Wood recommends contacting your servicer to ask for options, which can include forbearance, deferment or applying for an income-driven repayment plan. 

The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.

Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.

Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.

The Fresh Start program was a one-time temporary program that helped borrowers get out of default. This program ended Aug. 31, 2024.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A shooting inside a Las Vegas athletic club has killed two people including the suspect with at least four injured. Officials say that gunfire erupted Friday afternoon inside the gym and three people who were injured were transported to local hospitals, with one in critical condition. A spokesperson with the police department said in a press conference there is no longer a threat to the public.

Williams and his father, Carl, asked attorneys to find a workaround to the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, explored signing in the United Football League and considered ripping the city of Chicago and the team to create a controversy, according to ""American Kings: A Biography of the Quarterback.""

Still, the Bears selected Williams with the No. 1 overall pick and he played only 12 games under Matt Eberflus before the coach was fired. Now, Williams will get to play under Ben Johnson.

Esiason talked about the book's details on his WFAN morning show in New York.

""The level of entitlement is breathtaking. It's no wonder why he failed initially, and it's no wonder why the coach got fired. So now they go out and get an offensive coach in Ben Johnson. 

""So you know what? Now it's on his a--. It's going to be on his a-- to live up to these so-called lofty expectations that he has for himself and that his father has for his son. I understand that there could be a discussion, ‘Hey, this is where quarterbacks go to die.' Well, go fix it. Be the reason that the team is going to turn it around, and you be the player that you think you are.""

CALEB WILLIAMS TRIED TO AVOID GETTING DRAFTED BY BEARS AND CONSIDERED UFL STINT, BOOK SAYS

Esiason said he would tell Williams to just ""keep your mouth shut, you're going into the greatest league that there's ever been for the sport that we all love, you're gonna have a chance one day to make $500 million, because guys like me and guys before me all went on strike so you could actually make more money.""

""Keep your pie-hole shut, and go out and play football and earn your keep and earn your respect.""

Williams, nor the Bears, have commented on the book's details.

Williams said at the time of Johnson's hiring that he was ""extremely excited"" about it.

""Then once I got off the phone, I was driving on the highway, and I don't know if it was safe or not, but I gave a loud yell and scream of just excitement,"" Williams said. ""It brings a bunch of clarity to the offseason. It brings a bunch of different things to the offseason. I'm really excited about the Bears and being able to make this happen. And keep Ben Johnson as our coach for a long time.""

'The Beltway Brief' author Christopher Bedford unpacks the audio of former President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

When asked by special counsel Robert Hur's co-counsel, Marc Krickbaum, in 2023 about a handwritten memo on Afghanistan during the Obama administration, President Joe Biden said he didn't ""remember"" telling Mark Zwonitzer, the ghostwriter of his book, ""Promise Me, Dad,"" he ""just found all the classified stuff downstairs.""

In a new audio file released by Axios Friday, Biden said ""I don't remember"" numerous times as Krickbaum questioned him on the second day of interviews in October 2023 about having classified documents he should not have had after leaving office.

""You said to Mark, ‘I just found all the classified stuff downstairs,' and, so, you can imagine we are curious what you meant when you said, ‘I just found all the classified stuff downstairs,'"" Krickbaum said.

BIDEN STRUGGLES WITH WORDS, KEY MEMORIES IN LEAKED AUDIO FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR INTERVIEW

""I don't remember,"" Biden replied. ""And I'm not supposed to speculate, right?""

""Correct,"" Biden's attorney, Bob Bauer, chimed in.

""So, OK, well, I don't remember, and it may have been — I just don't remember,"" the former president mumbled.

BIDEN'S TEAM HID THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS HEALTH ALL ALONG: WH PRESS SEC

After explaining that he was referring to a conversation with Zwonitzer about a handwritten memo he wrote for former President Barack Obama, Biden replied, ""I probably did. I don't remember specifically, but my guess is I may have done that.""

Then, leading to the ""classified stuff downstairs"" comment, Zwonitzer asked Biden if he had found any documents in his home or if he told Zwonitzer about finding any while they worked together on the book in 2017.

Stumbling over his words, Biden replied, ""No, the only thing I can remember is I wanted to be clear to him that I didn't want what he just heard me say about the memo to Barack, even though it wasn't a top secret thing (indiscernible), I didn't, I didn't want any of that mentioned. It was confidential.""

He clarified he didn't mean confidential in the classification sense, but that he did not want it included in the book about his son, Beau.

They discussed boxes in the library, hallway and the ""back of the garage,"" with Biden noting he did not know ""where in the hell"" all of it was going, but that was the extent of his knowledge of what they contained.

""Not like I'm looking for something, like I'm trying to compile things. But just what'd they pack up, what's here,"" Biden said.

BIDEN ADMIN OFFICIALS NOTICED STAMINA ISSUES IN PRESIDENT'S FIRST FEW MONTHS IN OFFICE: REPORT

While the White House released the transcripts during his presidency, the audio of the interviews remained under wraps, with some speculating about his mental state as the reason.

Hur's investigation, which concluded in 2024, found Biden should not be criminally charged for mishandling and retaining classified documents that detailed military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and other countries, among other national security topics.

After Hur described the former president as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,"" Biden fired back, saying, ""I'm well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president. I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation.""

Antonio Brown appeared to be involved in an incident in Miami on Friday night and was spotted in handcuffs being led to the back of a cruiser after the dust settled.

Several videos on social media showed Brown getting into a fight with multiple people following the matches at an Adin Ross boxing event. The popular streamer hosted a 10-match card, which was sponsored by Stake, Kick and Brand Risk Promotions.

In one of the videos, Brown appeared to be fighting in a parking lot. The crowd moved toward one alley when a possible gunshot was heard, and they started to run in the opposite direction. A subsequent video saw Brown in handcuffs with police officers.

A City of Miami Police Department spokesman told Fox News Digital that Miami Police received an alert of shots fired at around 3 a.m. ET on Saturday.

Police initiated an investigation and no arrests were made and no one was injured, the spokesman said. The investigation was ongoing.

Brown appeared in one of Ross' live-streams later in the night but didn't comment on what exactly led to the fight.

""There ain't no story time,"" he said in the video.

He praised the boxer Oblivion over Slim Jxmmi for winning his fight. Fox News Digital reached out to Brand Risk Promotions for comment.

""Yeah I got CTE, I blacked out,"" Brown said. ""I blacked out, Adin. I don't know what happened.""

Brown admitted that he had ""slammed"" one person's security guard. He said he had told one of the officers that he hadn't done anything.

The former NFL star has had multiple legal issues in the past. He was sued in 2019 over allegations of rape and sexual misconduct, which he eventually settled with his accuser. He pleaded no contest to felony battery and burglary charges in June 2020. Brown was then arrested in 2023 over allegations of unpaid child support.

Leaked audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur was published Friday.  

Former President Joe Biden early last year dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report that sparked additional concern about his mental acuity, just months after he was interviewed about his mishandling of classified documents.

Axios on Friday released audio from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur. In the recordings, Biden seemed to struggle to remember when his son Beau died, when he left office as vice president, what year President Donald Trump was elected to his first term, or why he had classified documents that should not have been in his possession.

The recordings not only showed Biden's memory lapses, but also slurring his words and muttering when speaking to Hur. Transcripts of the interviews — conducted on Oct. 8 and 9 of 2023 — were released on March 12, 2024.

In February 2024, Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy was the first to question Biden about Hur's report on his mental fitness.

""Something the special counsel said in his report is that one of the reasons you were not charged is because, in his description, you are a ‘well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,'"" Doocy said to Biden at a press conference on Feb. 8, 2024.

Biden responded: ""I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president and I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation—""

Doocy then asked Biden how bad his memory was and if he could continue as president.

""My memory is so bad I let you speak,"" Biden told him.

Hur, who was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Biden's handling of classified documents, said he declined to bring charges against him, in part, because a jury would find him to be a ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,"" despite the acknowledgment that the documents were ""willfully"" obtained by Biden during his time as vice president and as a senator.

The special counsel's report, in addition to gaffes seen during Biden's public appearances, amplified pressure from Republicans who said he lacked the mental fitness needed to serve as president.

Democrats and Biden's White House initially criticized Hur for his report, repeatedly insisting he was ""sharp"" and that the special counsel was politically motivated.

Later in 2024, amid Biden's re-election campaign, Democrats called on him to drop his candidacy over his performance in the June presidential debate against Trump, citing his age and mental acuity. Biden, now 82, ended his presidential campaign in July but finished his term, and his vice president, Kamala Harris, was defeated by Trump in November's general election.

Veteran Democratic Party strategist James Carville warned Democrats that they need to ditch jargon that confuses or even offends persuadable voters.

Despite a flurry of polling so far this year indicating the Democratic Party's favorability sinking to record lows, veteran Democratic strategist and pundit James Carville remains optimistic, as he points to recent ballot box victories by his party.

""You can't discount people winning elections,"" Carville told Fox News Digital this week.

Carville spoke the day after a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was the latest to spell trouble for the Democratic Party, six months after they suffered setbacks up and down the ballot at the hands of now-President Donald Trump and Republicans.

The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.

ON THE RISE: NEW POLL INDICATES TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATINGS EDGING UP

According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic. The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING

Since Trump's return to power earlier this year, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans, but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump.

And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit historic lows in several recent surveys.

The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21.

 (Fox News )

That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower than that of the GOP, which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.

The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.

The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey — 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable — conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.

And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and in March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.

Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month.

The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.

And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived.

""I don't doubt any of that's true,"" Carville told Fox News. ""But there's one thing: We're winning elections left and right as we're talking about how the Democratic number or image is low.""

John Ewing, Jr., a Democrat, this week ousted a longtime Republican mayor in Omaha, Nebraska, a blue dot in a reliably red state. Ewing will become Omaha's first Black mayor.

Last month, the Democrat-aligned candidate comfortably defeated the Republican-aligned candidate in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election. The high-profile and expensive campaign grabbed plenty of national attention and outside money.

Democrats have also performed very well so far this year in special elections, including flipping red state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania.

In addition to looking back, Carville also pointed ahead to November's gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Democrats hope to win back the governor's office in Richmond.

""Let's see what's going to happen in Virginia,"" said Carville, who first grabbed national attention for his work as a lead strategist on former President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign.

And Carville predicted that ""we're going to win that.""

WNBA star Sophie Cunningham spoke to Fox News Digital about her offseason trade to the Indiana Fever and her hopes for the upcoming season.  

Paige Bueckers made her WNBA debut on Friday.

The former UConn Huskies star had 10 points on 3-of-10 from the field with seven rebounds and two assists against the Minnesota Lynx. However, the Dallas Wings fell short in their first game of the season, 99-84.

Bueckers suggested she had a sigh of relief after her first-career game was finished.

""The first one's always the hardest, usually,"" Bueckers said. ""Not to say that it won't get harder, but just being able to have a starting point and continuing to build off that. And then there's no more questions about what is it going to be like for your first WNBA game. Now you have (to) move on past that.""

Wings head coach Chris Koclanes spoke glowingly of Bueckers and said the rookie was able to handle the hype and pressure that will come with her first season in the W.

""She's been fantastic. She's special in how she's able to handle things with such grace,"" Koclanes said. ""As a team, like really preaching, lots of attention to evolving our mental game and just dealing with everything else, all the outside expectations, the outside noise, and really trying to expose them and give them all sorts of different ways to stay present.

Arike Ogunbowale had 16 points to lead the Wings. Newcomer DiJonai Carrington had 15 points in her Dallas debut.

Secret Service agents questioned former FBI Director James Comey at a Washington field office on Friday about a social media post he made that sparked concerns that it called for violence against President Donald Trump. 

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the interview on Friday, saying: “Today, federal agents from Secret Service inter disgraced former FBI Director Comey regarding a social media post calling for the assassination of President Trump. I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of @POTUS Trump. This is an ongoing investigation.”

Comey posted a picture on Instagram of the numbers “8647” spelled out in the sand with seashells. The term “86” is defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as “get rid of” or “throw out,” and “47” refers to Trump being the 47th president of the United States. 

Comey later deleted the picture, which he thought was a “political message,” saying he didn't realize it could be interpreted as a call to violence. 

“I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence,” Comey wrote on Instagram. “It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” 

However, Trump shared on Fox News that Comey knew the message meant assassination. 

“He knew exactly what that meant,” Trump said. “A child knows what that meant. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant. That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear.”

Comey's post received staunch opposition from Republicans on social media, especially because Trump has already faced two assassination attempts. 

WHAT DOES ‘86' MEAN? 

“The Secret Service vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees,” a Secret Service spokesperson told the Washington Examiner earlier on Friday. “We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously.”

Republicans could be making a mistake in downplaying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) effectiveness as one of the Democratic Party's top political leaders. 

Several polls and the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour across the country have cemented the congresswoman's status as a dominant force in Democratic politics in recent months.

While the GOP has acknowledged Ocasio-Cortez's prominence, it has often suggested she poses little threat to the MAGA movement's momentum. Republicans have perceived her as a naive socialist pushing utopian ideas rather than a woman who could fuel the Democratic Party's comeback.

But political experts said holding to that narrative and underestimating her capabilities could prove fatal for Republicans.

Ocasio-Cortez has many of the traits that Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, used to their advantage during the 2024 elections. 

Those qualities include singular charisma and dynamic presentation skills that political experts said are comparable to Trump, the master communicator himself. They are combined with an impressive social media strategy designed to reach a wide swath of the electorate, particularly young people, a critical voting bloc that has been flocking to Republicans. 

“I think one of the reasons Trump has been able to break through is people see him as authentic. He says what he says, what he thinks, off the cuff, and people appreciate that — right or wrong about his policy. And to a certain extent, you can say the same about AOC,” said Annelise Russell, a professor and expert on the intersection of social media and political institutions at the Martin School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Kentucky.

“She seems very natural. She goes on Instagram Live, and she goes on Twitch, and she meets young people, in particular, where they are, in a way that a lot of her Democratic colleagues and Republican colleagues are not,” added Maggie Macdonald, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky.

Ocasio-Cortez's initial rise to power in 2019 saw her branded as the darling of progressive Democrats, and she painted herself proudly as a socialist who praised Green New Deal policies. But in recent years, she has made a critical messaging shift that could make Republicans' attacks on her as a dangerous radical fall on deaf ears. 

“It is possible that those sorts of attacks will put people off against the people making the attacks, rather than her,” Macdonald told the Washington Examiner. “She seems fine, like she doesn't seem like the devil or anything.” 

“I think her own party and the Republicans don't really know how to deal with her, how to effectively critique her, because she is just nimbler than they are, particularly online,” she added. 

Ocasio-Cortez's positions on key issues may not have changed, but she has become more focused on promoting workers instead of pushing controversial ideological stances. That's the same populist-style appeal that Trump used with spectacular results when he led the GOP in the 2024 elections.

“For AOC, as for Trump, they have managed to be successful by adopting populist approaches and an outsider perspective that is resonating with the public right now, at a time when people are so frustrated with politics and with politicians on both sides of the aisle,” said Dr. Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University. “I do see some parallels there. You know, they both started off as outsiders, toppling establishment figures within their respective parties, and that emboldens them.”

Jake Dilemani, a political strategist with Mercury Public Affairs, also explained the two “semi-similarities” between the two political figures in comments to the Washington Examiner. 

“One being their ability to kind of cut through the middleman of communication and go right to voters right through social media, predominantly. And secondly, they are both other populists, though on different sides of that spectrum, right?” he said. “And so I think voters are also drawn to that.”

But the GOP appears to be obsessed with targeting the Ocasio-Cortez of 2019. Experts warned that this tactic ignores the political reality that the Ocasio-Cortez of 2025 is waging a campaign that mirrors aspects of Trump's populist-style winning strategy.

“For Republicans to portray her as some sort of, you know, neophyte, or, you know, the caricature of a lightweight progressive politician, is, I think, not smart on their behalf,” Dilemani said. “There has been a shift somewhat in her politics … which is to say she has made a concerted effort to build better relationships with the mainstream of the Democratic Party leadership over the last year or so.” 

He argued that Ocasio-Cortez saw “the writing on the wall” when progressive Democrats in the House, such as former Reps. Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman, lost their bids for reelection last year. 

Dilemani suggested that while Republicans “would love to be able to hang around her neck some of the, frankly, worst elements of the far-left political positions” and are “salivating” for her to be the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party, Ocasio-Cortez may have outwitted them with her political shifts. 

“She is a very astute politician,” he concluded. 

Though she is increasingly viewed as a possible Democratic presidential candidate, the congresswoman has sidestepped questions about her future.

“This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected,” she said during a Fox News interview last month when pressed about plans for 2028.

Whatever she decides, Republicans are not yet assessing her as someone who could seriously challenge the MAGA movement. 

“Republicans aren't tired of winning, and apparently, Democrats aren't tired of ‘losing,'” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said on Wednesday in response to a new poll that found Ocasio-Cortez gained more support as the “face of the Democratic Party” than any other candidate, which knocked former Vice President Kamala Harris out of first place. 

“I consider congresswoman Cortez to be the leader of the Democratic Party,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA)  added last month. “I think she's the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle.”

Ocasio-Cortez has a “tiny little brain,” Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) mocked during an interview last November. 

However much of a lightweight conservatives might perceive her to be, the New York congresswoman has built a powerful social media presence that makes her a formidable opponent to the GOP, seasoned political strategists said.

“People find her to be an energizing and alluring elected official, given her youth, given her vigor, given her message. She was and is still able to very, very astutely use social media to her benefit,” Dilemani said.

And her presentation comes off as authentic, experts suggested, which lends her particular influence in an arena that often poses a challenge to both parties. 

The struggle was on full display in March when Democratic lawmakers were criticized for appearing inauthentic after posting identical scripted videos to social media. 

“It's kind of a trope that more senior politicians, you know, their staffers will put them in front of a vertical video, and you can tell that they don't really know what's happening, and they're doing it, but they don't really know why, or they're not — they don't feel natural or authentic in that space,” Macdonald said. 

But Ocasio-Cortez, who could be found in 2019 tutoring Democratic House colleagues on using social media, is different, experts said. They describe her as someone who has reached “celebrity” status. Her personal Instagram account has over 9 million followers, compared to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) 39,000, Senate Majority Leader John Thune's (R-SD) 3,000, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries's (D-NY) 68,000, and House Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) 471,000. 

“Her ability to build a reputation with her digital skills and to build digital constituencies is unparalleled. And that isn't to say that no one else can do it, but it matches her reputation. It's conveyed in her voice. It comes across as very authentic,” Russell said. “And in today's digital climate, authenticity is key, and it's one of the reasons she's been able to be so successful.”

It's the same ingredient that proved critical to pulling in votes for Trump in November, strategists argued, and it could fuel similar results for Ocasio-Cortez.

“They have different goals about what they're trying to do, different people. But at the end of the day, they're using the tools that are available to them to make their point. And they're both very good messengers,” Macdonald said. 

‘JD VANCE WILL BE THE NOMINEE IN 2028 – MARK MY WORDS'

Republicans would do well to reevaluate how they should tackle the challenge the congresswoman poses, experts concluded. 

“I think Republicans are underestimating AOC likely at their own peril,” Panagopoulos warned.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

When dozens of refugees from Africa arrived this week at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., they were greeted warmly by a pair of Trump appointees — and shunned by the political Left.

This was not a typical group of refugees from the continent. The color of their skin — white, due to their European ancestry — and the historical racial struggles in their home country of South Africa have helped shift the political battle lines being drawn around their arrival.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February that prioritized the admission of Afrikaners “who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.” Critics complained that the Afrikaners skipped to the front of a line of refugees from other countries who have been waiting years for a chance to be resettled in the United States. They noted that Trump closed the country to virtually all other refugees but cracked open the door for a group of white ones. 

Progressive Democrats insisted there is no evidence that white South Africans have faced any kind of persecution that would qualify them for entry under refugee programs that Democrats have typically pushed to expand.

SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT CALLS REFUGEES ‘COWARDS' AFTER ARRIVAL IN US

Advocates of the Afrikaners say white farmers are facing violent attacks from black South Africans and that the South African government has enacted policies that permit the disenfranchisement of Afrikaners. 

South African government officials, meanwhile, maintain that the violence Afrikaners have experienced isn't racially motivated or limited to white victims but is a reflection of a crime problem the whole country is battling.

“The thing that the Afrikaners are trying to explain is that this isn't just crime. They're being deliberately targeted,” Dr. Wanjiru Njoya, the Walter E. Williams research fellow at the Mises Institute, told the Washington Examiner. “The reason they're being deliberately targeted is because they are Afrikaners.”

The Afrikaners' ancestors arrived in modern-day South Africa in the 1600s, roughly around the time the pilgrims first arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Dutch settled initially in the Cape of Good Hope after the Dutch East India Company in 1652 built a station there where ships could refresh their supplies before sailing around the other side of Africa.

Germans and French Protestants fleeing religious persecution settled in the Cape as well and, together with the Dutch, formed the ethnic group later known as the Afrikaners, who developed a distinct culture and their own language, Afrikaans.

Centuries later, “they are not connected to Europe at all,” Njoya said. 

“Turning them to go back to Europe, which country would they go to?” she said.

That was the solution floated by one Democratic commentator this week, however. 

“The people who are native to that land deserve their rightful land back,” Ashley Allison, a former Obama administration official, said on CNN. 

“If the Afrikaners don't actually like the land, they can leave that country,” Allison added. “They can actually leave and go to where their native land is, which is probably Germany.” A fellow panelist chimed in to suggest their native land is Holland, which is also incorrect.

But whether the current black majority in South Africa is more native to that land is also a matter of debate amid the international attention on the plight of the Afrikaners.

“These are not the people who actually were at the Cape when the Boers arrived in 1652. They, too, are immigrants, from West Africa,” Njoya said. “So even when they say, ‘What about our historical grievances?' Anybody who knows the story of Africa will laugh.”

Still, the legacy of apartheid, a South African system of government that legalized segregation and discrimination against black citizens, has led the country's current government to pursue radical policies that proponents describe as an effort to rebalance the historical scales.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has called the persecution of white South Africans a “false narrative,” signed into law earlier this year a policy that allows the state to seize farmland from private owners without compensation if the government determines that doing so is “just and equitable and in the public interest.” The concept, known as expropriation, could be taken even further if the South African government passes another bill under consideration. The Equitable Access to Land Bill, proposed in February, would require all South African landowners to register their race with the government so that race could be used as a factor in land redistribution programs.

Another law, known as the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, requires white business owners to transfer partial ownership of their companies to black people in order to access many economic opportunities.

“It's not that the government is doing anything illegal. They've actually passed laws allowing them to persecute the Afrikaners,” Njoya said.

Afrikaners say they also fear becoming the victims of violent attacks that the government refuses to recognize. South African officials stopped keeping track of “farm attacks,” which became a polarizing term due to its association with white farm owners, in 2007 and now lump those incidents in with general crime data. 

South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. And in some parts of the country, police can take more than an hour to respond to a call about a violent crime in progress.

“It's the murders, it's the being targeted by these people chanting, ‘Kill the Boers,' but it's also these other laws that have been passed to exclude them from the economy,” Njoya said of why Afrikaners are fleeing from their home country.

“Kill the Boers,” an anti-apartheid song often sung or chanted in Zulu, was for years considered illegal hate speech in South Africa. But the country's highest court ruled last year that “Kill the Boers” is no longer considered hate speech. Julius Malema, the leader of one of the country's top political parties, publicly chanted “Kill the Boers,” which the pro-Afrikaner group AfriForum has said incites violent attacks against white farmers, at a public rally in March. 

The roughly 50 Afrikaners who arrived in the U.S. this week on a State Department-chartered flight quickly learned that their race made them a controversial group of refugees in a country that has proudly accepted thousands of other refugees every year.

One of the 10 nonprofit groups that work with the federal government to resettle refugees announced it would rather sever its partnership with the government than help the Afrikaners. The Episcopal Church said its commitment to “racial justice” prevented it from fulfilling its obligations under a federal grant agreement to resettle the white South Africans.

“I don't think I've ever seen, in my 30 years of doing this, an organization reject a specific population to resettle,” Lora Ries, director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation, told the Washington Examiner. “Does racial justice only go in one direction?”

The Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe said this week that he does not believe the Afrikaners have faced genocide or racial discrimination.

“In this case, it seems to be that people who are white seem to be more valuable than those who are people of color,” Rowe told NPR. 

The Biden administration raised refugee caps to 125,000 from the low of 18,000 that Trump had set during the final year of his first term. In fiscal 2024, the Biden administration admitted more than 100,000 refugees, hitting a three-decade high, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.

Not one was from South Africa, however.

Trump suspended refugee admissions when he took office in January. A federal judge in Seattle had ordered the Trump administration to admit 12,000 refugees who had planned to travel to the U.S. prior to Trump's inauguration, but the judge rescinded the order on Friday and said the administration was obligated to admit just 160 of them.

Democrats expressed outrage that the white South Africans were granted refugee status while all other groups were not.

“It's so deeply and morally wrongheaded and repulsive,” Richard Stengel, former undersecretary of state under President Barack Obama, said on MSNBC this week. “These are the descendants of the people who created the most diabolical system of white supremacy in human history, apartheid.”

“It's taking places away from people who are really being crushed by authoritarian governments … for these folks who have never had anything happen to them,” he added.

Ries said the situation the Afrikaners are facing has gone “beyond reparations” and has involved “too many instances of actual violence.”

“It doesn't matter what color skin you are, anyone can be persecuted,” she said. “It's pretty galling to see this church organization, which has made billions of dollars off the federal government, say, ‘We're not going to do it for this white population.' You know, they're judging someone, [a] population, by the color of their skin.”

Audio of former President Joe Biden‘s October 2023 interview with special counsel Robert Hur was leaked Friday, revealing more insight into the ex-president's memory lapses about important information.

During the interview Hur conducted for the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, Biden struggled to remember key dates, including when his son Beau Biden died and when President Donald Trump was first elected, and he trailed off topic when recalling past memories.

The audio recordings were published by Axios on Friday. However, transcripts of the interviews were made public just weeks after Hur's report came out early last year. The audio provides a deeper look into how Biden struggled through his interviews with Hur, in which his lawyers had to assist the then-president in remembering key dates and keeping him on topic.

Biden said his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015, died in 2017 or 2018. He also said that Trump was elected in 2017, but he was corrected by one of his lawyers, who said it was 2016. 

Biden then trailed off as he recounted his memoir, Promise Me, Dad.

Biden's lawyer at one point offered to give him a break, but the then-president refused, saying he wanted to “get it done.”

Biden's spokeswoman Kelly Scully said in a statement to the Washington Examiner that the audio recordings do not relay any new information. 

“The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago,” Scully said. “The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.”

White House director of rapid response Jake Schneider reacted to the leak in a post on X.

“We tried to tell you,” he wrote. “We literally spent years trying to tell you. Please stop acting shocked that Biden was senile, incompetent, and unfit for office.”

Republican lawmakers pressed former Attorney General Merrick Garland to release the audio tapes last year, but every House Democrat voted against it.

The National Republican Congressional Committee slammed Democrats for hiding Biden's condition in an X post.

“Democrats hid the truth from the American people—Biden was unfit to remain President. They must answer for their lock step cover up,” the NRCC posted.

NRCC Deputy Executive Director Jack Pandol said every Democrat who voted against the release of the tapes is “complicit in the cover up of the century” in an X post.

Trump told reporters Friday that he was leaving it up to Attorney General Pam Bondi as to whether the government would release the tapes.

“Look, everybody understands the condition of him,” Trump said. “I know people that are 89, 90, 92, 93 years old and are literally perfect. But Joe was not one of them, and they did a lot of hiding. They were, they were really playing games. And, you know, you can't do that. Our country's at stake.”

ADVISERS PRIVATELY DEBATED BIDEN USING WHEELCHAIR IF HE WON REELECTION: BOOK

Alex Thompson, who co-authored the article on the audio leak, also co-authored the book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again with CNN's Jake Tapper. 

The book, which is scheduled to be released May 20, includes more than 200 conversations with Democrats about how the White House shielded the deterioration of Biden's mental health.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Large metal plates will be placed at key points along the 250th Army celebration parade route to protect the streets of Washington, D.C.

The June 14 parade, which also falls on President Donald Trump's birthday, will include 25 M1 Abrams main battle tanks rolling through the capital. The inclusion of the tanks, which weigh about 66.8 metric tons, has raised concerns about their impact on D.C. streets.

District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the parade organizers should have to cover the cost of any repairs needed as a result of the tanks. The metal plates, which weigh hundreds of pounds, were determined to be the best way to prevent damage because they will strategically be placed at points in the route where the tanks will turn. When tanks turn, their metal and rubber tracking can do the most damage, an official told the Associated Press.

The parade will include 6,600 soldiers, some of whom will be dressed in historical costumes representing uniforms worn by soldiers from each conflict dating back to the Revolutionary War. There will also be 150 vehicles, including the M1 Abrams main battle tanks, and 50 helicopters.

“The procession will tell the story of the history of the Army, beginning with the Revolutionary War and concluding with the modern-day Army,” Army spokeswoman Heather Hagan told the Washington Post. 

TRUMP 250TH ANNIVERSARY MILITARY PARADE ESTIMATED TO COST UP TO $45 MILLION

The parade is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, receiving criticism from some Democrats as being wasteful and a boost to Trump's ego, as it falls on his 79th birthday. 

Last month, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced legislation that would prohibit federal dollars from being spent on a military parade “primarily intended to celebrate the birthday, personal milestone, or private interest of any individual, including President Donald J.

The dream of a phone without problems

On a recent commute to work, I texted my distant family about our fantasy baseball league, which was nice because I felt connected to them for a second. Then I switched apps and became enraged by a stupid opinion I saw on X, which I shouldn't be using anymore due to its advanced toxicity and mind-numbing inanity. Many minutes passed before I was able to stop reading the stupid replies to the stupid original post and relax the muscles of my face.



This is the duality of the phone: It connects me to my loved ones, and sometimes I think it's ruining my life. I need it and I want it, but sometimes I hate it and I fear it. Many people have to navigate this problem—and it may be at its worst for parents, who've recently been drowned in media suggesting that smartphones and social media might be harming their children's mental health, but who also want their kids to enjoy technology's benefits and prepare themselves for adult life in a digital age.

Read: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens

It was with this tension in mind that I rode a train last week to the town of Westport, Connecticut. There, a parent-led group called OK to Delay had organized an “Alternative Device Fair” for families who wanted to learn about different kinds of phones that were intentionally limited in their functionality. (There would be no frowning at X with these devices, because most of them block social media.) Similar bazaars have been popping up here and there over the past year, often in the more affluent suburbs of the tristate area. Westport's fair, modeled after an event held last fall in Rye, New York, was set up in a spacious meeting room in the most immaculate and well-appointed public library I've ever seen. When I arrived, about 30 minutes after the start of the four-hour event, it was bustling. The chatter was already at a healthy, partylike level.



The tables set up around the room each showed off a different device. One booth had a Barbie-branded flip phone; another was offering a retro-styled “landline” phone called the Tin Can. But most of the gadgets looked the same—generic, rectangular smartphones. Each one, however, has its own special, restricted app store, and a slew of parental-control features that are significantly more advanced than what would have been available only a few years ago. One parent showed me her notepad, on which she was taking detailed notes about the minute differences among these phones; she planned to share the information with an online group of parents who hadn't been able to come. Another mom told me that she'd be asking each booth attendant how easy it would be for kids to hack the phone system and get around the parent controls—something you can see kids discussing openly on the internet all the time.



A couple of years ago, I explored the “dumb phone” trend, a cultural curiosity about returning to the time before smartphones by eschewing complex devices and purchasing something simpler and deliberately limited. One of the better phones I tried then was the Light Phone II, which I disliked only because it was so tiny that I constantly feared that I would break or lose it. At the library, I chatted with Light Phone's Dan Fox, who was there to show people the latest version of the device. The Light Phone III is larger and thicker and has a camera, but it still uses a black-and-white screen and prohibits web browsing and social-media apps. He told me that it was his third alternative-device event in a week. He'd also been to Ardsley, a village in New York's Westchester County, and to the Upper East Side, in Manhattan. He speculated that kids like the Light Phone because it doesn't require all the rigmarole about filters and settings and parents. It was designed for adults, and therefore seems cool, and was designed in Brooklyn, which makes it seem cooler. (Fox then left early to go to a Kendrick Lamar concert with his colleagues.)

Read: Phones will never be fun again

The crowded room in Westport was reflective of the broad concern about the effect that social media may have on children and teenagers. But it was also a very specific expression of it. Explaining the impetus for hosting the marketplace, Becca Zipkin, a co-founder of the Westport branch of OK to Delay, told me that it has become the standard for kids in the area to receive an iPhone as an elementary-school graduation present. One of her group's goals is to push back on this ritual and create a different culture in their community. “This is not a world in which there are no options,” she said.



The options on display in Westport were more interesting than I'd thought they were going to be. They reflected the tricky balancing act parents face: how to let kids enjoy the benefits of being connected (a chess game, a video call with Grandma, a GPS route to soccer practice, the feeling of autonomy that comes from setting a photo of Olivia Rodrigo as your home-screen background) and protect them from the bad stuff (violent videos, messages from creeps, the urge to endlessly scroll, the ability to see where all of your friends are at any given time and therefore be aware every time you're excluded).



Pinwheel, an Austin-based company, demonstrated one solution with a custom operating system for Android phones such as the Google Pixel that allows parents to receive alerts for “trigger words” received in their kids' texts, and lets them read every message at any time. As with most of the others demonstrated at the fair, Pinwheel's custom app store made it impossible for kids to install social media. During the demo, I saw that Pinwheel also blocked a wide range of other apps, including Spotify—the booth attendant told me and a nearby mom that the app contains “unlimited porn,” a pronouncement that surprised both of us. (According to him, kids put links to porn in playlist descriptions; I don't know if that's true, but Spotify did have a brief problem with porn appearing in a small number of search results last year.) The app for the arts-and-crafts chain Michaels was also blocked, for a similar but less explicit reason: A red label placed on the Michaels app advised that it may contain a loophole that would allow kids to get onto unnamed other platforms. (Michaels didn't respond to my request for comment, and Spotify declined comment.)



Beyond the standard suite of surveillance tools, many of the devices are also outfitted with AI-powered tools that would preemptively censor content on kids' phones: Nudity would be blurred out and trigger an alert sent to a parent, for instance; a kid receiving a text from a friend with a potty mouth would see only a series of asterisks instead of expletives.



“The constant need to be involved in the monitoring of an iPhone is very stressful for parents,” Zipkin told me, referring to the parental controls that Apple offers, which can become the focus of unceasing negotiation and conflict between kids and their guardians. That is part of these alternative devices' marketing. Pinwheel highlights the helping hand of AI on its website: “Instead of relying on parents to manually monitor every digital interaction (because who has time for that?), AI-driven tech is learning behaviors, recognizing risks, and proactively keeping kids safe.”



The story was similar at other tables. Gabb, a Lehi, Utah, company, offers a feature that automatically shuts down video calls and sends notifications to parents if it detects nudity. The AI still needs some work—it can be triggered by, say, a person in a bathing suit or a poster of a man with his shirt off, if they appear in the background of the call. Gabb also has its own music app, which uses AI and human reviewers to identify and block songs with explicit language or adult themes. “Taylor Swift is on here, but not all of Taylor Swift's music,” Lori Morency Kun, a spokesperson for the company, told me.



At the next booth, another Utah-based company, Troomi, was demoing a system that allows parents to set content filters for profanity, discussions of violence, and “suggestive” chitchat, on a sliding scale depending on their kid's age. The demonstrator also showed us how to add custom keywords to the system that would also be blocked, in case a parent feels that the AI tools are not finding everything. (“Block harmful content BEFORE it even has the chance to get to your kiddo!” reads a post on the company's chipper Instagram account.)



Across the room, Bark, an Atlanta-based company that started with a parental-control app and then launched its own smartphone, offered yet another nice-looking slab with similar features. This one sends alerts to parents for 26 possible problems, including signs of depression and indications of cyberbullying. I posed to the booth attendant, Chief Commercial Officer Christian Brucculeri, that a kid might joke 100 times a day about wanting to kill himself without having any real suicidal thoughts, an issue Brucculeri seemed to understand. But false positives are better than missed negatives, he argued. Bark places calls to law enforcement when it receives an alert about a kid threatening to harm themselves or others, he told me, but those alerts are reviewed by a human first. “We're not swatting kids,” he said.



Although everybody at the library was enormously polite, there is apparently hot competition in the alternative-device space. Troomi, for instance, markets itself as a “smarter, safer alternative to Pinwheel.” Pinwheel's website emphasizes that its AI chatbot, PinwheelGPT, is a more useful tool than Troomi's chatbot, Troodi—which Pinwheel argues is emotionally confusing for children, because the bot is anthropomorphized in the form of a cartoon woman. Bark provides pages comparing each of these competitors, unfavorably, with its own offering.



Afterward, Zipkin told me that parents had given her varied feedback on the different devices. Some of them felt that the granular level of monitoring texts for any sign of emotional distress or experimental cursing was over-the-top and invasive. Others were impressed, as she was, with some of the AI features that seem to take a bit of the load off of parents who are tired of constant vigilance. Despite all the negative things she'd personally heard about artificial intelligence, this seemed to her like a way it could be used for good. “Knowing that your kids won't receive harassing or bullying material or sexual images or explicit images, or anything like that, is extremely attractive as a parent,” she told me. “Knowing that there's technology to block that is, I think, amazing.”



Of course, as every parent knows, no system is actually going to block every single dangerous, gross, or hurtful thing that can come in through a phone from the outside world. But that there are now so many alternative-device companies to choose from is evidence of how much people want and are willing to search for something that has so far been unattainable: a phone without any of the bad stuff.

Trump's plan to impose tariffs on movies seized upon the American film industry's existential panic.

Hollywood trade publications often call attention to how the film industry is in danger: If a hotly anticipated movie bombs at the box office, it's evidence of people not going to theaters anymore; if a studio shelves a completed film in exchange for a tax write-off, it's a sign of diminished optimism in cinema both commercially and artistically. But on May 4, President Donald Trump seemed to sound his own alarm when he suddenly announced on Truth Social that he'd be placing a “100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” The reason, according to the post, seemed to be his belief that “the Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death”—and that the growth of filmmaking opportunities abroad is apparently at fault.

Observers couldn't quite tell what the explicit target was—American movies filmed overseas? International films seeking American distribution? Questions also arose as to whether such tariffs could even be enforced, or what form they could take. Despite the confusion, the proclamation still seemed potentially devastating to many: “This is an ‘everyone loses, no one gains' policy,” one producer said of the possible fallout.

Like many a Trump statement made via social media, it was pulled back in fits and starts over the following days. A White House spokesperson said that “no final decisions” had been made on the tariffs. One day later, Trump told reporters, “I'm not looking to hurt the industry; I want to help the industry.” Three days after that, when announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, he clarified that “James Bond has nothing to worry about” and then mused on his personal friendship with the late actor Sean Connery. Those decrying the onset of new injuries to an already hobbled market could relax, at least for a moment. But there is an underlying existential panic that Trump is seizing on: that many of the biggest American films are not being made in America anymore.

Read: The bait and switch of Trump's tariffs

Perhaps that reality is why some of the major industry unions reacted to Trump's post with muted support. “SAG-AFTRA supports efforts to increase movie, television and streaming production in the United States,” the actors' guild said in a statement on May 5. “We look forward to learning more about the specifics of the plan announced by the President and to advancing a dialogue to achieve our common goals.” The below-the-line crew members' union wrote that Trump's plans would need to “do no harm” to the industry's current operations, but it indicated agreement that Hollywood requires buoying. “Foreign governments have successfully lured film and television productions, and the multitude of jobs they create, away from the United States with aggressive tax incentives and subsidies,” the union's statement reads.

Not long after Trump's post, someone else claimed responsibility for its origins: the Oscar-winning actor and Trump supporter Jon Voight, who has been tapped by the president to explore ways to bolster the American film and television industries. The president's tariffs comment was reportedly plucked from a wider list of recommendations drafted by Voight; the actor's business partner, who served as an adviser on the plan, stated that it was “crafted solely for the purpose of discussion.” But the tentative list of solutions does have somewhat concrete recommendations in it, codified after Voight took meetings in Hollywood with unnamed industry figures. Levying tariffs on works created abroad is just one part of the package of ideas, which range from the fanciful to the practical, that he presented to the president.

What people on both sides of the political spectrum have jumped on is the general idea of offering financial support to reinvigorate film production in Hollywood. The longtime focal point of cinema has lost a lot of opportunities to the rest of the world: There are other major American hubs, including in Georgia and New Mexico, but plenty more in regions such as Europe and Australia, where tax incentives are plentiful and labor is often far cheaper. Even if an American movie is made in the U.S., various elements of postproduction, such as visual effects, may still take place outside the country—as with so many other industries, the many forces of globalization can be tough to combat. California Governor Gavin Newsom, hopping on the news cycle, proposed a $7.5 billion federal tax credit to motivate studios to create more work locally, which would be many times larger than anything currently offered at the state level.

In his plan, Voight suggested something along these lines too: a 10 to 20 percent federal rebate that would stack with any existing state credits. On the punitive side, American productions that took advantage of overseas tax breaks would be subject to a tariff “equal to 120% of the value of the foreign incentive.” Voight's outline doesn't specify how those tariffs would be imposed; perhaps the studios would be able to absorb the cost themselves, but if not, it's hard to imagine that they would charge more for certain theatrical releases just because they were filmed in Europe, for example. Voight also proposed that all subsidized projects “meet a minimum threshold AMERICAN ‘Cultural Test,'” an idea borrowed from programs in places such as the U.K. that funnel government money toward domestically made works that benefit the country in some way.

Read: The conversation moviegoers don't need to be having

The U.S. is the world's chief exporter of movies, which rank among the country's most definitive, most abundant global offerings—and it's doubtful that producing them elsewhere is affecting the country's stronghold. Filming locations are rarely considered a matter of national pride, let alone taken into account for nonfinancial reasons. The lack of protectionism, however, could be part of why jobs have slipped away from Los Angeles. And tariffs could potentially encourage studios to film some projects in other, less expensive locales throughout the country, although even those costs, at present, typically exceed those in other nations. But it's also possible that such a plan would make the industry less vigorous. Studios—which are already struggling to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic and multiple strikes in a splintered media landscape—could be disinclined to go forward with certain projects at all, if the costs or penalties seem prohibitively high.

The relevance of other proposals in Voight's package felt less obvious, including a push to restore a now-defunct set of TV-broadcasting regulations. It's unclear why Voight and his team have alighted on that extinct initiative, although—as with the potential tariffs—some industry professionals saw the positives in reintroducing these regulations. And that's the thing about the desire to “make Hollywood great again”: There's no consensus on what the best course of action is to stimulate the film industry. The divergent opinions leave open space for Trump's emissaries to get a hearing and start rocking the boat. But even Voight himself seems to have reconsidered the best way to steer it: On May 11, the actor and several industry union leaders submitted a letter to Trump insisting on the need for tax incentives, not tolls.

The issue of how outsourcing jobs affects the economy is obviously a valid one. It's just that, when it comes to American filmmaking, it's neither novel nor of the greatest consequence to the industry's health; decades have passed since the age of New Hollywood, when it seemed like every production was happening in the L.A. area. Perhaps the more pressing concern, especially to domestic audiences and studios, should be the decline of theatergoing. Instead, Hollywood is busy reckoning with new alarmist proclamations.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A new cadre of officials might deal in evidence more than Robert F. Kennedy Jr. does, but they still question the worth of vaccines.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine activism is not what you'd call subtle. For decades, he has questioned the safety and effectiveness of various childhood vaccines, insisting that some of them cause autism, lying about their ingredients, and dismissing troves of evidence that counter his views. However much he might deny it, Kennedy is “an old-school anti-vaxxer,” Dorit Reiss, an expert in vaccine law at UC Law San Francisco, told me.



When he became the United States' health secretary, Kennedy brought few of his staunchest and oldest allies in the anti-vaccine movement with him. Instead, the Department of Health and Human Services is filling with political appointees whose views of vaccines run less obviously counter to evidence than Kennedy's. But these officials, too, question the safety and usefulness of at least some vaccines, and seek to slow or stop their use.



Among those officials are Marty Makary, the new FDA commissioner, and Tracy Beth Høeg, his new special assistant; Vinay Prasad, the new director of the FDA center that oversees the regulation of vaccines; and Jay Bhattacharya, the new director of the National Institutes of Health. Unlike Kennedy, they hold advanced degrees in science, medicine, or public health, and have published scientific papers—often in direct collaboration with one another. And they have each endorsed at least some vaccines for children, or even pushed back on some of Kennedy's most flagrant vaccine misinformation—criticizing, for instance, his false claims that MMR shots cause autism. When reached for comment by email, Emily Hilliard, HHS's deputy press secretary, described the cohort to me as “credentialed physicians and researchers with long-standing commitments to evidence-based medicine” who “were brought into HHS to restore scientific rigor, transparency, and public trust—not to blindly affirm the status quo.” (Emails to the FDA and the NIH requesting interviews with each of these four officials either went unanswered or redirected me to HHS.)



These new appointees can also be described, more succinctly, as a COVID contrarian who has questioned the worth of vaccines. Their approach to immunization policy is less extreme, more engaged with evidence, and more academic than Kennedy's. And precisely because these officials' perspectives carry a sheen of legitimacy that most of the secretary's usual allies lack, they could be more effective than Kennedy at undermining America's protections against disease.





In sharp contrast to Kennedy, this new cohort—you could call them the neo-anti-vaxxers—are generally established in their respective scientific fields. Makary, for instance, has been hailed for pioneering several surgical procedures; in the 2010s, Prasad, a hematologist-oncologist, gained recognition for his rigorous—albeit acerbic—takes on precision medicine and cancer drugs. And each has acknowledged, in at least some capacity, the lifesaving powers of immunization. When they've argued about vaccines, they've often done so in respected scientific venues, and performed their own analyses of the evidence.



No medical intervention is without risk, and on the broadest level, what these officials are asking for appears to fit the essential tenets of public health: thorough testing of vaccines before they're debuted, and careful scrutiny of each immunization's relative pros and cons. But these officials' past actions show that they haven't always weighed those scales fairly or objectively.

All four of these officials began to publicly coalesce in their view of vaccination in the early months of COVID. None of them had trained as infectious-disease specialists or vaccinologists. But in their public comments, and in several publications, they contended that the virus was far less dangerous than most public-health officials thought, and that the measures that the U.S. was taking against it were far too extreme. They argued against mandates and boosters, especially for children and for young and healthy adults; they exaggerated the side effects of the shots, extolled the benefits of acquiring immunity through infection, and dismissed the notion that people who'd already had COVID should still get shots later on. In October 2020, Bhattacharya and a group of colleagues advocated for reopening society before vaccines had debuted; Makary, although initially supportive of COVID vaccines, went on to praise the Omicron variant of the virus—which at one point killed an average of 2,200 Americans each day—as “nature's vaccine.” Prasad, meanwhile, has said that COVID-vaccine makers should be sued for the rare side effects caught and disclosed with standard monitoring. And Høeg, who'd previously worked with Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, influenced his decision to recommend against the COVID vaccine for healthy children.



Plenty of Americans were reasonably nervous about taking a vaccine developed at record speed, with new technology, under conditions of crisis. But Bhattacharya, Makary, Prasad, and Høeg went further than simply recommending caution; they questioned the legitimacy of the data supporting repeat immunization and at times actively advised against it.



Their criticism of vaccination has transcended COVID. Prasad allows that some vaccines are important but has also questioned the value of RSV vaccines during pregnancy; he's argued that the evidence for annual flu shots is “extremely poor,” and disparaged doctors who consider all vaccines lifesaving. He has suggested that Kennedy randomize different parts of the U.S. to different childhood vaccine schedules, to determine an optimal dosing strategy—an experiment that could keep kids from accessing safe and effective shots in a timely fashion. Høeg, too, has called for an overhaul of how vaccines are tested, approved, and regulated in this country. And she has sharply criticized the American pediatric immunization schedule for including more vaccines than the one in Denmark, where she holds citizenship. Makary, while more tempered in his public comments, has still declined at times to urge parents to vaccinate their children against measles, and downplayed the virus's risks.



As a group, these officials have generally been more sanguine about Kennedy's false claims about vaccines and autism than other researchers have. Bhattacharya, for example, said at his confirmation hearing that he is convinced that vaccines don't cause autism, but added that he wouldn't reject more studies on the issue.



Hilliard, at HHS, wrote that, by interrogating vaccines, these officials are doing only what science requires: “Questioning the quality of data, highlighting the limits of past decisions, or advocating for better trials is not anti-science—it is the gold standard of science.” But truly rigorous science also rests on the foundations of previous data—and a willingness to accept those data, even if they conflict with one's priors. Many of the questions these officials are asking have already been repeatedly asked and answered—and the four of them have been criticized by public-health experts for their tendency to, like Kennedy, ignore reams of evidence that do not support their views. Some of their suggestions for revamping vaccines would also put Americans at unnecessary risk: Asking certain American jurisdictions to delay childhood vaccinations, or perhaps even skip certain shots, could leave entire communities more vulnerable to disease.



Fundamentally, they, like Kennedy, believe that vaccines should generally be more optional for more Americans—a perspective that elides the population-level benefits of widespread immunity against disease. And fundamentally, they, like Kennedy, have argued that vaccines that have passed rigorous tests of safety and efficacy, been successfully administered to hundreds of millions of people, and saved lives around the world are not safe or necessary. If those stances are further codified into policy, they could waste the country's resources on unnecessary testing, produce misleading data, and erode confidence in public health as a whole.



Already, these officials have turned their new powers on COVID vaccines, some of which are still authorized only for emergency use. The FDA has delayed full approval of the Novavax COVID vaccine and is reportedly asking for a new—and very costly and laborious—randomized controlled trial on the shot's effectiveness, even though the shot has already been through those sorts of studies and been safely administered to people for years. The agency could also require all COVID-vaccine makers to submit new effectiveness data for shots updated to include new variants of the virus—essentially treating them as brand-new vaccines and potentially making it nearly impossible, logistically, to produce new formulations of the COVID vaccine each fall. (Experts worry that the agency will apply the same logic to flu vaccines, with the same result.) The FDA could also go as far as revoking emergency-use authorizations, such as the one for pediatric COVID vaccines, which Prasad has said should be stricken from the childhood immunization schedule.



These officials' powers have limits: The CDC (which still doesn't have a permanent director), not the FDA, recommends the childhood immunization schedule. At a meeting last month of the CDC's advisory council on immunization practices, though, Høeg came as the FDA's liaison—an unconventional choice, Jason Schwartz, a vaccine-policy expert at Yale, told me, for a role historically filled by a career scientist from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the FDA center Prasad runs. (After deferring to HHS, the FDA responded to a request for comment by pointing out that Høeg holds the title of “senior clinical science adviser” at CBER—a title she was apparently given after the meeting.) Grace Lee, who previously chaired the committee, told me that the FDA liaison is “not usually an active participant.” And yet, Høeg pointedly questioned the safety and effectiveness of multiple vaccines, including COVID shots—the sort of contribution that could influence the discussion, the ultimate vote, and, potentially, the eventual CDC director's decision to accept the panel's advice, Lee and Schwartz said.



Bhattacharya's sway, too, is likely to expand far past his own agency. Under this administration, the NIH has already canceled grants for hundreds of infectious-disease-focused studies, including dozens that look at vaccine uptake and hesitancy. Now, with Bhattacharya in charge, the agency is leading a $50 million study into the causes of autism, as directed by Kennedy—who already seems set on the answers to that question. When asked in a recent interview with Politico whether mRNA-focused science might be defunded, Bhattacharya said that “many, many people now think that mRNA is a bad platform.” If the U.S. ignores vaccine hesitancy—or if researchers have fewer resources to develop new vaccines—immunization in this country will stall, regardless of who runs the FDA or the CDC.



Modern American politics does still consider some positions to be too anti-vaccine: Trump's original pick for CDC director, Dave Weldon, who has repeatedly promoted the debunked idea of a connection between vaccines and autism, had his nomination withdrawn by the White House in March. Kennedy's own confirmation hearing was contentious, and heavily focused on vaccines; in official press statements and in interviews since then, he has softened some of his stances—acknowledging the protective powers of the MMR shot, for instance—to the point where he has angered his extremist base. Bhattacharya and Makary faced less resistance during their own hearings, during which they both praised the importance of vaccines. The vaccine distortions they've pushed are less blatant than Kennedy's, but also more difficult to combat.



When Kennedy began his new position, some feared he would immediately take a sledgehammer to American vaccines. The moves he and his new team are making have stopped short of obliterating access to shots; they're more about creating new roadblocks, Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the FDA, told me. But even seemingly minor hurdles can mark a substantial philosophical shift: Where HHS once treated the U.S.'s vaccines as well-vetted, lifesaving technologies, it's now casting them as dubious tools with a murky track record, pushed onto the public by companies rife with corruption. By sowing doubt that vaccines can safely protect people, HHS's lesser skeptics will help legitimize Kennedy—until all of their views, fringe as they may have begun, start to feel entirely reasonable.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Many of us spend our teenage years working tirelessly to avoid becoming our parents. But sooner or later, we discover that we didn't stray quite as far as we thought. A few years ago, my colleague Faith Hill spoke with 17 parents who had the same disconcerting experience: They all noticed themselves doing something, big or small, that mimicked what their own parents used to do. “Some were genuinely happy to take after them,” Faith writes. “But most felt at least a little uneasy at the realization: Even people who had relatively happy childhoods, after all, can recall some parental shortcomings. Of course they don't want to replicate them.”

The legacy of one's parents can feel like a prophecy, Faith notes. But we're not all doomed to repeat our parents' mistakes, or destined to inherit their successes. Today's reading list is a guide to taking useful lessons without losing your own way.

This week, Donald Trump returned from the first major foreign trip of his second term. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined last night to discuss what the president's visit to the Middle East reveals about America's place in the world.

The time Trump spent abroad has reinforced an approach to foreign policy that is “malleable” and “not always predictable,” Peter Baker said last night. “He went to the Middle East to re-alter the dynamics by recognizing Syria's new government, announcing that he's going to lift sanctions, and effectively moving closer towards a deal with Iran that sounds an awful lot like the deal he threw out in his first term.”

This, Baker continued, “is a different dynamic than we saw even just a week ago.”

The record drop in drug overdose deaths, briefly explained.

by  Bryan Walsh

In 2020 and 2021, before I came to Vox, I worked as the future correspondent at Axios — yes, that was the actual job title — and I found myself writing almost solely about the Covid-19 pandemic, or major trends that appeared to be driven by the pandemic.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

One of those trends was an alarming rise in drug overdose deaths. The trajectory was already bad before Covid: Between the widespread prescription and misuse of legal opioids and then the introduction of the ultra-powerful drug fentanyl to the illicit drug supply, overdose deaths in the US began taking off in the early 2010s. But the closure of treatment facilities during the pandemic and the isolation of users led to a sudden spike in deaths: In the year leading up to September 2020, as I wrote in April 2021, more than 87,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, a higher total than any 12-month period of the opioid epidemic up to that point. 

After publishing that piece, I received a letter from a reader, who said her son had been one of those 87,000 deaths. She begged me to give this issue more coverage, to remind my readers that behind the Covid pandemic, there was a shadow epidemic of drug deaths, of lost sons and daughters and husbands and wives. People had to stop closing their eyes to the toll of death and pain.

In the years that followed, the toll only continued to grow, however, with deaths reaching 110,000 in 2023. There seemed to be no answer for one of the worst public health crises in a generation. 

But now, at long last, we finally appear to be turning the corner on the drug overdose crisis. 

Provisional figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System released this week show that some 27,000 fewer Americans died of a drug overdose in 2024 than in 2023. That year-on-year drop is the steepest single-year decline since the government first began keeping track of overdose deaths 45 years ago. It means that drug deaths are now finally coming back down to pre-pandemic levels — and that we can make progress on what can seem like the most intractable social ills.

To put that 27,000 drop in deaths into perspective, think of it this way: It adds up to three lives saved every hour for an entire year. 

What's remarkable about the rapid drop in overdose deaths is just how widespread the trend is. Forty-five states recorded declines in deaths, with Ohio and West Virginia — two states that have suffered more than almost any other from the opioid epidemic — leading the way. Only a handful of states, mostly in the Northwest, where the epidemic started later, experienced increases. 

While synthetic opioids, which mostly means fentanyl, are still responsible for the vast majority of overdose deaths, deaths from such drugs are falling faster than any other, declining by 36 percent year over year. 

One of the biggest factors behind the decline is the growing availability of naloxone, an opioid antagonist. If administered in the immediate aftermath of an overdose, naloxone has been shown to be close to 99 percent effective in preventing death. The key is speed — even the fastest emergency medical responders may not make it to the scene in time to save someone suffering an overdose. But recent policies to make naloxone available over the counter, and to advise users to have it on hand, have made it possible to bring back thousands of people who otherwise would have died.

While the pandemic directly led to a significant spike in overdose deaths, policies that came out of Covid have helped curb the toll, including telehealth access to medicine-based treatment options for addiction like buprenorphine. All of these programs have been paid for in part by the billions of dollars in opioid-settlement cash from drug companies like Johnson & Johnson, which began flowing to state and local governments in 2024. Tougher enforcement on fentanyl has played a role as well. 

Lastly — and less positively — the sheer number of overdose deaths in the past few years has depleted the number of people at highest risk. Like an infectious disease epidemic that slows down as it begins to run out of new people to infect, the overdose epidemic burned so hot and killed so many that drug users who were left were less vulnerable to fatal overdoses.

The news isn't all good. While synthetic opioids like fentanyl appear to be in a steep decline, deaths actually rose last year from stimulants like meth and cocaine, with production of the latter surging to new highs. The increase in deaths in a handful of states like Alaska and Washington demonstrates that in some parts of the country, at least, there are still populations that remain highly vulnerable to fatal overdoses.

Most worryingly, the Trump administration's draft budget proposes major cuts to naloxone distribution, which could take the most potent tool for stopping overdose deaths out of the hands of those who need it most. 

Still, we should recognize this new data for what it is — evidence that, with effort, we can reverse the course of one of the biggest public health threats the US faces. Thousands of people are alive today who, if nothing had changed since I was writing about this epidemic in 2021, might have suffered a worse fate. 

Drug addiction is a horrible disease that can destroy futures, families, and lives. But where there is life, there is hope. Every overdose victim brought back by a spray of naloxone has another chance to change their future, and ensure that they won't become another statistic.

The Birthright Citizenship argument wasn't the only significant news out of the Supreme Court on Thursday.

by  Ian Millhiser

The most closely watched news out of the Supreme Court on Thursday was the argument in Trump v. CASA, a case asking whether President Donald Trump has power to cancel many Americans' citizenship. The justices appeared skeptical that Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship is constitutional, but may hand him a temporary victory on a procedural question about whether a single trial judge may block his order nationwide.

Just minutes before that hearing began, however, the Court also handed down an important — and unanimous — decision rebuking a federal appeals court's bizarre approach to police violence cases. That case is known as Barnes v. Felix.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Barnes arose out of what began as a routine traffic stop over “toll violations.” Shortly after Officer Roberto Felix Jr. stopped driver Ashtian Barnes in Houston, Barnes started to drive away while the officer was still standing next to his vehicle. Felix decided to jump onto the moving car, with his feet resting on its doorsill and his head over the car's roof.

After twice shouting, “don't fucking move” while clinging to Barnes's car, Felix fired two shots, killing Barnes.

The ultimate question in this case is whether Felix used excessive force by blindly firing into the car while he was precariously clinging to the side of a moving vehicle. But the Supreme Court did not answer this question. Instead, it sent the case back down to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to reconsider the case under the proper legal rule, in a victory for Barnes's family — albeit one that may not amount to much in the long run.

The Fifth Circuit is the most right-wing appeals court in the federal system, and it is known for handing down slapdash opinions that are later reversed by the Supreme Court. Barnes fits this pattern. 

The admittedly quite vague rule courts are supposed to apply in excessive force cases against police officers requires courts to determine whether the use of force was justified from “the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.” This inquiry, as Justice Elena Kagan explains in the Court's Barnes opinion, requires judges to consider the “totality of the circumstances” that led to a shooting or other use of force.

But the Fifth Circuit applies a different rule, holding that its “‘inquiry is confined to whether the officer' was ‘in danger at the moment of the threat that resulted in [his] use of deadly force.'” This rule requires judges to disregard the events “leading up to the shooting,” and focus exclusively on the moment of the shooting itself.

In a case like Barnes, in other words, the Fifth Circuit told judges to act as if Felix magically found himself transported to the side of a moving vehicle, forced to make a split-second decision about how to extract himself from this situation without being injured or killed. The question of whether it was reasonable for Felix to jump onto the side of a moving car in the first place is irrelevant to the Fifth Circuit's inquiry.

Kagan's opinion holds that this was wrong. “The ‘totality of the circumstances' inquiry into a use of force has no time limit,” she writes, noting that “earlier facts and circumstances may bear on how a reasonable officer would have understood and responded to later ones.”

As Kagan notes, a wider lens will not necessarily favor either police or people who are injured by police. “Prior events may show, for example, why a reasonable officer would have perceived otherwise ambiguous conduct of a suspect as threatening,” she writes, “or instead they may show why such an officer would have perceived the same conduct as innocuous.”

Indeed, Kagan compares this case to Plumhoff v. Rickard (2014), a harrowing case where a suspect led six police cruisers on a high-speed chase that exceeded 100 miles per hour. After the car collided with one of the cruisers and briefly came to a near stop, the driver put the car into reverse and attempted to resume his flight, but the chase ended after police shot him and he crashed into a building.

The Supreme Court held in Plumhoff that the shooting was reasonable, because the driver showed that he was “‘intent on resuming' his getaway and, if allowed to do so, would ‘again pose a deadly threat for others.'” But, under the Fifth Circuit's “moment of the threat” test, it's unclear that Plumhoff would have come down the same way. Judges would only ask whether it was reasonable to shoot someone who was reversing away from a crash after colliding with a police car, without considering the high-speed chase that led up to that crash.

It's also far from clear that the courts will ultimately determine that Felix acted unreasonably in Barnes. Notably, a total of four justices joined a concurring opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which reads like a paean to the peril faced by police during traffic stops. When a suspect flees such a stop, Kavanaugh writes, “every feasible option poses some potential danger to the officer, the driver, or the public at large—and often to all three.”

Still, Barnes wipes away a Fifth Circuit rule that all but ensured absurd results. It makes no sense to evaluate a police officer's use of force — or, for that matter, nearly any allegedly illegal action committed by any person — by divorcing that use of force from its context.

It's more complicated than it should be.

Much of the hearing focused on whether Richard Nixon can save Trump's tariffs.

America's most powerful legal organization confronts Trump's incompetence.

The justices will soon decide whether to weaken the courts holding back Trump.

Whoops! Republicans have somehow managed to violate Bush v. Gore.

We're about to get our first window into whether the judiciary will allow Trump's trade war to continue.

There's not a lot for Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves to smile about these days. 

Labour's vision for Britain “is a work in progress.” That isn't the view of some hostile Tory commentator but of Claire Reynolds, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's political director, no less, and wife of Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.

This searing critique of No. 10's communications was swiftly followed by a newspaper article by Starmer's recent economic guru, Nick Williams, who argued taxes must rise immediately.

Britain is working with the U.S. to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures and that ""confidence-building measures"" and dialogue take place, Foreign Minister David Lammy said on Saturday.

Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the worst fighting in decades between the nuclear-armed South Asian rivals, which erupted last week. A rapid diplomatic effort to broker the ceasefire succeeded on May 10, but diplomats and analysts say it remains fragile.

""We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,"" Lammy told Reuters in Pakistan's capital Islamabad at the end of a two-day visit.

Pakistan and India fired missiles at each other's territory during weeks of tensions after a deadly attack on tourists in the contested region of Kashmir that New Delhi blames on Islamabad. Pakistan denies involvement.

U.S. President Donald Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.

""These are two neighbors with a long history but they are two neighbors that have barely been able to speak to one other over this past period, and we want to ensure that we do not see further escalation and that the ceasefire endures,"" Lammy said.

Asked about India's suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, potentially squeezing Pakistan's water supply, Lammy said: ""We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations.""

Delhi said last month it had ""put in abeyance"" its participation in the 1960 pact, which governs use of the Indus river system, a move Pakistan says it would consider an act of war if it disrupted access to water in the agriculturally dependent nation.

Lammy said Britain would also continue to work with Pakistan on countering ""terrorism, saying that it is ""a terrible blight on this country and its people, and of course on the region.""

Lammy accused Moscow of obfuscating after talks between Ukraine and Russia on a possible ceasefire ended in less than two hours and Trump said ""nothing could happen"" until he had met directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Yet again we are seeing obfuscation on the Russian side and unwillingness to get serious about the enduring peace that is now required in Ukraine,"" Lammy said. ""Once again Russia is not serious.""

""At what point do we say to Putin enough is enough?"" he said.

President Donald Trump blasted Walmart on Saturday after the country's largest retailer warned this week that it will have to raise prices because of tariffs.

""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ""EAT THE TARIFFS,"" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. ""I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!""

Walmart CFO John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday that, ""We have not seen price increases at this magnitude, in the speed in which they're coming at us before, and so it makes for a challenging environment.""

As a retail giant and the largest grocer in the country, Walmart is often seen as a bellwether for the health of retailers and U.S. consumers.

Rainey said he is ""pleased with the progress that's been made by the [Trump] administration on tariffs from the levels that were announced in early April, but they're still too high."" That is despite a 90-day reprieve that lowered duties on Chinese imports to 30%. Goods from dozens of other countries face a 10% duty. Walmart imports electronics and toys from China and produce including avocados and bananas from Central and South America.

He said that the retailer wants to keep its prices lower than competitors, especially at a time when shoppers are seeking discounts. To do that, he said Walmart will absorb some of the tariff-related higher costs and he expects suppliers to absorb some higher costs, too.

Rainey said the company will ""try to work with suppliers to keep prices as low as we can.""

Walmart echoed that sentiment on Saturday when asked to comment on Trump's post.

""We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won't stop,"" Walmart said in a statement. ""We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.""

Walmart joined a growing number of companies that have increased prices or warned that higher prices are coming due to tariffs. Microsoft said earlier this month that it has increased the recommended retail prices of Xbox video game consoles and some controllers.

Barbie maker Mattel announced earlier this month it is moving production out of China, but still expected to have price increases its toys. And Ford warned last week it would have to raise prices on some cars.

Walmart maintained its sales forecast for the year on Thursday, but declined to provide an earnings or operating income forecast for the second fiscal quarter, citing the frequent changes in the Trump administration's tariff policies.

Major U.S. retailers, including Target, Home Depot and Lowe's, are expected to share their own outlooks on the impact of tariffs when they report results next week.

Shares of Walmart ended 2% higher on Friday at $98.24.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the world's richest man, want to make living on Mars a reality. 

Musk has said that his company, SpaceX, can get humans to Mars as early as 2029. Meanwhile, NASA officials have said that sending humans to Mars even by 2040 would be an ""audacious"" goal. China also has ambitions, with the country planning to establish an autonomous Mars research station by 2038.

In Musk's view, going to Mars is tantamount to preserving humanity and escaping the ever-growing threats to Earth, including natural disasters and warfare. For scientists, Mars offers possible answers to questions such as the prevalence and diversity of life in the universe.

""The early Earth and Mars were twins. They were both rocky planets with liquid water, CO2 dominated atmospheres,"" says Robert Zubrin, president of The Mars Society, a nonprofit. ""So if the theory is correct that life originates naturally from chemistry, wherever the right physical and chemical conditions, then it should have appeared on Mars.""

But landing humans on Mars and settling the planet will mean overcoming a number of daunting technical challenges and risks that humans have never before faced. 

""The Mars landing problem is complicated. The transit problem, super complicated. You know, the radiation environment is very severe. The life support problem. The reliability has to be super high,"" said Amit Kshatriya, deputy associate administrator of the Moon to Mars Program at NASA, during a panel discussion in February. ""The propulsion capability is not – you know, we got to get better in all those areas."" 

At the core of Musk's plan to reach Mars is the tallest and most powerful rocket ever built: Starship. In March, SpaceX conducted Starship's eighth test flight. While SpaceX was able to successfully retrieve the Super Heavy booster, the Starship spacecraft exploded, leaving a trail of debris in its wake and disrupting commercial flights. SpaceX's next test flight for Starship is expected soon.

CNBC visited the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah to get a behind-the-scenes look at what life on Mars could be like, and spoke to experts about what challenges remain to landing humans on the red planet. Watch the video to find out more.

Keke Palmer has worn many hats over her career so far: actress, entrepreneur, producer, podcast host, singer, author.

But the 31-year-old spends her money prudently due to her humble upbringing, she says: Living below her means is her top financial habit for having a secure lifestyle.

Palmer now tries to follow their example, she says.

""I learned from my parents very early on because they knew their limitations with money and finances,"" says Palmer. ""I believe in saving and frugality ... I don't play around with that.""

I would sacrifice 20 more years of my life working in this industry so that I can provide and we can have the business we have today.""

Living below your means looks different for everyone. For example, the classic 50-30-20 budgeting rule — 50% of your taxable income for living expenses, 20% for savings and 30% for everything else — is increasingly out of reach for many Americans, CNBC Make It reported in May 2023.

If you can't afford to save 20% of your earnings, start by finding a way to boost your income and minimize your large, fixed expenses, certified financial planner Rachel Camp recommended. That could look like picking up a side hustle, taking on roommates or even rethinking whether you need a car in the city you live in.

Palmer has an additional word of advice for young people, especially young women: ""learn up"" on economics.

That might mean reading personal finance books, taking a course at a local community college, talking to your money-savvy friend or even using ChatGPT to help you create a monthly budget plan.

""Be curious about that kind of stuff, because you don't want to do things based off of survival,"" says Palmer. ""You want to do them out of choice. That's something that my mom and my dad taught me very early on.""

In the two-plus years since generative artificial intelligence took the the world by storm following the public release of ChatGPT, trust has been a perpetual problem.

Hallucinations, bad math and cultural biases have plagued results, reminding users that there's a limit to how much we can rely on AI, at least for now.

Elon Musk's Grok chatbot, created by his startup xAI, showed this week that there's a deeper reason for concern: The AI can be easily manipulated by humans.

Grok on Wednesday began responding to user queries with false claims of ""white genocide"" in South Africa. By late in the day, screenshots were posted across X of similar answers even when the questions had nothing to do with the topic.

After remaining silent on the matter for well over 24 hours, xAI said late Thursday that Grok's strange behavior was caused by an ""unauthorized modification"" to the chat app's so-called system prompts, which help inform the way it behaves and interacts with users. In other words, humans were dictating the AI's response.

The nature of the response, in this case, ties directly to Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa. Musk, who owns xAI in addition to his CEO roles at Tesla and SpaceX, has been promoting the false claim that violence against some South African farmers constitutes ""white genocide,"" a sentiment that President Donald Trump has also expressed.

""I think it is incredibly important because of the content and who leads this company, and the ways in which it suggests or sheds light on kind of the power that these tools have to shape people's thinking and understanding of the world,"" said Deirdre Mulligan, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert in AI governance.

Mulligan characterized the Grok miscue as an ""algorithmic breakdown"" that ""rips apart at the seams"" the supposed neutral nature of large language models. She said there's no reason to see Grok's malfunction as merely an ""exception.""

AI-powered chatbots created by Meta, Google and OpenAI aren't ""packaging up"" information in a neutral way, but are instead passing data through a ""set of filters and values that are built into the system,"" Mulligan said. Grok's breakdown offers a window into how easily any of these systems can be altered to meet an individual or group's agenda.

Representatives from xAI, Google and OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment. Meta declined to comment.

Grok's unsanctioned alteration, xAI said in its statement, violated ""internal policies and core values."" The company said it would take steps to prevent similar disasters and would publish the app's system prompts in order to ""strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.""

It's not the first AI blunder to go viral online. A decade ago, Google's Photo app mislabeled African Americans as gorillas. Last year, Google temporarily paused its Gemini AI image generation feature after admitting it was offering ""inaccuracies"" in historical pictures. And OpenAI's DALL-E image generator was accused by some users of showing signs of bias in 2022, leading the company to announce that it was implementing a new technique so images ""accurately reflect the diversity of the world's population.""

In 2023, 58% of AI decision makers at companies in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. expressed concern over the risk of hallucinations in a generative AI deployment, Forrester found. The survey in September of that year included 258 respondents.

Experts told CNBC that the Grok incident is reminiscent of China's DeepSeek, which became an overnight sensation in the U.S. earlier this year due to the quality of its new model and that it was reportedly built at a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals.

Critics have said that DeepSeek censors topics deemed sensitive to the Chinese government. Like China with DeepSeek, Musk appears to be influencing results based on his political views, they say. 

When xAI debuted Grok in November 2023, Musk said it was meant to have ""a bit of wit,"" ""a rebellious streak"" and to answer the ""spicy questions"" that competitors might dodge. In February, xAI blamed an engineer for changes that suppressed Grok responses to user questions about misinformation, keeping Musk and Trump's names out of replies.

But Grok's recent obsession with ""white genocide"" in South Africa is more extreme.

Petar Tsankov, CEO of AI model auditing firm LatticeFlow AI, said Grok's blowup is more surprising than what we saw with DeepSeek because one would ""kind of expect that there would be some kind of manipulation from China.""

Tsankov, whose company is based in Switzerland, said the industry needs more transparency so users can better understand how companies build and train their models and how that influences behavior. He noted efforts by the EU to require more tech companies to provide transparency as part of broader regulations in the region.

Without a public outcry, ""we will never get to deploy safer models,"" Tsankov said, and it will be ""people who will be paying the price"" for putting their trust in the companies developing them.

Mike Gualtieri, an analyst at Forrester, said the Grok debacle isn't likely to slow user growth for chatbots, or diminish the investments that companies are pouring into the technology. He said users have a certain level of acceptance for these sorts of occurrences.

""Whether it's Grok, ChatGPT or Gemini — everyone expects it now,"" Gualtieri said. ""They've been told how the models hallucinate. There's an expectation this will happen.""

Olivia Gambelin, AI ethicist and author of the book Responsible AI, published last year, said that while this type of activity from Grok may not be surprising, it underscores a fundamental flaw in AI models.

Gambelin said it ""shows it's possible, at least with Grok models, to adjust these general purpose foundational models at will.""

A federal appeals court lifted an order on Friday that blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from stripping hundreds of thousands of federal employees of the ability to unionize and collectively bargain over working conditions.

A 2-1 panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put on hold an injunction a judge issued at the behest of the National Treasury Employees Union that had blocked implementation of an executive order Trump issued in March.

The union and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.

Trump's order exempted more than a dozen federal agencies from obligations to bargain with unions. They include the departments of Justice, State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services.

The union, which represents about 160,000 federal employees, argued the order violates federal workers' labor rights and the Constitution.

But the appeals court's majority said the union had failed to show it would suffer the type of irreparable harm that would justify the preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman on April 25.

U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of Republican President George H.W. Bush, and Justin Walker, whom Trump appointed in his first term, said the injunction, if allowed to remain in effect, would also impede Trump's national-security prerogatives.

Trump relied on a national security exemption to exempt agencies that he said ""have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work.""

""Preserving the President's autonomy under a statute that expressly recognizes his national-security expertise is within the public interest,"" the appeal's court majority wrote.

U.S. Circuit Judge J. Michelle Childs, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, dissented, saying the Trump administration had presented only ""vague assertions"" about potential interference with national security functions to justify its request for a stay of Friedman's decision.

Trump's order affects about 75% of the roughly 1 million federal workers represented by unions, according to court filings. NTEU has said the order applies to about 100,000 of its members.

The executive order significantly expanded an exception from collective bargaining for workers with duties affecting national security, such as certain employees of the CIA and FBI.

The Trump administration has filed separate lawsuits seeking to invalidate existing union contracts covering thousands of workers.

Billions of dollars have flowed into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin BTC$103,236.75 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent weeks, as the cryptocurrency chalked out a sharp recovery rally from $75,000 to $100,000.

Most of the investment is likely driven by bold, strategic bullish directional bets rather than market-neutral arbitrage plays, data analysis suggests.

The 11 spot ETFs drew in $2.97 billion in investor money in April, with an additional $2.64 billion flowing in so far this month, according to data source SoSoValue. That has boosted the net inflow since inception in January 2024 to over $41 billion.

Institutions have historically used these ETFs to set up non-directional arbitrage plays to profit from price discrepancies between futures and spot bitcoin markets. The so-called cash and carry arbitrage involves buying ETFs while simultaneously selling the CME futures to pocket the futures premium while bypassing price direction risks.

But inflows since early April seem driven by bullish directional bets, not arbitrage plays. That's reflected in the Commitment of Traders (COT) report published by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) every week.

The data shows leveraged funds, typically hedge funds and various types of money managers, including registered commodity trading advisors, have trimmed their net shorts to 14,139 contracts from 17,141 contracts in early April, according to data tracked by Tradingster.

The number of shorts would have risen if carry trades had primarily driven the net inflows.

""CFTC data shows leveraged funds didn't significantly increase short positions, indicating most flows were directional bets, not arbitrage,"" Imran Lakha, founder of Options Insight, in a blog post published on Deribit.

The shift in the nature of inflows in the ETFs suggests large players are increasingly using the ETFs to express a clear market outlook on bitcoin's future direction.

Bitcoin last changed hands at $102,700 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.

A 26-year-old man from Alabama has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for his role in a social media hack that briefly sent the price of bitcoin BTC$103,236.75 soaring.



Eric Council Jr. of Huntsville pleaded guilty to charges tied to the January 2024 hack of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's X account, according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release.



Posing as a telecom customer using a fraudulent ID, Council used a SIM-swap technique to hijack a phone number tied to the SEC's account. His co-conspirators then used it to falsely post that the agency had approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a long-awaited regulatory milestone.



Within minutes, the price of bitcoin surged by more than $1,000. It crashed soon after, losing more than $2,000 in value once the post was revealed as fake. The SEC did later that month approve the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs.



Authorities say Council was paid in bitcoin for his role. He will serve 14 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.



Federal prosecutors called the attack a calculated attempt to manipulate financial markets. “The deliberate takeover of a federal agency's official communications platform was a calculated criminal act meant to deceive the public and manipulate financial markets,” said Acting FBI Assistant Director Darren Cox. “By spreading false information to influence the markets, Council attempted to erode public trust and exploit the financial system”

After a strong rally that pushed Ethereum to a local high of $2,730, the asset has retraced over 10%, now testing key support levels as the market cools off. The correction comes after days of heavy buying pressure and growing expectations of a broader altseason. However, the recent pullback has sparked debate among analysts and traders, with sentiment now split between those anticipating another leg up and others preparing for a deeper correction.

Some believe this pause is healthy and necessary before Ethereum resumes its uptrend. Others argue that ETH could retest lower zones, especially if Bitcoin remains range-bound. Top analyst Daan weighed in by highlighting the ETH/BTC pair, pointing out that Ethereum, after its big move up, is now facing resistance around the 0.026 BTC level.

With Ethereum still trading far below its all-time high and caught in a wide macro range, the coming days may prove decisive. Whether this is just a short-term cooldown or the start of a larger correction, Ethereum's current levels will likely dictate the momentum heading into the next phase of the market.

Ethereum Holds Critical Support As ETH/BTC Pair Faces Key Resistance

Ethereum continues to show resilience despite recent volatility, maintaining its position above the $2,400 level. This zone now acts as crucial support, and bulls must defend it to preserve the broader bullish momentum. While price action has cooled slightly following its sharp run to $2,730, ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the market, holding up well amid increased uncertainty and speculative positioning.

Much of the current optimism hinges on Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin. If ETH continues to outperform BTC, analysts believe it could trigger the long-awaited altseason — a market phase where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. Daan shared insights on this dynamic, focusing on the ETH/BTC ratio, which has gained notable strength in recent sessions.

According to Daan, ETH has now run into resistance near the 0.026 level after a sharp rally. For bullish momentum to continue, ETH must hold above 0.0224. A break below this key support could trigger a slow bleed and potentially unwind the entire recent move. On the upside, a clear break above 0.026 would open the door to a move toward 0.03 and beyond.

In short, Ethereum's short-term direction will likely be shaped by its ability to hold $2,400 and maintain strength against Bitcoin. If both conditions are met, the case for a sustained altcoin rally grows significantly stronger.

ETH Pulls Back Into Support After Failing To Break $2,700

Ethereum is currently trading at $2,485, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,730. The chart shows that ETH failed to hold above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,701, which acted as a strong resistance zone. After days of sustained upward momentum, this rejection has pushed the price back toward the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) around $2,438 — a key level that now serves as immediate support.

Volume has remained elevated during this move, suggesting active participation from both bulls and bears. Despite the rejection from the 200 SMA, Ethereum is still holding well above its breakout zone from early May, where the price surged from under $2,000. If bulls can defend the EMA and keep price above $2,400, this could form a higher low and set the stage for another attempt at reclaiming the $2,700–$2,800 area.

However, if ETH loses the $2,400 level, momentum could shift in favor of the bears, potentially triggering a larger correction. For now, Ethereum remains in a consolidation phase within a broader bullish structure. The next few daily closes will be critical to confirm if the pullback is healthy or a signal of deeper weakness.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Undervalued Ether Catching Eye of ETF Buyers as Rally Inbound: CryptoQuant","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/17/undervalued-ether-catching-eye-of-etf-buyers-as-rally-inbound-cryptoquant","Sat, 17 May 2025 07:25:40 GMT","

ETH has quietly slipped into historically rare territory as one market signal shows its deeply undervalued compared to bitcoin (BTC), at a ratio not seen since 2019, a new CryptoQuant report says. 

The signal comes from Ethereum's ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, a gauge of relative valuation that measures market sentiment and historical trading patterns. 

Historically, whenever this indicator has reached similarly low levels, ETH has subsequently delivered significant gains and substantially outperformed BTC.

Investors appear to be taking notice. Demand for the ETH ETF has sharply picked up, with the ETH/BTC ETF holdings ratio rising steeply since late April, according to data from CryptoQuant.

This shift in allocation suggests institutional investors anticipate ETH will outperform BTC, potentially fueled by the recent Pectra upgrade or a more favorable macroeconomic environment.

Already, the ETH/BTC price ratio has rebounded 38% from its weakest level since January 2020, suggesting investors and traders are betting the bottom is in and an ""alt season"" could soon follow.

This echoes what some market participants have been telling CoinDesk.

March Zheng, General Partner of Bizantine Capital, said in a recent message that traders should remember that ETH has typically been the main on-chain altcoin indicator for risk-on, and its sizable upticks generally lead to broader altcoin rallies.

On-chain data further supports this optimism. ETH spot trading volume relative to BTC surged to 0.89 last week, its highest since August 2024, signaling renewed appetite from investors. A similar trend occurred between 2019 and 2021, when ETH went on to outperform BTC by fourfold.

CryptoQuant also notes that ETH exchange deposits, often an indicator of selling pressure, have dropped to their lowest relative level since 2020, implying investors anticipate higher prices ahead.

For now, confirmation hinges on ETH decisively breaking above its key 365-day moving average against BTC.

Still, with compelling undervaluation, rising institutional interest, and diminishing selling pressure, ETH appears positioned for significant upside in the coming months.

But one thing ETH is still lagging on is network activity, as CryptoQuant flagged in a prior report. Without more people using Ethereum, it will be tough for the token's price to lift off and head to the moon.

As the debate about Ethereum (ETH) scaling on L1 level becomes more and more heated, Ethereum (ETH) engineers and researchers proposed a protocol improvement proposal that would allow the blockchain to parallelize transaction execution and block validation.

Ethereum (ETH), the oldest and largest smart contracts network, is to receive completely new scaling workload. With EIP 7928 ""Block-Level Access Lists,"" Ethereum (ETH) will be able to include in blockchain a complete list of all addresses and storage keys accessed during this or that block, along with their post-execution values.

Block-level Access Lists (EIP-7928) could unlock major scaling gains for Ethereum L1 by enabling faster, parallel block validation.In my latest post, I break down the design space, variants, and trade-offs behind this proposal:🔗 https://t.co/t3BdQ8Yq7NTL;DR 👇

Authored by Ethereum (ETH) veterans Toni Wahrstätter, Dankrad Feist, Francesco D`Amato, Jochem Brouwer, Ignacio Hagopian, Yoav Weiss and Alex Forshtat, the new proposal is expected to enable parallel disk reads and parallel transaction validation.

This, in turn, is poised to increase execution efficiency and accelerate block validation, potentially allowing for future gas limit increases.

To achieve this goal, the new EIP introduces three new components to the block body in Ethereum (ETH). Block Access List (BAL) that maps transactions to accessed addresses and storage slots, transaction indices and post-execution values is the key element here.

As explained by Wahrstätter, once approved, EIP 7928 will boost the performance of Ethereum (ETH) validators:

What are Block-level access lists (BALs)? BALs are builder-supplied ""cheat sheets"" that tell validators what each transaction in a block will do—so they can validate faster

L1 scaling comes here with shorter slot times and higher gas limits, the researcher added.

Such EIPs are part of a broader discussion in the Ethereum (ETH) community. While some Ethereans are only betting on L2s as potential ways to scale Ethereum (ETH), their opponents highlight the necessity to focus on L1 enhancements as well.

As covered by U.Today previously, Ethereum (ETH) successfully activated its most ambitious hard fork since Pow-to-PoS migration, Pectra, on May 7.

Bitcoin's market cap is shrinking relative to other popular cryptocurrencies as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to back away from his once-dizzying trade war. But that doesn't mean “altcoin season” is around the corner, according to analysts.

They say that a recent pivot to risk-on assets that has buoyed Ethereum and other altcoins may not last amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, and that investors could favor the safer-haven digital asset if volatility arises again. 

“When markets are focused on macroeconomic instability and risks to the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin's dominance will likely rise,” Zach Pandl, head of research for crypto asset manager Grayscale, told Decrypt. “When markets are focused on all the applications of blockchain technology and the innovation happening in crypto, Bitcoin's dominance will fall.”

As of Saturday, Bitcoin's market cap stood above $2 trillion. Bitcoin dominance markers vary in how many coins they track, but they consistently show BTC at a four-year high compared to either major altcoins or the entire field.

TradingView data shows that among the top 125 cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin represents about 63.5% of that combined market value. Earlier this month, Bitcoin dominance reached 64.89% on that chart, representing its highest level since January 2021. CoinGecko data, by comparison, shows Bitcoin dominance at 60.4% compared to all other tracked coins on the market.

Over the past two weeks, Ethereum's price has surged 36% to around $2,485, outpacing Bitcoin's increase and making a small but noticeable dent in Bitcoin's dominance, along with other altcoins that have also soared more than Bitcoin over this period. 

Ethereum was among digital assets crushed by Trump's initial efforts to reshape global trade, with its price plummeting 45% in the first quarter and slipping below $1,500 in April, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. 

Bitcoin has benefited from its portrayal as a non-sovereign asset like gold, while absorbing the bulk of capital flows into crypto through products like exchange-traded funds—which were approved last year—said Pandl.

During previous market cycles, Bitcoin's dominance has fallen after its price peaks and traders rotate funds into altcoins that are further out on the risk curve—that was once the industry's prevailing mythos, at least. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs could conflict with that dynamic, as products that don't allow investors to reach for an alternative asset on-chain.

Within a range of to nine to 12 months, Bitcoin dominance is more likely to plateau around 60% to 70% of the overall market, as opposed to moving sharply lower, Pandl said. It's a tough call, he added, considering Bitcoin and altcoin have distinct tailwinds that could both be in play.

“We are more or less equally bullish on Bitcoin for macro reasons, and altcoins for technological and adoption related reasons,” he said. “My working assumption is that we plateau from here.”

Juan Leon, senior investment strategist for crypto asset manager Bitwise, told Decrypt that Bitcoin's falling dominance reflects investors' increased risk appetite. Trump's 90-day tariff pause, combined with lower inflation, is easing broader concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, while lifting hopes of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, he said.

Lower interest rates tend to benefit risk assets like stocks and crypto due to cheaper borrowing and increased liquidity. When the Fed slashed borrowing costs last year, crypto prices boomed, although that was before the election of America's first “crypto president.”

Leon's sentiment was echoed by Greg Magadini, director of derivatives for crypto data provider Amberdata, who told Decrypt that the market has been “having a huge rebound in risk-on assets all week, [and] that has been great for altcoins.”

Magadini noted that gold's price has fallen as trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have progressed. Bitcoin, which “trades on a mix of risk-on and ‘digital gold,'” has therefore lost ground to altcoins, which “are a pure risk play,” he added.

The crypto market continued its downward trend on Saturday, May 17, with most altcoins erasing some of their recent gains. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped from this week's high of $105,000 to $103,000. Some of the top laggards were Pi Network (PI), Bonk (BONK), Floki (FLOKI), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which dropped by over 10%.

Bitcoin is often the main driver in the crypto market. In most cases, altcoins rally whenever the top coin is on an upward trend and fall when there's a retreat. For example, most of them surged by double digits recently when Bitcoin broke the resistance at $90,000 and reached $105,900.

In this case, altcoins are falling because Bitcoin has failed to cross the resistance at $105,000 and retest its all-time high. 

Crypto prices are also crashing because of profit-taking among investors who benefited from the recent surge. Indeed, some of the top gainers during the rally have become the top laggards.

For example, Bonk, which dropped 26% from its monthly low, was up almost 200% from its lowest level in April. Similarly, Floki was up 162%, while PENGU was up over 330%. It is common for cryptocurrency prices to retreat after a strong rally.

The crypto market is also falling because of the overall market risks. While the US reached a truce with China, it maintained a 30% tariff. Officials also maintained the baseline 10% tariff on most goods from the UK, and talks with Japan have stalled. As such, there is a risk of a recession in the US, with Polymarket traders bringing the odds to 38%.

Meanwhile, Moody's, one of the top three rating agencies, downgraded the U.S. on Friday after the market closed. It cited the country's large public debt and Washington politicians' deteriorating fiscal policies.

The best way to predict whether crypto prices will bounce back is to look at Bitcoin. On the daily chart, there are signs that it is slowly forming the bullish pennant pattern, comprising a vertical line and a triangle pattern. 

Bitcoin is also forming a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation sign. It also remains above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, it may bounce back and hit its all-time high of $109,300. 

Moving above that level will point to more gains in this cycle, leading to a strong rebound of most altcoins.

Bitcoin's grip on the cryptocurrency market is loosening, and analysts are speculating about a potential altcoin season set to ignite in June 2025. 

Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, predicts a significant shift, with altcoins already outperforming Bitcoin.

Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), an Ethereum-based altcoin blending meme culture with AI innovation, has gained attention for its unique value. But what does this shift mean for your portfolio, and which cryptocurrencies are primed for the next wave of growth? 

Let's first do a background check.

Recent data from TradingView reveals Bitcoin's dominance rate has slipped from 65% to 62% in just one week, ending a five-month uptrend. This decline signals a potential shift in investor sentiment, with capital likely to flow from Bitcoin's $2 trillion market cap into altcoins. 

During this period, the total crypto market capitalisation surged from $2.90 trillion to $3.24 trillion, underscoring growing enthusiasm for altcoins.

Joao Wedson points to this trend as evidence that an altcoin season is already underway. His proprietary index, tracking 57 select altcoins, shows that 37 of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 60 days. 

Wedson advises investors to analyse altcoin-to-Bitcoin pairs, such as ETH/BTC, to identify the best crypto to buy now for long-term gains. He recently noted on X that part of Bitcoin's market cap will likely flow into altcoins, suggesting that many altcoins have already found their price floors.

Broader market indicators like CoinMarketCap's altcoin index are still hovering at 27, indicating a “Bitcoin season”. These shifting tides suggest that altcoins are gearing up for a breakout. 

For investors seeking the top cryptocurrencies to invest in, this could be the moment to position for the next bull run.

The allure of altcoins lies in their diversity and innovation. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value, altcoins often integrate advanced blockchain technologies or unique use cases. 

From Ethereum's smart contract dominance to emerging projects like Dawgz AI, altcoins offer investors a chance to tap into high-growth sectors of the crypto market.

Wedson's analysis highlights that altcoins are not just following Bitcoin's lead — they're carving their own path. As exchanges list more altcoins and trading volumes rise, projects with strong fundamentals and community support are likely to shine. 

This is a clear indication that the best crypto to buy now isn't just about chasing short-term pumps; it's about identifying coins with potential for long-term adoption and value creation.

Among the top cryptocurrencies vying for attention, $DAGZ emerges as a compelling option. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, $DAGZ combines the viral appeal of memecoins with cutting-edge AI technology. 

Unlike traditional memecoins that rely solely on hype, Dawgz AI offers a unique value proposition: AI-powered trading algorithms designed to optimise returns for holders.

The project's blackbox AI system, crafted by a team of Wall Street veterans and algorithmic trading experts, reacts to market trends in real-time, aiming to deliver consistent yields with minimal effort. 

This makes $DAGZ an accessible investment for both seasoned traders and newcomers looking to invest in the best crypto to buy now. 

With a total supply of 8,888,888,888 tokens, the project allocates 30% to its presale, 20% to staking rewards, and 15% to community engagement, promoting a vibrant ecosystem.

Dawgz AI's presale, currently priced at $0.004 per token, has already raised nearly $3.6 million, signaling strong investor confidence. Early stakers gain access to exclusive AI-powered rewards, making it an attractive option for those aiming to hold for the long term. 

Additionally, the project's smart contracts, audited by SolidProof on June 4, 2024, ensure security and transparency, addressing a key issue in the crypto market that has been associated with scams and hacking.

Beyond its technical prowess, Dawgz AI leans into meme culture to build a passionate community. The project keeps engagement high through meme contests and social media campaigns, positioning itself as a fun and profitable altcoin. 

As Wedson's altcoin season prediction looms, $DAGZ could capture a significant share of the capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins.

With June 2025 on the horizon, investors are reevaluating their portfolios to identify the best crypto to buy now. Wedson's insights suggest that altcoins are poised to outperform, even if Bitcoin experiences short-term volatility. “Most altcoins have already bottomed out,” he stated, urging investors to focus on projects with strong fundamentals and growth potential.

For those looking to invest, the key is to act strategically. Centralised and decentralised exchanges are seeing increased trading activity for altcoins, making it easier to access promising projects. 

Dawgz AI, for instance, supports purchases via ETH, USDT, BNB, and SOL, catering to a wide range of investors. Its staking option, which unlocks rewards seven days after the presale, adds an extra layer of incentive for long-term holders. 

Watch this video for more updates.

The crypto market is at a turning point, with Bitcoin's dominance giving way to a new wave of altcoins in 2025. Wedson's prediction of a full-blown altcoin season in June highlights the urgency for investors to identify the best crypto to buy now. 

Projects like Dawgz AI, with its AI-driven trading algorithms and vibrant community, could be at the forefront of this shift, offering a blend of meme-tastic fun and long-term potential.

As capital is expected to flow from Bitcoin into altcoins, are you positioned to seize this opportunity? 

The bull run is coming; make sure you're ready to run with the pack by joining the Dawgz Army.

What's the best crypto to buy right now?

The best crypto to buy now depends on market trends and project fundamentals. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out for its AI-powered trading algorithms and strong community, making it a potential top pick for the anticipated altcoin season in 2025.

What crypto has 1000x potential?

Dawgz AI has significant potential due to its innovative AI technology and presale traction. Its low entry price and Ethereum-based ecosystem position it for a potential explosive growth in the next bull run.

Which altcoin will reach $1 in 2025?

Predicting exact price targets can be challenging, but Dawgz AI could see substantial gains if the altcoin season materialises as forecasted. Its current presale price of $0.004 offers room for growth, especially with strong market adoption.

What is the fastest-growing crypto?

The fastest-growing crypto combines the current innovation and community hype. Dawgz AI is gaining momentum with over $3.5 million raised in its presale, driven by its unique AI-memecoin model and Ethereum foundation.","{'href': 'https://www.dlnews.com', 'title': 'dlnews.com'}","cryptocurrency"

TALLINN, Estonia, May  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin Solaris, a next-generation blockchain network focused on high-throughput decentralized applications, is preparing to launch a developer-ready API suite to support fast, modular, and scalable app deployment.

The upcoming Bitcoin Solaris API Suite is designed to simplify blockchain development and migration, providing developers with the tools they need to launch or port applications efficiently without overhauling their existing architecture. This suite supports a wide range of application functions — including transaction submission, smart contract interaction, state management, and event listening — through familiar interfaces and flexible logic patterns.

Developer-Ready Infrastructure

At the heart of this API suite is Bitcoin Solaris' dual-layer blockchain architecture, engineered for both speed and resilience:

This infrastructure is designed to support real-time, performance-intensive applications such as decentralized finance platforms, NFT marketplaces, and on-chain games.

 

Mobile-Native Ecosystem and Developer Incentives

In addition to backend performance, developers can integrate directly with the Nova App, the mobile gateway to the Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem. Through this interface, users mine BTC-S tokens, access dApps, and interact with blockchain tools — all in a unified experience.

Developers deploying on Bitcoin Solaris gain immediate access to:

Presale Phase 3: Limited Access to BTC-S Tokens

Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 3, where the native BTC-S token is priced at 3 USDT per token. This presale phase includes 4.2 million tokens — representing 20% of the fixed 21 million total supply — and will conclude before the Nova App mining activation and CEX listings.

The token follows a Bitcoin-style halving model with no inflationary emissions, ensuring transparent distribution and long-term value alignment with active participants.

 

Verified for Production-Grade Deployment

Before opening the network to large-scale developer access, Bitcoin Solaris completed multiple layers of technical validation:

These steps establish Bitcoin Solaris as a secure foundation for blockchain applications with serious scaling ambitions.

What's Next

With its API suite set to go live in the coming weeks, Bitcoin Solaris is opening the door to a new wave of blockchain builders ready to deploy, scale, and connect with users in a high-performance environment. Developers can pre-register for early access, token presale updates, and technical documentation via the official website.

When the Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying powerhouse, set out to find its next CEO, it wanted to find someone with deep Washington ties and deep knowledge of the crypto industry.

And it wanted to do it fast.

“We have a very narrow window to get legislation through,” Blockchain Association board member Marta Belcher told DL News. “The midterms are next year. I think it's very likely that our window closes at the midterms.”

Earlier this week, the organisation said it has hired Summer Mersinger, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to replace Kristin Smith, who left Friday to join the Solana Policy Institute.

“Commissioner Mersinger brings exceptional leadership experience at the intersection of innovation, law, and public service, assuming the role at a critical moment for the industry,” the Blockchain Association said in a statement announcing her hire. 

“With her track record of driving regulatory clarity and building coalitions across government and industry, she will spearhead efforts to advance forward-thinking legislation, foster industry growth, and defend the foundational principles of decentralised technology.”

Before joining the CFTC, Mersinger was a top aide to Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota. Thune is now the Senate majority leader.

“It has been a privilege to work and serve at the CFTC in both the first and the current Trump Administrations, doing my part to assist in pursuing the President's important policies,” Mersinger said in a statement announcing her departure.

The Blockchain Association is one of the largest crypto lobbying firms in DC, with almost 130 members, according to Belcher.

And it's entering what could be the most pivotal moment for crypto legislation in the industry's short history.

President Donald Trump has cast himself as a champion of crypto. After a flurry of executive orders, attention has turned to Congress, where Senators are negotiating major stablecoin legislation and the House debates a market structure bill that would create a framework for digital asset regulation.

Belcher called that legislation “existential” for crypto.

And getting it across the finish line will require coordination from the industry and its myriad players.

“It was important for us to have a permanent CEO as quickly as possible, and that was why we decided to move forward quickly in the search,” Belcher said.

Rather than hiring a search firm to find candidates, the Blockchain Association decided to handle the entire process itself.

“We felt like we needed someone who was in crypto and who understood the space,” Belcher said. “We had a rigorous but rapid process where we did those interviews.”

Belcher cited Mersinger's dissent in the case of Ooki DAO as an example of the commissioner's crypto bona fides.

The CFTC sued Ooki DAO in 2022, arguing it functioned as an unregistered platform for commodities trading and failed to implement required know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures.

The industry sprang to Ooki DAO's defence, with venture capital firms Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz, lobbyist DeFi Education Fund, and an association of crypto attorneys called LeXpunK writing to the court in Ooki's defence.

In 2023, a federal judge sided with the CFTC after Ooki DAO failed to defend itself in court.

In her dissent, Mersinger acknowledged Ooki may have violated the Commodities Exchange Act. But she took issue with the CFTC's attempt to lay blame at every member of the cooperative — every person who held an Ooki DAO token and used it to vote on the project's ongoing development. 

“That's one example which shows her alignment with the underlying values of crypto,” Belcher said.

Mersinger's first day as CEO is June 2. Sarah Milby, the Blockchain Association's head of policy, will serve as CEO in the interim.

“We're at a pivotal moment for crypto policy, and I think Commissioner Mersinger is the right leader to take us forward from here,” Belcher said.

Central banks are beginning to explore how programmable blockchain tools could reshape the execution of monetary policy.

A recent pilot project, Project Pine, conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Innovation Center and the BIS Innovation Hub (Swiss Centre), demonstrates how smart contracts might offer more responsive and adaptable mechanisms in a digitized financial system.

Instead of relying on outdated, slow-moving infrastructure, the test simulated how blockchain-based tools could rapidly adjust monetary conditions in real time. In one scenario, smart contracts enabled near-instant changes to collateral requirements and interest rates, reacting within minutes to hypothetical market disruptions.




The prototype relied on Ethereum-based token standards and incorporated access controls to simulate a secure environment. While results were promising—highlighting flexibility and speed—researchers noted that most current financial systems aren't yet equipped to handle this level of technological integration.

Beyond the test environment, interest in tokenization is growing rapidly. At Consensus 2025, DTCC Digital Assets' Joseph Spiro emphasized stablecoins as ideal instruments for real-time financial operations like collateral transfers in derivatives markets.

While the technology is still experimental in the public sector, early findings suggest that programmable finance could become a crucial part of the monetary toolkit in the years ahead.







JPMorgan has quietly taken a step toward public blockchain integration by settling a tokenized U.S. Treasury transaction outside its private infrastructure for the first time.

Thailand is preparing to issue $150 million in digital investment tokens, opening up access to government bonds for everyday citizens through blockchain technology.

Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has unveiled a bold new concept: a meta blockchain layer that would unify data from multiple blockchains into a single, ordered history.

Lido may soon reshape how decisions are made within its ecosystem. A new proposal, LIP-28, introduced on May 8, aims to give staked Ethereum (stETH) holders the power to counter potentially harmful decisions made by LDO token voters.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is preparing to take legal steps against individuals alleging that he manipulated the blockchain to take control of 318 million ADA tokens.

The accusations, which recently emerged on the social media platform X, suggest he used his Genesis keys in 2021 to seize funds belonging to early investors.

Last week, NFT artist Masato Alexander claimed that during the Cardano “Allegra” hard fork, the network overwrote certain unspent token allocations from the original token sale. It then rerouted those tokens to Cardano's reserves.

“In 2021, the Cardano ‘Allegra' Hard Fork (HF) wasn't just a routine upgrade. It contained an extra payload. This HF effectively ERASED the original ICO UTxOs holding the ₳318M and swept the funds into the Cardano reserves,” Alexander wrote.

Alexander claimed that although they intended to reissue the funds to their rightful owners, they allegedly withheld a large portion.

He further claimed that only a small percentage of the tokens funded Intersect, a Cardano governance initiative. Most of the tokens, he alleged, were staked to generate an estimated 25 million ADA in additional rewards.

“Only a tiny fraction went to Intersect… Where did the VAST majority of that ₳318 MILLION actually go after being moved from reserves? Separately, the funds were staked, earning 25m additional,” Alexander alleged.

In addition, Alexander criticized the lack of clear documentation on the fund's path, suggesting there is no verifiable audit trail.

Ironically, Charles recently emphasized needing community input for scaling solutions, citing the importance of governance.Yet, when ₳318M was at stake, he acted unilaterally via genesis keys to alter the ledger and control these funds.Interesting. pic.twitter.com/7aeInvGWok

However, Hoskinson has strongly rejected the allegations. In a response posted to X, he described the claims as “lies” and clarified that the ADA vouchers became unspendable following the Allegra hard fork. 

The Cardano founder explained that these assets were transferred to a custodial account managed by the Token Generation Event (TGE). This account continued processing redemptions for three years.

“The Ada vouchers became unspendable after the hard fork. They were rolled into a custodial account controlled by the TGE that then continued redemption for 3 more years to distribute the genesis funds to the original buyers,” he said.

Hoskinson stated that original buyers eventually claimed 99.8% of the ADA sold during the ICO. He added that the team allocated only 0.2% of the tokens to fund Intersect.

“After seven years, the remaining 0.2 percent were returned to the TGE and donated to Intersect through the same process that funded the Cardano Foundation,” he added.

While the Cardano team has not released a full public report, Hoskinson noted that the redemption process is still ongoing. 

He warned that he will sue Alexander and others who repeat the claims if they keep alleging that Input Output Global stole funds.

“As we are now considering litigation against those slandering us, we will make no further statements until the closing report is published. We will then send letters to the relevant parties demanding retractions and apologies,” the Cardano founder concluded.

AI meets blockchain in 2025's most disruptive innovation wave. Discover how these revolutionary AI-powered crypto projects are transforming digital assets with unprecedented functionality and real-world applications. Our investigation reveals which projects lead the market and why they merit investor attention.

The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most transformative developments in the digital assets space. A wave of innovative AI-powered crypto projects is fundamentally reshaping the blockchain ecosystem, offering enhanced functionality, efficiency, and real-world utility. This investigation examines two of the top AI crypto projects disrupting the market in 2025, analyzing both their technological innovations and investment potential.

The integration of AI and blockchain represents a synergistic fusion where each technology enhances the other's capabilities. Blockchain provides AI with transparent, immutable data sources and decentralized computing resources, while AI brings automation, prediction, and optimization capabilities to blockchain networks.

According to recent data from KuCoin, AI and big data tokens experienced a remarkable 131% increase in market capitalization in late 2024, reaching $42.1 billion by November. This surge reflects both technological maturity and increasing market demand for intelligent decentralized systems.

The technical architecture of these projects typically involves either AI systems operating on blockchain infrastructure, blockchain-based marketplaces for AI services, or AI-optimized consensus mechanisms. Each approach offers unique advantages for specific use cases, from financial services to supply chain management and beyond.

The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance represents a groundbreaking collaboration between three prominent decentralized AI projects: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. Launched in July 2024, the alliance aims to create a unified, decentralized AI ecosystem by merging their respective tokens (FET, AGIX, and OCEAN) into a single ASI token.

Fetch.ai's technology enables autonomous economic agents capable of performing various tasks without human intervention. These AI agents can process and share data among IoT devices, execute crypto transactions, and facilitate trades on decentralized exchanges through trading bots [CryptoPotato, February 2025].

The platform recently launched DeltaV, which “simplifies complex tasks and enhances user experiences through AI-powered chat interfaces,” allowing users to process everyday practical tasks like holiday bookings and finding electric vehicle charging points. Best AI Crypto Coins in 2025: Top 12 Projects to Watch This development has contributed to FET becoming one of the largest crypto AI tokens by market capitalization in early 2025.

Currently, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is priced at $0.74 – well short of its $3.20 all time high from March last year. It has a market cap of approximately $1.9 billion, and is up 60% in the last month – far outpacing Bitcoin over the same time frame. The token has shown significant volatility, typical of the AI crypto sector, but maintains substantial trading volume, indicating strong market interest.

NEAR Protocol has established itself as a leading layer-1 blockchain focused on AI integration and development. In November 2024, NEAR unveiled an ambitious plan to build the world's largest open-source AI model with 1.4 trillion parameters, 3.5 times larger than Meta's Llama model. The development process is being crowdsourced through the newly established NEAR AI Research hub, inviting thousands of contributors to participate.

What makes this initiative particularly noteworthy is the background of NEAR's leadership. Co-founder Illia Polosukhin was a contributor to the seminal “Attention Is All You Need” paper that laid the groundwork for modern AI models like ChatGPT. His expertise is complemented by co-founder Alex Skidanov's experience at OpenAI during ChatGPT's development.

NEAR's focus for 2025 includes improving wallet infrastructure for cross-chain interactions, developing tools for chain abstraction, and prioritizing infrastructure for decentralized AI applications. The protocol is also advancing in decentralized confidential machine learning, addressing key challenges in privacy and user data ownership.

NEAR is up 36% in the last month. Source: Brave New Coin NEAR market data.

With a current price around $2.75 and a market cap of $3.35 billion, NEAR is up 36% in the last month – also outpacing Bitcoin and representing a significant player in the AI crypto space.

The market performance of AI crypto projects has been particularly noteworthy against the broader crypto landscape. According to data from KuCoin, AI and big data tokens had a 131% increase in market capitalization in late 2024.

Developer adoption metrics also tell a compelling story. GitHub data analyzed by Electric Capital indicates that AI crypto projects have experienced a significant increase in monthly active developers over the past 12 months, outpacing the broader crypto ecosystem. This surge in developer interest often precedes mainstream adoption and market growth.

For individual projects, transaction volume and network usage provide meaningful insights into real-world adoption. The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, for example, frequently demonstrates strong trading volumes exceeding $100 million in 24-hour periods, indicating substantial market activity and interest.

The investment landscape for AI crypto projects presents both significant opportunities and distinctive risks. Tokenomics vary considerably among projects, with some focusing on utility within their ecosystems while others incorporate governance or staking mechanisms.

Analysts from reputable sources predict varying growth trajectories for these tokens. For FET, price predictions for 2025 range from conservative estimates of $2.19-$2.69  to more optimistic projections of up to $5. NEAR Protocol is expected to reach between $7.15-$8.90 by the end of 2025 according to market analysts. 

However, investors should be aware of the substantial risks in this sector. Technical complexity in developing and deploying decentralized AI systems presents challenges related to scalability, security, and interoperability. The competitive landscape is dominated by tech giants with greater resources which hinders market penetration for smaller projects.

Regulatory uncertainty surrounding both cryptocurrencies and AI adds another layer of risk. Potentially restrictive regulations could impede adoption and growth, particularly regarding autonomous systems and data privacy concerns.

Liquidity also remains a critical consideration. While major AI crypto assets maintain healthy trading volumes on tier-1 exchanges, newer projects often suffer from limited liquidity, creating potential entry and exit challenges for investors.

The regulatory environment surrounding AI crypto projects is rapidly evolving. In March 2025, the European Union's AI Act introduced specific provisions addressing AI-blockchain integration, requiring enhanced transparency for algorithms operating on public blockchains. Similar regulatory frameworks are under development in other jurisdictions.

Looking ahead, several trends appear likely to shape the future of AI crypto projects:

According to industry experts interviewed by DL News, the AI-linked crypto market is worth almost $55 billion as of early 2025, with researchers estimating that the combination of AI and blockchain could add another $20 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

The convergence of AI and blockchain technologies represents one of the most promising developments in the crypto space. Projects combining these technologies are demonstrating real-world utility and attracting significant developer and investor interest. However, the sector's rapid evolution demands careful analysis and due diligence.

For investors, the most successful approaches will likely balance exposure to established AI crypto projects with selective positions in promising newcomers. Technical evaluation of the underlying AI capabilities—not merely blockchain functionality—will be crucial for identifying projects with sustainable competitive advantages.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Arthur Leclerc, a passion for racing, music, crypto. And, winning!","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/05/17/arthur-leclerc-passion-racing-music-crypto-winning/","Sat, 17 May 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

We sat down with Arthur Leclerc, the Monegasque young talent, who serves as a development driver for Ferrari racing, working side by side with his brother Charles, who is one of the two Formula 1 drivers for the Italian Scuderia. 

The occasion of the meeting was created by zondacrypto, an emerging crypto exchange and digital suite for decentralized finance services – which dominates in Easter Europe and is growing reach and awareness now across Western Europe and the USA (compliant with all rules and regulations in the markets where they operate), and it took place at Top Marques Monaco 2025, the luxury car fair. This is what we discussed. Leclerc recently joined as an ambassador for the crypto platform, who is sponsoring sports teams, athletes and events, including world know Juventus FC.

Leclerc shared some insights into his passions beyond the racetrack, revealing his love for playing the piano. “It's something that I really like doing,” he said. “When I have some time off and I go off track, I just play a bit of piano for myself first. In the small amount of free time that I have, I go to Spotify to share my music with everyone.” He hopes to share his own compositions with a wider audience soon.

The conversation shifted to crypto. What's intriguing in crypto and blockchain? Leclerc admitted that, being young and having spent most of his life in a racing car, it has been challenging to adjust to these new fields and own them completely. However, he has been closely watching the growth of crypto over the past few years. “I see how big it has become,” he said. “I have several friends who are working in the space, so I'm getting to know more and more about it. It's amazing to watch the improvements happening around crypto.” Leclerc is impressed with platforms or solutions that simplify transactions and make everything more accessible. “When I see spaces that make everything simple, the transactions and everything else, I feel it was really the right call to join as an ambassador for zondacrypto,” he added.

We moved to technology in general and Leclerc shared how tech plays a significant role in his life, especially in the context of motorsports. “Technology is a big part of the sport,” he explained. “In Formula 1, we have a whole department dedicated to technology. It's all about analyzing data, predicting numbers, and developing software. There are a lot of things involved, and I really love that.” He has also been fascinated by physics and new technologies. “I think Formula 1 is at the top of technology, in every detail of a car,” he said. It's amazing, indeed, to see the advancements being made, like the development of self-driving Formula 1 cars, tested by the likes of Dallara. Absolute perfection on the track could potentially be achieved with the use of artificial intelligence, paradoxically without any human intervention some time in the future. “Maybe in the future, let's see what happens,” closes Leclerc. 

In the world of business, exactly like in racing, winning means always being number one. In sports, it's even more challenging, as it can boil down to fractions of a second ahead of a competitor. For Leclerc, winning is everything. “Competition has always been something that runs in the family,” he said. “I have my brothers, and it can be everywhere – from paddle to PlayStation to the track. We love racing, so we have been trained to compete and win. For me, competition is everything and it is what pushes you to get better and stronger before a race.” Leclerc's drive is evident. He would not do what he does for a living. He enjoys both the research and training, and the actual race. “It's a mix,” he explained. “There's the research to maybe have a faster car, but there's also the competition, and that's why you need to be better every day, improve your skills, and extract more from yourself. It's a huge satisfaction when you win because it's the result of the whole team's effort, the research done in the background, and the work of many people at the factory. Winning in Formula 1 or motorsport means everything to me. It's the best thing of all.”

Humanity and technology are heavily intertwined in Formula 1, and the same thing goes for finance. Leclerc is young and has a full plate, between music, racing, tech, crypto and winning.

Crypto

While digital assets continue to transform the financial world, they come with opportunity and risk hand in hand. On the one hand, the hope of decentralization, transparency, and innovation; on the other hand, increasing alarm at how they can be misused in financial crimes. Money laundering, perhaps, is one of the closest among these risks. The pseudonymous and borderless nature of the crypto environment has rendered it a popular avenue for concealing illicit wealth. As such, the application and function of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) technologies have become important in ensuring the legitimacy and sustainability of digital finance.

Traditional banking systems are based on proven compliance models. Banks, as an example, are subject to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML practices to track and report suspicious transactions. The distributed nature of cryptocurrencies poses a challenge anew. Distributed ledger transactions can be tracked but owners of wallet addresses' identities tend to be obscured—so one of the biggest challenges for law enforcers and regulators.

Such anonymity has led to some of the high-profile abuse cases of digital assets being utilized by malicious actors for cybercrime proceeds money laundering, ransomware, illicit trade, and corruption. As this threat environment continues to materialize, regulatory bodies worldwide are demanding increased controls and more open mechanisms to keep digital finance free from criminal uses.

As far as the subtlety of the crypto universe is concerned, AML technology stands no chance in the race when it comes to traditional methods. They now employ elements of blockchain analysis, machine learning, and behavioral risk scoring to identify ever-more accurate suspect financial activity.

Among the largest improvements has been the emergence of real-time blockchain tracking tools to track transactions. These sites are able to track money from wallets to networks and alert on purchases outside normal behavior. With risk scores placed on individual wallet addresses or baskets of transactions, these solutions allow compliance officers to determine whether or not to investigate and intervene.

Transaction heuristics constitutes yet another layer—algorithms that track transaction patterns, timing, and structure to look for signs of layering or structuring, a typical money laundering process. Coupled with open-source intelligence and dark web surveillance, AML systems will be in a position to create more precise profiles of suspected actors involved in illicit activity.

The regulatory framework of digital property is changing very fast. Regimes around the world are updating their financial compliance laws to include crypto-based firms. A part of the most critical element of that transformation is to compel exchanges and other intermediaries to adopt AML and KYC structures equivalent to those employed by conventional financial institutions.

These developments have brought about the application of sophisticated compliance suites with not just transaction monitoring but also sanctions screening and identity verification software. The intention is to make actors in the digital economy traceable, identifiable, and responsible. Travel rule compliance models where there is a need for exchange of certain details regarding senders and receivers in the event of high value transactions has been embraced by some countries.

At the same time, cross-border finance working groups and independent monitors have evolved public-private partnership as the solution for the quest for data sharing and enforcement. Regulators, compliance experts, and technology providers together are incrementally building an open and secure digital finance infrastructure.

Though tools technology is getting better, the road to successful AML in the crypto world is still full of pitfalls. Among the largest obstacles is the absence of international standard regulatory requirements. Some countries have established rigorous control, but others are lax or vague in their actions. Such discrepancies offer scopes for regulatory arbitrage, whereby illicit actors move operations to less controlled spaces.

The second challenge is the sheer quantity and variability of blockchain data. With the thousands of new tokens and decentralized systems that pop up, keeping up with every transaction is an enormous undertaking. This creates pressure on compliance teams as well as software providers to constantly innovate and automate as much as possible without sacrificing accuracy.

There's also the issue of privacy and user agency. Finding a balance between monitoring and rights of the individual is still a delicate matter. Excessive tracking might prompt users to go elsewhere or use privacy-orientated protocols that refuse to be tracked at all.

Aside from technology and tools, there is mounting awareness that compliance must become a cultural value in digital worlds of assets. This entails teaching users, entrepreneurs, and developers about the importance of financial integrity and the long-term consequences of forsaking compliance.

Crypto compliance officers are increasingly receiving compliance training, and so is the integration of AML modules in blockchain development courses. Both digital and traditional financial institutions are spending money on capacity building to ensure their personnel are adequately equipped to deal with the intricacies of this new reality.

Along with this, there is a growing trend of transparency reports and voluntary disclosures by Internet companies, indicating a change in thinking from reactive compliance to proactive responsibility.

A 26-year-old man from Alabama has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for his role in a social media hack that briefly sent the price of bitcoin BTC$103,218.58 soaring.



Eric Council Jr. of Huntsville pleaded guilty to charges tied to the January 2024 hack of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's X account, according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release.



Posing as a telecom customer using a fraudulent ID, Council used a SIM-swap technique to hijack a phone number tied to the SEC's account. His co-conspirators then used it to falsely post that the agency had approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a long-awaited regulatory milestone.



Within minutes, the price of bitcoin surged by more than $1,000. It crashed soon after, losing more than $2,000 in value once the post was revealed as fake. The SEC did later that month approve the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs.



Authorities say Council was paid in bitcoin for his role. He will serve 14 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.



Federal prosecutors called the attack a calculated attempt to manipulate financial markets. “The deliberate takeover of a federal agency's official communications platform was a calculated criminal act meant to deceive the public and manipulate financial markets,” said Acting FBI Assistant Director Darren Cox. “By spreading false information to influence the markets, Council attempted to erode public trust and exploit the financial system”

Billions of dollars have flowed into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin BTC$103,218.58 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent weeks, as the cryptocurrency chalked out a sharp recovery rally from $75,000 to $100,000.

Most of the investment is likely driven by bold, strategic bullish directional bets rather than market-neutral arbitrage plays, data analysis suggests.

The 11 spot ETFs drew in $2.97 billion in investor money in April, with an additional $2.64 billion flowing in so far this month, according to data source SoSoValue. That has boosted the net inflow since inception in January 2024 to over $41 billion.

Institutions have historically used these ETFs to set up non-directional arbitrage plays to profit from price discrepancies between futures and spot bitcoin markets. The so-called cash and carry arbitrage involves buying ETFs while simultaneously selling the CME futures to pocket the futures premium while bypassing price direction risks.

But inflows since early April seem driven by bullish directional bets, not arbitrage plays. That's reflected in the Commitment of Traders (COT) report published by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) every week.

The data shows leveraged funds, typically hedge funds and various types of money managers, including registered commodity trading advisors, have trimmed their net shorts to 14,139 contracts from 17,141 contracts in early April, according to data tracked by Tradingster.

The number of shorts would have risen if carry trades had primarily driven the net inflows.

""CFTC data shows leveraged funds didn't significantly increase short positions, indicating most flows were directional bets, not arbitrage,"" Imran Lakha, founder of Options Insight, in a blog post published on Deribit.

The shift in the nature of inflows in the ETFs suggests large players are increasingly using the ETFs to express a clear market outlook on bitcoin's future direction.

Bitcoin last changed hands at $102,700 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.

ETH has quietly slipped into historically rare territory as one market signal shows its deeply undervalued compared to bitcoin (BTC), at a ratio not seen since 2019, a new CryptoQuant report says. 

The signal comes from Ethereum's ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, a gauge of relative valuation that measures market sentiment and historical trading patterns. 

Historically, whenever this indicator has reached similarly low levels, ETH has subsequently delivered significant gains and substantially outperformed BTC.

Investors appear to be taking notice. Demand for the ETH ETF has sharply picked up, with the ETH/BTC ETF holdings ratio rising steeply since late April, according to data from CryptoQuant.

This shift in allocation suggests institutional investors anticipate ETH will outperform BTC, potentially fueled by the recent Pectra upgrade or a more favorable macroeconomic environment.

Already, the ETH/BTC price ratio has rebounded 38% from its weakest level since January 2020, suggesting investors and traders are betting the bottom is in and an ""alt season"" could soon follow.

This echoes what some market participants have been telling CoinDesk.

March Zheng, General Partner of Bizantine Capital, said in a recent message that traders should remember that ETH has typically been the main on-chain altcoin indicator for risk-on, and its sizable upticks generally lead to broader altcoin rallies.

On-chain data further supports this optimism. ETH spot trading volume relative to BTC surged to 0.89 last week, its highest since August 2024, signaling renewed appetite from investors. A similar trend occurred between 2019 and 2021, when ETH went on to outperform BTC by fourfold.

CryptoQuant also notes that ETH exchange deposits, often an indicator of selling pressure, have dropped to their lowest relative level since 2020, implying investors anticipate higher prices ahead.

For now, confirmation hinges on ETH decisively breaking above its key 365-day moving average against BTC.

Still, with compelling undervaluation, rising institutional interest, and diminishing selling pressure, ETH appears positioned for significant upside in the coming months.

But one thing ETH is still lagging on is network activity, as CryptoQuant flagged in a prior report. Without more people using Ethereum, it will be tough for the token's price to lift off and head to the moon.

Two of the year's most chaotic token blowups — Movement Labs' MOVE scandal and the collapse of Mantra's OM — are sending shockwaves through crypto's market-making businesses.""These scandals have definitely changed trust dynamics between market makers and project teams, where trust is no longer assumed—it's engineered,"" Zahreddine Touag, Head of Trading at Woorton, said over a Telegram message  on Friday. ""Market makers -- especially those providing balance sheet-intensive support -- will now insist on full disclosure of side agreements, token grants, and any preferential economic rights,"" Touag added.

In both cases, rapid price crashes revealed hidden actors, questionable token unlocks, and alleged side agreements that blinded market participants, with OM falling more than 90% within hours late April on no apparent catalyst.

Unlike traditional finance, where market makers provide orderly bid-ask spreads on regulated venues, crypto market makers often operate more like high-stakes trading desks. 

They're not just quoting prices; they're negotiating pre-launch token allocations, accepting lockups, structuring liquidity for centralized exchanges, and sometimes taking equity or advisory stakes. 

The result is a murky space where liquidity provision is entangled with private deals, tokenomics, and often, insider politics. 

A CoinDesk exposé in late April showed how some Movement Labs executives colluded with their own market maker to dump $38 million worth of MOVE in the open market.

Now, some firms are questioning whether they've been too casual in trusting counterparties. How do you hedge a position when token unlock schedules are opaque? What happens when handshake deals quietly override DAO proposals?

“Our approach now includes more extensive preliminary discussions and educational sessions with project teams to ensure they thoroughly understand market-making mechanics,” Hong Kong-based Metalpha's market-making division told CoinDesk in an interview. 

“Our deal structures have evolved to emphasize long-term strategic alignment over short-term performance metrics, incorporating specific safeguards against unethical behavior such as excessive token dumping and artificial trading volume,"" it said.

Behind the scenes, conversations are intensifying. Deal terms are being scrutinized more carefully. Some liquidity desks are reevaluating how they underwrite token risk. ""Recent developments have prompted a recalibration—not a reinvention—of how B2C2 assesses counterparty risk in our market-making,"" Dean Sovolos, Chief Legal Officer at B2C2, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Historically, when I first joined B2C2 in 2021, much of the crypto market operated on a blend of informal trust and aggressive risk appetite. That paradigm has shifted, especially of late. Post-Q1, B2C2 is seeing a marked pivot toward institutional-grade rigor: enhanced legal diligence, enforceable tokenomics terms, and clear contingency frameworks for breaches or deviations from disclosed unlock schedules,"" he said.""The Movement and Mantra incidents didn't create new risks—they revealed how latent those risks remain in poorly governed token ecosystems. We're responding with stronger contract architecture, but also better integration between legal terms and technical enforcement mechanisms,"" Sovolos stated.

Others are demanding stricter transparency — or walking away from murky projects altogether.

“Projects no longer accept prestigious reputations at face value, having witnessed how even established players can exploit shadow allocations or engage in detrimental token selling practices,” Metalpha's head of Web3 ecosystem Max Sun noted. “The era of presumptive trust has concluded,” he claimed.

Beneath the polished surface of token launch announcements and market-making agreements lies another layer of crypto finance — the secondary OTC market, where locked tokens quietly change hands well before vesting cliffs hit the public eye. 

These under-the-table deals, often struck between early backers, funds, and syndicates, are now distorting supply dynamics and skewing price discovery, some traders say. And for market makers tasked with providing orderly liquidity, they're becoming an increasingly opaque and dangerous variable.

“The secondary OTC market has changed the dynamics of the industry,” said Min Jung, analyst at Presto Research, which runs a market-making unit. “If you look at tokens with suspicious price action — like $LAYER, $OM, $MOVE, and others — they're often the ones most actively traded on the secondary OTC market.”

“The entire supply and vesting schedule has become distorted because of these off-market deals, and for liquid funds, the real challenge is figuring out when supply is actually unlocking,” Jung added.

In a market where price is fiction and supply is negotiated in back rooms, the real risk isn't volatility for traders — it is believing the float is what the whitepaper and founders say it is.

 Everstake met with the SEC's Crypto Task Force to argue that non-custodial staking is a technical process, not a securities transaction. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.

The meeting, which also involved the SEC's Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.

However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.

The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.

During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.

They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.

“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.

In a letter submitted to the SEC's Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.

In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce's call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.

It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.

In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.

The letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake's efforts, and are not dependent on the company's management for financial returns.

Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.

Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.

It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.

Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake's chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there's no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:

Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.

“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”

In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.

 The mayor of Panama City seemingly advocated for a city-level Bitcoin reserve in a mysterious post after meeting two of El Salvador's Bitcoin policy leaders this week. 

Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has hinted at establishing a city-level Bitcoin reserve in a cryptic post following his meeting with two of El Salvador's Bitcoin policy leaders.

“Bitcoin Reserve,” Mizrachi wrote to X on May 16 after meeting El Salvador-based Bitcoiners Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert.

While Mizrachi didn't share details about his discussions with Keiser and Herbert, the timing of the post came 11 days before the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Mizrachi is scheduled to speak.

The creation of a Bitcoin reserve in Panama City would follow a recently approved measure permitting the use of crypto for public payments, including taxes, fines and municipal fees.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) will be accepted once the crypto-to-fiat payment rails are established, Mizrachi said at the time.

To push for a Bitcoin reserve at the federal level, Mizrachi would need to collaborate with Panama's National Assembly to craft legislation. 

There's no evidence to suggest that he has taken such measures.

Mizrachi's post follows the recent enactments of two Bitcoin reserve bills in the US states of Arizona and New Hampshire. 

Ukraine is also reportedly inching closer toward adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve asset, local media reported earlier in the month.

A post from Keiser suggests the trio spoke about how Panama and El Salvador can leverage renewable energy to bolster their Bitcoin mining operations.

Herbert also noted that Panama City will integrate El Salvador's “What is Money?” financial literacy textbook into its online library system.

Keiser and Herbert have played a crucial role in crafting El Salvador's Bitcoin policy, which includes a Bitcoin reserve consisting of 6,179 Bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $640 million.

Keiser serves as President Nayib Bukele's Bitcoin advisor, while Herbert runs the country's Bitcoin Office.

 Paraguayan law enforcement has deported three undocumented immigrants from China after they were caught breaking into a crypto mining facility attempting to steal machines. 

Paraguayan law enforcement has deported three individuals and arrested another for attempting to steal crypto miners at a facility near the country's Itaipu hydroelectric dam.

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA's facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.

Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company's CEO.

The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

The other person arrested, Nahun María Velázquez Garcete, is a legal resident in Paraguay but is believed to be part of a criminal organization.

He has been charged with aggravated theft and is currently in pretrial detention.

The arrested individual was hospitalized in critical condition soon after the arrest, but the injuries sustained weren't disclosed.

Paraguayan officials believe other individuals were involved in the attempted theft and are working to identify those people. As such, the case is still under investigation.

Rolón believes the undocumented immigrants had been in Paraguay for several months and had come to work as programmers. However, it isn't clear whether that work was performed for the company.

Paraguayan officials are waiting on a report from Teratech's CEO to determine the exact nature of his relationship with the three men.

Paraguay is considered well-suited for crypto mining operations due to its abundant renewable energy resources, much of which is underutilized.

The Itaipu dam has become a popular site for miners to set up, as it supplies all of Paraguay's local electricity needs and leaves a large amount of excess electricity to tap into.

When you're using your laptop away from its charging cable, every bit of battery life matters—it can make the difference between just managing to finish that important email or essay, or not. One of the ways you can make sure you eke out as much time between charges as possible is to look at your browser settings.

The web browser is most probably where you're going to spend most of your computing time, so any battery life savings you can make here will quickly add up. There are a number of tricks to try to reduce the energy demands from loading up all those web pages, videos, social media feeds, and web apps.

Applying just one or two of these tricks—together with some more general battery-saving tips—can give you a significant boost in battery life and make sure you get to the end of the working day without needing a recharge.

Google Chrome comes with a dedicated Energy Saver setting, which turns off some background tasks to reduce the load on your laptop. Browsing might be slightly slower in some circumstances, but there's a positive trade-off in battery life.

Click the three dots in the top-right corner of any Chrome tab, then choose Settings > Performance. You can toggle the Energy Saver feature on and off from this screen. You can also instruct Chrome to turn it on automatically, either whenever your laptop is unplugged or whenever your laptop's battery life drops below 20 percent.

There's another toggle switch here: Memory Saver. Enabling this reduces the memory load of inactive tabs until you switch back to them. While it's not as directly related to battery life as Energy Saver, it can also reduce the demands of Chrome on your system.

Microsoft Edge has something similar to Chrome's Energy Saver in the form of Efficiency Mode. Its primary function is to snooze inactive tabs that you've haven't visited in a while, which then means Edge is hogging fewer system resources, and from there drawing less energy from the battery.

Click the three dots in the top-right corner of any Edge tab, then click Settings. Open the System and Performance tab, and you'll see an Efficiency Mode toggle switch. Alongside it are some related settings, including how long Edge should wait before putting tabs to sleep, and whether or not you want Efficiency Mode to kick in automatically whenever your laptop is running on battery power.

There's also a Maximum savings option you can switch to, if you want to prioritize battery life savings over everything else. Edge doesn't specify exactly what additional actions are taken, but notes that ""you may experience some visible slowdowns"" when browsing if you turn on Maximum savings.

The Opera browser isn't quite as well known as Chrome or Edge, but it does offer plenty of useful features, including a handy Battery Saver mode. With this mode enabled, the browser is more selective when it comes to allowing background tasks to run. Opera says you can expect up to an hour of extra battery life with Battery Saver enabled.

You can find it on Windows by clicking the Opera button (a red O) in the top-left corner of the browser, then choosing Settings. On macOS, open the Opera menu, then pick Settings. The Battery Saver toggle switch is under the Features tab, and you can also opt to have the mode kick in automatically whenever you're on battery power, or whenever your laptop's battery drops below a certain point.

Farther down the same settings screen is a Snooze inactive tabs to save memory toggle switch: While this isn't strictly part of the Battery Saver feature, it can help reduce the demands of the browser a little more.

There are no dedicated battery saving modes in the other popular web browsers—perhaps their developers would rather not fess up to the issue of significant battery drain—but there are still a couple of ways you can maximize battery life while navigating the web, and they apply to pretty much any browser you might use.

First and foremost, keep your open tabs to a minimum. Every tab your browser has to open adds to the work it has to do and the demands on your laptop's battery. If you find you're not great at managing this yourself, enlist the help of an extension to organize your tabs: something like Tab Stash for Firefox or OneTab for Chrome.

Switching to dark mode in your browser can also help cut down on the energy use of your display. By default, browsers will usually follow the lead of your operating system when choosing how to display content, but several browsers have a separate setting too. In Firefox, for example, click the three-line menu button (top right) in Windows or the Firefox menu in macOS, then choose Settings to find Automatic, Light, and Dark options.

Elon Musk says he's stepping back from his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to turn his attention to his businesses—most urgently to Tesla, which has faced global sales slumps in recent months. In this episode, we discuss how our understanding of DOGE has evolved over the past five months and what we think will happen when Musk scales back.

Katie Drummond: Ugh.

Michael Calore: That good?

Katie Drummond: That was me, Katie. That was me speaking. No, it's going all right. It's been a stressful 90 minutes leading up to recording this podcast, but I'm okay.

Michael Calore: Did you just fly through Newark?

Katie Drummond: No, actually I didn't. Although I know that that is in your cards, in the near future. I actually rescheduled a flight to avoid Newark, so I'm now taking a red eye for no reason other than I don't want to fly into Newark Airport.

Lauren Goode: Smart.

Katie Drummond: Thank you.

Michael Calore: I'm jealous.

Lauren Goode: Mike, I'm sending you all of the good wishes.

Michael Calore: Thank you. I hope to listen to this podcast on an airplane that took off on time and lands on time without incident on Thursday.

Lauren Goode: I hope you return next week able to tape another podcast because you didn't get stuck somewhere.

Michael Calore: I think metaphysically, we're all stuck somewhere right now, I think.

Lauren Goode: Yeah, we're in the middle of some big transitions. That's probably the one thing that we have in common with Elon Musk.

Katie Drummond: Touché.

Michael Calore: Back in the first week of January, we put out an episode of this show that was all about DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. I would say it was our very first DOGE episode, if I'm remembering correctly. And we talked about the key players, the goals of the group, and the ins and outs of government spending. A lot has happened since then. And now, Elon Musk, says that he's stepping back from his full-time role at DOGE. There are still many unanswered questions about where DOGE stands now, including if and when Elon's exit will happen, but we're wondering what actually has been accomplished during Musk's time with the DOGE Bros. So, today in the show, the latest on DOGE and what it may look like post-Elon. This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, Director of Consumer Tech and Culture here at WIRED.

Lauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode, I'm a Senior Writer at WIRED.

Katie Drummond: And I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's Global Editorial Director.

Michael Calore: So, I want to start by asking a question that we asked in our last deep dive on DOGE, because I think the answer may have changed since then. At this moment, just a few months into Trump's second term as President, May 2025, what exactly is DOGE?

Lauren Goode: Well, I wish it was a figment of our imagination.

Katie Drummond: Yes, I wish that it was a fever dream, but that is still the big question, incredibly enough. And I think at WIRED, we've actually been very careful when we characterize DOGE in our reporting, we often, or always, use the term, ""so-called."" The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, because it doesn't really actually exist.

And as some WIRED reporters pointed out last month, I think it was Zoë and Kate, it's almost a metaphysical question at this point. And that was in relation to employees at the General Services Administration, despite the fact that there are at least half a dozen DOGE operatives on payroll at that administration, despite the fact that there is a section of that building that is for DOGE use only and is a secure facility within the GSA, that the acting head of the GSA actually said, in an all-hands, that there was no DOGE team working at the GSA. Which begs the question, well, who are these people then and who do they work for?

I think in a more practical way, there are two DOGEs. There's US Digital Service, which was essentially hijacked and repurposed by the administration, now known as the US DOGE Service. Sure. And then there's a temporary organization within the US DOGE service, called, obviously, the US DOGE Service Temporary Organization. And that organization is ostensibly in charge of carrying out the DOGE agenda.

So, I think all of this semantic BS aside, what is DOGE? Well, it is the brainchild of Elon Musk. It is something that the president got on board with very early, and DOGE is effectively a collection of typically young, I think almost always male, technologists who come from companies that Musk and Peter Thiel do run or have run. Despite what the acting head of GSA says, there is a DOGE, and it is made up of these dozens and dozens of technologists who are working inside all of these different agencies. That is what DOGE is, whether it's a real department or agency or not, that's what it is. And we have a pretty good sense now, in May, of what they're actually doing.

Michael Calore: And it's important to note that they did make a number of hires, dozens and dozens of people who they hired to be a part of DOGE, who are now installed in various agencies around the federal government.

Lauren Goode: And a lot more layoffs too.

Michael Calore: Yeah. Well, we have been doing a lot of reporting on DOGE. As Katie, as you just mentioned, WIRED has been on top of the story ever since the beginning, because we know Elon and we know his playbook. So, what are some of the stories that WIRED has done over the last few months on DOGE that have just totally blown your mind?

Katie Drummond: Wow. There are a lot. I think the reporting that we have done around what DOGE is doing using AI and using all of the data that they've been able to access to actually surveil immigrants, I think that that reporting is incredibly disturbing. I think it is beyond the worst fears of folks in late January, early February as DOGE's work was getting underway, the idea that this kind of thing could happen and that it could happen so quickly, it certainly was talked about. It was speculated in terms of what do you think they're going to do? What are they after? There were a lot of hypotheses at the time. I don't think anyone anticipated that we would see that kind of work happen so quickly and in such a dystopian way.

And then, I think, it hasn't blown my mind, but I really like the coverage that we've done around how recruiting for DOGE happens. And we just published another story on this recently, I think it was a couple of weeks ago. It was in early May, from Caroline Haskins and Tori Elliot, that was about another round of recruiting that's happening for DOGE. And this recruiting always seems to happen in these Slack groups for alumni of various tech companies, this time it was Palantir, and this guy, this entrepreneur, went into the Slack room and basically said, ""Hey, I'm looking for people who would be excited to design and deploy AI agents who could free up at least 70,000 full-time government workers over the next year."" And in the way he phrased it, he was saying, ""These agents could free up these 70,000 people for,"" quote, ""higher impact work."" Which begs the question, higher impact work in the private sector after you fire all of them? Exactly what is the plan?

And that story was really interesting to me because of how, first of all, I think how the recruiting happens is really interesting. I think the fact that it's happening, they're specifically targeting alums from certain companies, that this is happening in Slack groups and message boards. I think that's interesting. But I thought that the way that message was received was fascinating, given that we're now in May. And so, people have seen DOGE play out over the last few months. We wrote, ""Eight people reacted with clown face emojis, three reacted with a custom emoji of a man licking a boot. Two reacted with a custom emoji of Joaquin Phoenix giving a thumbs down in the movie Gladiator. And three reacted with a custom emoji with the word 'fascist.'""

So, it was just interesting to me to note that alums of a company like Palantir are looking at that message, and at least some of them are saying, like, ""Nah, I see what you're doing here. And this is not only not compelling to me as a recruitment effort, but actually fascist.""

Lauren Goode: Now, I should mention that I happen to have been on a short book leave at the start of this year—

Katie Drummond: Good timing.

Lauren Goode: When ... Great timing. Katie knows I came back, and I was lamenting to her via our Slack, like, ""Katie, I'm literally never taking leave again because so much happened."" And starting in late January, I started to see WIRED's incredible reporting, watching it from afar and seeing all this news come out about DOGE, and just was like, ""What is happening?"" And one of the things that stood out to me almost immediately was this juxtaposition of cuts to the federal workforce and also cuts to federal spending, like the $1 limit that was placed on federal employees credit cards—

Michael Calore: Oh, gosh.

Lauren Goode: And how much this limited their ability to do their job, like running out of toilet paper, running out of printer paper, not being able to just do office functions as a federal employee, juxtaposed with Trump's incredibly lavish candlelight dinners and the crypto scheme we talked about last week, and all of the ways in which it seems like there are members of this administration who are simply lining their pockets as they have dispatched DOGE to make all of these cuts. If you just step back from that, it's hard to see, at this point, how this benefits America. What has actually happened here?

Michael Calore: I think probably my favorite story is one of our most recent ones about the Library of Congress, and how two gentlemen showed up to the Library of Congress and said, ""Hi, we work here. You need to let us in."" Capitol Police said, ""No. Who are you? Can you identify yourselves?"" And they showed him a note from DOGE saying that they worked there and that they should let them in. And the Capitol Police turned them away. And it turns out they did actually work there. They had a note from Daddy.

Lauren Goode: Please never call him that again.

Katie Drummond: Oh, boy.

Michael Calore: So, back when we first started talking about DOGE, at the beginning of the year, it was actually two people. It was Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. I think a week after we published that episode, Vivek was out.

Lauren Goode: Has anyone heard from Vivek?

Katie Drummond: I don't think about him. I don't know him. I don't know that man. No. Isn't he running for governor?

Lauren Goode: I was going to say he's running for governor of Ohio. Wasn't that the plan? I like how we're all Googling this.

Katie Drummond: He's pivoted.

Michael Calore: Well, it's important to think about who's running it now, because Elon says he's only going to be around one to two days a week. He says he will continue to do work for DOGE and for President Trump until the end of Trump's term, whatever year that may be. He's going to be scaling back. He's going to go on 20% time, basically. So, who are the people who are still there? Who are the people? Who are the names that we now need to know?

Lauren Goode: I think AI agents are going to be running all of it.

Katie Drummond: Well, obviously they're apparently replacing 70,000 federal workers with them within the year. Obviously, there are some very high-profile members of DOGE after just a few short months. There's Edward ""Big Balls"" Coristine, this 19-year-old appointed by Musk who owns Tesla.Sexy LLC. I'm sure everyone is familiar with Big Balls at this point. There are plenty of other young inexperienced engineers working across these agencies, and then there are the adults in the room. There are people like Steve Davis, who is one of Musk's, really, right-hand men who works closely alongside him at a number of his companies, and has been working with him in the federal government. And we also, of course, know that they are still actively recruiting, again, largely from companies that Musk himself own.

So, I think that the whole point of all of this is that, yes, Elon Musk is scaling back. So, let's say he scales back, let's say he decides to part ways with DOGE and the administration altogether. DOGE is already embedded in the federal government. He accomplished what he set out to do, in so far as we now have DOGE team members, DOGE operatives at dozens and dozens and dozens of federal agencies. They very clearly have their marching orders, they're carrying out work. So, at this point, you can't claw that all back, and that doesn't leave the federal government just because Elon Musk potentially leaves the government. The damage is done.

I do think it's important to note here, and I know this will come up over and over because I'm going to keep bringing it up. Elon Musk at two days a week, is a lot of Elon Musk. 20% of Elon Musk's time going to the federal government, sure, he won't be in the weeds seven days a week, 24 hours a day, but that's a lot of Musk time. So, I do think it's important to be cautious, and I just say this to all of our listeners and to everyone out there, this idea that Musk is disappearing from the federal government or disappearing from DOGE, the administration might want you to think that that's what's happening. I suspect that that is not at all what's happening. That said, from all appearances, Elon Musk might be less involved in DOGE, but DOGE is going to keep on keeping on.

Michael Calore: And while it's trucking, what is Elon going to be doing? What does he say?

Lauren Goode: Yeah, what is he going to be doing? Katie, do you have a sense of how much of this is related to the fact that Tesla isn't doing so well right now?

Katie Drummond: Well, I suspect that that's a big factor, but I think so much of the narrative externally, and even people at Condé Nast who have come up to me to be like, ""Elon, he's out. Is it Tesla? Why is he leaving DOGE?"" This is optics. This is narrative. His company is in the tubes, it is really struggling. They needed a way to change that story, and they needed a way to change that story very quickly. The best way that they could change that story was to say, ""No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. Elon Musk is not all in on DOGE and the federal government. He is going to be stepping back and he's going to be focusing on his other companies.""

Even just Trump saying that, Musk saying that, that being the narrative that plays out in the media is incredibly helpful for Musk, particularly in the context of Tesla, and just the board, and shareholders, and their confidence in his ability to bring this company back from the brink. So, do I think that he's pulling back and will be spending less time with DOGE? Yes. Do I think a lot of this was just smoke, and mirrors, and optics, and narrative and PR? Yes, it was incredibly well-timed right as Tesla was really, really, really in the tubes and getting a ton of bad press. Elon Musk makes this very convenient announcement, right?

Lauren Goode: Mm-hmm. Right. And this is something that the venture capitalist and Musk's fellow South African, David Sacks, has said, ""It's just what Musk does."" He said he has these intense bursts where he focuses on something, gets the right people and the structure in place, feels like he understands something, and then he can delegate. And he's just reached that point with DOGE. He's in delegation mode.

Katie Drummond: Yes, it seems like he has all the right people in place, and a structure that is so clear and transparent to the American people, that it's time for him to move on.

Michael Calore: And I do think that he is going to have to figure out the Tesla situation. As you said, the company's really struggling, and there are a lot of reasons for that. There are no new Tesla models for people to buy, even though they were promised. There have been a bunch of recalls. People are just hesitant about buying a new EV right now anyway, for a number of reasons. But it's really, it's him that people don't like. So much like the damage that he has done to the structure of the federal government with DOGE, similarly, he has done damage to Tesla, the brand, by his association with the policies of the Trump Administration, and his cozying up to the President, and his firing, and destroying the rights of people.

Katie Drummond: And isn't it also true that all of these problems with Tesla, all of the problems, aside from Elon Musk himself, those problems were happening or were poised to happen regardless, like issues with new models, with recalls, that all predates his work with DOGE, unless I'm drastically misunderstanding how time works. So, those problems with the company existed and were bound to become a bigger deal at some point, and then it really feels like his work with DOGE and the federal government just added fuel to the fire. He just poured gasoline on all of his company's problems by participating with the Trump Administration in the way that he did. But the fact that Tesla is a troubled company is old news, and has nothing to do with the fact that Elon Musk is not a well-liked individual. So, it's just problem on top of problem.

Michael Calore: That's right. That's right. And the damage is done, I think, at this point. He would probably have to move on from that company in order to fully turn it around.

Katie Drummond: Well, we still have a lot of time left in the year, so we'll see.

Michael Calore: All right, well let's take a break and we'll come right back.

Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. When we talked about DOGE at the beginning of the year, it still felt just like an idea. The tone was decidedly different. We talked about how the group was named after a meme coin, and we all had a good laugh at the absurdity of it all. It was still unclear what would happen. And of course, since then, DOGE has gutted multiple federal agencies, dismantled so many programs, fired a bunch of people, built a giant databases to track and surveil people, among other things.

Katie Drummond: So, I wasn't actually with you guys on the show when you talked about DOGE in January, but I was listening to the show, and I remember you talking about Musk's plans to, quote, ""open up the books and crunch the numbers to cut costs."" Sounds very exciting. And cutting some of those costs, of course, had to do with laying people off. Now, I remember that because Zoë Schiffer, who hosts the other episode of Uncanny Valley, said she would be surprised if any, quote, ""books were even opened."" So, what did we see actually happen from that prediction to now, from January to May?

Lauren Goode: I want to give Zoë a shout-out here because I think the context of that was me saying, ""Oh, I wonder how they're going to go about this careful, methodical process of doing the thing."" And so he was like, ""This is going to be utter chaos. They're not going to open any books.""

Katie Drummond: She was right. It has been chaos.

Lauren Goode: So we also said that the New Yorker reported Vivek had joked at one point that he was going to do a numbers game. You would lose your job if you had the wrong Social Security number. That didn't actually happen, but Zoë surmised at the time that this was potentially going to be run off of the Twitter/X playbook, run like a chaotic startup. And that's true. I definitely did think there would be more of a process to what DOGE was doing, so I was wrong. There was process. They have systematically terminated leases for federal office buildings, or taken over other buildings. They're reportedly building out this big master database. They've gutted public agencies like the CDC, and regulatory bodies like the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. So they've done a lot. I think the part where I thought there would be more process was around the people, the human capital of all this, like the federal workforce. And so, maybe in a lot of ways, this is just like some startup, you're acting recklessly and worrying about the human beings you're affecting later.

Michael Calore: And I think the thing that we also predicted correctly was that if DOGE has a chance to shape the regulatory agencies in the federal government, they would shape those agencies in a way that benefit people who are in their industry.

Lauren Goode: Right.

Katie Drummond: I think one of the questions you guys were asking back in January was whether or not the administration was bringing in these guys. It was Musk and Ramaswamy at the time, because they actually wanted them to advise on how technology is used as part of government services, as part of the way the government works, or because they thought the two would be influential over the types of regulations that are rolled back or introduced. So, man, it's crazy to even say all of that, knowing what we know now about ... It's just interesting, in January, we knew so little, we were so naive. But what do you think now about why Musk, in particular, was actually brought on board?

Lauren Goode: Well, honestly, I think that they have done both. WIRED has reported that DOGE is building out a master database of sensitive information about private citizens, and a database that will reportedly help them track immigrants. And we know they're playing around with these AI agents, like you just talked about, Katie. And so, we know that they were brought in to apply that technology building mindset to government services, if you want to call it that.

But I think that they also are influencing policy, because on the policy side, we've seen, I mentioned David Sacks, he's Trump's crypto and AI Czar, and he's been weighing in on cryptocurrency and stablecoin regulations. Even if that hasn't been pushed through yet, he's certainly in Trump's ear about it. Musk has also been pushing back on Trump's tariff policies. Musk has been expressing his opinion on immigration policies. Those are just a few examples, but safe to say, he has Trump's ear.

Michael Calore: I think at the beginning I was cautiously interested in the IT consultant part of it, like the DOGE mission to come in and modernize the federal government. Obviously, if you've ever dealt with federal government agencies, as a person who's computer-literate, sometimes you are just completely flabbergasted by the tools that you have to use to get access to services in this country. So yes, guys, come in, do your thing, zhuzh it up, make it work better. Of course, that is absolutely not what happened.

But I was excited about the prospect of that maybe happening. And it turns out that they really took the opportunity to take all of the data that are in all of these agencies and put it all together into one giant input, fed into various systems that are going to process that data and find efficiencies in ways that are probably going to affect human beings negatively. A computer is really good at doing very simple tasks over and over again. It doesn't necessarily understand the nuances of how things are divided up equitably among different sectors of society, it doesn't understand the nuances of people's personal situations. So, that's the modernization that we're going to see, I think, of government systems. And that's frightening, that wasn't what I was expecting.

Katie Drummond: Now, we've talked a little bit on and off in this episode already about AI. AI has played a much bigger role with DOGE than maybe we thought it would, maybe we hoped it would, in January. So, let's talk about that. As far as we know now, what does DOGE aspire to do with AI, and how were you thinking about that in January, if you were thinking about it at all?

Lauren Goode: I still feel like I don't really understand what they're trying to do with AI, frankly.

Katie Drummond: Maybe they don't.

Lauren Goode: We know at this point that there are AI officers and leaders in the federal government. We mentioned David Sacks before, who was put in charge of crypto and AI. There is now the first ever AI officer at the FDA, Jeremy Walsh. WIRED has reported that OpenAI and the FDA are collaborating for an AI assisted scientific review of products. Our colleague, Brian Barrett, has written about the use of AI agents. In particular, Brian wrote, ""It's like asking a toddler to operate heavy machinery."" Social Security Administration has been asked to incorporate an AI chatbot into their jobs. And we've also reported on how the GSA, the General Services Administration has launched something called the GSAI bot. But we also later found out that that's something that was based on an existing code base, a project that existed prior to DOGE taking over the building.

I think the short answer is that when DOGE first started, we didn't really have a clear sense of how they were going to use AI. And even right now, after saying all that on this podcast, I cannot pretend to understand fully what they are doing with AI. And that's either due to a lack of transparency, or just the fact that it all seems very disparate, very scattered. I'm not going to sit here on this podcast and pretend to make sense of it.

Michael Calore: With a lot of this stuff, it's hard to understand where the DOGE initiatives end, and where just other initiatives in the federal government begin. I think simply because there's a lack of transparency about how these decisions are being made, who's advising who, and who's really drafting the memos.

When we think about what is AI going to do, we have to consider what an AI agent is. It is a program that can do the same work as a human being. And that's just the broad definition of it. So, you can deploy an AI agent to write emails, make phone calls, fill out paperwork, whatever it is. You're just basically doing admin work, and there is a lot of admins in the federal government, and I think that that is in our future. People have this cozy idea that their experience with AI is maybe ChatGPT or Siri, or something like that. So, ""Oh, you have a problem with your taxes, you can just talk to the IRS chatbot and it'll solve it for you."" That sounds like a nightmare. I can't imagine that any IRS chatbot is going to be able to solve any problems for me. It'll probably just make me mad and make the problems worse or the same.

But when you think about, ""Okay, here is an opportunity for us to use these AI agents in a way that will increase efficiency across the government,"" what you're really talking about is just we don't need these people anymore and we just need to replace them with the technology.

Katie Drummond: One of the pieces of this that I think is so consequential, I remember maybe a year and a half ago, talking to a bunch of civil servants, people in decision-making roles across federal agencies, and they were all asking a lot of questions about AI. They were very curious about AI. The Biden Administration executive order had put forth all of these different demands of different agencies to investigate the potential for AI to do X, Y, or Z within their agencies. So they were in that exploratory process. They were very slow to think about how AI could be useful within those agencies, and that's for the bureaucracy reasons, but it's also because the work of these federal agencies, you don't really want to get it wrong.

When we're talking about the IRS or we're talking about payments from treasury, we're talking about evaluating new drugs via the FDA, you want to be right. You want to reduce the risk of error as much as possible. And I think for so many people in technology, there's this notion that technology outdoes human performance just inevitably. It's inevitable that a system will do a better job than a human being who is fallible, who makes mistakes. That said, what we know about AI so far, generative AI in particular, is that it makes a lot of mistakes. This is very imperfect technology. AI agents are not even really ready for primetime within a private company for one individual to use in their own home, let alone inside the federal bureaucracy.

So, I do think that a lot of what DOGE has done with AI, like Lauren, to your point about them building on top of this existing AI initiative at the GSA, is they're taking very preliminary work in AI at these agencies, and they're just fast tracking it. They're saying, ""This is going to take three years. No, no, we're doing this in three weeks."" And that's scary, given what we know about AI and how effective and how reliable it is right now. So, does anything stand out to you guys about that in the context of what we're talking about around AI and DOGE, and AI in the federal government? What are some of the risks that really stand out to you guys?

Lauren Goode: I think that it is consequential when you think about AI being used in such a way that it ends up impacting people's jobs, right?

Katie Drummond: Right.

Lauren Goode: But I actually think that that idea of AI agents doing the jobs of humans at this point is a little bit optimistic. And when I think about what feels more consequential, is this idea of AI just becoming a code word or a buzzword for what is essentially very, very, very advanced search. So, if they are able to build this master database that creates some sort of profile of every US citizen, or every US non-citizen, and is pulling in from all these different data sources, both within government agencies, but public documents, and across the web and across social media, and anything you've ever tweeted, and anything you've ever said, and anything you've ever done, and if you've ever gotten a parking ticket or a DUI, or you've committed a crime, or anything like that, to just hoover that all into one centralized location and be able to pull that up in a citizen of the drop of a hat, that, to me, feels more consequential and potentially more dangerous than going to the Social Security website and having an annoying bot trying to answer your questions for you.

Michael Calore: It's surveillance creep, really is what it is. And marry that with computer vision, like face recognition and the ability to photograph everybody who's in a car at the border, cross-reference that with government documentation like passports and driver's licenses, and you have a whole new level of surveillance that we have not dealt with before in our society.

Katie Drummond: Now, not to be all negative Nelly, because we often are, but does any ... What?

Michael Calore: What show are you on?

Katie Drummond: You know me, the Canadian. Does anything stand out to both of you as having actually been good from all of this? So, DOGE takeover January to May, anything potentially exciting? Any bright spots, anything where we should be a little bit more generous in our assessment and say, ""You know what, actually, as dystopian and scary as a lot of this is, this potentially a good thing, or this is unequivocally a good thing""? Anything like that that stands out to either of you?

Lauren Goode: I would say that if there's one area where we could be a little bit more generous, it might be that if this turnaround of the federal government was something that was being done in good faith, then I might give them a pass after just five months. I might say ... Katie, you've done turnarounds before?

Katie Drummond: I have.

Lauren Goode: They take longer than five months, right?

Katie Drummond: They do.

Lauren Goode: Yes. Okay.

Katie Drummond: Depends on the size of the organization. With the federal government, you're looking at five to 10 years.

Lauren Goode: Right. Exactly. So there's that. In terms of the actual cuts to fraud and abuse as promised, as far as we know and has been reported by other outlets, the actual cuts that DOGE has made fall far below what Trump and Musk had promised. Initially, they said that they were going to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. That goal was cut in half almost immediately. The latest claims are that 160 billion has been saved through firing federal workers, canceling contracts, selling off the buildings, other things. And PR just reported that the tracker on DOGE's own website is rife with errors and inaccuracies, though. The wall of receipts that DOGE has been posting totals just $63 billion in reductions, and actually, as of late March, government spending was up 10% from a year earlier. Revenue was still low. So, we're still in a deficit, in terms of federal spending.

There is one thing I've heard from folks in Silicon Valley they think is a good thing. It's Musk's pushback on some of Trump's immigration policies, specifically those that affect high-tech workers. During Trump 1.0, the denial rates for H-1B visa spiked, and Trump said he wanted to end, forever, the use of H-1 B visas, he called it a cheap labor program. Now, he has flip-flopped a bit. Stephen Miller, his Homeland Security Advisor, Deputy Chief of Staff, has been pushing for more restrictions on this worker visa. But Musk, who actually understands how critical this visa is for the talent pipeline in Silicon Valley, maybe because he's an immigrant, I think has managed to sway Trump a bit on that. And so, for obvious reasons, perhaps people in Silicon Valley say, ""Well, I think this is actually a good thing that Musk is doing.""

Michael Calore: I'll point out two things.

Lauren Goode: Go ahead.

Michael Calore: One, the LOLs. The press conference that they did in the Oval Office where Elon brought his child—

Katie Drummond: Oh, that was good.

Michael Calore: That was definitely a big highlight for me. But seriously, the other thing is that people are really engaged now. You talk to people who are somewhat politically minded, and they have opinions about government spending, they have opinions about oversight and transparency, they have opinions about what actually matters to them. Like what do they need from their government, what do they want their government to do for them. Those were all nebulous concepts even five, six months ago that I think are at the top of everybody's mind now. And I think that is a good thing.

Katie Drummond: Oh, I love that. A galvanized and engaged public—

Michael Calore: That's right.

Katie Drummond: As a plus side to DOGE. I love it. We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.

Michael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Before we wrap up, let's give the people something to think about, our recommendations. Katie, why don't you go first?

Katie Drummond: I have an extremely specific recommendation. Do either of you use TikTok?

Lauren Goode: I do sometimes.

Michael Calore: Define use.

Katie Drummond: Scroll.

Lauren Goode: Yeah, scroll maybe like once every couple weeks.

Katie Drummond: Do you thumb through TikTok?

Michael Calore: I'm familiar with it, yes.

Katie Drummond: There is an account on TikTok called Amalfi Private Jets. It is the account of a private jet company. This is the most genius marketing I have ever seen in my life. For someone who likes reality TV and trash, which is me. It's these little 60-second reality TV episodes, where the CEO of Amalfi Private Jets is on the phone or he's on a Zoom with one of his clients, often, I think her name is McKenna. She's a young, extremely wealthy, entitled little brat, and she'll call him up in the clip, he's at his office. He's young and handsome, and he's like, ""Hey, McKenna."" And she's like, ""Hey, Colin. So, my dad said that I had to fly from Geneva to London,"" and blah, blah, blah. And then there's this whole dramatic narrative around McKenna and why she needs a $75,000 jet immediately, and she needs it to have vegan spinach wraps refrigerated. It's just these very dramatic little vignettes of what life is like for the rich and fabulous who are calling Amalfi Private Jets to book their private jets. So there's that account.

And then, once you go down the rabbit hole of that account, the TikTok algorithm will start serving up these companion accounts they've created, like the CEO of the company has one, his girlfriend has one. I think McKenna now has one. And so, there's this little cinematic universe of Amalfi Private Jets on TikTok, and you get sucked in, and you get to know all of these people. And it's a little vertical video reality show experience that I highly recommend if you only have 60 seconds, which then turn into two hours, which then turn into pulling an all-nighter to learn everything about Amalfi Private Jets, their CEO, his girlfriend, and their wealthy clientele. This is the TikTok for you. Enjoy.

Michael Calore: This is genius.

Katie Drummond: Thank you.

Lauren Goode: This is the reality TV of the future.

Katie Drummond: It's incredible.

Lauren Goode: It has arrived.

Katie Drummond: And you know what? And I just did their job for them, because it's marketing for their company. They got me.

Michael Calore: All right, Lauren, what's your recommendation?

Lauren Goode: My recommendation might go nicely on your Amalfi Private Jet. Hear me out, peonies. You guys like flowers?

Michael Calore: Oh, peonies.

Lauren Goode: Peonies.

Katie Drummond: I like flowers.

Michael Calore: Sure.

Lauren Goode: Do you like peonies?

Katie Drummond: I couldn't tell one from another, but I like them.

Lauren Goode: They're beautiful. It's peony season here. I'm saying that now with the O annunciated, which is how I would do if I was giving my architectural digest home tour.

Michael Calore: I see.

Lauren Goode: Yes, these are peonies.

Katie Drummond: Oh, I'm just looking at Google images of them. They're very nice.

Lauren Goode: Aren't they beautiful?

Katie Drummond: They're very nice.

Lauren Goode: The cool thing is they do have a very short-lived season. In this part of the world, it's typically late May through June. If you plant them, they only bloom for a short period of time. If you buy them, they're these closed balls, not to be confused with Edward Coristine ""Big Balls."" They're these closed balls, and then after a few days they open up and they're the most magnificent looking things. They're really, really pretty. And I got some last week at the flower shop, and when they opened, I was like, ""Oh my God."" It just made me so happy. And they're bright pink. And so, if you're just looking to do something nice for yourself, or someone you just want to pick up a nice little thoughtful gift for someone, get them some peonies. You know what? I didn't check to see if they're toxic to pets. So, check that first, folks. But, yes.

Michael Calore: That's great.

Katie Drummond: Mike, what's yours?

Michael Calore: So, I'm going to recommend an app. If you follow me on Instagram, Snackfight in Instagram, you may notice that I have not posted in a long time, and that's because I stopped posting on Instagram, and I basically just use it as a direct message platform now. But there are still parts of my brain that enjoy sharing photos with my friends, so I found another app to go share photos on and it's called Retro.

Lauren Goode: Yeah, Retro.

Michael Calore: So, it's been around for a while, but I went casting about for other things out there, and I found that there was a group of my friends who are on Retro, and I was like, ""Oh, this is great."" It's very private. By default, somebody can only see back a couple of weeks. But if you would like to, you can give the other user a key, which unlocks your full profile so that they can look at all of your photos going back to the beginning of time, according to whenever you started posting on Retro. I really like that about it, the fact that when I post a photo, I know exactly who's going to see it. There are no Reels, there's no ads, there's no messaging features, there's no weird soft-core porno on there, there's no memes. It's just pictures. And I really like that. It's like riding a bicycle through the countryside after driving a car through a city. It's like a real different way to experience photo sharing, because it's exactly like the original way of experiencing photo sharing, and I'd forgotten what that feels like.

Katie Drummond: Oh, it sounds lovely.

Lauren Goode: What's cool about the app too is when you open it and you haven't filled out that week's photos, when you tap on it, it automatically identifies those photos from that week in your camera roll. It's like, ""You shot these photos between Sunday and Saturday, and here's where you can fill this weekend.""

Michael Calore: And—

Lauren Goode: It's pretty cool.

Michael Calore: And all the photos from the week stack up. So, if you post 12 photos, and then you look at my profile, you can just tap through all 12 photos, and then that's it. That's all you get.

Lauren Goode: Good job, Nathan and team.

Michael Calore: Who's Nathan? Who are you shouting out?

Lauren Goode: Nathan Sharp is one of the cofounders of it. He's a former Instagram guy. I think his cofounder is as well. It was founded by two ex Instagram employees. And the whole idea is they're trying to make, it's not the anti-Instagram, but it is more private.

Michael Calore: Feels like the anti-Instagram right now.

Lauren Goode: It's nice. It's a nice place to hang out.

Michael Calore: Well, thanks to both of you for those great recommendations.

Lauren Goode: Thanks, Mike, for yours.

Katie Drummond: Yeah, Mike, thanks.

Lauren Goode: Thanks, Mike.

Katie Drummond: Bye.

Lauren Goode: See you on the jet.

Global Accessibility Awareness Day was Thursday, so it's fitting that both Apple and Google have announced a raft of new accessibility features for their devices this week, all slated to land in the coming year.

First up, let's talk Apple. The headline is Magnifier support for Mac. This is integrated with Accessibility Reader, so you can use your iPhone camera to zoom in on a distant whiteboard or sign and magnify it on your MacBook screen, tweak contrast and colors to make it more legible, or extract the text into your preferred format.

For deaf and hard-of-hearing people, Apple has beefed up Live Listen by adding Live Captions support and extending it to the Apple Watch. You can use your iPhone's microphone to boost audio for AirPods or hearing aids with Live Listen, but with Live Captions, you can get instant transcription on your wrist. The Apple Watch can also serve as a remote control for capture, so you can leave your iPhone close to the speaker (ideal for a meeting, classroom, or lecture hall). You can also rewind if you missed something and review the transcript later.

Other noteworthy additions include Braille Access, which turns your Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Vision Pro) into a braille note taker, enhanced eye and head tracking for iPhone and iPad, plus new Accessibility Nutrition Labels in the App Store, which will allow people to see at a glance what accessibility features an app or game supports. You can find the full list on Apple's website. —Simon Hill

Google's accessibility update focuses in on existing Android and Chrome features, as well as some new ones aimed at Chromebooks in the classroom.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The relentless drive of AI has seen Google's Gemini enhance several existing services like Android's Talkback screen reader, which offers AI-generated descriptions of images for low-vision and blind folks. The company is expanding that integration, so you can now ask questions about those images, perhaps the material of a pictured dress or learning the make and model of a car. Google is also relying on AI to enhance its Expressive Captions to convey more emotion and tone.

Improvements to the Chrome browser enable you to use your screen reader to interact with PDFs to read, highlight, search, and copy text just as you would with any other page. Page Zoom has also been improved for Chrome on Android, so you can increase text size without affecting the webpage layout and customize your preferred zoom levels for different pages, bringing it into line with Chrome on desktop.

For students using Chromebooks in the classroom, Google has enabled hands-free navigation with Face control, which uses the webcam to track facial movements. The caret browsing setting enables folks with visual impairment to navigate and interact with web pages using a keyboard instead of a mouse. ChromeVox is a built-in screen reader that can read onscreen text aloud and will soon be able to output audio captions in braille when the Chromebook is connected to a braille display. Chrome also now features more natural-sounding voices for text-to-speech.

Finally, the College Board's Bluebook testing app (where students can take the SAT and Advanced Placement exams) can access all of Google's built-in accessibility features, including ChromeVox, Dictation, and the College Board's digital testing tools. —Simon Hill

Ever since Sonos bungled its app update last year, Sonos stans have been clamoring for a whole-home streaming alternative that reliably works. Chinese audio brand WiiM makes easy-to-use audio devices that support virtually every major streaming service. I've been enjoying the company's streaming player and stand-alone streaming speaker for months, with no issues playing music in different zones, starting Spotify jams with my wife on her phone and me on mine, and generally imbuing our home with music.

WiiM's latest is a smart speaker and wireless subwoofer that can take your system to the next level. The speaker, called the Sound, looks remarkably familiar to anyone who has seen an Apple HomePod and features a small, round display on the front to help you know when it's listening (and what is playing). It's capable of a room-filling 100 watts of sound and can be configured as a stereo pair if you have two. The subwoofer adds a bit of low-end extension and should be great for folks who want to use this system to fuel a dance party.

In addition to the two speakers, WiiM also announced a new streaming amp called the Amp Ultra which features a touchscreen and large physical volume knob. It looks like a great, affordable competitor to options from Cambridge Audio, Naim, and others. This amp has a dedicated subwoofer output and HDMI, so you can use it and your new subwoofer with your TV too. –Parker Hall

Sony hasn't sold an Xperia smartphone in the US for two years, which doesn't seem to be changing with the new Xperia 1 VII. The niche, expensive flagship Android phone continues the design language of previous Xperia devices, while combining the prowess of Sony's various hardware brands, from its Bravia TV and Alpha camera teams to the Walkman music department. For example, the new Xperia adds an artificial intelligence-powered Auto Framing mode to recognize humans during video capture—it records the whole scene, but it'll also provide a cropped close-up view of the person, so you can intermix footage despite using one camera.

From the Walkman team, Sony says the Xperia now has “high-quality sound components,” from adding gold to the solder on the audio jack to minimize transmission loss to upscaled music quality with DSEE Ultimate support. The phone's speakers have also been upgraded, with better treble and mid-bass output.

The Xperia 1 VII has flagship specs like any other high-end Android, from the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset to 256 GB of internal storage. However, unlike the competition, Sony's phone retains the microSD card slot for storage expansion and still has a headphone jack. It's available in the UK and Europe for £1,399 (€1,499).

Nothing announced this week that it is working with British hi-fi wizards KEF on “several acoustically co-developed” audio products that it said are already in progress and launching later this year. A few days later, it dropped a video on its YouTube channel announcing it was releasing its first pair of over-ear headphones this summer. The KEF partnership wasn't mentioned directly, but it feels safe to assume it is probably involved.

Some of the things the designers seem keen to address in the forthcoming cans include a better, easier-to-use design, more interesting and unique features, and a cheaper price than comparable headphones—all with a “better than AirPods Max” performance. Amen. —Verity Burns

We can see right through Audio-Technica's new turntable. Quite literally. Unveiled at High End Munich this week, the AT-LPA2 transparent deck has been labeled as the brand's “finest turntable yet,” delivering not just a striking design but the promise of a high-end analogue performance too. That's helped by a number of features—the acrylic platter and chassis aim to provide top-notch resonance control and minimize unwanted vibrations, there's an optical speed sensor positioned under the spindle for ensuring the most accurate playback speeds, and an external power supply to prevent any electrical interference affecting the turntable's sensitive audio components.

The AT-LPA2 will also come fitted with Audio-Technica's well-regarded AT-OC9XEN dual moving coil cartridge alongside a newly designed straight carbon-fiber tonearm and adjustable anti-skate mechanism. The interchangeable 110-gram and 130-gram counterweights should allow for broader cartridge compatibility, futureproofing it should you ever want to upgrade. It's available now for $2,000 (£1,699). —Verity Burns

Folks in the UK may be interested in Huawei's new wearable lineup (they won't come to the US). I've been wearing the headline-grabbing Huawei Watch 5 for the past few days, a luxurious new entrant to the smartwatch scene with a sleek design that combines sapphire glass with titanium or stainless steel. It runs Huawei's HarmonyOS but also works with Huawei's app on Android or iOS to bring notifications to your wrist (there's even an eSIM option). It boasts solid health and fitness tracking, partly thanks to a pressure sensor you can press with your other fingertip for ECG and PPG measurements, making it easy to track your heart health and blood oxygen levels. The display is nice and bright, and I've been getting around three days between charges with it set to always-on. (You can get around a week with it off.)

Elsewhere, the Huawei Watch Fit 4 and 4 Pro are the more affordable entries in Huawei's smartwatch lineup. With a rectangular design reminiscent of the Apple Watch, they mix sapphire glass and an aluminum body with a titanium alloy bezel. They look nice, but the thick bezel around the screen detracts a little from the design, and it's not very responsive, sometimes needing a couple of taps or swipes. Both are solid fitness trackers, but the svelte (9.3-mm) 4 Pro adds water sports tracking and a new Air Pressure Sensor. Neither requires daily charging, and they are relatively affordable.

Huawei also announced open-fit earbuds, the FreeBuds 6 and the MatePad Pro 12.2-inch 2025, an OLED tablet that can be paired with Huawei's Glide Keyboard. The Huawei Watch 5 (£400), Huawei Watch Fit 4 (£150) and 4 Pro (£250), and the Huawei Freebuds 6 (£140) are available now. There's no word on the price or release date for the tablet. —Simon Hill

French retro tech brand Rewind is releasing a boombox to sit alongside its excellent Walkman-style portable cassette player. In advance of its debut at the High End audio show in Munich, the company posted a video of the new GB-001 earlier this week—the GB apparently, and rather questionably, standing for “Ghetto Blaster” if the original, now deleted Instagram post is anything to go by. It's a single-deck device with clean lines that showcase two bright, backlit VU meters. There are four speakers onboard, with the company aiming for a neutral sound rather than an 1980s-style bass monster. The GB-001 will also function as a Bluetooth speaker and has battery power. —Martin Cizmar

Google I/O, the annual developer conference where we learn what's new from the search giant, kicks off on May 20 in Mountain View, California. (You'll be able to stream it here.) We're expecting to hear about the company's mixed reality plans at the show, but Google made several announcements this week. That includes a new design language for Android and an expansion of the Gemini assistant onto new platforms like Wear OS and Android Auto. Google's Find My Devices app is also rebranding to Find Hub, since it's now more than just a tool to find lost gadgets. You can read more about these updates here.

Android is also getting some fancy new security and privacy boosts. For example, Google is expanding its Scam Detection AI tool in the Google Messages app to flag more types of digital fraud, and there's a new Advanced Protection mode in Android 16 that offers extra security for at-risk users.

Y Combinator-backed startup Firecrawl is back on the hunt for AI agent employees. As we reported back in February, its first attempt didn't yield an AI worth hiring.

But it's now placed three new ads on YC's job board for “AI agents only” and has set aside a $1 million budget total to make it happen.

Within about a week after the new job posts went live, it had about 50 applicants, founder Caleb Peffer tells TechCrunch.

Firecrawl offers a web crawling tool that scrapes data from websites for LLMs. This is, Peffer admits, a shady part of the AI ecosystem where bad behaving web crawlers can sometimes pound websites like DDoS attacks. But Firewcrawl has gained popularity by trying to bring in some guardrails, he says. 

For instance, many of its customers are enterprises scraping their own data for internal LLM use. Some websites want their data included in chatbot responses, just like they want Google links, he says. Additionally, the tool honors robot.txt settings and can be set to only scrape a public website once and share the data with others.  

Consequently, one job opening is for a content creation agent “that never sleeps and always ships” that will autonomously produce “high quality” SEO-pleasing blog posts and tutorials on how to use its product, the startup's ad says. Firecrawl wants this AI to watch engagement metrics and use that to autonomously improve the audience for its content, too. 

In other words: the agent should decide what to create, create it, post it, measure the audience, and grow mastery from that feedback, autonomously. If you are a borderline AGI AI made for blogging, this could be the job for you. The advertised pay is $5,000 a month.

The company is also looking for a customer support engineer agent that will be tasked with crafting the AI workflow that responds to customer issues within two minutes and can handle tickets on its own, knowing when to escalate to a human. Previous experience doing customer support is requested. Pay is also $5,000/month.

The third opening is for a junior developer agent who'll be tasked with prioritizing incoming Github issues, writing documentation and writing code in TypeScript and Go. Once again, the pay also $5,000/month.

But here's the catch: Firecrawl is also hoping to hire human creator or creators behind these bots — and the $1 million budget is for hiring both agents and humans, though it's not clear how many years the budget is supposed to cover. The startup might hire the humans full time, or as contractors (which might make more sense if they're creating lots of agents for lots of companies). Firecrawl is also entertaining bids from other startups that specialize in creating the types of agents that it's looking for, say in customer service, Peffer says.

The truth is, the AI employee of Firecrawl's dreams doesn't exist yet. Maybe it never will.

“AI can't replace humans today,” Peffer says. ”The future, what we see, is a world where the next 10x engineers are operating armies of agents, AI systems that they're building, maintaining, and monitoring. What we want to do is work with people that want to be those agent operators.”

Firecrawl is not the only one. YC's job board is full of jobs for developers of agents. Will their creations ever replace them as Silicon Valley is continuously wishing? That's the real million-dollar question.

Epic Games is escalating its efforts to pressure Apple to allow its game Fortnite into its App Store, with a new court filing asking Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to require that Apple “accept any compliant version of Fortnite onto the U.S. storefront of the App Store.”

Epic and Apple have been engaged in a years-long legal battle over Apple's App Store policies, particularly the commissions Apple charges for in-app purchases.

The Fortnite publisher scored a major victory last month when Judge Rogers ruled that Apple was in “willful violation” of an injunction on anti-competitive pricing — a ruling that seemed to pave the way for Fortnite to return to the App Store, and more broadly, for developers to offer alternative payment options in their apps.

However, Apple said it will appeal the ruling, and on Friday, Epic said Friday the company is blocking Fortnite from both its U.S. App Store and preventing it from being released on the Epic Games store in Europe: “Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.”

Apple disputed this characterization, specifically the suggestion that it was blocking Fortnite outside the United States. Instead, the company said it asked Epic Sweden to “resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.”

But why block Fortnite in the United States? Epic released a letter signed by Mark A. Perry, an attorney representing Apple, telling Epic's lawyers that “Apple has determined not to take action on the Fortnite app submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction.”

In its filing, Epic argues that Apple is denying it “the ability to take advantage of the pro-competitive rules it helped usher in,” and “punishing” Epic “by shutting it out of the very market it has fought so hard to open — while sending a clear message to other developers not to challenge Apple's practices.”

Sonali De Rycker,  a general partner at Accel and one of Europe's most influential venture capitalists, is bullish about the continent's prospects in AI. But she's wary of regulatory overreach that could hamstring its momentum.

At a TechCrunch StrictlyVC evening earlier this week in London, De Rycker reflected on Europe's place in the global AI race, balancing optimism with realism. “We have all the pieces,” she told those gathered for the event. “We have the entrepreneurs, we have the ambition, we have the schools, we have the capital, and we have the talent.” All that's missing, she argued, is the ability to “unleash” that potential at scale.

The obstacle? Europe's complex regulatory landscape and, in part, its pioneering but controversial Artificial Intelligence Act.

De Rycker acknowledged that regulations have a role to play. Still, she said she worries that the AI Act's broad reach and potentially stifling fines could deter innovation at the very moment European startups need space to iterate and grow. While the goals of ethical AI and consumer protection are laudable, she fears the net may be cast too wide.

“There's a real opportunity to make sure that we go fast and address what we're capable of,” she said. “The issue is that we are also faced with headwinds on regulation.” 

That urgency is amplified by shifting geopolitics. With U.S. support for Europe's defense and economic autonomy waning under the current Trump administration, De Rycker sees this moment as a decisive one for the EU.  “Now that Europe is being left to fend [for itself] in multiple ways,” she said, “we need to be self-sufficient, we need to be sovereign.”

That means unlocking Europe's full potential. De Rycker points to efforts like the “28th regime,” a framework aimed at creating a single set of rules for businesses across the EU, as crucial to creating a more unified, startup-friendly region. Currently, the mishmash of labor laws, licensing, and corporate structures across the countries creates friction and slows down progress.

“If we were truly one region, the power you could unleash would be incredible,” she said. “We wouldn't be having these same conversations about Europe lagging in tech.”

In De Rycker's view, Europe is catching up. Cities like Zurich, Munich, Paris, and London are starting to generate their own self-reinforcing ecosystems thanks to top-tier academic institutions and a growing base of experienced founders. Accel, for its part, has invested in over 70 cities across Europe and Israel, giving De Rycker a front-row seat to the continent's fragmented but flourishing tech landscape. 

Still, on Tuesday night, she noted a stark contrast with the U.S. when it comes to adoption. “We see a lot more propensity for customers to experiment with AI in the U.S.,” she said. Meanwhile, U.S investors are “spending money on these kinds of speculative, early-stage companies. That flywheel keeps going.”

Accel, whose London team closed their newest fund with $650 million last year, can afford to lean in a bit more than many other regional players. It hasn't backed any of the major foundational AI model companies like OpenAI or Anthropic but is instead focused on the application layer. “We feel very comfortable with the application layer,” said De Rycker. “These foundational models are capital intensive and don't really look like venture-backed companies.”

Examples of promising bets include Synthesia, a video generation platform used in enterprise training, and Speak, a language learning app that recently jumped to a $1 billion valuation. 

De Rycker (who dodged questions about Accel's reported talks with another big name in AI), sees these as early examples of how AI can create entirely new behaviors and business models. “We're expanding total addressable markets at a rate we've never seen,” she said. “It feels like the early days of mobile. DoorDash and Uber weren't just mobilized websites. They were brand new paradigms.”

Ultimately, De Rycker sees this moment as both a challenge and a once-in-a-generation opportunity. If Europe leans too heavily into regulation, it risks stifling the innovation that could help it compete globally – not just in AI, but across the entire tech spectrum.

“We're in a supercycle,” she said. “These cycles don't come often, and we can't afford to be leashed.”

With geopolitical uncertainty rising and the U.S. increasingly looking inward, Europe has little choice but to bet on itself. If it can strike the right balance, De Rycker believes it has everything it needs to lead.

On Tuesday, asked by one attendee of the event what EU founders can do to be more competitive with their U.S. counterparts, she didn't hesitate. “I think they are [competitive],” she said, citing companies Accel has backed, including Supercell and Spotify. “These founders, they look no different.”

Chirps, trills, growls, howls, squawks. Animals converse in all kinds of ways, yet humankind has only scratched the surface of how they communicate with each other and the rest of the living world. Our species has trained some animals—and if you ask cats, animals have trained us, too—but we've yet to truly crack the code on interspecies communication.

Increasingly, animal researchers are deploying artificial intelligence to accelerate our investigations of animal communication—both within species and between branches on the tree of life. As scientists chip away at the complex communication systems of animals, they move closer to understanding what creatures are saying—and maybe even how to talk back. But as we try to bridge the linguistic gap between humans and animals, some experts are raising valid concerns about whether such capabilities are appropriate—or whether we should even attempt to communicate with animals at all.

Towards the front of the pack—or should I say pod?—is Project CETI, which has used machine learning to analyze more than 8,000 sperm whale “codas”—structured click patterns recorded by the Dominica Sperm Whale Project. Researchers uncovered contextual and combinatorial structures in the whales' clicks, naming features like “rubato” and “ornamentation” to describe how whales subtly adjust their vocalizations during conversation. These patterns helped the team create a kind of phonetic alphabet for the animals—an expressive, structured system that may not be language as we know it but reveals a level of complexity that researchers weren't previously aware of. Project CETI is also working on ethical guidelines for the technology, a critical goal given the risks of using AI to “talk” to the animals.

Meanwhile, Google and the Wild Dolphin Project recently introduced DolphinGemma, a large language model (LLM) trained on 40 years of dolphin vocalizations. Just as ChatGPT is an LLM for human inputs—taking visual information like research papers and images and producing responses to relevant queries—DolphinGemma intakes dolphin sound data and predicts what vocalization comes next. DolphinGemma can even generate dolphin-like audio, and the researchers' prototype two-way system, Cetacean Hearing Augmentation Telemetry (fittingly, CHAT), uses a smartphone-based interface that dolphins employ to request items like scarves or seagrass—potentially laying the groundwork for future interspecies dialogue.

“DolphinGemma is being used in the field this season to improve our real-time sound recognition in the CHAT system,” said Denise Herzing, founder and director of the Wild Dolphin Project, which spearheaded the development of DolphinGemma in collaboration with researchers at Google DeepMind, in an email to Gizmodo. “This fall we will spend time ingesting known dolphin vocalizations and let Gemma show us any repeatable patterns they find,” such as vocalizations used in courtship and mother-calf discipline.

In this way, Herzing added, the AI applications are two-fold: Researchers can use it both to explore dolphins' natural sounds and to better understand the animals' responses to human mimicking of dolphin sounds, which are synthetically produced by the AI CHAT system.

Outside the ocean, researchers are finding that human speech models can be repurposed to decode terrestrial animal signals, too. A University of Michigan-led team used Wav2Vec2—a speech recognition model trained on human voices—to identify dogs' emotions, genders, breeds, and even individual identities based on their barks. The pre-trained human model outperformed a version trained solely on dog data, suggesting that human language model architectures could be surprisingly effective in decoding animal communication.

Of course, we need to consider the different levels of sophistication these AI models are targeting. Determining whether a dog's bark is aggressive or playful, or whether it's male or female—these are perhaps understandably easier for a model to determine than, say, the nuanced meaning encoded in sperm whale phonetics. Nevertheless, each study inches scientists closer to understanding how AI tools, as they currently exist, can be best applied to such an expansive field—and gives the AI a chance to train itself to become a more useful part of the researcher's toolkit.

And even cats—often seen as aloof—appear to be more communicative than they let on. In a 2022 study out of Paris Nanterre University, cats showed clear signs of recognizing their owner's voice, but beyond that, the felines responded more intensely when spoken to directly in “cat talk.” That suggests cats not only pay attention to what we say, but also how we say it—especially when it comes from someone they know.

Earlier this month, a pair of cuttlefish researchers found evidence that the animals have a set of four “waves,” or physical gestures, that they make to one another, as well as to human playback of cuttlefish waves. The group plans to apply an algorithm to categorize the types of waves, automatically track the creatures' movements, and understand the contexts in which the animals express themselves more rapidly.

Private companies (such as Google) are also getting in on the act. Last week, China's largest search engine, Baidu, filed a patent with the country's IP administration proposing to translate animal (specifically cat) vocalizations into human language. The quick and dirty on the tech is that it would intake a trove of data from your kitty, and then use an AI model to analyze the data, determine the animal's emotional state, and output the apparent human language message your pet was trying to convey.

Together, these studies represent a major shift in how scientists are approaching animal communication. Rather than starting from scratch, research teams are building tools and models designed for humans—and making advances that would have taken much longer otherwise. The end goal could (read: could) be a kind of Rosetta Stone for the animal kingdom, powered by AI.

“We've gotten really good at analyzing human language just in the last five years, and we're beginning to perfect this practice of transferring models trained on one dataset and applying them to new data,” said Sara Keen, a behavioral ecologist and electrical engineer at the Earth Species Project, in a video call with Gizmodo.

The Earth Species Project plans to launch its flagship audio-language model for animal sounds, NatureLM, this year, and a demo for NatureLM-audio is already live. With input data from across the tree of life—as well as human speech, environmental sounds, and even music detection—the model aims to become a converter of human speech into animal analogues. The model “shows promising domain transfer from human speech to animal communication,” the project states, “supporting our hypothesis that shared representations in AI can help decode animal languages.”

“A big part of our work really is trying to change the way people think about our place in the world,” Keen added. “We're making cool discoveries about animal communication, but ultimately we're finding that other species are just as complicated and nuanced as we are. And that revelation is pretty exciting.”

Indeed, researchers generally agree on the promise of AI-based tools for improving the collection and interpretation of animal communication data. But some feel that there's a breakdown in communication between that scholarly familiarity and the public's perception of how these tools can be applied.

“I think there's currently a lot of misunderstanding in the coverage of this topic—that somehow machine learning can create this contextual knowledge out of nothing. That so long as you have thousands of hours of audio recordings, somehow some magic machine learning black box can squeeze meaning out of that,” said Christian Rutz, an expert in animal behavior and cognition and founding president of International Bio-Logging Society, in a video call with Gizmodo. “That's not going to happen.”

“Meaning comes through the contextual annotation and this is where I think it's really important for this field as a whole, in this period of excitement and enthusiasm, to not forget that this annotation comes from basic behavioral ecology and natural history expertise,” Rutz added. In other words, let's not put the horse before the cart, especially since the cart—in this case—is what's powering the horse.

But with great power…you know the cliché. Essentially, how can humans develop and apply these technologies in a way that is both scientifically illuminating and minimizes harm or disruption to its animal subjects? Experts have put forward ethical standards and guardrails for using the technologies that prioritize the welfare of creatures as we get closer to—well, wherever the technology is going.

As AI advances, conversations about animal rights will have to evolve. In the future, animals could become more active participants in those conversations—a notion that legal experts are exploring as a thought exercise, but one that could someday become reality.

“What we desperately need—apart from advancing the machine learning side—is to forge these meaningful collaborations between the machine learning experts and the animal behavior researchers,” Rutz said, “because it's only when you put the two of us together that you stand a chance.”

There's no shortage of communication data to feed into data-hungry AI models, from pitch-perfect prairie dog squeaks to snails' slimy trails (yes, really). But exactly how we make use of the information we glean from these new approaches requires thorough consideration of the ethics involved in “speaking” with animals.

A recent paper on the ethical concerns of using AI to communicate with whales outlined six major problem areas. These include privacy rights, cultural and emotional harm to whales, anthropomorphism, technological solutionism (an overreliance on technology to fix problems), gender bias, and limited effectiveness for actual whale conservation. That last issue is especially urgent, given how many whale populations are already under serious threat.

It increasingly appears that we're on the brink of learning much more about the ways animals interact with one another—indeed, pulling back the curtain on their communication could also yield insights into how they learn, socialize, and act within their environments. But there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as asking ourselves how we use the powerful technologies currently in development.

Silicon Valley's wealthiest and most galaxy-brained executives and venture capitalists went all-in on Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election, and their investment is starting to pay off. According to the Wall Street Journal, more than three dozen people who have either worked under or are associates of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have been placed in roles at federal agencies that oversee the businesses of their Silicon Valley bosses.

Per WSJ, at least 18 federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Labor, Treasury Department, and Department of Defense, all employ at least one person with ties to one of Trump's four favorite tech bros. Musk's network is the most robust, with connections now occupying more than a dozen agencies. But all of the execs are positioned to benefit, as they have managed to place their own people—current and former employees, lawyers, investors, and financial advisors—in positions that oversee, regulate, and award government contracts to their companies.

The WSJ found that companies founded, owned, or invested in by Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey have already snagged about $6 billion worth of federal contracts just since Donald Trump took office. And while some of the bidding process started before Trump's second term began, those companies are currently pitching themselves for many more contracts worth billions of dollars and will likely find themselves with a leg up in the procurement process.

There have been some high-profile wins for these companies in that time. Palmer's Anduril Technologies took over a government contract originally awarded to Microsoft to build mixed-reality goggles for the Army, which could ultimately pay out $22 billion. Musk's SpaceX scored $5.9 billion to launch Space Force missions. Thiel's Palantir got tapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to build software for deportation processing.

That's a solid payout for the billionaires, who have poured their own money into Trump's campaigns. Musk spent $290 million on the project of getting Trump back to the White House, while Andreessen gave at least $2.5 million, and Luckey gave at least $400,000. Thiel, unlike these more recently Trump-curious opportunistic ghouls, has been a long-time Trump backer and gave around $1.5 million to Trump-related groups going back to the 2016 election.

All of this is on top of the cuts that Musk has managed to make at all of these agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency, which will likely reduce the resistance these companies will see in regulatory pushback. It's hard to say some of those cuts didn't seem at least in part targeted. USAID, which Musk tried to close the doors on entirely, was reportedly investigating Starlink contracts at the time it got axed. Employees at the Food and Drug Administration tasked with overseeing reviews and applications related to Musk's Neuralink were fired. Staffers at the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration who were researching the safety of self-driving technology like Tesla's FSD were forced out, too.

Trump has always claimed his goal was to drain the swamp. Instead, it seems he's just handed control of the swamp over to tech titans, who are happily swimming in it.

One of Intel's latest processors, the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K, is now available at Amazon for one of its lowest prices. It has a recommended price of $404 and has been going for around $340 lately. Today, however, the price has plummeted to $269—one of the lowest CPU offers since it first released.

Just a couple of weeks ago, we saw a price drop on not only the Intel Core 7 265K and other editions in the line, such as the Intel Core Ultra 5 245K. In that post, we point out a possible caveat with an investment into the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K, mainly concerning the LGA1851 socket it relies on. This standard may be replaced soon and would require an upgraded motherboard to get a new processor, which makes for a substantial investment.

Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 265K: now $269 at Amazon (was $404)

The Intel Core Ultra 7 265K can reach speeds as high as 5.5 GHz. It has 20 cores for a total of 20 threads and has a peak TOPS of 33. You can use both PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 5.0 interfaces with this processor.

The Intel Core Ultra 7 265K has 20 cores—eight of which are dedicated as performance cores and twelve more dedicated as efficient cores—for a total of 20 threads. With Max Turbo enabled, the performance cores can reach speeds as high as 5.5 GHz. According to Intel, the peak TOPS for the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K is 33, thanks to its integrated graphics support and NPU.

This CPU supports PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 5.0 devices and can use up to 256GB of DDR5-6400. It has Integrated Intel Graphics, so you don't need a GPU to get started with the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K. The built-in NPU module is known as Intel AI Boost, which adds 13 TOPS to the device's capabilities.

Navi 33 XE silicon smiles for the camera

Photographs of a cancelled AMD RX 7000-series prototype have reportedly surfaced on X. According to GOKForFree, the GPU seems to be a working sample of what could have been the Radeon RX 7500. When tested using GPU-Z, it was shown to have 6GB of memory with a 96-bit bus, 1,536 shading units, and 64 ROPs.

By comparison, the AMD Radeon RX 7600 has 8GB of GDDR6 memory with a 128-bit bus, 2,048 shading units, and 64 ROPs. The graphics card was an incremental upgrade from the RX 6650 XT and competes directly with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060.

On the other hand, TechPowerUp lists an unreleased AMD Radeon RX 7500 XT with the same memory size as the unknown card, but with fewer shading units (1,024) and ROPs (32). So, it could be that this unknown GPU is the actual RX 7500 XT, with the details listed by TechPowerUp as those for the vanilla RX 7500. After all, it's unlikely that AMD will release an XT version of a base-spec GPU.

The unearthed card seems like a competitor to Nvidia's most affordable GPU offering. After all, the RTX 3050 also came in a 6GB variant, with more shaders but only half the ROPs. If Team Green released an RTX 4050 6GB, this GPU would probably comfortably land within the same performance and price bracket. However, because the RTX 4050 desktop GPU never arrived, AMD apparently thought it did not make sense to make an alternative to something that does not exist.

This is all for the better, since a 6GB GPU would age like milk for modern gaming. Even the 8GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti has been significantly falling behind its 16 GB brother, even encountering performance issues when attached to a PCIe 4.0 slot. So, if AMD released this GPU for the masses, it would only cause pain and misery to penny-pinching gamers.

GOKForFree could not adequately test the GPU, as it could only hit a maximum frequency of 300 MHz. This is likely because it lacks a proper driver, which is hindering the PC from fully utilizing what little muscle it has. This is an interesting view of what could have been AMD's last sub-$200 GPU, but I still think we should leave it and its 6GBs of VRAM in the past.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Because the CPU reaches its peak temperature (TJ Max) with air coolers like the one we're looking at with this review, I've measured the CPU package power to determine the maximum wattage cooled to best compare their performance. This is why you won't see results from the best AIO coolers in this chart.

It's important to note that thermal performance can scale differently depending on the CPU it's being tested with. First, we'll look at results with Intel's i7-14700K.



Looking at the results with Intel's Raptor Lake CPU, you might think this cooler isn't very impressive. It's the worst-performing result I have in this chart, outside of a compact SFF cooler. Let's take a look at how it handles AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D now.



This is a much more impressive result. With 219W cooled on average, Endorfy's Fortis 5 is able to handle the full “stock” power of AMD's flagship CPU (~200W) and has a little bit of room to spare to let PBO push the CPU beyond its typical performance.



Noise levels are where this cooler shines. While thermal performance on Intel's hottest CPUs isn't the greatest, this cooler isn't designed to win overclocking competitions. It's designed to provide quietly running, essential cooling performance. With a maximum noise level of 37.3 dBA, this cooler is the quietest product I've tested on Intel's Z790 Platform.

Finding the right balance between fan noise levels and cooling performance is important. While running fans at full speed can improve cooling capacity to some extent, the benefits are limited and many users prefer a quieter system.

For noise-normalized testing with Intel CPUs, I typically set the noise levels of the cooler to reach 38.9 dBA. But this presents a problem: Endorfy's Fortis 5 doesn't reach that level of noise! Because this issue prevents a proper comparison to the other results I've collected, I'll be skipping noise-normalized tests on Intel's Core i7-14700K.

Let's take a look at my initial noise-normalized results using AMD's flagship Ryzen 9 9950X3D instead. This chart is still lacking the amount of comparison results I'd like, as I've just started sting with this CPU. That said, let's take a look at what I have recorded thus far.



This test was run a little differently than I have done with previous tests on Intel CPUs. I've lowered the noise threshold of the CPU cooler down to 37.3 dBA, as some readers have indicated they consider 38.9 dBA “too loud” for this type of test. The other change is that I've measured the thermal performance of the cooler while also running Furmark 2 on MSI's RTX 4070 TI Super, increasing the heat inside the case and increasing cooling difficulty.

The results here are encouraging. With 195W cooled, that's almost the full power budget of AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D at “stock” settings while the system also handles the full heat of a GPU. It performed significantly better than Thermalright's impressive Royal Knight 120 SE in the same scenario!

My recent reviews have focused more on tests with both the CPU and GPU being stressed, but many have indicated they would like to see more CPU-only tests. So let's take a look at how Endorfy's Fortis 5 handles the Ryzen 9950X3D with default power levels, which limits consumption to ~200W.



Going by temperature data alone, the results aren't very impressive here. The CPU reaches a toasty 83.7 degrees. But that really doesn't matter, because it keeps the CPU under its peak temperature and does so while running very quietly, at or below the lowest measurement my noise meter can measure, at 36.4 dBA. This means the true measurement of noise level might actually be lower.



Testing a CPU Cooler in isolation is great for synthetic benchmarks, but doesn't tell the whole story of how it will perform. If your GPU is running a full load, that heat doesn't just disappear – it makes it harder for your CPU cooler to do its job due to the increased heat within your computer case.

The CPU power limit of 150W was chosen based on the worst CPU power consumption I've seen reported in gaming with AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D. In my personal experience, most games use much lower power, but this might be biased by the games I play.



Again, looking at thermal performance alone would give you the incorrect assumption that this cooler is not impressive. The important thing is that the CPU is operating well under its peak temperature, and the cooler is running whisper quiet – 36.4 dBA!





The last round of test results we'll look at in today's review is a test with a 140W power limit imposed. This level of power is much easier for most CPU coolers to handle. But I've recorded lower power results for comparisons with SFF and air coolers for future reviews.



As with previous results, Endorfy's Fortis 5 keeps the CPU within reasonable thermal values while running whisper quiet.



Endorfy's Fortis 5 ARGB is a single tower air cooler with whisper-quiet noise levels, intended for users who value silent operation over maximum thermal performance. It's powerful enough to handle AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D at stock settings, handling 219W when power limits were removed. However, the performance on Intel CPUs was not as impressive. If you're looking to compete in overclocking competitions or running a previous-generation Core i9, you might want to pass on this one. But for everyone else, this is the level of cooling I'd recommend for AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D, so anything lesser should also run below thermal thresholds and extremely quiet with this cooler.

Palm oil derives from the fruit of the oil palm tree. Its high fat content has led to concerns that it may raise cholesterol levels and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is little scientific evidence to support such concerns.

There are two main types of palm oil: red and white. The latter has undergone a process of refinement, bleaching, and deodorization and contains fewer micronutrients like beta carotenes and vitamin E. As such, researchers consider red palm oil to be the healthier option.

This article considers whether palm oil is bad for health and whether it may have any health benefits. It also provides some nutritional information on palm oil and outlines some important environmental considerations when choosing palm oil and palm oil products.

Authors of a 2020 review note that consuming palm oil in moderation and as a part of a balanced diet does not present known health risks.

People may be concerned that palm oil's saturated fat content can have adverse health effects. A 13.6-gram (g) tablespoon of palm oil contains 13.6 g of fat, of which 6.7 g is saturated fat. Saturated fats are known to increase cholesterol levels, which can increase the risk of heart disease.

Interestingly, the research surrounding the consumption of palm oil and its effect on blood cholesterol levels suggests that palm oil may have some benefits. 

A 2021 review investigated the effect of palmitic acid on cholesterol levels. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid that derives from both vegetable and animal sources. The review concluded that palmitic acid from palm oil and other vegetable sources has less effect on blood cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad cholesterol” than palmitic acid from animal sources. 

The review also added that a chemical compound in palm oil called tocotrienols actually lowered blood cholesterol levels by 7% to 38%.

An earlier 2018 systematic review also found no evidence to support an association between palm oil consumption and CVD. However, the reviewers noted difficulties in quantifying the true association between the two variables and called for further research in this area.

As a 2021 review notes, there are two main types of palm oil: red palm oil and “refined, bleached, deodorized” (RBD) palm oil. Some people refer to the latter as “white” palm oil.

According to the review, red palm oil contains a higher concentration of antioxidants and micronutrients, such as:

The refinement process involved in creating RBD palm oil results in lower levels of carotenoids, vitamin E, and sterols. Therefore, RBD palm oil possesses fewer health benefits than red palm oil.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, one 13.6g tablespoon of palm oil contains the following nutrients and micronutrients:

As the World Wildlife Federation (WWF) explains, palm oil is an efficient, high-yield crop that provides a steady income for growers and smallholders. However, the palm oil industry is causing large-scale deforestation, destroying habitats for critically endangered species, and contributing to climate change across the globe. As such, the WWF encourages individuals to make ethical choices when it comes to purchasing palm oil.

The WWF advises people to look for palm oil and palm oil products featuring the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. This global certification indicates that the palm oil growers and manufacturers have adhered to the following sustainability practices:

Palm oil is not a seed oil. Palm oil derives from the fruit of the oil palm tree. It is not the same as palm kernel oil, which derives from the kernel or “stone” inside the fruit.

Palm oil is not a seed oil. Palm oil derives from the fruit of the oil palm tree. It is not the same as palm kernel oil, which derives from the kernel or “stone” inside the fruit.

Palm oil derives from the fruit of the oil palm tree. There are two main types: red palm oil and white palm oil. Red palm oil contains more micronutrients, making it a healthier option. However, both types are high in saturated fat, leading some people to speculate that it may raise cholesterol levels and increase the risk of CVD.

However, little research supports the notion that palm oil consumption increases the risk of CVD. On the contrary, some research has found that consuming red palm oil may reduce cholesterol levels due to its high concentration of cholesterol-lowering plant sterols.

People who decide to add palm oil to their diet should consider the environmental impact of this decision. Individuals should look for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification, which indicates adherence to the most robust environmental and human rights policies. 

People should also check with a doctor to ensure that they can safely consume palm oil without it interfering with other medications or supplements they may be taking.

 May 17, 2025  

ORLANDO, Florida — Sotagliflozin (Inpefa) reduces A1c and body weight in people with type 2 diabetes, although the degree of improvement was attenuated in those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

""These findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of kidney function to help inform and tailor treatment decision-making for patients with diabetes and CKD,"" Belinda Hardin, PharmD, senior director of medical communications and head of field medical at Lexicon, said at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Annual Meeting 2025.

Sotagliflozin, a novel agent that inhibits sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1 as well as SGLT2, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 for reducing the risks of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits in patients with heart failure, and for preventing these same events in patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. 

The drug is not indicated for diabetes. In 2019, the FDA declined to approve sotagliflozin as adjunctive treatment for type 1 diabetes due to concerns about the increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. And in 2024, the agency again turned down Lexicon's application for sotagliflozin as a treatment for people with type 1 diabetes and CKD. The company hasn't sought an indication for sotagliflozin for type 2 diabetes.

Two SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance), have indications for preventing heart failure hospitalizations in patients with heart failure as well as approvals for type 2 diabetes and preservation of renal function. 

The new findings, from a meta-analysis of eight double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, suggest that despite the lack of an indication for treatment of diabetes or obesity, sotagliflozin does result in A1c and body weight lowering across all levels of kidney function. This study is a companion to a previous similarly designed analysis showing that the effects of sotagliflozin on systolic blood pressure were maintained in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of kidney function. Those findings were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Session 2024, Hardin told Medscape Medical News. 

Asked for comment, session moderator Sara E. Lubitz, MD, associate professor of medicine and endocrine program director at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey, told Medscape Medical News: ""This opens my mind more that if there is a heart failure patient with diabetes and we're looking for sugar reduction as well as heart failure protection, [sotagliflozin] is probably just as efficacious as the SGLT2 inhibitors...that have the indication for glucose-lowering, but we're not pulling it out as a first-line [treatment]."" 

All eight trials in the meta-analysis had similar designs and timeframes and were at least 26 weeks in duration. The patient-level intent-to-treat population data were pooled. Patients were divided into three subgroups based on kidney function: 

Mean patient ages were 60.2 years in subgroup 1, versus 69.3 and 67.1 years, respectively, in subgroups 2 and 3. The treatment groups were sotagliflozin 400 mg (N = 1728), sotagliflozin 200 mg (N = 728), or placebo (N = 1440). 

Overall, compared with placebo, A1c was significantly lowered with 200-mg sotagliflozin (less mean squares [LMS] difference, –0.33) and 400 mg (LMS difference, –0.48). Body weight was also reduced (LMS difference, –1.48 and –1.66, respectively). 

The effects on both A1c and body weight of both doses were statistically significant for the overall study population and subgroup 1 (normal kidney function). In subgroup 2, the effect on body weight remained significant for both doses, but only the 400-mg dose effect was significant for lowering A1c. 

The 400-mg dose produced significant reductions in all kidney function subgroups for both measures except A1c reduction in subgroup 3, although there was still benefit. 

Hardin told Medscape Medical News, ""This provides us supplemental information with regard to heart failure outcomes, and not directly focusing on whether there's an additive benefit in terms of A1c or an additive lowering of A1c in patients with chronic kidney disease.""

Asked about future plans for sotagliflozin, she replied, ""I don't think at this point you'll likely see sotagliflozin before the FDA for a glucose-lowering indication in type 2 patients. The file remains open for type 1 at the FDA, so that work continues."" 

Hardin is an employee of Lexicon. Lubitz is a speaker for Ascendis and has received clinical trial research funding from Ascendis, Chiasma, and Takeda.

Intakes of dietary fiber, high-quality and total carbohydrates in midlife were favorably linked to healthy aging and other positive health outcomes in older women, according to a new study by researchers from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The study was published May 16 in the journal JAMA Network Open.

We've all heard that different carbohydrates can affect health differently, whether for weight, energy, or blood sugar levels. But rather than just look at the immediate effects of these macronutrients, we wanted to understand what they might mean for good health 30 years later. Our findings suggest that carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging.""

Andres Ardisson Korat, scientist at the HNRCA and lead author of the study

The researchers analyzed data from Nurses' Health Study questionnaires collected every four years between 1984 and 2016 to examine the midlife diets and eventual health outcomes of more than 47,000 women who were between the ages of 70 and 93 in 2016. Intakes of total carbohydrates, refined carbohydrates, high-quality (unrefined) carbohydrates, carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, dietary fiber, and the dietary glycemic index and glycemic load were derived from the validated food-frequency questionnaires. The researchers defined healthy aging as the absence of 11 major chronic diseases, lack of cognitive and physical function impairments, and having good mental health, as self-reported in the Nurses' Health Study questionnaires. In the new study, 3,706 participants met the healthy aging definition.

The analysis showed intakes of total carbohydrates, high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, and total dietary fiber in midlife were linked to 6 to 37% greater likelihood of healthy aging and several areas of positive mental and physical health. In the other direction, intakes of refined carbohydrates (carbohydrates from added sugars, refined grains, and potatoes) and starchy vegetables were associated with 13% lower odds of healthy aging.

""Our results are consistent with other evidence linking consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes with lower risks of chronic diseases, and now we see the association with physical and cognitive function outcomes,"" said senior author Qi Sun, associate professor in the departments of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard Chan School.

The authors note as a limitation that the study population was composed mostly of white health professionals; future research will be necessary to replicate these findings in more diverse cohorts.

Ardisson Korat also noted that additional work is needed to understand the potential mechanisms linking dietary fiber and high-quality carbohydrates to healthy aging.

""Studies are starting to find an association between food choices in midlife and quality of life in later years. The more we can understand about healthy aging, the more science can help people live healthier for longer,"" added Ardisson Korat.

The study was supported by a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and by the National Institutes of Health under award numbers K12TR004384, R01DK120870, U2CDK129670, R01DK127601, R01HL060712.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals how acetaminophen may actually relieve pain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250516/Study-reveals-how-acetaminophen-may-actually-relieve-pain.aspx","Sat, 17 May 2025 01:53:00 GMT","

A new study from Indiana University scientists may aid the pharmaceutical industry in better understanding a popular over-the-counter pain reliever: Tylenol.

Michaela Dvorakova, a postdoctoral researcher at IU's Gill Institute for Neuroscience and the College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, and Gill Institute research scientist Alex Straiker published the study in Cell Reports Medicine. Their discovery, which details a previously unknown way the drug targets pain, could change how pharmacologists think about treating pain, and aid in designing safer and more effective pain medications.

The researchers found that acetaminophen inhibits an enzyme that makes one of the endogenous cannabinoids, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, or 2-AG. Endocannabinoids are produced by the body to activate CB1 receptors, the same receptor that produces the psychoactive effects of cannabis.

Though acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol or paracetamol, is the most common pain and fever reliever in the U.S., how it relieves pain is still a mystery.

There are hypotheses, but we still don't know precisely how it works. Up until now we thought that elevated endocannabinoids in our body meant less pain, but our study shows that in the case of 2-AG, it might be the opposite. Actually, reduced levels of 2-AG leads to decreased pain.""

Michaela Dvorakova, postdoctoral researcher at IU's Gill Institute for Neuroscience

In high doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver. Acetaminophen toxicity causes around 500 deaths per year in the U.S. and is the second leading cause of liver transplantation around the world. Due to its wide availability and its combination in other products, more than 60 million Americans consume acetaminophen weekly, making it crucial to understand how it targets pain receptors.

""If you don't know what the target is, you can't design an alternative,"" Straiker said. ""Our research suggests that this enzyme might be the target, in which case you can start developing drugs that target that specific enzyme but without that toxicity.""

There was skepticism in the research community about a new mechanism of action for acetaminophen, Straiker said. When 50 years of research showed that activating CB1 receptors produced pain relief in the body, scientists settled on that concept.

""It can be hard to break through that dogma,"" Straiker said.

Going forward, the research team is looking into evaluating other common pain relievers, like ibuprofen and aspirin, to determine whether they have similar mechanisms of action.

Additional authors of the study include Ken Mackie from IU's Gill Institute, as well as Taryn Bosquez-Berger, Jenna Billingsley, Natalia Murataeva, Taylor Woodward, Emma Leishman, Anaëlle Zimmowitch, Anne Gibson, Jim Wager-Miller and Heather Bradshaw from the Gill Institute and the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences; Ruyi Cai, Shangxuan Cai and Yulong Li from the Peking University School of Life Sciences; Tim Ware from Scripps Research Institute; and Ku-Lung Hsu from University of Texas at Austin.

Filed under:

The World Cup could be saying Aloha to the United States again.

After the 2026 World Cup and (likely) the 2031 Women's World Cup leaves the United States, we may not have to wait long for the biggest tournament on the planet to return. The Athletic's Adam Crafton is reporting that at the recent FIFA Congress, which took place this week in Paraguay, New Zealand has explored plans to partner with the United States and Fiji to bid for the 2038 World Cup. 

The 2030 World Cup is already confirmed for Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, while the 2034 World Cup will be in Saudi Arabia. That means for 2038, unless FIFA decides to change its bid procedure, only bids from Oceania and Concacaf will be accepted. 

Enter New Zealand, who co-hosted the 2023 Women's World Cup with Australia. However, with Australia being a part of the Asian Football Confederation, they are not allowed to band with their island neighbor to bid on 2038 with the confederation hosting in 2034. That is forcing New Zealand to get creative in exploring a possible bid. That creativity, according to Crafton's report, includes partnering with the United States and Fiji.

NEW: Inside FIFA congress
  FIFA reduce Club World Cup prices again, many group games now available for $30
   New Zealand target 2038 trans pacific World Cup, seeking co-hosts, which may mean USA + Fiji (!)
  Infantino's Trump ties worrying Canada + Mexico 

www.nytimes.com/athletic/636...

Fiji has long wanted to build a stadium that they think would be capable of hosting big time matches, and it would add to New Zealand's potential plan for a 2038 World Cup that could have at least 48 teams but potentially 64. Part of those plans could also include hosting matches in Hawaii, who is building a new stadium to replace Aloha Stadium. The new stadium would be less than the old stadium's 50,000-seat capacity, but could be temporarily expanded for a World Cup. Finally, there would in theory be matches in the continental United States, creating a trans-Pacific affair.

With both the men's and women's World Cups now at 48 teams and lots of serious chatter about expanding the men's tournament to 64 teams, FIFA has now created an issue that only some nations could bid for the World Cup without partnering with a co-host. That increases the complexity of the logistics for players, staff, and fans to get from one place to another. That includes visas, accommodations, and flights even before you get to the match tickets. A trans-Pacific World Cup would see teams and fans potentially flying 15 hours or more to get from a match in New Zealand to a match on the west coast of the United States, which means jet lag could be a major factor. For the USMNT, it would mean that after two rotations, they would once again automatically qualify for a World Cup as the co-hosts.

There's also the possibility that FIFA could allow other nations from confederations that are technically excluded from consideration. Concacaf president and FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani has reportedly encouraged England to bid for the 2038 World Cup. England, who are joining the rest of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - as the likely hosts of the 2035 Women's World Cup, have not hosted the men's tournament since 1966. An England bid, if allowed by FIFA, could be seen as a more popular option, especially if paired with another country. For New Zealand, if England is allowed to bid for the World Cup, they could ask for an exemption to co-host with Australia. However, that feels unlikely given that Asia (Saudi Arabia) is hosting in 2034 and they won't allow a confederation to host two consecutive World Cups. That mean pairing with the United States feels like the best chance New Zealand have of hosting the men's World Cup.

There's a long way to go before FIFA decides on the 2038 World Cup. But, it's possible that American fans may once again have matches end up on our soil 13 years from now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Real Madrid Complete Transfer of Bournemouth and Spanish Defender Dean Huijsen","https://www.si.com/onsi/soccer/real-madrid/transfers-and-rumors/real-madrid-complete-transfer-of-bournemouth-and-spanish-defender-dean-huijsen","Sat, 17 May 2025 13:18:37 GMT","

It has been expected, but earlier, Real Madrid announced the signing of Bournemouth Center-back Dean Huijsen. Both clubs announced on their respective websites that the deal has been completed.

Los Blancos have agreed on a five-year contract with the player, and he will join up with the squad on June 1. The early arrival was negotiated between the two clubs so the Spaniard could participate in the FIFA Club World Cup in June.

MORE: Report Reveals How Much Dean Huijsen Will Make at Real Madrid as Deal Draws Closer

Xabi Alonso should be officially announced as the head coach before then, and he is said to have been a big part of the signing. Los Blancos reportedly activated the $66 million release clause, which the club will pay before the end of 2026, in three instalments.

The Cherries bought Huijsen from Serie A side Juventus for around $17 million before the 2024-25 season. The Dutch-born defender has been a revelation for the Premier League side this season and has been nominated for the Young Player of the Year award.

Huijsen, who received his first Spain international call-up in March, also featured in both UEFA Nations League games against the Netherlands. He could be the future at center-back alongside current Real player Raul Asencio, who also received his first call-up in March.

Alonso looks to have two new signings for the Club World Cup in the US in June, with the expectation of Trent Alexander-Arnold joining. However, they must agree on a fee with Liverpool for his early release as his contract expires on June 30.

In the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, representatives from 211 nations and territories assembled this week for the 75th FIFA Congress. This was not an obvious contender to be a dramatic affair because the agenda was relatively light. Yet in the space of a few days, civil war broke out within the FIFA Council, which is the decision-making body that sits at the top of the organisation.

The drama began when The Athletic revealed last week that FIFA president Gianni Infantino would not be attending a scheduled in-person meeting of the FIFA Council in Paraguay on Tuesday, making it a virtual call and instead joining President Donald Trump on a visit to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. This rankled several members of the Council, but matters really blew up on Thursday morning when flight tracking data of a Qatari private jet travelling from Doha — via Lagos in Nigeria — showed that Infantino appeared to still be in the air to Paraguay, delaying the Congress by three hours.

Despite Infantino's apologies when the meeting finally began, the eight UEFA (European) members of the Council walked out midway through the Congress. A UEFA statement chastised the late changes to timings and accused Infantino of making changes “for what appears to be simply accommodating private political interests”. Victor Montagliani, the FIFA vice-president and president of Concacaf, later said “two wrongs do not make a right” in response to UEFA's walk-out.

This was just one flashpoint during what became a tricky week for FIFA in South America, and The Athletic was present, speaking to federations, stakeholders and insiders to uncover, among other matters:

This summer's revamped and expanded FIFA Club World Cup tournament will see 32 teams from across the world compete to win a tournament hosted across 11 cities in the United States. However, the general public in the U.S. do not seem as smitten with the idea as either Infantino, whose name is inscribed twice on the trophy, or the competing teams, who now have $1billion (£753m) of prize money to play for.

The Athletic can reveal that FIFA's quest to fill stadiums is floundering to the extent that the organisation has now dropped the price of tickets once again, having unveiled a new tier of lower pricing for games during the tournament. In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA confirmed: “New batches of more affordable match tickets have been released this week on FIFA.com/tickets.” The organisation did not clarify what this new bracket refers to, but tickets on FIFA's partner Ticketmaster are now showing up as vastly reduced compared to the lowest prices that were available to fans earlier this year.

For example, as of Friday morning, the lowest priced tickets for the following group stage matches involving major European sides were presenting lowest-priced options of $30 or less: Manchester City v Al Ain in Atlanta, Inter v Urawa Red Diamonds in Seattle, Paris Saint-Germain v Botafogo in Pasadena, Chelsea v Esperance de Tunis in Philadelphia. Other games involving teams unfamiliar to many in the United States, such as the Korean team Ulsan HD against the South Africans Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, are available for $28.

FIFA has been operating a “variable pricing model” for this tournament, which is more commonly known as dynamic pricing. When demand is high, this can lead to prices skyrocketing, while when demand is low, it can work in the favour of the consumer and lead to lower prices. The lowest priced tickets on general sale for the semi-finals are showing at about $300, which is substantially down on FIFA's original aims a few months ago, while the cheapest ticket on general sale for the final is currently $538, but thousands of seats remain available.

Some prices appear to have remained more resilient, particularly group games involving Real Madrid. Via general sale, the cheapest seat for their game against Saudi side Al Hilal is $194.38, while it is $101 against Mexican side Pachuca and $100 against Red Bull Salzburg, despite 20 sections of the stadium in Philadelphia showing 100+ seats remaining available for non-luxury seating. FIFA has been buoyed by the take-up for some games, such as Boca Juniors against Bayern Munich, which is scheduled for a Friday night in June at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. Other venues, most notably the 90,000-capacity Rose Bowl, are braced for lots of empty seats. FIFA recently announced it had gifted 30,000 tickets for matches in Los Angeles to first responders who fought the wildfires that recently devastated the region.

Several sources familiar with the planning of the tournament, who spoke anonymously to protect relationships, said FIFA believe the U.S. is a late-buying market for sports events and is hoping that interest will build throughout the tournament.

There is some good news for fans, as supporters who acquired tickets via their club's allocation may be in line for partial reimbursements if prices for equivalent seating within stadiums have dropped since they first bought their tickets. FIFA is in contact with clubs to explore the possibility of partial refunds to supporters who bought tickets in the current and previous sales periods.

FIFA has already wrapped up the locations for the 2030 and 2034 men's World Cup, which means plenty at the Congress were already thinking about where the tournament may end up in future editions.

Under FIFA's confederation rotation principle, two tournaments need to pass by before a single confederation is able to host a World Cup again. In 2030, three confederations are hosting the World Cup because FIFA has split the tournament between South America, Africa and Europe, playing games in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Then, in 2034, the Asian confederation has the tournament in Saudi Arabia. This rules out those four confederations, which leaves only Concacaf and Oceania as potential destinations for 2038.

This means, under the current rules at least, a return to the United States, just 12 years after the men's World Cup in 2026 and (almost certainly) the women's World Cup in 2031, may well be the likeliest outcome if FIFA enforces the principle.

One federation has already made clear that it is interested in exploring hosting arrangements for the tournament, and that is New Zealand. Ordinarily, we might expect New Zealand to partner with neighbouring Australia, but Australia is part of the Asian confederation, which would rule it out of hosting in 2038 due to Saudi Arabia's host status for 2034. This leaves New Zealand, who co-hosted the 2023 women's World Cup with Australia, seeking more innovative options.

During an extended interview with The Athletic in Paraguay, the New Zealand federation CEO Andrew Pragnell said: “It's clearly not realistic we could ever host one on our own. They're getting bigger and the capacity requirements are well known. But we are certainly capable of hosting a group and a couple of knockout games, so the key for us is partnership. Given the limited stadium sizes in the rest of Oceania, we have to partner.

“We have raised it, within FIFA in meetings and in conversations. We haven't formalised it. What's really interesting is the way that 2030 is playing out, where you've got literally three confederations involved and crossing the globe. We are 13 years away and the way the event is growing (2026 will be expanded to 48 teams), the event could just get to the point where it can only be staged in one or two areas.

“But you'd like to think that given the philosophy of FIFA, which is about more distribution of wealth to more of the game, they'd go, ‘You in this small region can have a group stage and then relocate'. You could argue we could partner with anyone based on the 2030 model, but geographically, New Zealand looks two ways frequently in economic discussions — either as part of Asia or part of the wider Asia-Pacific region, so you look across to the west coast of the Americas.”

He said no discussions with potential partners have yet taken place. However, the U.S. has shown itself as being open to creative hosting ideas, notably sharing 2026 with Canada and Mexico, and bidding for 2031 along with Mexico — and it is likely Jamaica and Costa Rica will soon join that women's tournament as co-hosts for a small number of games.

A potential trans-Pacific World Cup could even hypothetically involve Hawaii. The 50,000-seater Aloha Stadium there is due to be demolished and a new stadium built — at a reduced capacity — so this hypothetical would require particular leniency from FIFA who usually want bigger stadia but as the tournament expands, it may be that a hot-ticket smaller venue has a role to play. Fiji, meanwhile, is also currently exploring building a stadium.

Pragnell added: “Everyone wants something different. The idea may be that we're gonna look at this ocean, the Pacific, and that we could host it across that. The Paris Olympics (in 2024) held the surfing in Tahiti, right? People want different things. They are looking for a different experience and the idea of holding this across the ocean (appeals).”



President Infantino's adventures across the Middle East this week put European noses out of joint, and The Athletic also heard various whispers of increasingly disgruntled Canadians and Mexicans in the corridors of power within sport and politics.

Infantino joined President Trump and the Qatari emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha. Not only did Infantino join them for a state banquet at Lusail Palace, but he also posted an image on Instagram of the emir presenting Trump with a ball from the 2022 edition of the men's World Cup in Qatar. As Infantino stood beside them, it looked to many like a handover from the 2022 tournament to the 2026 tournament.

One problem with that (or two): there are three hosts of the World Cup in 2026, because the tournament is being shared with Mexico and Canada, neither of which had representatives present in Doha.

People briefed on FIFA's position pointed out this was not an official handover, but the optics did cause some consternation, particularly because Infantino's increasingly cosy relationship with the White House has produced some rather awkward moments for the two other hosts of FIFA's tournament for next summer.

Remember, for example, how Infantino was seen laughing hysterically as Trump unveiled his plan to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America during his inauguration speech in January, or how Infantino stood next to Trump and smiled awkwardly as the U.S. president joked that trade wars with his neighbours would make the World Cup “more exciting”.

Multiple people at the Congress in Paraguay told The Athletic that all of this has not gone down well with officials in Canada and Mexico.

Infantino's involvements with Trump — and frequent Instagram posts thanking the U.S. president — have secured some wins so far for FIFA, notably in the establishment of a White House World Cup Task Force, while Trump also indicated last week that he was open to providing the security funding necessary to cover costs required for host cities during the tournament.

Addressing the FIFA Congress on Thursday, Infantino also insisted, despite the Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration and commitment to deportations, that “the world is welcome in America”.

“Of course, the players, everyone involved, but definitely also all the fans,” he said. “And let's be clear about that: this doesn't come from me, this comes from the American government.”

JD Vance, the U.S. vice-president, last week said of fans travelling for the tournament: “We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game. But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they'll have to talk to (Homeland Security) Secretary Kristi Noem.”

As for the apparent handover in Qatar, the Concacaf president, Montagliani, who is Canadian and also FIFA vice-president, sought to calm any tensions when asked if Canada and Mexico are receiving enough attention from FIFA's leadership.”From what I understand, it was a state issue, so it's up to Qatar and the U.S. to invite who they want to invite. I'm not worried about that at all. Mexico is a fantastic country. And as the president of the United States once said, the world could use more Canadas.”

It would be lovely to ask Infantino about any of this, but he did not do a press conference for media at the Congress — for the second year in a row — and left the mixed zone scrum for his vice-presidents and general secretary to endure.

There was a peculiar dance around the houses during the FIFA Congress speeches on Thursday.

Alejandro Dominguez, CONMEBOL president and FIFA vice-president, was one of the headline speakers. The Paraguayan made the proposal at his own congress in April to expand the 2030 edition of the tournament to 64 teams. He said it should be a one-off to mark the 100th anniversary of the tournament.

The 2030 tournament will include a game each for Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, but it would appear that CONMEBOL would like to have more games to host, and rather than taking them away from Spain, Portugal or Morocco, the plan by Dominguez is to simply expand the tournament from 48 teams (which will happen for the first time in 2026) to 64.

Dominguez did not mention 64 teams during his speech at the FIFA Congress this week, but he did urge the room to think differently about a big centenary celebration. He made a comparison as to how a person might celebrate a 49th or 51st birthday differently to a 50th and that exceptions should be made for special events. Dominguez added: “I would like to invite you to reflect together so we can do something that the world is waiting for, that the football community deserves. It is what football teaches us — to play as a team.”

In his closing comments, Infantino opened the door. He said: “The 100-year celebration will be something special. And I want to underline the words of Alejandro in this speech. He told all of us to think on how we can really celebrate it in the way it deserves to be celebrated. So every idea is a good idea.”

Mattias Grafstrom, the FIFA general secretary, told the media afterwards: “Both the president of CONMEBOL and the FIFA president posed an open question about the Centenary World Cup. All ideas are welcome, but no specific ideas have been discussed.”

Montagliani repeated his opposition to the idea. “It's not a great idea. We haven't even kicked the ball for 48, and obviously they can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right,” he said.

Liverpool have reportedly made a decision on whether to allow Trent Alexander-Arnold to join Real Madrid early. 

After months of speculation, it was confirmed earlier in the month that Alexander-Arnold will depart Anfield this summer, upon the expiration of his contract.

The 26-year-old explained his decision to leave his boyhood club in an emotional video posted on social media.

He said: ""This is easily the hardest decision I've ever made in my life.

Advert

""This club has been my whole life - my whole world - for 20 years. From the Academy right through until now, the support and love I have felt from everyone inside and outside of the club will stay with me forever. I will forever be in debt to you all.""

It is widely expected that Alexander-Arnold will join Spanish giants Madrid on a free transfer upon leaving Liverpool.

As things stand, Alexander-Arnold's contract with Liverpool is set to expire on June 30.

Advert

However, Madrid would like him to join the club before that, as the FIFA Club World Cup is set to begin on June 15.

In order for that to happen, it has been reported that the two clubs could discuss a fee for Alexander-Arnold's early release.

Now, as reported by Spanish news outlet Diario AS, via Madrid Zone on social media, Madrid will pay Liverpool €2 million for Alexander-Arnold and he will join the club before the start of the FIFA Club World Cup.

Fabrizio Romano wrote on social media: ""Real Madrid have offered €2M to Liverpool for Trent to play at the Clubs World Cup, reports Diario AS.""

Advert

During Liverpool's first match since Alexander-Arnold's exit was confirmed, the 26-year-old was booed as he replaced Conor Bradley against Arsenal.

Reacting to the boos, Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah was left unimpressed.

He said: ""I think somehow the fans were being harsh with him.

""I think he didn't deserve it at the time, he deserved the fans to treat him the best way possible because he gave it all to the fans.""

Liverpool are back in Premier League action on Monday night when they take on Brighton and Hove Albion at the AMEX.

Alex Moreno

Real Madrid already plans the Club World Cup with a completely renewed defense. It is not a system with three center-backs. These are three defensive signings that will arrive for the tournament. All endorsed by Xabi Alonso.

The first was Trent Alexander-Arnold, who will occupy the right flank.  The second, Dean Huijsen, already confirmed for the center of the defense. The third, yet to be announced, will be Álvaro Carreras for the left side.

Xabi Alonso demanded guarantees. The club has replied. Real Madrid committed to securing three defensive signings before the World Cup. They are keeping it.

Alexander-Arnold already said yes. Liverpool resists, but the player wants to go to Madrid. He will do so as a free agent.

Only the final agreement is missing to incorporate him in the window enabled for the Club World Cup. The cost will be low:  about 2 million euros, including his salary for the month of June.

Dean Huijsen, coming from Bournemouth, is already confirmed as a Real Madrid player. He will cost 58.5 million euros, and he will be in the United States with Xabi Alonso from the start.

The last name is Álvaro Carreras. The operation is not yet closed, but it is 90% done. At Madrid, they trust everything will be finalized after the Copa final.

Carreras belongs to Benfica, but United has a buyback right. Here lies the complexity. The English club can reclaim him for 18 million. Subsequently, they could sell him to Madrid for about 30 or 35 million.

A move that would benefit both United and Real Madrid. Benfica, on the other hand, would lose the player for a low cost, although they would profit after paying only 6 million.

The conversations between the three clubs have been intense. But Real Madrid already has the player's ""yes"". Only details are missing.

This defense is not an alternative. It will be starting in the World Cup debut. Carvajal and Militao remain injured. Rüdiger and Alaba will arrive late. Mendy is ruled out.

Alexander-Arnold, Huijsen, and Carreras will form the base of Xabi Alonso's team. It will be their first trial by fire. A new beginning. A new defense.

What seemed like an emergency has turned into an opportunity. Madrid keeps its word. Xabi Alonso will have his defense to conquer the world.

Both men have much at stake as the World Cup heads to North America next year, with the potential for President Donald Trump's immigration policies to chill international attendance.

DOHA, Qatar — As President Donald Trump drove to a palace here the other night, he passed by a gleaming and glittery Lusail Stadium, the crown jewel of the sports complexes built to host what would become an electrifying 2022 World Cup final.

When he arrived at the palace, after the camels and the horses and the singing outside, he found a man ready to greet him with gusto: FIFA President Gianni Infantino. As they had dinner, Trump again called out for him. When he left, Infantino was there once more.

“Great job you do, Gianni!” he said.

Trump has reason to pay attention to Infantino — and Infantino to him. FIFA's World Cup heads to the United States, Mexico and Canada next year, and both men have much at stake in the success of the quadrennial soccer tournament.

“We've got the World Cup coming,” Trump said Friday morning at the conclusion of his trip.

There may be other reasons for the genuine affection between Trump and Infantino. There is an aspect of Trump's foreign policy approach that aligns with FIFA's president. They want to expand global reach with glitz and glamour, and they are willing to stretch ethical boundaries and turn a blind eye to autocrats who crack down on their populations.

FIFA has approached the world much like Trump has — in a transactional way that can elevate countries with questionable records in human rights.

Russia was picked to host the 2018 World Cup, and Infantino accepted high honors from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Qatar relied heavily on migrant labor to remake its capital and construct gleaming stadiums from scratch. Saudi Arabia, widely condemned for its own human rights abuses, including the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, will host in 2034.

Trump has likewise looked the other way in his dealings in the Middle East this week, notably with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the CIA concluded had ordered Khashoggi's death.

Trump instead focused on one of the things that unites them all: World Cup hosting duties.

“The World Cup is coming to the United States,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia, after remarking that Infantino was in the audience. “It's going to be really exciting next year.”

Trump and Infantino share ties dating back years. They have golfed together, dined together and taken countless photos together. At a dinner in Davos in 2020, Infantino introduced Trump with lavish praise.

“President Trump is definitely a sportsman,” Infantino said. “I am lucky enough in my life to come across some of the most talented athletes in soccer. And President Trump is made of the same sort of fiber. He is a competitor. He wants to compete. He wants to win. He wants to show who is the best.”

Infantino came to Trump's inauguration, and he has also visited the White House. Trump at times has had a replica of the World Cup trophy sitting behind him in the Oval Office, and the two men were together earlier in the month for a task force meeting about the planning for the event.

Much is on the line for Trump and Infantino — including whether the president's crackdown on immigrants will chill international attendance. There have also been concerns about whether the United States would grant visas for foreigners to come and support their countries in what is normally an event marked by its global flavor and fervent support.

The Trump administration has not exactly signaled a welcoming tone.

“We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,” Vice President JD Vance said at the meeting. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home.”

Infantino's presence with Trump for much of the week has caused some controversy in the soccer world. He rescheduled several events of his organization's governing body in Paraguay and then still arrived late. The episode triggered protests from several high-ranking members.

“To have the timetable changed at the last minute for what appears to be simply to accommodate private political interests, does the game no service and appears to put its interests second,” read a statement from UEFA.

Infantino has defended his relationship with Trump, which he said is critical to put on a smooth World Cup next year. He apologized to the forum for being late.

“As president of FIFA, my responsibility is to take decisions in the interests of the organization. I decided to spend the last two days in the Middle East, knowing the 2034 World Cup will be in Saudi Arabia and the 2022 World Cup was in Qatar,” he said, according to the Athletic.

The United States is hosting not only the World Cup next year but also another event this year that Infantino has put together called the Club World Cup, where club teams from around the world, rather than national teams, compete.

“Some important World Cup discussions took place, and I needed to be there to represent football and all of you,” he said of the Middle East trip. “We had an issue with our flight, which made this delay happen — apologies, sorry, and I am looking forward to spending time with you here.”

The mood was demonstrably brighter a few nights earlier in Doha.

After dinner at the palace Wednesday, the leaders walked down a long marble hallway into a bright atrium. At the center was a stand holding an official World Cup ball from 2022.

Trump arrived and held the ball aloft proudly. Al Thani then signed it and passed it to Trump, who did the same. Infantino was on hand, too, and also put his signature on the ball.

All three men were beaming.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","soccer"

In the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, representatives from 211 nations and territories assembled this week for the 75th FIFA Congress. This was not an obvious contender to be a dramatic affair because the agenda was relatively light. Yet in the space of a few days, civil war broke out within the FIFA Council, which is the decision-making body that sits at the top of the organisation.

Advertisement

The drama began when The Athletic revealed last week that FIFA president Gianni Infantino would not be attending a scheduled in-person meeting of the FIFA Council in Paraguay on Tuesday, making it a virtual call and instead joining President Donald Trump on a visit to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. This rankled several members of the Council, but matters really blew up on Thursday morning when flight tracking data of a Qatari private jet travelling from Doha — via Lagos in Nigeria — showed that Infantino appeared to still be in the air to Paraguay, delaying the Congress by three hours.

Despite Infantino's apologies when the meeting finally began, the eight UEFA (European) members of the Council walked out midway through the Congress. A UEFA statement chastised the late changes to timings and accused Infantino of making changes “for what appears to be simply accommodating private political interests”. Victor Montagliani, the FIFA vice-president and president of Concacaf, later said “two wrongs do not make a right” in response to UEFA's walk-out.

This was just one flashpoint during what became a tricky week for FIFA in South America, and The Athletic was present, speaking to federations, stakeholders and insiders to uncover, among other matters:

This summer's revamped and expanded FIFA Club World Cup tournament will see 32 teams from across the world compete to win a tournament hosted across 11 cities in the United States. However, the general public in the U.S. do not seem as smitten with the idea as either Infantino, whose name is inscribed twice on the trophy, or the competing teams, who now have $1billion (£753m) of prize money to play for.

The Athletic can reveal that FIFA's quest to fill stadiums is floundering to the extent that the organisation has now dropped the price of tickets once again, having unveiled a new tier of lower pricing for games during the tournament. In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA confirmed: “New batches of more affordable match tickets have been released this week on FIFA.com/tickets.” The organisation did not clarify what this new bracket refers to, but tickets on FIFA's partner Ticketmaster are now showing up as vastly reduced compared to the lowest prices that were available to fans earlier this year.

For example, as of Friday morning, the lowest priced tickets for the following group stage matches involving major European sides were presenting lowest-priced options of $30 or less: Manchester City v Al Ain in Atlanta, Inter v Urawa Red Diamonds in Seattle, Paris Saint-Germain v Botafogo in Pasadena, Chelsea v Esperance de Tunis in Philadelphia. Other games involving teams unfamiliar to many in the United States, such as the Korean team Ulsan HD against the South Africans Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, are available for $28.

FIFA has been operating a “variable pricing model” for this tournament, which is more commonly known as dynamic pricing. When demand is high, this can lead to prices skyrocketing, while when demand is low, it can work in the favour of the consumer and lead to lower prices. The lowest priced tickets on general sale for the semi-finals are showing at about $300, which is substantially down on FIFA's original aims a few months ago, while the cheapest ticket on general sale for the final is currently $538, but thousands of seats remain available.

Some prices appear to have remained more resilient, particularly group games involving Real Madrid. Via general sale, the cheapest seat for their game against Saudi side Al Hilal is $194.38, while it is $101 against Mexican side Pachuca and $100 against Red Bull Salzburg, despite 20 sections of the stadium in Philadelphia showing 100+ seats remaining available for non-luxury seating. FIFA has been buoyed by the take-up for some games, such as Boca Juniors against Bayern Munich, which is scheduled for a Friday night in June at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. Other venues, most notably the 90,000-capacity Rose Bowl, are braced for lots of empty seats. FIFA recently announced it had gifted 30,000 tickets for matches in Los Angeles to first responders who fought the wildfires that recently devastated the region.

Several sources familiar with the planning of the tournament, who spoke anonymously to protect relationships, said FIFA believe the U.S. is a late-buying market for sports events and is hoping that interest will build throughout the tournament.

There is some good news for fans, as supporters who acquired tickets via their club's allocation may be in line for partial reimbursements if prices for equivalent seating within stadiums have dropped since they first bought their tickets. FIFA is in contact with clubs to explore the possibility of partial refunds to supporters who bought tickets in the current and previous sales periods.

FIFA has already wrapped up the locations for the 2030 and 2034 men's World Cup, which means plenty at the Congress were already thinking about where the tournament may end up in future editions.

Under FIFA's confederation rotation principle, two tournaments need to pass by before a single confederation is able to host a World Cup again. In 2030, three confederations are hosting the World Cup because FIFA has split the tournament between South America, Africa and Europe, playing games in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Then, in 2034, the Asian confederation has the tournament in Saudi Arabia. This rules out those four confederations, which leaves only Concacaf and Oceania as potential destinations for 2038.

This means, under the current rules at least, a return to the United States, just 12 years after the men's World Cup in 2026 and (almost certainly) the women's World Cup in 2031, may well be the likeliest outcome if FIFA enforces the principle.

One federation has already made clear that it is interested in exploring hosting arrangements for the tournament, and that is New Zealand. Ordinarily, we might expect New Zealand to partner with neighbouring Australia, but Australia is part of the Asian confederation, which would rule it out of hosting in 2038 due to Saudi Arabia's host status for 2034. This leaves New Zealand, who co-hosted the 2023 women's World Cup with Australia, seeking more innovative options.

During an extended interview with The Athletic in Paraguay, the New Zealand federation CEO Andrew Pragnell said: “It's clearly not realistic we could ever host one on our own. They're getting bigger and the capacity requirements are well known. But we are certainly capable of hosting a group and a couple of knockout games, so the key for us is partnership. Given the limited stadium sizes in the rest of Oceania, we have to partner.

“We have raised it, within FIFA in meetings and in conversations. We haven't formalised it. What's really interesting is the way that 2030 is playing out, where you've got literally three confederations involved and crossing the globe. We are 13 years away and the way the event is growing (2026 will be expanded to 48 teams), the event could just get to the point where it can only be staged in one or two areas.

“But you'd like to think that given the philosophy of FIFA, which is about more distribution of wealth to more of the game, they'd go, ‘You in this small region can have a group stage and then relocate'. You could argue we could partner with anyone based on the 2030 model, but geographically, New Zealand looks two ways frequently in economic discussions — either as part of Asia or part of the wider Asia-Pacific region, so you look across to the west coast of the Americas.”

He said no discussions with potential partners have yet taken place. However, the U.S. has shown itself as being open to creative hosting ideas, notably sharing 2026 with Canada and Mexico, and bidding for 2031 along with Mexico — and it is likely Jamaica and Costa Rica will soon join that women's tournament as co-hosts for a small number of games.

A potential trans-Pacific World Cup could even hypothetically involve Hawaii. The 50,000-seater Aloha Stadium there is due to be demolished and a new stadium built — at a reduced capacity — so this hypothetical would require particular leniency from FIFA who usually want bigger stadia but as the tournament expands, it may be that a hot-ticket smaller venue has a role to play. Fiji, meanwhile, is also currently exploring building a stadium.

Pragnell added: “Everyone wants something different. The idea may be that we're gonna look at this ocean, the Pacific, and that we could host it across that. The Paris Olympics (in 2024) held the surfing in Tahiti, right? People want different things. They are looking for a different experience and the idea of holding this across the ocean (appeals).”



President Infantino's adventures across the Middle East this week put European noses out of joint, and The Athletic also heard various whispers of increasingly disgruntled Canadians and Mexicans in the corridors of power within sport and politics.

Infantino joined President Trump and the Qatari emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha. Not only did Infantino join them for a state banquet at Lusail Palace, but he also posted an image on Instagram of the emir presenting Trump with a ball from the 2022 edition of the men's World Cup in Qatar. As Infantino stood beside them, it looked to many like a handover from the 2022 tournament to the 2026 tournament.

One problem with that (or two): there are three hosts of the World Cup in 2026, because the tournament is being shared with Mexico and Canada, neither of which had representatives present in Doha.

People briefed on FIFA's position pointed out this was not an official handover, but the optics did cause some consternation, particularly because Infantino's increasingly cosy relationship with the White House has produced some rather awkward moments for the two other hosts of FIFA's tournament for next summer.

Remember, for example, how Infantino was seen laughing hysterically as Trump unveiled his plan to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America during his inauguration speech in January, or how Infantino stood next to Trump and smiled awkwardly as the U.S. president joked that trade wars with his neighbours would make the World Cup “more exciting”.

Multiple people at the Congress in Paraguay told The Athletic that all of this has not gone down well with officials in Canada and Mexico.

Infantino's involvements with Trump — and frequent Instagram posts thanking the U.S. president — have secured some wins so far for FIFA, notably in the establishment of a White House World Cup Task Force, while Trump also indicated last week that he was open to providing the security funding necessary to cover costs required for host cities during the tournament.

Addressing the FIFA Congress on Thursday, Infantino also insisted, despite the Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration and commitment to deportations, that “the world is welcome in America”.

“Of course, the players, everyone involved, but definitely also all the fans,” he said. “And let's be clear about that: this doesn't come from me, this comes from the American government.”

JD Vance, the U.S. vice-president, last week said of fans travelling for the tournament: “We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game. But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they'll have to talk to (Homeland Security) Secretary Kristi Noem.”

As for the apparent handover in Qatar, the Concacaf president, Montagliani, who is Canadian and also FIFA vice-president, sought to calm any tensions when asked if Canada and Mexico are receiving enough attention from FIFA's leadership.”From what I understand, it was a state issue, so it's up to Qatar and the U.S. to invite who they want to invite. I'm not worried about that at all. Mexico is a fantastic country. And as the president of the United States once said, the world could use more Canadas.”

It would be lovely to ask Infantino about any of this, but he did not do a press conference for media at the Congress — for the second year in a row — and left the mixed zone scrum for his vice-presidents and general secretary to endure.

There was a peculiar dance around the houses during the FIFA Congress speeches on Thursday.

Alejandro Dominguez, CONMEBOL president and FIFA vice-president, was one of the headline speakers. The Paraguayan made the proposal at his own congress in April to expand the 2030 edition of the tournament to 64 teams. He said it should be a one-off to mark the 100th anniversary of the tournament.

The 2030 tournament will include a game each for Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, but it would appear that CONMEBOL would like to have more games to host, and rather than taking them away from Spain, Portugal or Morocco, the plan by Dominguez is to simply expand the tournament from 48 teams (which will happen for the first time in 2026) to 64.

Dominguez did not mention 64 teams during his speech at the FIFA Congress this week, but he did urge the room to think differently about a big centenary celebration. He made a comparison as to how a person might celebrate a 49th or 51st birthday differently to a 50th and that exceptions should be made for special events. Dominguez added: “I would like to invite you to reflect together so we can do something that the world is waiting for, that the football community deserves. It is what football teaches us — to play as a team.”

In his closing comments, Infantino opened the door. He said: “The 100-year celebration will be something special. And I want to underline the words of Alejandro in this speech. He told all of us to think on how we can really celebrate it in the way it deserves to be celebrated. So every idea is a good idea.”

Mattias Grafstrom, the FIFA general secretary, told the media afterwards: “Both the president of CONMEBOL and the FIFA president posed an open question about the Centenary World Cup. All ideas are welcome, but no specific ideas have been discussed.”

Montagliani repeated his opposition to the idea. “It's not a great idea. We haven't even kicked the ball for 48, and obviously they can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right,” he said.

Filed under:

The World Cup could be saying Aloha to the United States again.

After the 2026 World Cup and (likely) the 2031 Women's World Cup leaves the United States, we may not have to wait long for the biggest tournament on the planet to return. The Athletic's Adam Crafton is reporting that at the recent FIFA Congress, which took place this week in Paraguay, New Zealand has explored plans to partner with the United States and Fiji to bid for the 2038 World Cup. 

The 2030 World Cup is already confirmed for Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, while the 2034 World Cup will be in Saudi Arabia. That means for 2038, unless FIFA decides to change its bid procedure, only bids from Oceania and Concacaf will be accepted. 

Enter New Zealand, who co-hosted the 2023 Women's World Cup with Australia. However, with Australia being a part of the Asian Football Confederation, they are not allowed to band with their island neighbor to bid on 2038 with the confederation hosting in 2034. That is forcing New Zealand to get creative in exploring a possible bid. That creativity, according to Crafton's report, includes partnering with the United States and Fiji.

Fiji has long wanted to build a stadium that they think would be capable of hosting big time matches, and it would add to New Zealand's potential plan for a 2038 World Cup that could have at least 48 teams but potentially 64. Part of those plans could also include hosting matches in Hawaii, who is building a new stadium to replace Aloha Stadium. The new stadium would be less than the old stadium's 50,000-seat capacity, but could be temporarily expanded for a World Cup. Finally, there would in theory be matches in the continental United States, creating a trans-Pacific affair.

With both the men's and women's World Cups now at 48 teams and lots of serious chatter about expanding the men's tournament to 64 teams, FIFA has now created an issue that only some nations could bid for the World Cup without partnering with a co-host. That increases the complexity of the logistics for players, staff, and fans to get from one place to another. That includes visas, accommodations, and flights even before you get to the match tickets. A trans-Pacific World Cup would see teams and fans potentially flying 15 hours or more to get from a match in New Zealand to a match on the west coast of the United States, which means jet lag could be a major factor. For the USMNT, it would mean that after two rotations, they would once again automatically qualify for a World Cup as the co-hosts.

There's also the possibility that FIFA could allow other nations from confederations that are technically excluded from consideration. Concacaf president and FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani has reportedly encouraged England to bid for the 2038 World Cup. England, who are joining the rest of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - as the likely hosts of the 2035 Women's World Cup, have not hosted the men's tournament since 1966. An England bid, if allowed by FIFA, could be seen as a more popular option, especially if paired with another country. For New Zealand, if England is allowed to bid for the World Cup, they could ask for an exemption to co-host with Australia. However, that feels unlikely given that Asia (Saudi Arabia) is hosting in 2034 and they won't allow a confederation to host two consecutive World Cups. That mean pairing with the United States feels like the best chance New Zealand have of hosting the men's World Cup.

There's a long way to go before FIFA decides on the 2038 World Cup. But, it's possible that American fans may once again have matches end up on our soil 13 years from now.

...

Beppe Bergomi feels that Napoli are “under pressure” while Inter Milan “have the wind in their sails” in the Serie A title race.

The legendary former Nerazzurri captain and 1982 World Cup winner with Italy gave his thoughts on the title race in today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews.

There are now just two matches to go in the Serie A title race.

Inter Milan and Napoli are separated by just a single point at the top of the table.

Therefore, it is clear that the title race is still far from over.

The Partenopei undoubtedly have the advantage. If they win both their matches, against Parma and Cagliari, they will win the title no matter what Inter do.

However, those are going to be tricky matches. As are the Nerazzurri's final two league outings against the likes of Lazio and Como.

Therefore, it will go down to the wire, without question.

And the question of momentum could prove to be crucial. Particularly considering that Napoli dropped points against Genoa last weekend.

Inter, on the other hand, are riding high on reaching the Champions League final.

Beppe Bergomi writes that “It's impossible to say exactly what will happen in this round of fixtures.”

“But it's inevitable to think that Napoli are the favourite to win in the end.”

“In any event, this will be an unpredictable weekend for everyone,” Bergomi continues. “Particularly for Conte's team.”

“And it won't necessarily be decisive.”

“How they'll react to seeing their advantage go down to just a point we can't know,” Bergomi notes. “But it's obvious that the pressure they're under is increasing.”

“Meanwhile, Inter suddenly have the wind in their sails. And being in the hunt for the title can also be good for them in the Champions League.”

“The team is obligated to stay alive in it right until the last second.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Los Angeles FC will host Mexico's América on May 31 in their Club World Cup qualification playoff, FIFA finalized on Friday.

The winner will get group-stage games against Chelsea in Atlanta on June 16, then Esperance from Tunisia in Nashville, and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando.

The play-in game is needed to complete the 32-team lineup of the tournament that starts on June 14 because another Mexican club, León, was removed. León broke tournament integrity rules being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca.

FIFA announced the date and venue 10 days after León's appeal against expulsion was lost at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.

LAFC's 22,000-seat home BMO Stadium - next to the LA Memorial Coliseum and shared with Angel City - will stage the game at 7:30 p.m. local time.

That is several hours after the Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Both have qualified for the Club World Cup.

The Club World Cup entry for LAFC or América is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA for a CONCACAF region team, plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament. It is being played in 11 U.S. cities.

FIFA planned the LAFC-América game in March after first ruling to expel León, which qualified by winning the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League.

FIFA said LAFC would be in the playoff because it was the beaten finalist against León, while América was the next best ranked team in its Club World Cup confederation ranking.

It was unclear why América - one of Mexico's best-supported teams - is eligible when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the four-year qualifying period through 2024.

Mexico already has Pachuca and Monterrey in the tournament that has been heavily promoted by FIFA President Gianni Infantino with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump has said he will attend the July 13 final at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to present the gold trophy. It has spent much of the past few weeks in the Oval Office at the White House.","{'href': 'https://abc7.com', 'title': 'ABC7 Los Angeles'}","soccer"

The Eagles have never won a major trophy, but have a chance to end that drought at Wembley against Manchester City

This Saturday, Crystal Palace will partake in only their third-ever FA Cup final. Unlike those two previous losing occasions in 1990 and 2016, they will not be facing Manchester United, but rather the noisy neighbours of City instead.

Oliver Glasner's men are chasing down history. The Eagles have never won a major trophy going all the way back to 1861 when the first remnants of the modern-day club were founded. Their vocal, passionate and colourful fanbase south of the River Thames have waited generation upon generation to see their team lift silverware, and their time could finally be now.

Leading the red-and-blue offensive has been Eberechi Eze. It was his magic that got Palace to Wembley for the semi-finals with a stunning brace against Fulham, and then put Aston Villa to the sword in order to set up this tie with City.

In the sky-blue corner, the Cityzen's own wizard of dribble has lost his majesty. Nothing seems to have gone right for Phil Foden ever since he led his boyhood team to their record fourth-successive Premier League title last season, and now his England status is at risk.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alcaraz – Sinner: 18.05.2025 12:00 CEST
H2H: 7-5

Carlos Alcaraz has won five straight matches. This is his second appearance in Rome. In the opening round, Alcaraz won against Lajovic 6-3 6-3. The Spaniard faced another Serb in the third round. He trailed 1-3 in the opening set against Djere but turned it around. In the 1/8-Finals, Alcaraz had his toughest challenge so far this week. He defeated Khachanov in three tight sets after spending almost three hours on the court. In the quarterfinals, Alcaraz defeated Draper in straight sets. He trailed 2-4 in the opening set but turned it around.

Yesterday, after playing for two hours, the Spaniard defeated Musetti 6-3 7-6 in the semifinals. He trailed 2-4 in the second set but turned it again. Alcaraz was great under pressure throughout the whole week. In his debut campaign, the Spaniard lost against Marozsan in the third round.

Jannik Sinner has won 29 straight matches. He is returning to competitive tennis after serving a three-month suspension related to anti-doping procedures. This week in Rome, Sinner easily won his opening-round match against Navone in straight sets. In the third round, he defeated de Jong in straight sets. Sinner lost his serve twice against the Dutch but still won in straight sets. In the 1/8-Finals, Cerundolo put up a big fight against Sinner but still fell short, losing in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, Sinner demolished Ruud, winning 6-0 6-1. He served great, but he did not offer any breakpoints.

In the semifinals, Sinner had his biggest challenge of the week yesterday. After losing the opening set 1-6, the Italian stepped up his level and turned the match quickly around, winning 1-6 6-0 6-3. Before this year's edition, Sinner has never made it past the quarterfinals in Rome.

According to the bookies, Alcaraz is the slight underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. We saw some inconsistency in Sinner's game throughout the week; even though he was dominant, he still lost his serve often. On the other hand, Alcaraz gradually improved as the week went on so we expect him to deliver his best tennis in the final. The Spaniard leads 2-1 at the head-to-head meetings on clay, which was always tight. We believe he will play his best tennis and keep the match close.

That being said, Alcaraz covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Carlos Alcaraz +1.5 games handicap @-110 @FanDuel

As previously mentioned, Alcaraz and Sinner are in great form. In their head-to-head meetings, they have always gone the distance when playing on clay courts. We expect a similar outcome tomorrow as well.

That being said, over games is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: over 22.5 games @1.83 @bet365

enWorld number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed centre court to continue his march towards a first Foro Italico title.

After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court, where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.

And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.

A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.

""If I want to win Sunday, I have to play some of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.

""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming, but from my side, it's incredible to be here in the final.""

Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6(4).

The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.

""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.

""I have to know against whom I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""

Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.

And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.

""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.

Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.

The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.

Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.

But from nowhere, he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.

It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.

Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.

LINK: ATP Tour Hamburg Draw | ATP Tour Geneva Draw | WTA Strasbourg Draw | WTA Rabat Draw

As the red clay season winds to its dramatic conclusion, four key stops across Europe and North Africa set the stage for final tune-ups before Roland Garros. This week, the ATP Tour brings top-tier talent to Hamburg and Geneva, while the WTA heads to Strasbourg and Rabat, Morocco. Each event offers players one last opportunity to find form, gain ranking points, and sharpen their clay-court instincts.

The Hamburg European Open returns with a stacked ATP 500 draw, headlined by World No. 3 Alexander Zverev, American Frances Tiafoe, and former winner Andrey Rublev. Zverev, who hasn't enjoyed a stellar 2025 season to date, will look to solidify his status as a Roland Garros favorite by making a deep run in Hamburg.

Rublev, a proven performer on clay, brings his trademark aggression and flair to a court where he's previously thrived. Tiafoe, known for his explosive forehand and relentless baseline play, will be aiming to gain some much-needed confidence as he heads into Roland Garros.

With several young guns and clay-court specialists in the field, including Argentine and Spanish talents, Hamburg promises high-octane matchups from the first round. The event is also known for producing upsets, making it a key watch for fans and pundits alike.

The scenic Geneva Open offers a different tempo—both literally and figuratively. Played at altitude, the conditions can favor big servers and aggressive baseline play, which suits Taylor Fritz and Grigor Dimitrov perfectly.

However, it's Casper Ruud, a two-time French Open finalist, who enters as the heavy favorite. Ruud has made a career of dominating the pre-Roland Garros swing, and Geneva's slower clay suits his grinding style. His top-spin-heavy forehand and impeccable movement could see him lift another trophy on Swiss soil.

Dimitrov, a semifinalist in Madrid, will look to continue his resurgence, while Fritz continues to chase a signature clay-court result. The Geneva draw also features dark horses capable of springing surprises in the thin mountain air.

A late entry in the event is none other than Novak Djokovic. The tennis master is in search of his first win on clay this season, and the Geneva Open is a great place for him to start.

The Internationaux de Strasbourg offers a fascinating mix of proven champions and rising stars. American Jessica Pegula, a former US Open finalist, returns to a venue as the tournament's top seed. Pegula's game is better suited to hard-courts, but she has continued to improve on all surfaces throughout her career. 

Spanish star Paula Badosa is also in the mix, continuing her return from injury with renewed optimism. Her heavy topspin and athleticism are a perfect fit for Strasbourg's red dirt.

American Emma Navarro, a rising force on the WTA Tour, rounds out the trio of favorites. Navarro's baseline consistency and court IQ make her a real threat as she continues to climb the rankings in 2025.

The Strasbourg field features a balanced mix of veterans and next-gen talents, offering compelling matchups and a potential preview of second-week contenders in Paris.

Over in North Africa, the Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem in Rabat, Morocco brings a more intimate setting to the WTA Tour, but no shortage of intrigue. Armenia's Elina Avanesyan headlines the 32-player draw and enters the event with something to prove.

Currently ranked No. 38 in the world, Avanesyan will be keen on capturing her first Tour title ahead of next week's French Open. 

Camila Osorio, Lucia Bronzetti and Ann Li round out the top four seeds at the event.

The tournament has historically served as a springboard for lesser-known players to shine, and with several top-100 players looking to fine-tune their games, Rabat promises compelling early-round drama.

With Roland Garros 2025 just around the corner, the ATP and WTA action in Hamburg, Geneva, Strasbourg, and Rabat offers a final glimpse into player form, health, and confidence. Expect breakout runs, tense three-setters, and perhaps a few unexpected champions before the world turns its eyes to Paris.

When you step through the gates at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the atmosphere is unmistakable. Italian tennis is thriving — and you can feel it.

The marble statues that line the Foro Italico may recall Rome's ancient past, but the energy coursing through the venue is undeniably modern. It's not just about loyal fans packing the stands, but about a homegrown tennis boom, and right now, it's alive and well in the Italian capital.

“We are Jannik's girls,” one lady told ATPTour.com, wearing an iconic orange jersey with ‘Alo' Jannik' written on it. “We love him, he's the best in the world, full stop. He's also a good, simple guy.”

Jannik Sinner fans in attendance at the Foro Italico in Rome. 

The sense of connection was evident as Jannik Sinner returned to the capital for the first time since becoming the first Italian to reach No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings. The 23-year-old was met with a chorus of ‘Olé, Olé, Olé, Sinner' during his first practice session on Campo Centrale, and those chants have not ceased as he made his way through the draw.

Yet the enthusiasm isn't reserved just for one player. Having joined Sinner inside the Top 10, Lorenzo Musetti's rise marks another step forward for the country's depth, becoming just the sixth Italian player to achieve that feat. 

The adoration for Musetti was evident on Wednesday night, when the Italian rode the backing of a lively crowd to an inspired performance over defending champion Alexander Zverev. With his win, Musetti became the first Italian player to reach the semi-finals at all three clay-court ATP Masters 1000 events in one season.

“Full crowd, full stadium, that's a big advantage,” said Musetti. “All week there has been incredible support from the fans. I felt the adrenaline and the energy from the first point.”

Four of the six Italians to have cracked the Top 10 in PIF ATP Rankings history featured in the 2025 main draw in Rome, with Matteo Berrettini and Fabio Fognini joining Sinner and Musetti. The 37-year-old Fognini, who is tied with Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic for the most men's singles appearances in Rome (18), bade farewell to the tournament this year.

Fognini's last dance in the capital added a layer of emotion to proceedings during the opening week.

“I love them,” Fognini said of the Italian fans. “I would like to be remembered for [being] a guy who showed passion, sometimes too much passion, on the court. That's the way I was, I was feeling my work, feeling the tennis, feeling it in my veins.”

This year, the sense of occasion came with another unique twist. With the papal conclave taking place during the tournament's opening week, fans on Campo Centrale looked up to see the announcement of Pope Leo XIV's election broadcast live on the big screens.

It was a moment that added to the already distinctive atmosphere: Part history, part tennis, part something only Rome could deliver.







Fognini's passion has long been a part of Italy's tennis culture and, as the next generation rises, it's being carried forward by a younger group eager to make their own mark and leave an impression among the home fans.
The 21-year-old Luca Nardi, who was one of three Italian wild cards to win a main-draw match this year, spoke of what the tournament means to him and the importance of the vibrant fans.
“I was coming here when I was a kid to watch the tournament as a fan,” Nardi told ATPTour.com after edging Flavio Cobolli in a rowdy all-Italian clash on Grand Stand Arena. “Playing here in front of my home crowd is an amazing feeling. It's always amazing, the crowd is super motivated and cheers a lot for us. Every year it's special.”

Sinner has held the World No. 1 spot for 48 consecutive weeks, amassing six tour-level titles and just three match losses during that period. It's no surprise that the 23-year-old from San Candido's success has lifted expectation, as well as trophies.
“It's a motivation not just for me, but for all Italians,” Nardi said when asked of Sinner's progress. “I know Lorenzo [Musetti], Flavio [Cobolli] and everyone else very well, it's a big motivation for all of us.”
That belief is mirrored by investment. The Italian Tennis Federation has expanded its commitment to the Italian ATP Masters 1000 event with a renovated Foro Italico and the addition of a new 3,200-seat stadium: Super Tennis Arena.
“Every big tournament is trying to build new things, but Rome is a little bit different,” said tournament director Paolo Lorenzi. “We have a lot of history, and this place is not only for tennis, it's for other things.
“We just built this court from nothing. We have all the statues around the court, I think it's something really special. Also for the players, I like that they have this feeling of staying in a place in the middle of history.”

A new era in Rome 🎾 🇮🇹

There are seven Italian men currently inside the Top 50, and Hologic WTA World No. 5 Jasmine Paolini emphasises the strength in depth across the board. Lorenzi, the former World No. 33, recognises the impact that this new wave of Italian stars is having — not just on the court, but how the country is perceived within the sport. Their professionalism and character, he says, are playing a key role in Italy's growing reputation.
“You have Sinner, Musetti, [Jasmine] Paolini, Berrettini… All of them have a good image,” Lorenzi said. “If you watch them, they are people that are working for tennis. At this moment, we are not only one of the best countries in the world for tennis, but also the image they give us is really important.”
With every chant, cheer, and rising star, Rome reminds us this is more than a tournament — it's a celebration of Italy's tennis renaissance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Tracy Austin thinks there's a youngster on the WTA Tour who could compete with Coco Gauff for the French Open title","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/tracy-austin-thinks-theres-a-youngster-on-the-wta-tour-who-could-compete-with-coco-gauff-for-the-french-open-title/","Sat, 17 May 2025 01:00:00 GMT","

Coco Gauff is set to be one of the hot favourites for Roland Garros this year, and with good reason.

After all, she has enjoyed another solid clay-court season, and could cap it off with a title in the Italian Open final on Saturday.

However, if she is to claim another Grand Slam title, the 21-year-old will definitely have to dig deep.

Tracy Austin, one of America's greatest-ever tennis exports, has actually outlined another potential competitor set to push her, Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka for the crown.

Speaking to Tennis Channel during their live watch-along of Mirra Andreeva's win over Clara Tauson, the panel utilised their time with the Hall of Famer well.

After all, they peppered her with questions about her illustrious past within the sport, as well as picking her brains on some of tennis' brightest contemporary stars.

Naturally, Coco Gauff‘s name cropped up, with Austin actually inserting her into the conversation to challenge for the French Open.

However, she started by acknowledging Andreeva's credentials and capability of winning the event, with attention then returning to her compatriot: ‘I think Coco Gauff [to challenge for RG] first of all as well. I think Coco has really changed the dynamic and the conversation since Madrid.'

She then picked back up where she left off, but this time with a critique: 'I think it all comes down to the forehand. That's the tipping point shot. When she is backing up on her forehand, your racket head has to be squared up for contact. When she's backing up it kind of opens it and it's hard to manipulate with your hand. It's just a more defensive position.

‘When Coco's stepping in and finding the right balance, finding the right contact point on the forehand, she's offensive, dictating play.

‘Even more than the serve now it comes down to the forehand.'  

Whilst there have been some rather obvious holes in Gauff's game of late, the manner in which she has been able to offset them with quality elsewhere is admirable.

In fact, despite a misfiring forehand and a very unpredictable serve, she somehow came out the other end of a marathon match on Thursday night. Gauff's win over Qinwen Zheng in Rome made history for the length, finishing after three hours and 14 minutes.

However, she faces a completely different task in the final, with last year's French Open finalist Jasmine Paolini standing between her and another Masters 1000 title.

There is no denying that whoever claims the crown is sure to be regarded as one of the favourites for this year's iteration of the Parisian Grand Slam, but the American must certainly find a way to solve these issues before proceedings get underway in the French capital.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

France has long been a powerhouse in the tennis world, producing stars in both the men's and women's circuits. One of the country's most exciting prospects in the early 2000s was Tatiana Golovin. Born in Russia, Golovin moved to France as a young child, eventually obtaining French citizenship and representing her adopted country on the global stage.

Golovin's tennis journey began early. She trained at the prestigious Nick Bollettieri Academy in Florida, a proving ground for many tennis greats. In 2002, at just 14 years old, she turned pro. Two years later, she made her mark by winning the mixed doubles title at Roland Garros alongside fellow French prodigy Richard Gasquet.

The year 2004 proved pivotal for Golovin, not only for her Grand Slam success in doubles but also for her singles performances. She reached the fourth round in both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, showcasing her potential as a future star.

By 2006, she had advanced to the quarterfinals of the US Open, and in 2007, she captured her first two WTA singles titles—at Amelia Island and Portoroz. Early in 2008, despite struggling with back pain, she achieved her career-high ranking of No. 12 in the world.

Golovin grabbed headlines during Wimbledon in 2007 for an unexpected reason—her outfit. The French player adhered to the tournament's strict all-white dress code but pushed the boundaries by wearing red shorts under her skirt.

The bold choice wasn't just a fashion statement. Golovin later revealed she wore the shorts because she was on her menstrual cycle, a topic rarely discussed openly in tennis at the time. Her decision drew significant attention, sparking debates about Wimbledon's traditional dress code.

Years later, Wimbledon adjusted its rules, allowing female players to wear colored undergarments to ease stress during their periods. Golovin's statement remains one of the most notable dress code challenges in the tournament's history.

In 2008, Golovin's promising career began to falter due to persistent back issues. After competing in just a handful of tournaments, she decided to take a break, hoping to recover and return in 2009. Unfortunately, her injuries worsened, and by the end of that year, Golovin was forced to retire at just 20 years old. Her retirement shocked the tennis world, as many believed she was on the brink of joining the sport's elite.

In 2019, Golovin made a brief return to competitive tennis, playing two matches—one in a WTA 250 event in Luxembourg and another in an ITF tournament in Germany. Though both matches ended in defeat, her comeback effort demonstrated her enduring love for the sport.

Reflecting on her return, Golovin told BeIN Sports: “In 2009, I had to stop because my body couldn't meet the demands of high-performance tennis due to my condition. Over the past 18 months, I've been exploring treatments that might allow me to come back. After mourning my early retirement, I thought it might be time to give it another try”.

Since officially stepping away from competition, Golovin has built a successful career in broadcasting. She currently works as a commentator for BeIN Sports and frequently participates in exhibition matches.

In 2022 and 2024, she played in special events at Roland Garros, including a victory alongside compatriot Nathalie Tauziat over Argentine legends Gabriela Sabatini and Gisela Dulko.

For the second straight Grand Slam tournament, Novak Djokovic's seeding will put him in a tough spot.

After getting the No. 7 seed at the Australian Open, the 24-time major champion could again be seeded as low as No. 7 for Roland Garros, which begins May 25. The Serb is currently No. 6 in the Live Rankings.

Jannik Sinner will be the top seed at a fourth consecutive Grand Slam while defending champion Carlos Alcaraz has elevated to No. 2. Sinner and Alcaraz will meet Sunday in the Rome final in a tasty preview to Paris.

Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the Australian Open quarterfinals, but tore a hamstring muscle and then had to retire in the semifinals against Alexander Zverev, who lost to Sinner in the final.

Djokovic, 37, now faces a potential similar path in Paris where he could have to beat three of the world's best to win his record 25th major.

“I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” 18-time major champ Chrissie Evert told Forbes.

“I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. This guy's won everything, more than anybody. I would never say he's not going to win, but I would be surprised. I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human…I'm not feeling it.""

Djokovic is a three-time Roland Garros champion, most recently in 2023, but is just 12-7 this season with first-round losses in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

“I was very surprised watching Novak compete in Monte Carlo and Madrid,” said Mouratoglou , Naomi Osaka's coach. ""Not by the level, we all know what he's capable of. But by the attitude. He just didn't look like he wanted to win. He didn't even look like he cared to win, Of course, he can play much better, he's Novak Djokovic, but he didn't look physically ready or mentally engaged. And for a player like him, if the motivation isn't there, there's really no point in being on the court. I've been saying this for a long time now: motivation is everything for Novak.

Djokovic, who recently parted ways with coach Andy Murray, took a wildcard into the Geneva Open next week.

""His decision to play Geneva now makes sense. He wants to feel that winning rhythm again, even just a little, before stepping into Paris. The big question is: will it be enough?"" Mouratoglou added.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Amid Jannik Sinner, Tommy Paul, and Others' Withdrawals Taylor Fritz Refuses To Cancel His Appearance Before French Open","https://www.profootballnetwork.com/tennis/jannik-sinner-tommy-paul-withdrawals-taylor-fritz-refuses-cancel-appearance-french-open/","Sat, 17 May 2025 06:57:39 GMT","

While several top ATP players have been resting or missing out on lower-tier events prior to the French Open, American tennis star Taylor Fritz is going against the trend.

Instead of joining the trend of mass withdrawals, Fritz is going ahead with his schedule to compete in the 2025 Geneva Open, which is scheduled to be played from May 18 to May 24, barely a week before Roland Garros's opening.

After his sixth Italian Open campaign, Taylor Fritz is already in Geneva to prepare for the ATP 250 tournament. The World No. 4, who was seeded fourth in Rome, received a bye in the second round but lost in straight sets to fellow American Marcos Giron.

The disappointing loss, however, has not dampened Fritz‘s spirits. He posted a video on his Instagram stories showing him working hard on the clay courts in Geneva, indicating that he was focusing on perfecting his form before the Paris clay-court Grand Slam.

This is Fritz's third appearance at the Geneva Open. His best effort so far was in 2023, when he made it to the semifinals before losing to Grigor Dimitrov. Since Dimitrov is one of the top names withdrawing from playing this year, Fritz will be seeking a better performance than before while gaining momentum for Roland Garros, which starts on May 25.

Fritz's move is opposite to that of a number of top-tier players who have opted to forego playing ATP 250 events before Paris. High-profile stars such as Jannik Sinner, Tommy Paul, Holger Rune, Lorenzo Musetti, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Casper Ruud all withdrew from their respective pre-Roland Garros events, specifically the Geneva Open and the Hamburg Open, to rest or prevent possible injuries.

Sinner and Paul, who also pulled out of the Hamburg Open, are also in action at the Italian Open in Rome and will meet in a high-stakes semifinal for the opportunity to contest Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Musetti, on the other hand, recently ended his run in Rome with a semifinal loss at the hands of Alcaraz.

Hamburg withdrawees Holger Rune and Stefanos Tsitsipas both lost in the third round at the Italian Open. Ruud, who pulled out of the Geneva Open, made it to the quarterfinals in Rome, losing to Sinner.

Other high-profile withdrawals from the Geneva Open include Denis Shapovalov, Jordan Thompson, Roberto Bautista Agut, Lorenzo Sonego, and Camilo Ugo Carabelli. The Hamburg Open also experienced some withdrawals, with Sebastian Korda, Ugo Humbert, and Hamad Medjedovic being among those to withdraw.

By Gianni Taina

France has long been a powerhouse in the tennis world, producing stars in both the men's and women's circuits. One of the country's most exciting prospects in the early 2000s was Tatiana Golovin. Born in Russia, Golovin moved to France as a young child, eventually obtaining French citizenship and representing her adopted country on the global stage.

Golovin's tennis journey began early. She trained at the prestigious Nick Bollettieri Academy in Florida, a proving ground for many tennis greats. In 2002, at just 14 years old, she turned pro. Two years later, she made her mark by winning the mixed doubles title at Roland Garros alongside fellow French prodigy Richard Gasquet.

The year 2004 proved pivotal for Golovin, not only for her Grand Slam success in doubles but also for her singles performances. She reached the fourth round in both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, showcasing her potential as a future star.

By 2006, she had advanced to the quarterfinals of the US Open, and in 2007, she captured her first two WTA singles titles—at Amelia Island and Portoroz. Early in 2008, despite struggling with back pain, she achieved her career-high ranking of No. 12 in the world.

Golovin grabbed headlines during Wimbledon in 2007 for an unexpected reason—her outfit. The French player adhered to the tournament's strict all-white dress code but pushed the boundaries by wearing red shorts under her skirt.

The bold choice wasn't just a fashion statement. Golovin later revealed she wore the shorts because she was on her menstrual cycle, a topic rarely discussed openly in tennis at the time. Her decision drew significant attention, sparking debates about Wimbledon's traditional dress code.

Years later, Wimbledon adjusted its rules, allowing female players to wear colored undergarments to ease stress during their periods. Golovin's statement remains one of the most notable dress code challenges in the tournament's history.

In 2008, Golovin's promising career began to falter due to persistent back issues. After competing in just a handful of tournaments, she decided to take a break, hoping to recover and return in 2009. Unfortunately, her injuries worsened, and by the end of that year, Golovin was forced to retire at just 20 years old. Her retirement shocked the tennis world, as many believed she was on the brink of joining the sport's elite.

In 2019, Golovin made a brief return to competitive tennis, playing two matches—one in a WTA 250 event in Luxembourg and another in an ITF tournament in Germany. Though both matches ended in defeat, her comeback effort demonstrated her enduring love for the sport.

Reflecting on her return, Golovin told BeIN Sports: “In 2009, I had to stop because my body couldn't meet the demands of high-performance tennis due to my condition. Over the past 18 months, I've been exploring treatments that might allow me to come back. After mourning my early retirement, I thought it might be time to give it another try”.

Since officially stepping away from competition, Golovin has built a successful career in broadcasting. She currently works as a commentator for BeIN Sports and frequently participates in exhibition matches.

In 2022 and 2024, she played in special events at Roland Garros, including a victory alongside compatriot Nathalie Tauziat over Argentine legends Gabriela Sabatini and Gisela Dulko.

                Both players are chasing first title in 2025!            

Soon to be ranked No. 2 in the world, Coco Gauff will attempt to overcome a partisan Italian crowd when she faces 2024 Roland Garros runner-up Jasmine Paolini in the Internazionali BNL d'Italia final on Saturday. The Italian is looking to win her first career trophy on clay, and dropped only one set en route to the summit clash. Regardless of the result, Gauff vs Paolini promises to be one of the most highly anticipated 1000-level finals in recent times.

While both players have encountered brilliant runs at the Italian capital – the biggest loser here is Iga Swiatek. The former World No. 1 endured a challenging clay court season when compared to her phenomenally high standards. She dropped points in Stuttgart as well as Madrid, before failing to defend her crown at the Eternal City. Nonetheless, there is a lot at stake for both Gauff and Paolini this weekend.

While Jasmine Paolini is a consistent threat on the WTA circuit, the 29-year-old has not won a title since the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships in February 2024. The first Italian woman to enter the final since her doubles partner Sara Errani in 2014, another victory for Paolini will make her the first home champion in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985. Just like her American counterpart, she is chasing her maiden clay court 1000-level championship.

For Coco Gauff, a first trophy in 2025 awaits if she can scale the Paolini peak. She will also win an incredible 10th tour-level singles title in the process at just 21 years of age. The 2023 US Open champion is bidding to become the first American champion in Rome since Serena Williams in 2016. Gauff has already become the third youngest player to reach four WTA-1000 finals – and a maiden clay court title in four years beckons.

Coco Gauff is wary of the quality that Paolini possesses. She firmly asserted how she must be ready for a fight, and produce a better level than what she did in Stuttgart. “It [Stuttgart] was a tough match. She played well, she's a tough opponent. I think especially here with the home crowd behind her, she's going to be playing some great tennis. I have to expect that.”

Subsequently, Jasmine Paolini is taking confidence from her outstanding 2024 season. “That [previous season] gave me a lot of confidence that I have to remember – a lot of experience that I have under my belt. At the same time, this year is another year. It's a completely different story. I'm trying to repeat to myself ‘Look, remember that last year, we had an amazing year.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Former No 1 warns fans ahead of Jannik Sinner & Carlos Alcaraz showdown","https://www.tennis365.com/atp-tour/andy-roddick-reveals-watch-out-carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-clash","Sat, 17 May 2025 15:17:47 GMT","

Andy Roddick has warned fans to ‘watch out' for a key factor, early on during the 2025 Italian Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

The two will meet for an 11th time, with the Spaniard leading their head-to-head 6-4 – however, it will be their first meeting in a final and their first on clay since the 2024 Roland Garros semi-final.

“The funny thing is, when you see the stats from [Carlos] Alcaraz, at different points of the year, we have been concerned about him,” began Roddick, speaking on the Tennis Channel.

“Maybe after Australia or maybe he takes a loss to Goffin in Miami and we start the question meter.

“Then you look at the graphics and he is winning six matches for everyone that he loses and you are going ‘What standard are we comparing him to?'

“I don't think the question on clay has ever been about where his form is at, he has proven that he is the best clay courter in the world over the last couple of years, it's just a matter of health.”

During Sinner's semi-final match against Tommy Paul, the Italian seemed to struggle when stretching for forehand shots, not wanting to put pressure on his right leg – something which visibly caused him pain when he did.

“I will keep an eye – Sinner in that third set it looked like he was managing his movement a little bit. I think that is something to watch out for early days on Sunday,” warned Roddick.

“Also, if you are Sinner, and there is anything wrong and we don't know that there is yet, it's just the eye test, he was pulling up on some of the movement.

“If he is feeling anything, you play it safe for Roland Garros.”

Despite the warning from the 2003 US Open champion, the world No 1 was quick to dismiss any injury concerns, confirming that the discomfort was an existing blister.

“Since the third round, I have a small blister under my feet that doesn't allow me to move in some moments,” stated Sinner.

“I felt it more today than in other matches. Leg-wise, I'm not concerned. It is just a bit tight, but this is normal.

“There are no excuses and for Sunday, I am 100% not concerned.”

The three-time Grand Slam champion hasn't lost a match since the 2024 Beijing final, where Alcaraz prevailed from 3-0 down in the deciding-set tiebreak – capping off a third consecutive victory against Sinner.

As such, Roddick believes that the world No 3 is ‘well equipped' to beat the world No 1 in the Italian Open final.

“Carlos Alcaraz is a genius at finding a way to hit behind his opponents, especially when the footing isn't as solid,” analysed the American.

“Let's jump back to the plot for a second, all the way back to when Sinner played Casper Ruud. Sinner knows that Casper Ruud can attack him by going high and heavy, right? And he kind of knows that that's what's coming right?

“Today, the only way TP [Tommy Paul] was going to get ahead of the points was to go hard, flat through the court with that backhand-to-backhand. But Sinner knew he didn't have to defend TP's backhand line over and over, especially if he hits a good ball. Carlos Alcaraz is capable of all of them.

“He can create the high balls like a Casper Ruud. He can hit that backhand through the court. He can hit it line across. So it's not going to be as simple for Sinner just to get into that kind of exchange where he's the best in the world.

“So, Carlos doesn't want Jannik hitting multiple shots from the same position. That is when he can distribute, that is when he can deploy his power. And Carlos is probably the most well-equipped person on earth to deal with Jannik Sinner.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Why Sinner isn't the only reason Rome is buzzing","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rome-2025-tournament-feature-italian-tennis","Sat, 17 May 2025 14:39:05 GMT","

When you step through the gates at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the atmosphere is unmistakable. Italian tennis is thriving — and you can feel it.

The marble statues that line the Foro Italico may recall Rome's ancient past, but the energy coursing through the venue is undeniably modern. It's not just about loyal fans packing the stands, but about a homegrown tennis boom, and right now, it's alive and well in the Italian capital.

“We are Jannik's girls,” one lady told ATPTour.com, wearing an iconic orange jersey with ‘Alo' Jannik' written on it. “We love him, he's the best in the world, full stop. He's also a good, simple guy.”

Jannik Sinner fans in attendance at the Foro Italico in Rome. 

The sense of connection was evident as Jannik Sinner returned to the capital for the first time since becoming the first Italian to reach No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings. The 23-year-old was met with a chorus of ‘Olé, Olé, Olé, Sinner' during his first practice session on Campo Centrale, and those chants have not ceased as he made his way through the draw.

Yet the enthusiasm isn't reserved just for one player. Having joined Sinner inside the Top 10, Lorenzo Musetti's rise marks another step forward for the country's depth, becoming just the sixth Italian player to achieve that feat. 

The adoration for Musetti was evident on Wednesday night, when the Italian rode the backing of a lively crowd to an inspired performance over defending champion Alexander Zverev. With his win, Musetti became the first Italian player to reach the semi-finals at all three clay-court ATP Masters 1000 events in one season.

“Full crowd, full stadium, that's a big advantage,” said Musetti. “All week there has been incredible support from the fans. I felt the adrenaline and the energy from the first point.”

Four of the six Italians to have cracked the Top 10 in PIF ATP Rankings history featured in the 2025 main draw in Rome, with Matteo Berrettini and Fabio Fognini joining Sinner and Musetti. The 37-year-old Fognini, who is tied with Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic for the most men's singles appearances in Rome (18), bade farewell to the tournament this year.

Fognini's last dance in the capital added a layer of emotion to proceedings during the opening week.

“I love them,” Fognini said of the Italian fans. “I would like to be remembered for [being] a guy who showed passion, sometimes too much passion, on the court. That's the way I was, I was feeling my work, feeling the tennis, feeling it in my veins.”

This year, the sense of occasion came with another unique twist. With the papal conclave taking place during the tournament's opening week, fans on Campo Centrale looked up to see the announcement of Pope Leo XIV's election broadcast live on the big screens.

It was a moment that added to the already distinctive atmosphere: Part history, part tennis, part something only Rome could deliver.







Fognini's passion has long been a part of Italy's tennis culture and, as the next generation rises, it's being carried forward by a younger group eager to make their own mark and leave an impression among the home fans.
The 21-year-old Luca Nardi, who was one of three Italian wild cards to win a main-draw match this year, spoke of what the tournament means to him and the importance of the vibrant fans.
“I was coming here when I was a kid to watch the tournament as a fan,” Nardi told ATPTour.com after edging Flavio Cobolli in a rowdy all-Italian clash on Grand Stand Arena. “Playing here in front of my home crowd is an amazing feeling. It's always amazing, the crowd is super motivated and cheers a lot for us. Every year it's special.”

Sinner has held the World No. 1 spot for 48 consecutive weeks, amassing six tour-level titles and just three match losses during that period. It's no surprise that the 23-year-old from San Candido's success has lifted expectation, as well as trophies.
“It's a motivation not just for me, but for all Italians,” Nardi said when asked of Sinner's progress. “I know Lorenzo [Musetti], Flavio [Cobolli] and everyone else very well, it's a big motivation for all of us.”
That belief is mirrored by investment. The Italian Tennis Federation has expanded its commitment to the Italian ATP Masters 1000 event with a renovated Foro Italico and the addition of a new 3,200-seat stadium: Super Tennis Arena.
“Every big tournament is trying to build new things, but Rome is a little bit different,” said tournament director Paolo Lorenzi. “We have a lot of history, and this place is not only for tennis, it's for other things.
“We just built this court from nothing. We have all the statues around the court, I think it's something really special. Also for the players, I like that they have this feeling of staying in a place in the middle of history.”

There are seven Italian men currently inside the Top 50, and Hologic WTA World No. 5 Jasmine Paolini emphasises the strength in depth across the board. Lorenzi, the former World No. 33, recognises the impact that this new wave of Italian stars is having — not just on the court, but how the country is perceived within the sport. Their professionalism and character, he says, are playing a key role in Italy's growing reputation.
“You have Sinner, Musetti, [Jasmine] Paolini, Berrettini… All of them have a good image,” Lorenzi said. “If you watch them, they are people that are working for tennis. At this moment, we are not only one of the best countries in the world for tennis, but also the image they give us is really important.”
With every chant, cheer, and rising star, Rome reminds us this is more than a tournament — it's a celebration of Italy's tennis renaissance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Zverev headlines Hamburg; Djokovic, Fritz chase glory in Geneva","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/scouting-report-hamburg-geneva-2025","Sat, 17 May 2025 10:20:52 GMT","

The European clay-court swing continues on the ATP Tour this week ahead of Roland Garros, with a host of stars in action across two tournaments.

Former champion Alexander Zverev has accepted a wild card to lead the field at the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, where #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik will also make his debut at the ATP 500. Top 10 stars Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz will compete at the Gonet Geneva Open, where the latter is the top seed at the ATP 250.

ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event.



FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN HAMBURG
1) Top Seed Zverev: After dropping to No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Zverev enters as the top seed in Hamburg, where he lifted the trophy in 2023 and finished runner-up last year. The German is 24-9 on the season and triumphed on home soil in Munich for his first trophy of the year. He will aim to find that form again this week.

2) Can Former Champ Rublev Rekindle Spark? Andrey Rublev is at his lowest ranking since January 2020, the year in which he triumphed in Hamburg. Owning a 11-11 record on the season, the 27-year-old will be eager to rediscover his spark after an opening-round defeat to Fabian Marozsan in Rome.

3) #NextGenATP Mensik's Debut: Mensik has enjoyed a stirring start to the 2025 season, and will aim to continue his form this week upon debut at the ATP 500. The 19-year-old Czech, who is 4-1 vs. Top-10 players this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, defeated Djokovic in the Miami final in March to claim his maiden tour-level title.

4) Davidovich Fokina Aims To Bolster Turin Chances: The sixth-seeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has been a serious contender in 2025. With finals in Acapulco and Delray Beach, as well as a run to the semi-finals in Monte-Carlo, the Spaniard is 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He will aim to keep pace with a strong showing in Hamburg.

5) Heliovaara/Patten Eye First ATP 500 Crown: Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten enter as the top seeds, where they will continue their pursuit of a maiden title at ATP 500 level. The reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champions are second in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.



FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN GENEVA
1) Djokovic Chases 100th Title: Making a late entry into the ATP 250 in Geneva, Djokovic continues his pursuit of a landmark 100th tour-level crown. A victory would place him alongside Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to reach triple-digit titles in the Open Era. Djokovic is seeded for a quarter-final meeting with Matteo Arnaldi, who prevailed in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash in Madrid.

2) Fritz Looks To Reset: World No. 4 Taylor Fritz has had a disrupted season due to an abdominal injury that kept him off court for a month between his semi-final run in Miami and his return in Madrid. Now healthy, the American is keen to regain his rhythm following an opening-round defeat to countryman Marcos Giron in Rome. The top-seeded Fritz starts against Jaume Munar or Quentin Halys.

3) Can Machac Go One Better? Riding a career-high No. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Tomas Machac arrives in Geneva after an impressive start to the season, highlighted by his maiden title at the ATP 500 in Acapulco. As last year's runner-up, the Czech will look to replicate — and ideally surpass — his deep run from 2024, when he sunk top seed Djokovic in the semi-finals before falling to Casper Ruud in the final.

4) Former Champ Jarry: Nicolas Jarry has this week dropped outside of the Top 100 for the first time since February 2023, but will hope to reignite fond memories of his time in Geneva to spark an uplift in form. The Chilean, who reached the final in 2019 and triumphed in 2023, owns an impressive 8-1 record at the Swiss ATP 250.

5) Will Arevalo/Pavic Continue Momentum? Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic, first in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Rankings, will headline the doubles action. After a stellar start to the season, in which they completed the coveted 'Sunshine Double', the duo will aim to sustain their momentum ahead of their title defence at Roland Garros.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will renew one of tennis' most captivating rivalries on Sunday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, where they'll face off for the first time in an ATP Masters 1000 final.

Both men are contesting their 25th tour-level final and will walk onto Campo Centrale not before 5:00 p.m. CEST with plenty at stake.

The dream final is ON! 🎬@InteBNLdItalia | #IBI25 pic.twitter.com/JPGGEmGuiB

Sinner is making his return to Tour for the first time since he won his third major at the Australian Open in January, but has shown little sign of rust. The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has just dropped one set en route to the final and delivered a commanding 6-0, 6-1 quarter-final dismantling of Casper Ruud before he recovered from losing the first set 1-6 against Tommy Paul to advance in the semis.

Now just one win away from claiming his fifth Masters 1000 crown and first on clay, the 23-year-old is bidding to become only the second Italian in history to triumph in Rome after Adriano Panatta in 1976.

But standing in his way is a familiar foe. Alcaraz leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 6-4, including wins in their past three encounters. On clay, they're tied at 1-1: Sinner won the 2022 Umag final, while Alcaraz prevailed in last year's Roland Garros semi-final en route to the crown.

""We know each other quite well now,"" Sinner said when asked about Alcaraz. ""It's always special to share the court with him. I feel like we both know how to play against each other a little bit, so we have to be prepared tactically. Of course, small things are going to be changed. But it's just a great test for me to see where I am.

“It's great for me to play against Carlos before the two Grand Slams. That for me is good because I see where I have to improve, what I have to do better. But hopefully it's going to be a good match.”







Alcaraz, meanwhile, enters the final with the most match wins on Tour in 2025 (29) and is eyeing a Tour-leading third title of the season. Like Sinner, though, the 22-year-old arrived in the Italian capital with question marks after missing his home Masters 1000 event in Madrid due to injury.
Any lingering doubts have been put to bed this fortnight, with Alcaraz dispatching Top 10 stars Jack Draper and Lorenzo Musetti en route to his eighth Masters 1000 final (6-1). While Alcaraz is known for his flair and charismatic style, he's been happy with the maturity he's shown on court in the Italian capital.
""Sometimes it's difficult because sometimes when I see the ball coming, a lot of things come to my mind. Sometimes it's difficult to choose the right decision,"" Alcaraz said following his semi-final win against Musetti. ""But I'm trying to improve that part of my game, trying not to think too much and do the right things always, even if it is not the brilliant shot or the brilliant decision.""

What awaits on Sunday is more than just a final — it's the next chapter in a rivalry that has already delivered some of the most electric tennis of the decade. Sinner, riding a 26-match winning streak according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and Alcaraz, always ready for a fight, bring out the best in one another. Their duels don't just deliver drama — they elevate the sport.
“It could be great, I'm not going to lie,"" Alcaraz said. ""He's playing great. I've been watching his matches. His level is really high right now. Every time that I play against him is always a battle, is always really, really tough. I kind of enjoy those moments, as well.""

With both players coming into peak form and hungry for more silverware, Sunday's final promises not just a battle for the Rome crown, but a possible preview of deeper showdowns to come in Paris and beyond.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Strasbourg draw: Pegula tops field; Raducanu meets Kasatkina","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4267241/strasbourg-draw-pegula-tops-field-raducanu-meets-kasatkina","Sat, 17 May 2025 14:41:29 GMT","

The Internationaux de Strasbourg draw is set. Top seed Jessica Pegula and four Grand Slam champions are in the mix at the year's last WTA 500 clay-court event.

The main draw for the year's final WTA 500 clay-court event, the Internationaux de Strasbourg, was revealed on Saturday.

Strasbourg: Draws | Scores | Order of play | Everything you need to know

World No. 4 Jessica Pegula is the top seed of the marquee field, which also includes Grand Slam champions Emma Raducanu, Elena Rybakina, Barbora Krejcikova and Sofia Kenin.

Just ahead of Roland Garros, the year's second Grand Slam, Strasbourg play begins on Sunday, May 18 and runs through the finals on Saturday, May 24.

The Top 4 seeds have first-round byes in the 28-player main draw.

Here is a quick breakdown of the main draw highlights:

Fourth-ranked Jessica Pegula comes in as the No. 1 seed and one of the winningest players on tour this year. She has won the second-most WTA main-draw matches in 2025 -- her 28 victories only trail Aryna Sabalenka's 34.

After her bye, Pegula will face either Anna Kalinskaya or a qualifier. Pegula is 0-2 in Strasbourg, having lost in the first round in 2019 and 2021.

At the other side of this quarter, No. 6 seed Daria Kasatkina will face wild card Emma Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion. Kasatkina heads into that meeting 3-0 against Raducanu.

The winner of that match will play the winner of an all-American clash between 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin and last year's Strasbourg runner-up Danielle Collins. Collins made the 2024 Strasbourg final before losing to Madison Keys.

One of the three Top 10 players in the field, World No. 10 Paula Badosa leads this quarter as the No. 3 seed. Badosa will be making her Strasbourg debut.

Badosa will face either Alizé Cornet or a qualifier in the second round. Wild card Cornet is back on tour after a year-long retirement, and this will be her first event on home soil since her return last month.

Liudmila Samsonova is the other seed in this quarter, and she will face Linda Noskova in the first round.

Elena Rybakina heads this quarter as the No. 4 seed and will face Wang Xinyu or a qualifier in the second round. 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina was a Strasbourg finalist in 2020 before falling in the final to Elina Svitolina.

At the other end of this quarter is No. 7 seed Barbora Krejcikova, who will play her first match of the year after injuries kept her off court all season. The reigning Wimbledon champion brings a 3-0 head-to-head record into her first round vs. Magda Linette.

Krejcikova won her first WTA singles title at Strasbourg in 2021 -- then won her first Grand Slam singles title two weeks later at 2021 Roland Garros.

Two-time Strasbourg champion Elina Svitolina was here as the No. 5 seed, but she withdrew from the draw due to a lower back injury. 

Beatriz Haddad Maia slots into her spot in the draw as the No. 9 seed. World No. 22 Haddad Maia has a tough first-round match against No. 23 Clara Tauson, who is now the highest-ranked unseeded player in the draw.

World No. 9 Emma Navarro sits at the bottom of the draw as the No. 2 seed. A Strasbourg quarterfinalist in 2023, Navarro will face either Magdalena Frech or a qualifier in the second round.

The Internationaux de Strasbourg draw is set. Top seed Jessica Pegula and four Grand Slam champions are in the mix at the year's last WTA 500 clay-court event.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri charged to pole position for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at the end of a dramatic, incident-filled Qualifying session in Imola, narrowly getting the better of Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes' George Russell.

Verstappen had led the way after the opening Q3 runs but Piastri turned the tables with his final lap to the chequered flag – a stunning effort of 1m 14.670s putting the championship leader three-hundredths up on his Dutch rival.

Russell took third after opting for medium tyres, rather than softs, on his last lap, with Lando Norris having to settle for fourth in the second McLaren ahead of Aston Martin racer Fernando Alonso (another to go with the yellow-marked compound).

Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon impressed for Williams on their way to sixth and seventh respectively, while Lance Stroll (also on mediums), Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and Alpine's Pierre Gasly rounded out the top 10 positions.

Ferrari had a nightmare first home Qualifying session of the season as Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton – having complained of brake issues throughout practice – both missed the Q3 cut en route to 11th and 12th places.

Qualifying results

It was also a disappointing run for home favourite Kimi Antonelli, who could not match team mate Russell's pace as he exited in 13th. Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and F1 returnee Franco Colapinto rounded out the order in the second Qualifying segment.

Colapinto had posted a quick enough lap to reach Q2 but was not able to take part in it after the Argentinian youngster crashed during the final moments of Q1, giving his Alpine mechanics work to do overnight.

Liam Lawson and Nico Hulkenberg just missed out on joining their respective Racing Bulls and Kick Sauber team mates in Q2, leaving them in P16 and P17 for Sunday's race – the German compromised by a mistake and trip through the gravel on his final lap.

Haas were another team to experience a tough day, with both Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman dropping out in Q1, the latter following a lengthy review into whether he got an improved lap time in just before the red flags were thrown for Colapinto's shunt – the final answer being no.

Yuki Tsunoda had his own enormous accident in the early minutes of Qualifying and fell at the Q1 hurdle – the Red Bull racer sliding off the track at high speed, launching into the barriers and flipping over before thankfully hopping out of his massively damaged car.

Qualifying Highlights: 2025 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

After three practice sessions topped by McLaren, attention turned to the all-important Qualifying hour at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari – and whether anyone could get close to the papaya team's drivers in Piastri and Norris.

There was also plenty of intrigue over the tyre strategies that would be adopted across Q1, Q2 and Q3, given most drivers' struggles to make improvements between the yellow-marked medium C5 and the red-marked soft C6 in final practice.

As the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane to mark the start of the first Qualifying phase, plenty of cars soon hit the track to get some banker laps in – a potential traffic headache on the way as the 20-strong field searched for clean air.

Drama ensued only a few minutes into the session, though, when Tsunoda suffered a scary crash through the Variante Villeneuve section, causing significant damage to all four corners of his upgraded Red Bull and bringing out the red flags.

Replays showed the Japanese driver taking too much kerb at the entry, losing control of the car and slamming into the barriers on the outside of the track – triggering a violent barrel roll before he landed upright in the gravel trap and walked away from the scene.

2025 Emilia Romagna GP Qualifying: Tsunoda out in Q1 after big crash brings out the red flags

Following a delay for barrier repairs, Qualifying resumed with Albon provisionally leading the way on softs from Alonso, Hamilton, Sainz and Leclerc, while half of the grid – including the likes of Piastri, Norris and Verstappen – had not yet posted a lap time.

When the session got back under way, with Colapinto being noted for entering the fast lane before the resumption time was announced, fans enjoyed a proper wave of green and purple sector times and the first moves from the anticipated front-runners.

Verstappen continued his apparent overnight progress to go quickest from Piastri on a 1m 15.175s, followed by an inspired Alonso, Russell, Gasly and Norris. At the other end of the order, both Sauber drivers, Haas cars and the sidelined Tsunoda sat in the drop zone.

Then came the final, decisive sequence of runs to settle who would reach Q2, with Bortoleto the driver who managed to escape – at the expense of Lawson – before Colapinto triggered another red flag with a nasty crash of his own exiting the Tamburello chicane.

Hulkenberg joined Lawson in the bottom five after running wide at Rivazza and losing a time for track limits, followed by Ocon and Bearman – who appeared to get a lap in before the second red flag, only to lose it after checks – and Tsunoda.

Knocked out: Lawson, Hulkenberg, Ocon, Bearman, Tsunoda

After another delay while Race Control worked out whether Bearman's final time should stand or not, Verstappen continued where he left off in Q1 by going quickest on the opening Q2 runs, before Norris and then Piastri (1m 15.241s) moved to the fore.

Russell held fourth position from the Ferraris, with Hadjar seventh over Alonso, Sainz and Antonelli, leaving Stroll, Gasly, Albon and Bortoleto in the drop zone for the second runs – Colapinto already eliminated from the action after his Q1 off.

Aston Martin opted for a different approach as the cars rolled back out of the pit lane – both Alonso and Stroll emerging on sets of medium tyres, rather than softs. The remaining drivers, minus the aforementioned Colapinto, stuck with the new C6 compound.

As the clock ticked down and the chequered flag came out, Sainz delivered a magical final lap to go fastest on a 1m 15.198s – putting him just ahead of Piastri, Norris, Russell and Verstappen, with the updated, medium-shod Aston Martins also safely through.

This spelt disaster for Ferrari drivers Leclerc and Hamilton and Mercedes rookie Antonelli, who were dramatically denied Q3 spots by Gasly, Hadjar and Albon and wound up 11th, 12th and 13th respectively, ahead of Bortoleto and Colapinto.

Knocked out: Leclerc, Hamilton, Antonelli, Bortoleto, Colapinto

Antonelli and the two Ferrari drivers could not make it through to Q3

Piastri and Norris stated their intentions in the early minutes of Q3 by dipping into the 1m 14s bracket and forming a McLaren 1-2 – the Australian's benchmark time of 1m 14.821s putting him around a tenth-and-a-half up on his team mate.

However, Verstappen and Red Bull meant business as well, with the reigning four-time World Champion shooting to the top of the times on a 1m 14.772s, and only adding to the anticipation for the final runs to the flag.

When those arrived, Piastri, as he has done on so many occasions this season, hit another level to clock a 1m 14.670s and edge out Verstappen, while Russell climbed to third after switching from soft tyres to mediums.

Norris could only manage fourth, some three-tenths away from Piastri, with Alonso (also on mediums) taking fifth, and Williams impressing again thanks to Sainz and Albon placing P6 and P7 on the timesheets.

Stroll was the third and final medium-tyre runner in Q3 in eighth, as Hadjar and Gasly completed the top 10 for Racing Bulls and Alpine after those early Qualifying exits for Ferrari and Antonelli.

Piastri punched the air with delight after securing pole position

“It was a great session, a very tough session with all the delays, red flags, and then also the tyres, the tyres were very, very tricky today,” said Piastri. “I think after yesterday everyone thought the C6 was not too bad and then today it was a real mystery. The team did a great job, put the car in a nice window. We've been trying a few different things this weekend and we got into a nice place for Qualifying. The lap was good, I had about four cars [around me] in the last corner which didn't help, but it was enough, so I'm very, very happy with the job we've done and excited for tomorrow now.”

HIGHLIGHTS: Piastri pips Verstappen to pole at Imola as red flags disrupt Qualifying

Lando Norris set the pace during the third and final practice hour ahead of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the Briton beating team mate Oscar Piastri to the top spot while Red Bull's Max Verstappen went third quickest.

After two busy sessions at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari on Friday – featuring several incidences of traffic – the drivers headed out again at 1230 local time on Saturday for a last opportunity to fine-tune their cars ahead of a crucial Qualifying later in the day.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Are McLaren the team to beat again at Imola – or can a rival cause an upset?

Norris was the first to briefly hit the track after the green light was displayed in a quiet start to FP3, the McLaren driver completing an out lap to give the hard tyre its debut running of the weekend. And while many seemed content to wait it out in their respective garages, other cars slowly began to emerge onto the circuit as the session got going.

Lewis Hamilton joined those making an early appearance on track, the seven-time World Champion perhaps keen to test the feel of the Ferrari after both he and team mate Charles Leclerc struggled with braking issues on Friday. The Briton also set an initial benchmark in the process, sitting top on a lap of 1m 15.866s.

Practice 3 results

As the session neared its halfway point and the action picked up, there was an eye-catching display from Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar, the Frenchman making up for the disappointment of his FP2 spin by slotting into P1 on the timesheets via an effort of 1m 15.508s, just 0.021s ahead of Leclerc in P2.

Things were not going quite so well for his team mate Liam Lawson, however, who suffered a 360-degree spin that looked to have ruined his medium tyres. Elsewhere in the Red Bull stable, Verstappen had gone fastest on a 1m 15.130s, leading from Norris and Hadjar.

There was a bit of a moment in the pit lane as Hadjar prepared to complete a practice start near the exit – only for the Williams of Carlos Sainz to appear in the fast lane, resulting in a close call between them. Hadjar subsequently apologised over the radio.

With attentions for many turning to the soft-shod flying runs, George Russell ran wide out on track before reporting: “This ride is definitely a bit worse today.” The Mercedes man was not the only one to have a wobble, with Verstappen and Piastri also making mistakes during their laps.

Elswhere, Yuki Tsunoda did not seem happy at the wheel of the Red Bull, the Japanese driver radioing in that he had “absolutely zero pace”, while up ahead Norris had gone quickest with a time of 1m 14.897s.

Hadjar caught the eye by going fastest at one stage of the session

Kimi Antonelli gave his home crowd something to smile about as he improved to go fourth, having seemingly lacked pace in comparison to Russell throughout the session. Norris, meanwhile, had a trip through the gravel before making his way back to the pits.

While Piastri bettered his previous lap to move up to second, it was ultimately not enough to dislodge Norris from the top, the Briton ending the session in P1 thanks to his earlier effort that kept him one-tenth clear of his team mate. Verstappen followed in third – the only non-McLaren driver within two-tenths of the papaya cars – with Antonelli fourth and Leclerc fifth.

Sainz put his Williams into P6, while Hadjar, Russell, Alex Albon and Hamilton completed the top 10 order. Fernando Alonso claimed P11 for Aston Martin – a team that ran a different strategy by gathering data on the hard tyre during the session – ahead of Haas' Ollie Bearman, Lance Stroll, Lawson and Alpine's Pierre Gasly.

Gabriel Bortoleto – who suffered a crash on Friday at the end of FP1 – was 16th in the Kick Sauber, followed by Tsunoda, the returning Franco Colapinto for Alpine, Nico Hulkenberg and the Haas of Esteban Ocon bringing up the rear in 20th and last place.

With the last practice session of the weekend now complete, the drivers and teams will have a final chance to debrief and examine their data before returning to action for Qualifying, which is set to get underway at 1600 local time.

Oscar Piastri claimed his third pole position of the season for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, pipping Max Verstappen and George Russell as two red flags disrupted an incident-filled Qualifying.

The current Drivers' Championship leader, who has won the last three Grands Prix, set a 1m 14.670s with his final effort despite not improving in the final sector after complaining of traffic.

Verstappen fell short by just 0.034s, as Russell beat the second McLaren of Lando Norris to third having used a medium set of tyres as drivers struggled to keep the soft C6 tyre alive for the whole lap around the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit.

The opening Q1 session was red-flagged twice following crashes for Yuki Tsunoda, the Japanese driver rolling his Red Bull at the Villeneuve chicane, and the returning Franco Colapinto hitting the barrier in his Alpine at the Tamburello chicane.

Meanwhile, Ferrari suffered a dreadful Qualifying in front of the Tifosi as both Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton failed to make it through Q2 having lacked pace.

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella has pinpointed where Oscar Piastri has improved over the last year as a driver, with the Australian on the brink of matching a record held by Ayrton Senna at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix this weekend.

Piastri has been the pacesetter during the 2025 campaign, securing four wins – including three on the bounce in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Miami – that has allowed him to take a 16-point lead in the Drivers' Championship over team mate Lando Norris.

If Piastri claims a fourth win in succession this weekend, it will match a record held by Senna of four wins in a row with McLaren, which dates back to 1991 when the Brazilian won the opening quartet of races en route to his third and final world title.

""Oscar himself is gaining these kinds of chances and opportunities because overall Oscar has become a faster driver,"" said Stella, who has worked alongside World Champions including Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen during his career.

Stella has helped turn McLaren's fortunes around with Piastri and Norris both winning this year

""I think that's the main thing in which he has improved, and by being a faster driver then this means he can have more space to process situations, process information, focus on the right details, because the foundation from a speed point of view is there, so that's where I think Oscar has improved the most.

""But it's a very long season, we need to keep the concentration [in the] team and Oscar himself because we have only done one fourth of the season so far and there's a long way to go.""

FP2: Piastri leads another McLaren 1-2 at Imola as Hadjar brings out red flags

McLaren dominated both Friday practice sessions at Imola, with Piastri fractionally faster than Norris in each session, but with the duo cautious about their chances for Qualifying on Saturday, Stella is keen for the team to be competitive at all venues this season.

""The chances of winning a race for a McLaren driver, based on the statistics over the previous races and based on the competitiveness that we saw even in Free Practice 1, remain high, and that's good for us because that's what we want,"" he said.

""We want to be competitive in every single circuit, even if I think circuits like Miami or Bahrain or China gave us a bit more opportunities because the car this year seems to be performing very well where we have low-speed corners, and here in Imola it is anything medium to high-speed corners so we will see.""

Stella pinpoints where Piastri has improved in 2025

With McLaren claiming every Grand Prix victory in 2025 bar one - Max Verstappen's victory in Suzuka - the squad are enjoying a healthy lead of 105 points in the Teams' Standings, ahead of second-placed Mercedes.

And, as the start of the European leg of the season gets underway, it marks the time many teams bring upgrades to their machines to try and gain on their rivals, with the papaya squad no exception.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Are McLaren the team to beat again at Imola – or can a rival cause an upset?

""The upgrades for this weekend are actually relatively minor,"" explained Stella. ""We plan to deliver some more upgrades over the course of the season and some more substantial upgrades because somehow, like I said before, it's just one fourth of the season done so far and there's definitely the need to remain concentrated on improving our performance.

""We see everyone else is bringing upgrades, we see floors, bodywork, quite substantial parts that are being upgraded, so I'm just looking forward to seeing the improvements we can make on the MCL39, which thankfully was competitive right from the start.

""We will see this Grand Prix in Imola, then we have a big variation with Monaco, I think this will give us even more of an idea of how competitive we are, but definitely we will need some upgrades to consolidate our position.""

As the Q1 segment entered into its final minutes – and Colapinto fought to make it through to Q2 – the 21-year-old took too much kerb at the exit of Turn 3, causing him to spin into the barriers.

From there, the Aston Martin Development driver escaped out of DRS range and then managed the gap to those behind, only coming under slight pressure from Arvid Lindblad in the closing laps.

The Campos Racing and Red Bull Junior Team driver had started fifth on the grid, but with a great getaway and decisive move on Miyata for second in the opening stages, secured second place.

In another unfiltered rant, the president's missive included a veiled threat concerning the rocker's re-entry to the U.S.


							By 

	Michele Amabile Angermiller



	President Donald Trump thinks Bruce Springsteen is “highly overrated … not a talented guy – just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.” Trump shared his always unfiltered comments on his Truth social media platform on Friday, following Springsteen's admonishment of his administration at the opening of the E Street Band's European “Land of Hopes and Dreams” tour Wednesday night (May 14) in Manchester, England.


	“Sleepy Joe didn't have a clue as to what he was doing, but Springsteen is ‘dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!),” Trump wrote, referencing former President Joe Biden. “This dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare'. Then we'll all see how it goes for him!”

	To recap: Springsteen opened the European leg of his 2025 tour with a scathing message taking aim at the U.S. president and the Trump administration. The Manchester stop by the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and his E Street Band was at Etihad Stadium.

	During a pause in the show, Springsteen addressed the crowd: “The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ‘n' roll in dangerous times,” he said. “In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration. Tonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!”


	The setlist included 29 songs, many of which touched on themes related to American identity, justice, and civic life. The concert opened with “Land of Hope and Dreams,” which included a snippet of “People Get Ready” at the end. That was followed by “Death to My Hometown,” “Lonesome Day,” “My Love Will Not Let You Down” and “Rainmaker,” which was performed live for the first time and introduced as being “dedicated to our dear leader.”


	Other songs performed during the main set included “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “The Promised Land,” “Hungry Heart,” “My Hometown,” “Youngstown,” “Murder Incorporated” (performed for the first time since 2017) and “Long Walk Home.”

	











	Springsteen also played “House of a Thousand Guitars,” followed by “My City of Ruins,” “Letter to You,” “Because the Night,” “Human Touch,” “Wrecking Ball,” “The Rising,” “Badlands,” and “Thunder Road.”


	The encore began with “Born in the U.S.A.,” followed by “Born to Run,” “Bobby Jean,” “Dancing in the Dark” (which included band introductions) and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” during which images of late band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici were shown on screen. The show concluded with “Chimes of Freedom,” a Bob Dylan cover not performed by Springsteen since 1988 on his “Tunnel of Love” tour.


	The performance in Manchester marked the start of Springsteen's latest European tour, with additional dates scheduled across the continent in the coming months. His remarks and song choices come amid ongoing political discourse in the United States surrounding the 2024 presidential election and the return of Donald Trump to the political spotlight.


	Earlier this year, Springsteen participated in the 2025 American Music Honors, where he performed with Smokey Robinson, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and John Fogerty. The event, held at Monmouth University's Pollak Theatre, celebrated musical legends and featured tributes and performances by numerous artists. Springsteen, along with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt, joined honorees in renditions of classic songs, including “This Land Is Your Land,” “Fortunate Son” and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.”

	











	Springsteen is set to perform again in Manchester on May 17 and 20. 


	In response to Trump's comments, which also took aim at Taylor Swift, the American Federation of Musicians released a statement that reads: “[The AFM] will not remain silent as two of our members — Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift — are singled out and personally attacked by the President of the United States. Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift are not just brilliant musicians, they are role models and inspirations to millions of people in the United States and across the world. Whether it's Born in the USA or the Eras Tour, their music is timeless, impactful, and has deep cultural meaning. Musicians have the right to freedom of expression, and we stand in solidarity with all our members.”

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' ex Cassie Ventura confronted questions about financial incentives on the final day of her cross-examination, while Richard testified to witnessing Combs' abuse.

	Rachel Scharf



Sean “Diddy” Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, faced probing questions about her financial motivations on her last day of testimony in the rapper's sex-trafficking trial on Friday (May 16), while Danity Kane alum Dawn Richard also took the stand and said she witnessed Combs abusing Ventura.


	Richard's testimony closed out the first week of Combs' much-awaited criminal trial, in which the music mogul is accused of coercing Ventura and other women into participating in drug-fueled sex shows known as “freak-offs.” R&B singer Ventura, the prosecution's star witness, spent four days on the stand detailing how Combs allegedly controlled and physically abused her during their 11-year relationship.


	Ventura faced her second and final day of cross-examination on Friday from Combs' attorney Anna Estevao, according to the Associated Press and the New York Times. Defense lawyers had previously suggested they may want to keep questioning Ventura next week, but backed off the request after prosecutors flagged concerns that the very pregnant Ventura might go into labor over the weekend.   




			Trending on Billboard		







	Continuing a strategy from the first day of cross-examination, Estevao confronted Ventura with more seemingly loving text messages between her and Combs. Some appeared to support the defense's theory that the pair's sex life, while unconventional, was consensual.


	“I don't want to freak off for the last time,” Ventura wrote in one such text to Combs. “I want it to be the first time for the rest of our lives.”


	Estevao also tried to imply that Ventura is motivated by money to lie about her experience with Combs, getting the witness to reveal for the first time that she's getting a $10 million settlement from the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles, where Combs was seen beating Ventura in infamous video footage from 2016.


	The newly-revealed $10 million settlement is on top of a $20 million civil payout Ventura got from Combs himself after she sued the rapper in 2023. Estevao noted Friday that Ventura canceled an upcoming concert tour soon after inking that settlement.


	“As soon as you saw that you were going to get the $20 million, you canceled the tour because you didn't need it anymore, right?” Estevao asked Ventura.


	“That wasn't the reason why,” Ventura replied.


	When prosecutors got another chance to question Ventura on re-direct examination later on Friday, she explained that she would give the money back if she could reverse Combs' abuse. “If I never had to have freak-offs I would have agency and autonomy,” Ventura said.


	After Ventura completed her testimony, her attorney, Douglas Wigdor, shared a statement from the singer: “This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,” Ventura wrote. “I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.  For me, the more I heal, the more I can remember, and the more I can remember, the more I will never forget.”


	Another figure in the music world took the witness stand after Ventura departed Friday: Dawn Richard, whose girl group Danity Kane was launched by Combs' MTV reality show Making the Band.


	Richard has a pending civil lawsuit against Combs, in which she alleges he harassed and assaulted her during “years of inhumane working conditions.” But those claims aren't part of the criminal trial; instead, Richard served as a corroborating witness for Ventura.


	During her brief testimony, Richard told the jury she witnessed Combs physically assault Ventura on multiple occasions. In one 2009 encounter, Richard said she saw Combs punch, kick, drag and even try to hit Ventura on the head with a cooking skillet.


	The trial is expected to pick up Monday (May 19) with testimony from Ventura's longtime friend Kerry Morgan, followed by other alleged victims of Combs' freak-offs. The jury could hear evidence for up to two months total.

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


	Two of Ang Lee's most disruptive films celebrate anniversaries this year; they may be five years apart, but the connective tissue between them is undeniable. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) was such an intense high-wire act, the grueling shoot in China left Lee barely able to stand and fully intending to give it all up. It was Lee's father who made his son promise to try one more time, because retirement, he thought, would set a bad example for the filmmaker's son. Lee's father died in 2004, weeks after making his son promise to give it one more go, and Lee kept that promise with 2005's Brokeback Mountain, an experience that made the filmmaker fall back in love with storytelling, fueling everything he has done since including Life of Pi, which brought him his second Oscar for directing. 

	











	When I meet Lee in his Manhattan offices, he is struggling to hit a budget number and a green light from Sony Pictures on a Bruce Lee movie that will star the director's son, Mason. He hopes to revolutionize fight choreography one more time. He certainly accomplished that with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film had non-martial artist actors Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang soaring in Cirque du Soleil-style aerial battles woven into a 19th century China-based drama about duty, honor, vengeance, repressed desires and lost love, mixed seamlessly into the ass-kicking wuxia genre. It was a marked contrast to Brokeback Mountain, another forbidden love story powered by the performances of Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway.

DEADLINE: The aerial combat and wire fighting in Crouching Tiger fit loosely into the wuxia genre of martial arts films but turned out like nothing seen before in Hollywood. What ground are you hoping to break 25 years later?


ANG LEE: I hope I can revolutionize something in action shooting. Crouching Tiger was my first taste of martial arts filming, and I learned the hard way that it's not about martial arts, it's about choreography. It's a two-person dance, in the form of fighting. They collaborate with each other instead of trying to kill each other. [The Bruce Lee project] is different. It's not about choreography, although he did that extremely well. It's very different from Crouching Tiger, more like Sense and Sensibility in an ass-kicking form. Bruce Lee was the first and probably only person, even now, that put expression and thought into his fighting instead of just dazzling you. Nobody had done that with such dramatic effect, such a visceral impact.

	











DEADLINE: You shot Crouching Tiger in China when that country was just opening itself up to outsiders. Why was it such a hard film to make?


LEE: I didn't know how to do it. I believe I'm a pretty quick learner in any kind of filmmaking, like the previous movie, Ride with the Devil. Horses, guns. Also, it was the first time I'd tried using an anamorphic lens, which is very different than your normal lens, and I picked it up in two weeks. The first action sequence, I didn't know what I was doing, I was flabbergasted, but the next one I did quite well, and in two weeks I'd figured out gunfights, action, how to frame horses. On the other hand, it took me two and a half months on Crouching Tiger to even know what I should be looking at for action in a martial arts film, even though the choreography team were among the most brilliant filmmakers I know.


DEADLINE: None of the stars of Crouching Tiger were martial artists. Chow Yun-fat was known for John Woo's films and their stylized two-handed gunplay. Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang trained as dancers. What was the biggest challenge there?


LEE: Michelle can act. I know she can act. She may not act the way I like, because she picked it up from Hong Kong action crews. Nobody talks about acting in action movies, because you have to count the beats, otherwise you get hit. That's all you think about if you don't want to get hit or poked in the eye. I wanted to build in performances.

	[Wuxia] is a great form of art if you know how to use it. I would sacrifice a little bit on swiftness of movement to go for the acting. It was a great challenge for the greatest choreographer, Mr. Yuen Woo-ping, I'm glad he has such a heart for drama, for art, that he was willing to compromise the visual effect — of which he's a master — for the dramatic effect. So, that's something different from that movie, I would say. The formal martial art [film] is full of regulations. They're supposed to do this or that, it's preachy and pulpy. 


	I wanted to make great cinema out of that. That was my yearning, to grab the Chinese tradition. My fantasy China does not exist in Taiwan or Hong Kong or China anymore. It's a lost thing. But I was brought up by that culture. With that movie, I'm tracing my cultural roots. You certainly don't see that in martial art movies. Little hints, but not really.


	By nature, I'm like Michelle's character. I was never rebellious. As a child, I was very obedient, extremely docile and shy. I behaved well, but my mind was drifting. I didn't know where my focus was, until I start making movies. But filmmakers didn't get respect from my father's generation. There were no role models. My father loved me. He loved drama, and he loved movies like everybody else. It's just that his son having a filmmaker's life was hard for him. He was a very respected person, a high-school principal. But he still supported me. To go to film school, that cost a lot of money back then.


DEADLINE: When did you feel you'd paid off on that faith?


LEE: Well, finally he caved in. At first, he thought, “OK, if you have to make a movie, go make a movie. But once you get that out of your system, you can do something more serious.” I remember he said that to me after Sense and Sensibility. It was being treated like a national treasure, winning awards — though not me, because nobody knew who I was yet — and he said, “I think, at this rate, you might get an Oscar when you're 50. Then you can think about something serious.” But I'm pretty sure he was proud of me even then.

DEADLINE: Why did Crouching Tiger take such a toll on you?


LEE: It took a little bit over five months to shoot, and they were long days because we traveled to many places and those martial arts scenes take a long time. Each fight scene would take at least two weeks, from 16 to 20 hours a day. For the first two months I shot over 12 hours a day. If a non-martial arts director did that, they'd leave the martial arts team to do their thing. But I wanted to do everything myself, because I wanted the drama in there. So, I'd be shooting drama, then move and set up the wire work, which took hours.


	I'd go to the other set, which was an hour away, and at night I'd do night-fighting until five o'clock in the morning. Traveling back, I'd doze off in the car, take a shower, sleep maybe an hour and go to the next 12 hours. I'd shoot six days a week, and my Sunday involved doing only 12 hours of shooting and watching dailies. Plus, there was another nearly five months in prep. We lived in a hotel. My room was $13 a day. There were, like, eight months where I didn't have more than three hours of rest.


	It's the hardest movie I ever made. I cannot do that anymore. But it's very memorable. We had a blast. We were very inventive [with the wire work]. After our movie, I don't think anybody is allowed to do that anymore. It's all digital. It doesn't risk somebody's life, let alone the lives of the biggest stars in Asia. That was really dangerous.


DEADLINE: You followed Crouching Tiger with Hulk, another big movie…


LEE: I thought I'd retire after Crouching Tiger because I was literally spent. At the end when I was mixing sound, I couldn't even sit down. I was lying down on the couch. It was that bad. I said, “I've had enough. My dad was right.” And then three months later, what am I doing? I'm doing Hulk. That was another exhausting five-month shoot, but I found a new playground. For the first time in my career, I learned about visual effects. After that, I was really tired, and I wanted to retire.

DEADLINE: Why didn't you?


LEE: My father, for the first time in his life said, “Go ahead and make another movie. You're only 49. It's a bad example for your boy.” And then two weeks later, he passed away. I'd taken Hulk over Brokeback Mountain. I thought it was the little movie that I'd missed. I assumed it had gotten made. So, I asked [producer] James Schamus, “Remember Brokeback Mountain? How did it turn out?” James went out right away and bought the rights.


DEADLINE: When the father who resisted your film path becomes the reason you didn't give up, that sounds like divine intervention.


LEE: I wanted to retire. I think Brokeback Mountain brought me back, nursing me back to love life, to love filmmaking. And I'm still standing, still making movies, thanks to that movie. That was the one movie where I felt, “There's a movie god who loves me. He wants me to keep going.” And the movie was so perfect. What have I done to deserve that movie? Everything about it was good. At first, I didn't even want to go back to work. I was so emotionally drained, because my father had passed away, and I was exhausted after the other two movies. Physically, I was drained. I got Achilles tendonitis. My body just gave up.

	I don't know what it is about that movie. It's a sad movie, but it's about love. It's so nurturing. Everybody's in love. And it was great. Every actor turned out to be great. I didn't do much, I just did the coverage. I didn't have a cinematic ambition. I just basically made the day and secured the performances. And then, in the first cut, I realized I'd got something. People are so affected by it. You can never plan how people feel about the movie. It never happens as you'd expect. But people swoon over the movie. I thought it was a small arthouse movie. I thought no American company would want it. I thought nobody would see it, so I could do whatever I wanted. And coming from Hulk, there was practically no budget. So, I learned that the effectiveness of a movie is literally something you cannot predict. It doesn't correspond with how much effort you put in it. Making Crouching Tiger was a thousand times harder than making Brokeback Mountain. And Brokeback Mountain was a great success that just seemed to happen on its own.


DEADLINE: The movie premiered in Venice and soon became an Oscar frontrunner. How surprised were you by the warm embrace?


LEE: I knew it was a good movie because, from the first cut, which I showed to friends and family, I could see that it had an effect on people. Then, at Venice, people were gushing. I did not expect to win there, so I flew to Toronto for the festival. I thought, “There's no way we're going to win.” When I landed in Toronto, my publicist was at the airport. I walked off the plane, and he said, “Turn around, they want you to go back.” I'd won the Golden Lion. I'm always uptight when I get awards, never happy. I'm a shy person. Except that one time. Everybody was smiling at me. The movie had so much love. I was very happy. And then Toronto, of course, complained because I wasn't on the red carpet. But it was all good; I knew I had a winner of a movie. I still didn't imagine it would go to the shopping malls. That was really a surprise.


	When a film takes off, you see it go up in the box office, and suddenly everybody is going to see it. I remember the L.A. Times ran a headline saying, “Ang Lee Breaks the Last American Frontier.” I was like, “Kill me!” I was very nervous. I'm a shy person. A foreigner. I got nervous when they started describing me as a hero. And then it stopped, at $80 million. Maybe everybody who wanted to watch it had watched it. But it stopped right there. In the heat of the Oscar campaign. You'd think it would keep going, but everything just stopped.


DEADLINE: Why?


LEE: I don't know. I guess there was only so much tolerance in America at the time.


DEADLINE: After winning most major awards, Brokeback Mountain lost to Crash at the Oscars in a big upset.


LEE: When I got my award [for Best Director] right before [the Best Picture announcement], the stage manager said, “Just stay here.” We were by the curtain. Then he was like, “Uh. Oh my god…” So, everybody expected us to win. He looked genuinely surprised.


DEADLINE: You must have wondered why. Was it the limits of tolerance, aversion to a gay love affair in the Oscar voting body?












LEE: Your guess is as good as mine. There are times when I feel like there's an unlimited willingness to watch the movie. There's so much love for it. Generally, you feel like it's a breakthrough, that it broke all barriers. People seem to melt down. And you cannot even define it as gay cinema. It's not gay cinema, right? It's a love story.


DEADLINE: I guess they weren't ready to give it the Best Picture at that time…


LEE: I'm nothing but grateful. I have no bitterness. It never occurred to me. Maybe just for one second, when Jack Nicholson opened the envelope, and then it disappeared. Honest to God, I never held any grudge because Crouching Tiger didn't get me the director award. I was winning straight up, until the Oscars. But it didn't really bother me. Even that little grudge I had was because I was the leader of the pack. I represented the movie. So many people worked on it, I wanted it to win. So, it takes a few seconds for that to pass. How many people get to experience that? How many filmmakers? Not many.


DEADLINE: When did you realize you had something with Crouching Tiger?


LEE: It was late. After the movie was done, we still had four months of post-production. Most of the time it was doing looping, recording Michelle and Chow Yun-fat's Mandarin dialogue. And then we had the visual effects. The post team was only me, my editor, and my assistant editor. Only three of us. None of us had visual effects experience. It was all over the place. Back then, there were no preview screenings, just friends and family, and we couldn't even show it with subtitles. So, unless they were Chinese, they wouldn't really know what was going on. So, no, I didn't know [we had something] until we went to Cannes, where people cheered. They applauded; they screamed.


DEADLINE: These are two risky movies, and we haven't focused on the others, like Life of Pi, which brought your second Best Director Oscar, or Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, which didn't catch on with audiences but broke ground with high-resolution formats. How much harder would it be for you to make either movie now?


LEE: It was hard before, but it was possible. Right now, it's impossible. You are not allowed to take risks and find something new, but if you don't change, you're dead. I don't get it. I'm going to keep fighting. And if it takes longer, then it takes longer. I think the world was more open-minded then. Today, it's hard. The whole world has turned so hostile. I wish it was different. I miss those days. I miss the good old days.

	A man in his 30s was seriously injured while walking on Cannes' famous Croisette promenade on Saturday when he was struck by a falling palm tree brought down by high winds.


	Local media reported that the victim was a Japanese producer attending the Cannes Film Festival, but Deadline has yet to confirm this information.


	The 78th edition of the festival is currently in full tilt with more than 15,000 cinema professionals in town to do business, joined by thousands of day-trippers and tourists hoping to get a glimpse of stars.

	According to local media reports, the incident took place close to the Gray d'Albion beach around mid-morning when a palm tree was blow over by a gust of wind.


	“I was sitting when there was a terrible gust of wind. I heard a cry and turned around and saw a palm tree had been uprooted,” a festival attendee, named as Marthy Fink, told news agency AFP.


	“It knocked the person to the ground, who was badly injured,” she continued, suggesting that in her view the palm tree was in bad condition.


	A small section of the Croisette close to where the palm tree fell  remained cordoned off as of late afternoon on Saturday.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	No good deed goes unpunished in Urchin, a London-set character study that shows so much sophisticated and worldly wisdom it's hard to believe that its writer, director and co-star is only 28 years old. Built around a charismatic performance from Frank Dillane, best known for his role as recovering heroin addict Nick Clark in AMC's Fear the Walking Dead, Harris Dickinson's remarkable feature debut takes the tropes of socially conscious British cinema and fashions a deceptively nuanced cautionary tale that isn't so much about the failings of that society as our own personal capacity for self-destruction.

	











	At the center of the drama is Michael (Dillane), who we find sleeping rough, woken up by city noise and the earnest entreaties of a largely ignored street preacher. In a subtle moment that tells you exactly who he is, Michael rudely pushes past her, then sets about his day. After charging his phone, begging for change and socializing at a soup kitchen, he realizes that his wallet has gone missing, stolen by his junkie friend Nathan (Dickinson). Dirty, scruffy and scarily intense, Michael accosts horrified passers-by to ask if they've seen him. “He's wearing blue trousers and there's blood on his face,” he says, and they react exactly as you think they might, and probably would yourself.


	Filmed in covert (improvised?) documentary-style situations, Michael is all but invisible thus far, and his interactions with the public feel so real that it's actually quite jarring when the film makes an abrupt segue from its loose so-far, so-verité aesthetic to tight drama with the film's shocking defining incident. After Michael finds Nathan outside a busy office building, a confrontation ensues, drawing in a good Samaritan, Simon, who diffuses the tension and offers to buy Michael lunch. In lieu of a thank-you, Michael waits until his benefactor's guard is down, assaults him, then steals his watch and pawns it.

	Michael's ensuing eight-month prison sentence is handled in the most extraordinary way; as he showers, naked and vulnerable, the camera pans down to follow the falling water as it circles the drain then goes down, down and even further down, to the darkest depths of the ocean, even. And then, before you know it, Michael is out of captivity and back in society, encouraged by sympathetic social worker Nadia, who finds him a hostel, and employed by Franco, the kind-hearted manager of a hotel that we hear described by its guests as “a shithole,” who offers him work as a prep cook in his kitchen.

	











	This is where the film gets interesting. Can Michael hold the job down after living so long in the margins? He seems to want to try, committing to getting himself sober and boasting to Nadia of an alcohol-free night doing karaoke with a couple of female workmates, joining in as they sing the cheesy but emotional “Whole Again” by ill-starred '90s British girl group Atomic Kitten. He even listens to a self-help CD, and its holistic gibberish seems to be taking hold as he tries to take control of his new freedom.


	In fact, he becomes so comfortable that he agrees to a conciliatory meeting with his victim, Simon, who bears no malice but, more damagingly, articulates the question Michael has been running away from all these years: Why did he do it? The scene is uncomfortable and oddly brief; unusually for an actor-director, Dickinson doesn't go in for showy scenes and leaves a lot to be inferred. But the things he leaves out are every bit as powerful as the things he leaves in; this meeting triggers a reaction in Michael, a voracious, cancerous, near-Cronenbergian self-loathing that devours his self-esteem.  


RELATED: Full List Of Cannes Palme d'Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery


	This kind of unraveling isn't that new in the pantheon of British kitchen-sink dramas, but what is quite startling is the film's clear-eyed, unsentimental portrayal of Michael as the author of his own tragedy. Dillane is quite the revelation in this respect; his backstory is lightly sketched, aside from a few references to his adoptive parents, but somehow it's all there. With his incongruous RP accent and oddly naive façade, he's quite likely posher than he lets on, but there's a sense that his street smarts have long since obliterated that past, that identity. Toward the end, he watches, with detachment, as a snake devours a mouse. Survival is his game, an addict's mindset described by author William S. Burroughs as the algebra of need (“The more absolute the need, the more predictable the behavior becomes until it is mathematically certain”).


	This might seem like cold right-wing rhetoric in today's charity-averse world, but Dickinson's film is more complex than that. It doesn't tell us to help the needy; it wants us to see that sometimes the needy can't and won't accept that help. Likewise, Urchin doesn't offer any answers, nor does it try, but it does open up a conversation about the people who fall through the cracks. Dillane is key here, whether pacing the streets in tacky charity-shop gear or invading people's spaces with his spidery, unwanted attention. It's to the credit of both that the film lands its ending, a strangely poetic but unexpectedly moving knockout. A vision of purgatory, perhaps, or an X-ray of a man who somehow lost his soul.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	When it came to unpacking the politics of MAGA culture and Donald Trump in Ari Aster's Eddington, there was no dodging the subject for the filmmaker and stars Pedro Pascal and Joaquin Phoenix at the Cannes presser this afternoon.


	Actually, Phoenix let Pascal do all the talking. 


Eddington is a melting pot about the fallout from Covid, the frenzy of social media and how Black Lives Matter gripped the country. The pic follows crusty Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), who decides to take on the town's mayor, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal). But the odds are greatly stacked against Cross, and he tries to take the situation into his own hands.

	











	Expounded Pascal when asked how the politics of the movie speaks to the Trumpian era: “It's very scary to participate in a movie that speaks to issues like this; it's far too intimidating a question for me to address. I'm not informed enough. I want people to be safe and protective. I want very much to be on the right side of history.”

	He added: “I felt like [Aster] wrote something that was all our worst fears as that lockdown experience was already a fracturing society. This was building toward an untethered sense of reality, and there is a point of not going back. I was overwhelmed by that fear, and it's wonderful it was confirmed by Ari.”

	Said Aster about his Cannes Film Festival debut, “I wrote this movie in a state of fear and anxiety. I wanted to try and pull back and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore.”


	He added: “I feel like for the last 20 years we've fallen into this age of hyper-individualism and that social force that used to be central in liberal mass democracies, which is an agreed-upon thing in the world, that is gone now. Covid felt like the moment where that link was finely cut for good.”


	Asked whether there would be a second civil war in America, Aster quipped, “I don't speak English!”

	“I feel like we're on a dangerous road and we're living in an experiment that hasn't gone well,” the Midsommar and Beau Is Afraid filmmaker said. “I feel there is no way out of it. What I said what mass liberal democracies always had, this fundamental agreement, we agree what we're arguing about, that system was coming from power. So it's not like suddenly like there's this bad power out there. It's always been there, but right now it's chaos.

	











	“I think people feel powerless,” he said.

	For Aster, Eddington is about what happens when isolated people come up against an another.


	“I think fear is the way that they win, so we should keep telling stories,” said Pascal in response to a question by Chaz Ebert about U.S. toughening border patrol with Canada, “Don't let them win.”


	“I'm looking desperately for hope,” said Aster about the current divided political climate in the U.S., “I said it earlier, and I'll say it again, we need to re-engage with each other.”

	The 2x Golden Globe nominee mourned the death of his alligator co-star Morris, who played the titular character's nemesis in the 1996 golf comedy, on Wednesday with a sweet tribute to the reptilian actor on Instagram.


	“Goodbye, Morris. We are all gonna miss you,” he captioned the post. “You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers – really anyone with arms or legs – but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film. The day you wouldn't come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art. I will never forget at craft service that time when we split the Three Musketeers bar and you let me have the bigger half. But that's who you were.”

	











	Sandler continued, “I know your character's decapitation in the first movie precluded your participation in the sequel, but we all appreciated the fruit basket and the hilarious note. I will miss the sound of your tail sliding through the tall grass, your cold, bumpy skin, but, most of all, I will miss your infectious laugh. Thanks to Mr. Young for taking care of you all these years, and vaya con dios, old friend.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Colorado Gator Farm announced Morris' death this week on Facebook. The alligator, who was estimated to be more than 80 years old, appeared in many films and TV shows from 1975 to 2006, when he retired to the gator farm.

	In Happy Gilmore, Sandler's short-tempered golfer decapitates the gator with a golf club to retrieve his coach Chubbs' (Carl Weathers) severed hand.


	Sandler reprises his role in Happy Gilmore 2, which premieres July 25 on Netflix, also featuring the returns of Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Ben Stiller and Dennis Dugan. Additionally, the cast includes Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley, Nick Swardson, Benny Safdie Scott Mescudi, pro wrestler Jacob Friedman and Travis Kelce.

During “American Idol” finalist Jamal Roberts' hometown visit on May 14, 2025, the top 3 singer was excited to see family, friends, and his students at Crestwood Elementary, where he works as a physical education teacher. 

But likely the most special moment for Roberts, 27, during his whirlwind trip to Meridian, Mississippi, was the chance to finally meet his newborn daughter, born in early May while he was competing on the show in Los Angeles. Although producers briefly shared a pic of baby Gianna at the hospital during the May 5 live episode as Roberts announced her birth, he has now shared his first personal photos and video of the infant on social media. 

On May 14, he shared a one-minute Facebook Live video as he sweetly held his newborn. On May 16, Roberts — now a dad of three daughters — added several photos of the infant, including one of her in a ladybug outfit, and captioned the post, “Hey world, meet my little ladybug 😩, Gianna Grace Roberts. I'm so proud to be her father 😭 #girldadforlife #idol”

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

The second photo that Roberts shared of baby Gianna showed her in a tiny t-shirt featuring images of him performing on the show. The shirt said, “My Dad is the Next American Idol” and “Vote Jamal Roberts — Meridian Proud, Meridian Strong, Meridian United.”

A third pic showed Gianna sleeping, dressed in a lavender and cream outfit with a matching pacifier. 

Roberts has not disclosed the identity of Gianna's mom, and hadn't shared publicly that a baby was on the way. During the live episode on May 5, he said, “It was so personal to me, I did not share it. But I have a healthy, beautiful, baby girl born today.”

Roberts has happily shared the “Idol” spotlight with his two older daughters, Harmoni, 6, and Lyrik, 3, who have attended many of the shows, cheering on their dad in the audience. They also accompanied him during the parade and concert held in Meridian to celebrate his top 3 status. Footage from the hometown visit will be shown on the finale, when he goes up against fellow top 3 finalists Breanna Nix and John Foster. 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

“I love my daughters,” Roberts told Parade in early May. “They are my world, my life. They're the reason I'm here and working so hard to keep smiles on those little faces.”

Fans were thrilled to see Roberts' photos of Gianna, writing notes of congratulations, including someone who wrote on his latest post, “She's just as beautiful and adorable as her big sisters! Congrats Jamal! Now go win Idol!!!!”

Another person commented, “Aww she's so beautiful. Congratulations @officialjamalroberts I'm voting you bro. Hope you win American idol 💪🏾👏🏾💙🍾👶🏽👣🤞🏾”

Roberts, Foster and Nix will compete to win season 23 of “American Idol” during the three-hour season finale airing live coast-to-coast on May 18 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Two recent winners of NBC's “The Voice” will appear on the show's star-studded season 27 finale, airing live on May 20, 2025. 

Season 22 winner Bryce Leatherwood will perform his new single, and season 24 winner Michael Huntley will host a live red carpet special via social media. In addition to the returning winners, multiple past coaches are scheduled to perform, too.

A post shared by Bryce Leatherwood (@bryceleatherwood)

Leatherwood, 25, will perform his new single “God Made” on “The Voice” season 27 finale. 

The country singer won “The Voice” in December 2022 with Blake Shelton as his coach. He signed a record deal with Mercury Nashville in the fall of 2023 and moved to Nashville, according to NBC. His debut, self-titled album was released on May 16, featuring 12 tracks including the previously-released singles  “Neon Does,” “The One My Daddy Found,” “Where the Bar Is,” and “The Finger.”

On May 14, when Leatherwood appeared on “The Today Show with Jenna & Friends,” Shelton sent a surprise message, telling Leatherwood, “Man, it still seems like literally yesterday that I watched you win ‘The Voice,' and I'm still just as proud of you today. Go get em' brother!”

Leatherwood called Shelton — who will also perform on the season 27 finale — “the greatest guy” and told host Jenna Bush Hager, “He really told me, ‘Man, just be yourself and people will fall in love with it,' and it's been true ever since.”

In addition to Shelton, past coaches Kelly Clarkson, Alicia Keys, and Chance The Rapper are also scheduled to perform. 

A post shared by Michael Huntley (@huntleymusic)

Meanwhile, Huntley, 35, won “The Voice” exactly one year after Leatherwood. He will also return to the show to host the TikTok Livestream, reporting from the red carpet and interviewing the season 27 winner and their coach. 

Huntley will go live on “The Voice” TikTok account at the very end of the show, at 11 p.m. Eastern time. 

The singer, who won “The Voice” in December 2023, posted news of his fun gig on social media. When “The Voice” host Carson Daly saw it on Instagram, he commented, “Let's gooooo!!! 🔥🔥”

“The Voice” two-night finale starts on May 19 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, with the top 5 contestants each performing two songs — one uptempo tune and one ballad, according to TV Insider. On the second finale night, May 20, Daly will host a recap at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and then the live two-hour finale kicks off at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

When writer/director Ari Aster stood up for the ovation after the Cannes premiere of his divisive 2020-set Western “Eddington” (July 16, A24), he said, “I feel very privileged to be here. This is a dream come true. Thank you so much for having me. And, I don't know, sorry?”

Indeed, festival attendees have been fiercely divided by his 145-minute portrait of a fictional New Mexico town wracked by COVID, BLM, ACAB, you-name-it-2020-buzz-concept during the darkest season of American lives in recent memory. Joaquin Phoenix (Aster's “Beau Is Afraid”) plays a conservative sheriff who decides to run against his Gavin Newsom-esque, pro-masks-and-testing adversary, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), in the local mayoral election.

Meanwhile, at home, Phoenix's character Joe Cross is in a quarantine bubble with his hysteria-addled wife Louise (Emma Stone) and her far-right conspiracy-obsessed mother Dawn (Deirdre O'Connell), the type for whom hydroxychloroquine was presumably a panacea. But Joe's campaign is all anti-masks, anti-vax, as well as the threat of cult leader Vernon Jefferson Peak (Austin Butler) also posing a challenge to his political and personal life.

The film has sparked massive debates up and down the Croisette since premiering Friday night, with the starriest red carpet thus far and a press conference Saturday afternoon featuring Aster with his actors Phoenix, Pascal (in a sleeveless top), Stone (in a pixie haircut, her hair growing back presumably after shaving it off for Yorgos Lanthimos' upcoming “Bugonia”), and Michael Ward, who plays Phoenix's next-in-command. IndieWire has talked to people who loved or hated the film, with rarely any opinion in between and certainly never without a strong response of some kind from anyone — whether out of boredom or raptures over Aster's in-your-face replay of our worst COVID-times memories.

“Eddington” could be a tough sell for audiences unwilling to be submersed again in summer 2020 and all the chaos and anxieties it erupted. Other pundits I've spoken to defend “Eddington” as a necessary social satire that mocks and derides the panic of that year, while encapsulating it all into one movie as never before. IndieWire critic David Ehrlich wrote in his rave review that “few other filmmakers would have the chutzpah required” to pull this movie off, “and we should probably all be grateful that none of them have tried.”

 










“It's very scary to participate in a movie that speaks to issues like this,” Pascal said at the press conference. “It's far too intimidating a question for me to address. I'm not informed enough. I want people to be safe and protective. I want very much to be on the right side of history.”

“Eddington” indeed takes shots at both sides of the aisle, roasting liberal posturing in the form of social justice youth like Sarah (Amélie Hoeferle), who posts TikToks about James Baldwin and rants about having any position at all on “stolen land.” Phoenix's sheriff character, meanwhile, could only be wrought from the era of Trump, as he rails against mask mandates and is suspicious of the George Floyd-inspired protests shaking up his community. At one point, he swaggers into a grocery store with the pompousness of Western's most classic, gun-on-the-hip cowboys.

Pascal added, “I felt like [Aster] wrote something that was all our worst fears as that lockdown experience was already a fracturing society. This was building toward an untethered sense of reality. There is a point of not going back. I was overwhelmed by that fear, and it's wonderful that it was confirmed by Ari.”

Aster, whose latest feature is a hairpin departure from the genre thrills and chills of films like “Hereditary” and “Midsommar” and is far from the spirit of intrusive-thought-induced weirdness of “Beau Is Afraid,” added, “I wrote this movie in a state of fear and anxiety. I wanted to try and pull back and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore.” “Eddington” is his first feature to premiere at Cannes.

 










“I feel like we're on a dangerous road, and we're living in an experiment that hasn't gone well,” Aster said (via Deadline) about his MAGA- and liberal-skewering Western. “I feel there is no way out of it… Mass liberal democracies always had this fundamental agreement we agree what we're arguing about, that system was coming from power. So it's not like suddenly there's this bad power out there. It's always been there, but right now it's chaos.”

Stone, who connected with Aster amid his 2024 “Beau Is Afraid,” said that her research into the conspiracy theories that turn her character against her husband even ended up modifying her personal social media algorithms (via Variety).

“The only additional thing that scared me a little bit in the algorithm system was looking into some of the things that are in this film that haven't been in my algorithm, unfortunately, added them to my algorithm,” she said. “Because once you start Googling it, you start seeing more and more things. So it's a real rabbit hole, very quickly. Unfortunately, I'm still getting fed some crazy shit.”

“Eddington” is still the most conversation-starting Competition premiere at Cannes, with critics split over its social message and pacing (it's currently at 63 on Metacritic, where you can find reviews all over the map). How A24 will market this movie — only one teaser has been released so far, showing Phoenix doom-scrolling through familiar images of the deepest COVID era — is an intriguing question in the lead-up to its July theatrical release. 

 










Alex Garland's “Civil War,” another post-COVID story of national conflict, did well for A24 last year, grossing more than $127 million by tapping into a fascination factor over a divided United States. Who will “Eddington” appeal to? Either way, it's pitting Cannes audiences against each other — Screen Daily called it a “wan satire,” while Variety deemed it “brazenly provocative” — and will no doubt continue to stoke debate into the summer.

This week on “Screen Talk,” we take you behind the scenes of the goings-on at the 78th annual Cannes Film Festival on the French Riviera, where we recorded on Day Two. Politics dominated the first press conferences with director Thierry Frémaux and the nine-member jury led by Juliette Binoche. They turned up for opening night as well, where Leonardo DiCaprio presented an honorary Palme d'Or to Robert De Niro, and Quentin Tarantino bounded onto the stage to declare the festival open. The opening night film “Leave One Day,” from French rookie Amélie Bonnin, a strictly local jukebox musical with the actors singing French pop hits of the '80s, will not travel.

Later that night, DiCaprio attended the gala dinner with De Niro at the Palm Beach, where Anne enjoyed talking with “Anora” Oscar-winners Sean Baker and Samantha Quan (he produced, wrote, and edited Critics' Week entry “Left-Handed Girl“), the hilarious Michael Covino (“Splitsville”), Amazon's Scott Foundas, Michael Barker and Tom Bernard (Sony Pictures Classics), and Searchlight's Matthew Greenfield, among others.

When we recorded the podcast on Thursday, the first breakout film of the fest, Mascha Schilinski's German-language “Sound of Falling,” led the Screen International jury grid (by Friday, Sergei Loznitsa's “Two Prosecutors” was on top). Ryan and Ane both admire “Sound of Falling” with some caveats. Most buyers admire the bravura filmmaking, but mainly art-house distributors are circling.

Anne attended the IMAX showing of “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” which features several satisfying Tom Cruise death-defying stunts shot in IMAX. (You must see the film in IMAX.) Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie explain the $400-millon movie's craziest stunts here. Ryan suspects the Entity enemy is not only an AI but a metaphor for streaming services, where Cruise is leaning on his legacy as the man who saved Hollywood (and will keep saving it) with “Top Gun: Maverick.” Anne thinks this one, billed as the finale, will do better than the last, which was dinged by “Barbenheimer.” That doesn't mean it will make its money back: while the film's ending leaves a sequel open, the box office will tell that tale.

 










We also dig into big news out of Cannes that Neon has hired Cinetic Media executive Ryan Werner as its next global president. (His lieutenant Courtney Ott will now run Cinetic Media marketing.)

And we share our thoughts on a few titles premiering in the Competition and other sections. Ryan previews “Sirat,” “Left-Handed Girl,” and “The Little Sister,” while Anne raves about Ugo Bienvenu's “Arco,” a charming French animated film with an eco message.

Rich, complex films that can be crassly oversimplified because of a sex scene between a human and a machine have had a great run at Cannes in recent years. Now, Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke's directorial debut “A Useful Ghost” is ready to join the canon of one of the nichest arthouse subgenres of the 2020s. 

Much like “Titane” before it, the early discourse around “A Useful Ghost” might revolve around an intimate love scene between a Thai man and a Shop-Vac that's possessed by the ghost of his late wife. (I'll spare everyone the details, but I imagine the logistics will be easy for many of you to visualize.) But like Julia Ducournau, Boonbunchachoke has made a darkly hilarious film that deserves to be remembered for much more than its shock value.

 








Related Stories ‘Lucky Lu' First Look: Lloyd Lee Choi's Directorial Debut Confronts the Fallacy of the American Dream ‘I Only Rest in the Storm' Review: An Unapologetically Uncomfortable Voyage into the Grimy Underbelly of NGOs 

“A Useful Ghost” begins with a real contender for the best opening line of this year's festival: “Mere particles of dust in the air changed my ladyboy life forever.” It's a fittingly funny launch to a film that revolves around the physical and spiritual dangers of dust particles. March (Witsarut Himmarat) runs a successful vacuum cleaner factory in Thailand. It's a largely uneventful life, save for the occasional encounters with ghosts that haunt his place of business. But everything changes when his beautiful, loving wife Nat (Davika Hoorne) dies after being poisoned by dust in his factory. 

The backbone of March's young family and an incredible mother to their son Dot, Nat is gone but not forgotten. And she's not even gone for that long. She soon returns as a ghost and assumes the body of one of March's vacuums. The husband and wife resume their emotional and carnal relationship, but it's clear she came back for a very specific reason: to clean the factory and prevent her child from being exposed to the particles that killed her. But her arrival poses a major emotional roadblock to March's traditional family, who are jaded from a bad experience when a dead employee returned as a vacuum and threw a metaphorical wrench into their business. Plus, they've barely been able to wrap their minds around the fact that his older brother is gay. Welcoming a human-vacuum relationship into the family is a tougher proposition. 

“A Useful Ghost” masterfully blends deadpan lines like “I'm less worried about the fever than the fact that he made out with a vacuum cleaner” with a sincere story about the invisible workers we choose to ignore and love that doesn't waver in the face of family disapproval. The hardest challenge for films with such unique premises that have genuine heart behind them is often creating an internal set of rules that's plausible enough to generate immediate buy-in from audiences. Transcending novelty is only possible when you convince us to stop saying “wow, that's so weird” and begin genuinely investing in the characters. 

 










Boonbunchachoke does an immaculate job of threading that needle by quickly establishing the way appliances who can recall their past lives are treated in this world. Being reincarnated as a vacuum cleaner is a rare, but not shocking occurrence in this family's life. And given that they've already faced one major business setback caused by a sentient vacuum, any feelings of curiosity that you or I might experience in such a situation are immediately replaced with annoyance at the inconvenience. It's their apathy towards the fantastical situation that allows their humanity to take center stage.

The magical realism is also cleverly woven into the ways of thinking that dominate traditional Eastern culture. The love for March that brings a reincarnated Nan back to the factory and the genuine happiness (not to mention sexual satisfaction) that she still brings him are an afterthought to a family that is primarily focused on selfless duty and sacrifice in the pursuit of maintaining the family image. That bittersweet tension between love and tradition provides the film's emotional core as well as its very title, as Nan tries to endear herself to her former in-laws and differentiate herself from other ghosts by providing a sense of utility. As the family hesitates to accept her even with her mission to make the factory safer, the sincerity of everyone's principles faces a genuine test. 

 










Due to both its status as one of the highest profile Thai films to debut at Cannes in years and its unconventional reincarnation story, “A Useful Ghost” is bound to elicit some comparisons to the work of Apichatpong Weerasethakul. It's far from a perfect analogy, as “A Useful Ghost” moves at a pace that's damn near brisk when compared to Weerasethakul's meditative works. But hopefully Boonbunchachoke and the film community at large can look past the specifics and appreciate the invocation for what it really means: a phenomenal new filmmaker has arrived from Thailand, and international festivalgoers should expect to enjoy his works for years to come. 

“A Useful Ghost” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","'Mirrors No 3.' Review: Christian Petzold and Paula Beer in a Minor Key","https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mirrors-no-3-review-christian-petzold-1235121824/","Sat, 17 May 2025 11:15:00 GMT","

Christian Petzold‘s gossamer latest film, “Mirrors No. 3,” is as compact as a novella, as ephemeral in its emotion, as delicate in register as one of the Chopin or Ravel pieces that float through it. A mystery woman, standing on a bridge, lost in thought. An amnesiac looking for respite. A car flipped upside down, its driver's brains spilled onto the road while its passenger stares on, unharmed. Later, she eats apples in a bed that belongs to another woman, in clothes that belong to that woman's daughter, trying on another life almost as a lark. 

 










German filmmaker Petzold comes to Cannes for the first time with a minor-key new drama, which burrows into the psyche despite its slim running time and almost perverse refusal to explain itself or the shapes its narrative takes. The title comes from a piece written by Ravel — yes, that one you probably know from the trailer for “Call Me By Your Name,” but the affiliations with the idylls of summer love and coming-of-age end right there. Writing and directing a script that evolved during the making of his last feature, “Afire,” Petzold has never been less forthcoming, the images from cinematographer Hans Fromm never overstating themselves. Nor does Petzold's regular collaborator Paula Beer, who shifts with silvery, slippery ease between states of bemusement and shock. “Mirrors” is another gorgeous showcase for what makes her alchemy with Petzold succeed so well.

She plays Laura, a pianist in an unfulfilling relationship whose boyfriend, almost as soon as the movie starts, gets them into a rather suddenly (and hardly dramatically) staged car accident, he at the wheel and now dead. Nearby, a middle-aged woman, Betty (Barbara Auer), was painting a white-picket fence, an almost cliche image of the structures we surround ourselves with to feel safe and comforted against the changing weathers of potential emotional ruin. Did her presence (or appearance?) cause the accident? Laura eventually stumbles from the wreck and onto the steps of Betty's home, and into her largesse. As the pieces of Betty's own past come into place, we can see where this story is headed as Laura becomes a surrogate daughter for Betty while establishing a new, mother-daughter-like routine.

Petzold has made grander cinematic statements before, from the amnesiac Hitchcock homage “Phoenix” (starring his former muse Nina Hoss as a Holocaust survivor whose facial disfigurement allows her to impersonate someone else entirely to win back her estranged husband) to “Transit,” which starred Franz Rogowski and told a World War II story in Berlin but with anachronistically modern set design. Petzold's last film, “Afire,” felt like one of those ‘80s arthouse one-offs someone like Éric Rohmer would make, with characters chatting over a lengthy luncheon about their hopes, fears, and problems, analyzing them into the unforgivable marrow of becoming sick of themselves. 

 










“Mirrors No. 3” has a touch of Rohmer in terms of its deceptive effervescence. Running at less than 90 minutes — making it an immediate contender against the arguments that there would ever be any excess here, especially in a movie moment where two-and-a-half hours has become the standard running time — Petzold's latest film isn't especially giving of emotion. Nor is its lead, played by “Transit,” “Undine,” and “Afire” actress Beer, especially scrutable. But Beer's performance is another shimmering wonder, a stark contrast to the manic-pixie-dream-girl adjacent she played in “Afire.”

In this film, Beer portrays her character as a blank waiting to be filled. Whatever is going on with her and boyfriend Jakob in the first scenes, she wants nothing to do with the work trip he is dragging her on against her will. The movie even begins with her staring out a flowing river — if you thought we were done with Petzold's fascination with the elements after “Undine” and “Afire,” languid shots of moving water will signal otherwise — in a daze, as if she doesn't know where she is or where she's going. She reacts to the news of his death, and the fallout of it, with a shrug. 

When Paula starts dressing Laura in her daughter's clothes — including a red Babybel T-shirt that almost immediately infantilizes Laura — we know we are in for some sort of Bergmanesque exchange between women, the idealizing of a complete stranger who might resemble your own dead daughter, so much so that she passes for her. The women play off each other, or with each other at other times, contrapuntally like music, which seems to have inspired the psychological structure of “Mirrors No. 3,” more about whiffs of impressions of ideas than concrete symbols.

 










Laura also forms a close relationship with Paula's son (Enno Trebs), whose blond mullet and stoic face strikingly resemble those of her now-dead boyfriend Jakob. Petzold loves doubles, and particularly in a dizzied state, as a way to emphasize how the people we idealize in love may only be that ideal thing once they're realized in the form of someone else. Someone else not quite them, not quite the man you've been sharing a bed with for years, but a close enough resemblance to conjure that old-time feeling.

“Mirrors No. 3” often feels as concussed as its main heroine potentially is, with narrative elisions that defy easy solving or understanding. Connections, here, are like static electricity. Laura's sudden, seemingly preternatural ability to make Koeningsburg Dumplings for her host's husband and son comes from nowhere. This is a woman born from an accident, after all, and into the chance to live another life.

“Mirrors No. 3” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. Metrograph Pictures has North American distribution rights.

On April 15, 2025, it was announced that “Put Your Soul in Your Hand and Walk” — a series of filmed video conversations between Iranian documentarian Sepideh Farsi and 25-year-old Palestinian photojournalist, Fatma Hassona — would play in the ACID strand of the Cannes Film Festival. On April 16, as they slept in their home in Gaza City, Fatma, Walaa, Alaa, Yazan, Mohammed, and Muhannad Hassona were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Fatma's parents were wounded and father Raed died later from his injuries.

Final responsibility for the murder of a bright and gifted young woman who dreamed of visiting the world lies with the Israeli Defence Force. However, given widespread awareness of how Palestinians are targeted for raising the profile of the daily suffering induced by the occupation (see also the abduction of “No Other Land” co-director Hamdan Ballal after its Oscar win) a question hangs over this documentary about how deeply Farsi weighed her duty of care to her collaborator. Did Fatma decide that speaking in this format was worth the deadly cost that it ultimately exacted?

If she did, this matter is not touched in the course of the conversations that make up the soul and the substance of this documentary. Instead, the brutal news of seven deaths (and we have met three of Fatma's family members by this point) is starkly presented in a closing title card that follows a video call on April 15 subtitled, “The Final Conversation.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






Here Sepideh breaks the news to Fatma about Cannes. Fatma is a radiant presence who has been fighting back depression over the documentary's timespan of April 2024-April 2025. It's been a year in which food is becoming harder and harder to source and the sound of bombs and Apache helicopters are a daily soundtrack. A light goes on inside Fatma as Sepideh suggests that she comes to Cannes and the dramatic irony feels tasteless and cruel. We know that she will only come to Cannes as a still image behind the dates 1999-2025. 

In this grave context, it's hard not to weigh “Put Your Soul in Your Hand and Walk” against the value of seven lives, an equation that can only be answered to the film's detriment. Complicating this assessment, however, is the fact that Fatma had already achieved global recognition for her photography. Her images locate splashes of vivid color and human faces that pop against the ruined buildings behind them. 

 










Farsi folds these into the documentary for its most striking and artistic sequences as we see new perspectives through Fatma's eyes. More slapdash are the newsreel clips designed to situate what Fatma is going through in Al Tuffah within a broader global narrative about Israel's genocidal war on Gaza. A variety of sources from across the political spectrum are included whose reports unfold from clashing sets of values. This is not highlighted or analysed by the film, it simply muffles an intention to create a clear frame of reference.

To backtrack: Sepideh Farsi was compelled by the images coming out of Gaza to travel there. After being denied entrance through the Rafah Crossing through Cairo, she began filming refugees coming the other way. A man named Ahmed from the same neighborhood as Fatma introduced them and their personal connection proved stronger than the sketchy wifi that causes their video conversations to cut in and out. 

The rapport between the women is undeniable, even if Sepideh's attempt to force parallels between her own personal history in Iran and the unfolding situation in Palestine does not fully cohere. Having left Iran at the age of 18, she will not return for fear of arrest, however over the course of their conversations she calls in from France, Morocco, and Italy as a misty-eyed Fatma confesses that she has never left Gaza and that to do so is her dream. She is especially energized when Sepideh calls from Rome as The Vatican is on her bucket list.

 










To her credit, Sepideh is aware enough to own the surreal gulf between what to her is a normal life and what has become Fatma's normal life. “We're used to it but we're not used to it,” said Fatma, “Because we can't get used to killing or bombing or this suffering.” At the outset of their conversations, Fatma beams with a wide, white smile even as she narrates the death and destruction she has witnessed. She is proud to be a Palestinian in Gaza. “The strongest thing is that we have nothing to lose.”

Conversations touch on the molecular details of living in a destroyed place under daily bombardment. Sometimes Fatma goes to the balcony to show her pen pal the view, and her closeness to this devastation rebirths its horror anew. She has a log on WhatsApp of family deaths, each accompanied by a photo and a description of the circumstances. There are many photos of children. They found her uncle's wife's head in the street. As she said, Fatma is both used to and not used to her loved ones being picked off. When her artist friend is martyred, she still has tears to cry.

This is a slight, ambling documentary that now has a permanent shadow over it. Its leading lady deserved a stronger film and a longer life.

Under the circumstances IndieWire is not awarding a grade. Instead, here is a taste of Fatma Hassona's photography.
 










“Put Your Soul in Your Hand and Walk” premiered in the ACID section parallel to the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

“Babygirl” star Harris Dickinson is a little too young, a little too handsome, and a little too hot right now for critics to pretend as if his directorial debut exists in a vacuum, and yet the raw and raggedy “Urchin” — which would command our attention regardless of who made it — is only a few seconds old before it's locked into the thrall of a different actor altogether. 

Best known for playing the young Tom Riddle in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,” Frank Dillane awakens into this movie with the ache and neediness of an open wound. His character's name is Mike, he's been living on the streets of London for the last five years, and he doesn't take kindly to the street preacher whose shouting (“Have you heard about Jesus!?”) stirs him out of his latest drug stupor. It's bad enough that she's loud, but it's even worse that she's trying to save people — in her own way, at least.

Such generosity of spirit proves to be something of a trigger for a tousle-haired lost boy like Mike, who resents anyone for daring to offer him the help he doesn't know how to accept. He's pleasant enough to some of the people he recognizes from various shelters and the like, but when a good samaritan offers to buy Mike some food, our man returns the favor by violently mugging the man for his kindness. 

And so it's off to another stint in prison, the next part in a cycle that Mike seems ambivalent to escape. The film around him displays similarly little interest in forcing the matter, even after Mike is released from jail — now sober for seven months — and lands a job as a cook at a low-rent hotel on the outskirts of town. He makes friends with two of his co-workers, sings Atomic Kitten's “Whole Again” at karaoke, and even attends a supervised reconciliation meeting with the man he beat up. 

But Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive (comparisons to “Naked” practically make themselves, and while “Urchin” lacks the sadism of Mike Leigh's Thatcherite-era scream, it's a credit to Dillane's remarkable performance that the two movies seem capable of holding a conversation with each other).

 










Of course, “Urchin” is all the more rewarding for its messy approach to Mike's disarray, which rejects a clear diagnosis in favor of honoring a character who feels like he can't even afford to understand himself. Dickinson's film — shaped by people he knew growing up, and further informed by his work with a variety of social outreach charities — reflects a mature, and frequently harrowing, recognition of how people can be held captive by the centrifugal force of their own behavioral patterns. 

In this case, those patterns would appear to stretch back to childhood, as Dillane plays Mike as an overgrown kid — one entombed by the insouciant aloofness of someone who's never quite understood the connection between actions and their consequences. Wearing the same blank expression on his face when he gets out of jail as he does when he's first arrested, Mike always exists in the moment at hand, and in most situations remains unblinkingly honest about his circumstances (which would be more reassuring if he didn't fantasize about his delusional future with the same nanchalance as he reflects on his troubled past). 

If Mike is capable of sweetness or bursts of violence, that's only because he's equally capable of anything at all times, and considers all of his options to be more or less the same. When a customer at the restaurant complains about an undercooked burger, there's no telling if Mike will implode or explode; solely motivated by emotional avoidance (as we see in the unforgettably brief scene where he's reconciled with his assault victim), Mike makes no distinction between showing up to work or snorting ketamine on the beach, and lashes out at anyone who dares to suggest one choice might be better than the other. 

 










That steadiness is central to Dillane's magnetic performance, which always tacks closer to neediness than sociopathy, and never steers towards cheap sympathy or demonstrative rage. Mike is a troubled soul, but he's not Anton Chigurh (even though he's often just as stressful to observe); if he reliably makes the most self-destructive choice available to him, it's only so frightening to watch because he's so close to making a better one. 

Alas, the shape of his life doesn't bend toward salvation, just as Dickinson's film doesn't guide him towards any sort of narrative salvation. On the contrary, Josée Deshaies' long lens cinematography flattens Mike into his environment, effectively drilling the overt movieness out of the scenes where he exists in public. That documentary-like sense of discovery is contrasted against a handful of hyper-stylized setpieces (including a dance sequence and several different trips into the recesses of Mike's consciousness), as Dickinson eschews the film's early faux-realism in favor of a more complex array of modes and feelings — a decision that makes “Urchin” as hard to pin down as its protagonist, and also allows Dickinson to cast himself in a small but pivotal role without disturbing some docudrama illusion of truth. 

 










Where “Naked” tethered itself to the mania of a mad philosopher, Davdi Thewlis' performance wavering somewhere between Jesus and the Devil, “Urchin” is bound to an unbreakable innocence that persists long after Mike has disabused us of our sympathy; he's the victim of a cruel world, but also an unfeeling agent of its callousness. Dickinson clearly hopes this story will make it that much harder for people to dehumanize the homeless population, but the power of his film — and the promise of his intelligence as a filmmaker — is that it recognizes how a portrait of mottled ambivalence might better accomplish that goal than a million cheap sops of empathy. 

Mike is plagued by the feeling that no one will let him in; that happiness is glowing from the other side of a window labeled “this is not for you.” That may not be enough to justify his persecution complex, but Dickinson's terrific debut insists that the view from our side of the screen is just as clear as the one from Mike's. 

“Urchin” premiered at the 2025 Cannes film festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

No one listens to Arthur Russell just once. (Well, almost no one.) If you have heard his music, it is likely that you have internalized his singular voice and unique melodic sensibility, folded them into some innermost corner of your being. He has this effect on people, despite the fact—or maybe because of it—that the vast majority of his fans never heard a lick of his music while he was still alive. Yet this pair of decades-old live recordings reveals Charles Arthur Russell, Jr., gone now 33 years, as you have rarely, if ever, heard him before: just cello, the electrical heat of the microphone, the buzz and sway of a few pedals, a cocoon of empty space around him—and that voice, unmistakable, ethereal yet embodied, both distant and impossibly close, as familiar as the voice in your head.

These reissues come from two tapes recorded at Phill Niblock's Experimental Intermedia Foundation, a homey loft space in lower Manhattan where Russell frequently performed. He recorded the first on June 25, 1984, at a performance billed as Sketches for World of Echo (admission: $2.50), and the second 18 months later, on December 20, 1985. Steve Knutson's Audika label—which in collaboration with Russell's partner, Tom Lee, has given the world far more posthumous work from the artist than he ever released in his lifetime—first put out Sketches for World of Echo digitally and on cassette in 2020; the second live set, now titled Open Vocal Phrases Where Songs Come In and Out, remained unheard until now. While available separately on Bandcamp and streaming platforms, both recordings have been paired on a 2xCD release, which is appropriate: They feel like segments of a single continuum, snapshots of a long, unbroken moment.

These are not unplugged sessions, exactly; Russell was an inveterate tinkerer, and in both sets he fleshes out his cello and voice with a modest battery of effects pedals—stereo delay, reverb, distortion—and a rudimentary tone generator. Yet rather than obscure his playing and singing, those add-ons only seem to heighten the sensation that we are sitting alone in the room with him. There is an uncommon purity to these recordings that suits the guilelessness of his music; it is rare to feel like you have been granted such a direct line to an artist's mind at the moment of creation. He would later stitch segments from both nights into the 1986 album World of Echo, combining them with material recorded at Battery Sound studios, and some elements are echoed elsewhere in his catalog in radically different forms—the avant-disco masterpiece “Let's Go Swimming,” famously mixed by Walter Gibbons; the Nicky Siano-produced disco anthem “Tiger Stripes,” which Russell recorded under his Killer Whale alias—but by and large, these recordings are less collections of discrete songs than extended fantasias, improvisational meditations in which lyrical hints and brief melodic figures dissolve in the ceaseless onward flow.

Despite the stripped-down setup, the two sets cover a lot of ground. Sketches for World of Echo begins with a feint: two and a half minutes of dissonant and seemingly formless cello burnished with bracing feedback. Russell sounds like he's looking for something, stumbling in the dark. But then a squelchy, laser-zapping synth drone fires up, and the mood turns beatific as he launches into an extended instrumental raga. For more than 10 minutes, he traces graceful curlicues against the pedal tone—tender, whimsical, hypnotic. The album concludes with an equally liquid improvisation, “Sunlit Water,” which shimmers and swirls, blissfully directionless, for more than 10 idyllic minutes.

In between those dreamlike bookends, Sketches often feels like a treasure hunt. Look, here's “Let's Go Swimming,” the very same recording used on World of Echo, but drawn out into a six-minute trance, rather than the tantalizing wisp of the canonical version. And here's “Keeping Up,” a bittersweet highlight of 1994's posthumous Another Thought. Where that recording struts gaily, propelled by programmed drums and proudly decked out in Jennifer Warnes' gorgeous close-harmonized vocals, this one feels more relaxed, more innocent. Elsewhere, the traces are foggier—bits of World of Echo's “I Take This Time” and Another Thought's “Losing My Taste for the Nightlife” turn up, fleetingly, but folded into a five-song sequence in which Russell mostly seems to be channeling extemporaneous thoughts over shape-shifting melodies. It's curious: If “Let's Go Swimming” and “Keeping Up” invite us to think of the ways in which songs are like people, growing and changing over time, at other points it's almost as if Russell wants to show us that songs don't exist as standalone entities—they're all just part of a single stream of sound.

That feels especially true of Open Vocal Phrases Where Songs Come In and Out. The opening “That's the Very Reason,” three minutes long, is a perfect pop song, as pristine as anything in Russell's catalog. (Curiously, it shares seemingly nothing with “Very Reason,” a song from his archives that was included on the posthumous Picture of Bunny Rabbit, though you may grasp a fuzzy resemblance between the two if you squint.) But little else from this performance feels quite as clear cut. “Tower of Meaning/Rabbit's Ear/Home Away From Home” meanders for nearly 20 minutes of see-sawing cello patterns and searching vocal harmonies; he'd later cut the recording down to the 4:38 enshrined on World of Echo. (“There's a zillion edits throughout,” Knutson has said of that album, “because he's just taking these little pieces—a minute here, 10 seconds there—to weave all these ideas together in a way that was only in his head, that only he could hear.”) “Happy Ending,” “All-Boy All-Girl,” “Tiger Stripes,” and “You Can't Hold Me Down” all blur together in an extended passage of skeletal bowing and circuitous vocal melodies—the songs elusive, but the flow transfixing.

Open Vocal Phrases' most audacious playing comes toward the end, with the 11-minute “Hiding Your Present From You/School Bell.” Russell kicks it off with an uncharacteristic blast of harmonica, then lays into abrasive, fuzzed-out cello that sounds like his version of heavy metal. Plucking and bowing tangle up in delay; disconnected lyrics float over the top. Halfway through, a chugging electronic rhythm sets in, an unstable succession of siren bursts and white-noise clicks. Toward the end, he repeats a whispered, “School bell,” picking up the refrain from another classic Indian Ocean / Walter Gibbons 12"". It sounds like a playground chant; it sounds like caveman techno. For a moment, we witness Russell traveling as far out as he ever got.

It is reasonable to wonder how much is left to learn about Russell and his music, after two biographies, a documentary film, and a copious run of posthumous releases. But these two recordings suggest that however much you thought you knew about him, there is always more to discover. They deepen our understanding of his creative process by injecting us directly into the slipstream of his playing and his thought.

Despite their extreme beauty, these are not particularly orderly recordings, and they are not always easy to listen to. They can be abrasive, prickly, hard to follow; they toss up obstacles, outrun your attention, lag behind when you want to move forward. Following along can sometimes feel like trying to keep up with a strong-willed child (“Keeping Up,” indeed). The usual modes of pleasure do not always pertain—until his voice hits a certain pitch, and his cello harmonizes just so, and the effect is like sunlight emerging from behind a cloud.

What might be most striking about these performances is that despite the obviously broad appeal that his music has had for so many, it is an intensely private affair. What I find so uncanny about the recordings is the way they capture the sound of Arthur Russell as I hear him in my mind, stripped of anything extraneous; at their best, they epitomize the essential spirit of his music. At the tail end of Sketches for World of Echo, nearly buried beneath what might be the amplified thump of his bow, a muted burst of applause is very faintly audible—picked up, perhaps, by the pickups on his cello. The first time I registered it, I was startled, snapped out of my reverie; I had forgotten that there were other people in the room with him as he played. You wonder if the sound felt equally far away to him.

	This week, the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial began. The government's star witness is Cassie, Combs' ex, whom he settled a November 2023 sexual assault lawsuit to the tune of $20 million. Her lawsuit alleged sexual assault, physical abuse, and coercion to participate in prolonged sex acts deemed “freak offs.” Throughout her testimony, Cassie went into graphic detail on a relationship she said became more based on “shame” and “guilt” than genuine love. She said that he sexually assaulted her in 2018 and that she participated in so many “freak offs” that she couldn't estimate a precise number, and one session lasted four days.


	On social media, where content creators have been dissecting the case, some commenters have been distressingly sympathetic to Diddy's defense.


	Boosie spoke for many naysayers when he posted on X, “I don't see no crimes committed in this case,” ignoring Cassie's abuse, rape, and assault accusations to make a sweeping claim, as if she's not merely one witness detailing one portion of the government's case. Federal prosecutors have stated that they already have documentation of Combs trafficking sex workers across state lines for prostitution (and he allegedly did so with an infrastructure of employees who facilitated his activities).  

	











	Cassie also alleged that Combs was physically violent toward her “too frequently” (sex worker Daniel Phillip revealed two previously unpublicized instances of Combs hitting her). She said she could only get through the “painful” sessions with drugs that numbed her. After filming the acts at his behest, Combs allegedly blackmailed her with the threat of releasing videos when she tried to leave him. As a signee to Combs' Bad Boy Records, Cassie's music career was in his hands.

	After leaving Combs, Cassie said she became suicidal during rehab and therapy, where she wrote down everything she had been through with him in book format. “I was spinning out,” she told prosecutors. “I didn't want to be alive anymore at that point.” Yet, she was strong enough to go forward with the lawsuit that prompted other allegations, and once and for all, crumbling the “Brother Love” facade Diddy had shrouded himself in. She was vulnerable enough to be open about her mistreatment on the stand. But the “reward” for her bravery has been having onlookers, none of whom were in the rooms with them, picking apart her testimony with an implicit sense of suspicion.

	They've also sensationalized her trauma. A case with such grisly allegations deserves to be addressed with an empathetic tone that centers the alleged survivor's pain. But social media is full of media personalities and onlookers discussing the Combs trial with the timbre of a gossip blogger recounting a Real Housewives episode. Headlines have focused on how urine and semen played into their sexual encounters, immediately reducing her account to the most salacious bits. Independent journalist Loren Lorosa gave a hasty recap of Cassie's cross-examination from right outside the courtroom, noting, “Unfortunately, I don't think Puff is gonna walk away scot-free,” during a three-minute video where she was speaking off the cuff about sensitive issues that deserve measured recounting. YouTuber Tisa Tells, who was in Max's The Fall Of Diddy documentary, boasted about having “exclusive tea” in one of her trial recaps. Social media is rife with fresh baby oil and “Diddy party” jokes, as if we're all talking about a sketch comedy show instead of a woman recounting trauma that she almost didn't make it back from. 


	The rampant skepticism of Cassie and the ridicule of her pain reflect a societal conditioning that denies Black women genuine victimhood. Misogynoir is a systemic issue worldwide. But the way it's manifesting in the hip-hop community, fueled by an online culture increasingly influenced by the misogynistic “manosphere,” is more suffocating than ever. More than excitement over new music or artists, the recent rap-related headlines have been dominated by stories of women being diminished. We've seen several other examples just this week.

	Singer/actress Halle Bailey recently filed a restraining order against streamer/rapper DDG, whom she accused of repeated physical and verbal abuse. In her complaint, Bailey stated that DDG's false livestream claims have “caused me to feel afraid and victimized. His fans then threaten me. I am often scared for my life and Halo's safety.” In response, several of DDG's streamer peers are publicly siding with him. DDG found out about the restraining order live on media personality Adin Ross' stream. Without seeing any of the details, Ross knee-jerkingly told Halle, “Stop these fake allegations, this is a father…this is a good human being.” Streamer Plaqueboymax opined that he wants to see “concrete evidence” of DDG's guilt before stepping away from him. DDG has also received public support from streamers DJ Ghost, Deshae Frost, and N3on. Despite Halle giving the court several instances of violence and providing post-assault photos, her victimhood is being denied by many. His supporters have started a #ProtectDDG movement online. 

	











	The DDG solidarity exemplifies the rampant misogyny present on much of the internet. “Manosphere” figures such as Andrew Tate have espoused a rigid view of masculinity that denies women their volition and humanity on platforms like DJ Akademiks' stream, where the two commiserated on single mothers being unworthy of dating. Adin Ross, one of the people who spoke in support of DDG, has had Tate on his stream numerous times. Last October, he was getting a haircut on stream while Nick Fuentes and Tate agreed that “women can't lead because women aren't soldiers.” Adin Ross recently caught the ire of many by calling Doechii a “bitch” and an “unintelligent piece of shit” after a Met Gala clip of her cursing at assistants went viral. He's said that he lost two sponsorships because of the comments, where the vitriolic tone of his extended diatribe verged on racism. The sad reality is that as Doechii continues to elevate as an artist, the misogyny toward her will rise, too.  


	The deeper societal issue lies with the young people consuming this content. The Netflix show Adolescence depicted a young boy's “Manosphere” radicalization which resulted in him killing a young girl who had rejected him and called him an incel. In a report about the show, Allysa Czerwinsky, a male-supremacism and online extremism researcher told Rolling Stone that the show reflects real-world dynamics with “pervasive narratives of victimhood, of limited agency, of limited self-worth that are festering into this emotional turmoil,” and manosphere content “offer them a really easy solution” to decide, “‘women are responsible for this.'”


	The internet at one point served as a vehicle for survivors via #MeToo and other movements. Since Alyssa Milano encouraged other women who'd experienced assault to reply “me too” on X (then Twitter), a wave of people have come forward about harassment and assault they'd previously suffered in silence. The #MeToo movement, in particular, has laid bare the culture of coercion and abuse that permeates every institution and created space for women to feel supported by online communities. But in recent times, it feels like there has been pushback led by a swathe of men prone to challenge women coming forward. The streamer Sneako, who's frequently streamed with Ross, has surmised that “a woman's worth is what she looks like and a man's worth is your masculinity, is your respect.” Myron Gaines of the popular “manosphere” podcast Fresh N Fit, wrote that “Women are benefiting unfairly at nearly every man's expense” in his book Why Women Deserve Less. 

	











	Like with Cassie and Hallie, Megan Thee Stallion has been a victim of the internet's propensity to ridicule women. The widespread doubt that Megan's faced since her shooting seems rooted in the same misogynoir that Diddy and DDG defenders are using. Some people deny that she was even shot. And now, people are speculating that Roc Nation orchestrated Tory's prison stabbing because they knew Kelsey Harris' bodyguard, Bradley James, was going to come forward and accuse her of the August 2020 shooting. Megan's In Her Words documentary detailed that after being shot, she's experienced ensuing waves of trauma induced by the barrage of harassment and conspiracy theories sent her way (some revealed to have been devised by Tory himself). Logic says that the blame for James not taking the stand during Tory's trial rests with him or the Toronto artist's defense team. But instead, the circumstance has spurred even more harassment toward Megan, picking at a figurative wound that may never get the chance to heal. 


	Writer Joan Morgan's book, When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost identified the quandary women have long faced by enjoying hip-hop while being primary targets of their favorite artists' ire. “How did we go from fly-girls to bitches and hos in our brothers eyes?,” she asks in the 1999 book. She also wrote, “We have come to a point in our history, however, when black- on-black love —A love that survived slavery, lynching, segregation, poverty and racism —is in serious danger.”

	That fracture is apparent in the community's divisiveness surrounding high-profile assault accusations. Black women see the avidity with which men deny Cassie, Megan, and now Hallie their victimhood, and are justified in pondering how it dovetails with their disproportionate domestic violence rates. The Institute of Women's Policy Research reported that more than 40% of Black women have experienced intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence, and/or intimate partner stalking, higher than the national average of 31%. In February 2024, the Lancet medical journal reported that Black women are six times more likely to be killed than white women (51.3% of Black female homicides are related to intimate partner violence). 


	Over the past several years, hip-hop's supposed decline has been a prevailing storyline. Though plenty of indie acts are releasing exciting work, the bulk of broader rap discourse has centered on a lack of exciting music in the major label orbit and a dearth of Billboard success for hip-hop artists. In that perceived breach of great music, violence against women has become a dishearteningly common topic. And if that trend continues, alongside more exposés of abuse from once-beloved artists and executives, and more misogynist fan-flaming from media personalities, it's worth wondering how many women will consider leaving hip-hop behind altogether.

	Commander Emily Shilling served nearly 20 years in the U.S. Navy as a combat aviator with over 60 missions. Fighter pilots are very hard for the military to find, nonetheless. Shilling will be removed from service by Donald Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. So will many others, like former Navy SEAL Kristin Beck, who served 20 years in Naval Special Warfare, including with SEAL Team Six. She earned the Bronze Star with Combat “V,” the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Purple Heart. 


	Shilling and Beck are heroes the military will never get back, and the absence of service members like them will make America less ready, endanger troops, and hurt recruiting efforts.


	Yet, these folks aren't good enough to serve for Trump, who just banned transgender service members for the second time. His first effort was reversed by Joe Biden; this time, the Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect as the matter winds its way through the courts. A Trump ally, Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.) has introduced legislation to codify Trump's executive order and ensure no Democratic president can undo the damage he has caused.

	Hegseth's service could never compare to that of Shilling or Beck, even though Hegseth likes to pretend to be a Navy SEAL as he sycophantically follows them around the country during special events. Trump never served a day in his life. That is why it is odd to me and to many others that they are so adamant about preventing transgender troops — and likely, before his term ends, gay Americans — from serving in the armed forces. 


	Trump's disdain and disrespect for veterans will go down in history as reprehensible, as will Moore's, who voted against the bipartisan PACT Act, which expanded health care and benefits to millions of veterans, and numerous other bipartisan veterans' legislation. 


	Transgender Americans have served with honor — from the decks of aircraft carriers to combat zones around the globe. They fly missions, lead teams, and complete the same rigorous training as everyone else in the military.

	Now, Trump and Hegseth are reportedly planning to direct military commanders to identify troops who are transgender or have gender dysphoria, so they can undergo medical checks and then be purged. 

	











	This policy is an ethical failure and will be a logistical one, too. Removing thousands of trained service members during a recruiting crisis makes us weaker, not stronger. Forcing out skilled troops, pilots, linguists, mechanics, medics, because they sought medically necessary care or live authentically doesn't protect national security. It undermines it.


	That is not about readiness. That is about hate. If Trump cared about military readiness, he would invest in veterans' programs and bolster rewards for service — not dismantle the Department of Veterans Affairs, as Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency have done.


	Many trans service members will now have to closet themselves in fear. They will be forced to self identify promptly. If they haven't figured that out yet, then the rest of their service will be a minefield. Any military leader will tell you that fear is no way to lead, and it reduces readiness and hurts the fighting force. If only Trump, Musk, or Hegseth actually had the military knowledge, or cared about command leadership. 


	If you're wondering what the long-term strategy is, it's simple: drive transgender Americans out of public life, one agency at a time — and purge military leaders so they can't stop it. It starts at the military, it always does with authoritarians. Then health care, education, civil service. The goal is to make trans people invisible. But it will not stop there. Anyone who is different will be erased from the military, just as Hegseth and Trump are erasing the contributions of women, minorities, people of color, and gay Americans from official military history — an area where the Supreme Court and federal law cannot easily intervene.

	Trump's policies are dangerous, and anyone who supports his whitewashing of our military is complicit. These changes will shrink the number of qualified service members and turn the U.S. military into a place built by and for white men alone, weakening our forces, undermining readiness, and leaving us at a disadvantage. That is exactly the kind of military despots, dictators, and religious extremists  would love to see.


	We cannot wait for the next election to fix this. We need voices inside and outside the military to speak up now and say: enough. We will not purge our military. We will not gender-wash, trans-wash, gay-wash, or whitewash our ranks. We will fight back — with truth, with honor, and with the conviction that our strength comes from our diversity, not in spite of it.

Pedro Pascal spoke out about the political climate under the second Trump administration and the current immigration policies during the Cannes press conference following the premiere of Eddington.


	The Ari Aster film stars Pascal as a progressive New Mexico mayor battling Joaquin Phoenix's small-town sheriff amid the Covid pandemic in May 2020. Eddington, which skewers the MAGA movement by way of Phoenix's character, takes place during the first Trump administration, was filmed during the Biden presidency, but will ultimately be released during the second Trump administration.


	The same day Trump seemingly threatened Bruce Springsteen's re-entry back into America after that singer's politically charged comments during a European tour stop, Pascal — the son of Chilean refugees — was also asked if he was worried about reentering the U.S. following Eddington's premiere.


	“Fear is the way that they win,” Pascal said. “So keep telling the stories, keep expressing yourself and keep fighting to be who you are. Fuck the people that try to make you scared, you know? And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so in telling stories. And don't let them win.”

	Earlier in the press conference, Pascal was asked about the Trump administration's immigration policies. “Obviously, it's very scary for an actor participating in a movie to sort of speak to issues like this. It's far too intimidating the question for me to really address, I'm not informed enough,” Pascal said.

I'm too afraid of your question, I hardly remember what it was.” 


	Pascal added of Eddington, “It felt like the first time that we had a mole, like a whistleblower almost, someone from the inside being like, ‘This is what's happening. And that was really powerful to me, and I don't think I understood that until I saw it.”

	The reconciliation bill President Donald Trump and Republicans are working to pass through Congress is chock-full of troubling provisions, but the tax plan ultimately boils down to a massive financial break for the wealthiest Americans at the expense of social programs that benefit the less fortunate — most notably Medicaid.


	Trump implored Republicans to pass the “BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL!” on Friday, writing about how it cuts taxes for “ALL Americans” (not true) and would “kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need” (also not true).


	Republicans on the House Budget Committee failed to pass the bill hours after Trump's message — not because of the Medicaid cuts, but because they wanted them to be more extreme. Americans do not want more extreme cuts. The public holds an overwhelmingly positive view of Medicaid, with a whopping 76 percent opposing significant cuts to the program.


	The tax bill that Republicans ultimately pass — public opinion be damned — is going to make life more difficult for millions of low-income Americans. Here's everything you need to know:

	











	Medicaid is a government program that provides health insurance to low-income Americans, as well as those with certain disabilities and otherwise limited resources. Medicaid programs are funded by both state and federal money, with each state operating its own program in accordance with federal rules and regulations.


	There are over 70 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid, over one fifth of the nation's population.


	Medicaid is not to be confused with Medicare, although Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently mixed up the programs when he said that Medicaid is “fully paid for by the federal government.” Medicare, not Medicaid, is fully funded by the federal government, and provides health insurance for Americans over 65. (Kennedy also claimed that Americans enrolled in Medicaid are upset about high premiums and deductibles, despite the fact that most Americans on Medicaid don't have to make any such payments.)

					The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time		
	









	RFK Jr.'s confusion doesn't necessarily mean the program is inherently confusing — but it certainly can be given how much it can differ from state to state.

	











	Republicans are planning to cut $880 billion from the budget of the Energy and Commerce Committee's budget, which oversees Medicaid.


	One way Republicans want to cut costs is by limiting “provider taxes,” which states use to help pay their share of Medicaid costs — with payments going to local health care providers like hospitals and doctors. Rolling Stone reported on the industry-wide concern that freezing these payments could force some rural hospitals to close. Republicans also want to cut  federal Medicaid funding to states that provide care for undocumented Americans, and require Americans at or above the federal poverty level to pay out-of-pocket costs for services they didn't have to pay previously.


	The primary way Republicans are going to cut funding for Medicaid, however, is by wrapping it in as much red tape as possible in order to reduce the number of Americans who are enrolled.


	It's already difficult enough to secure and maintain Medicaid coverage, especially for sick and disabled Americans. Trump and Republicans want to make it more difficult.


	The crux of the cuts lies in what Republicans are calling “community engagement requirements,” which is a nice way of saying they want to put up a series of barriers to coverage that will inevitably result in Americans getting kicked off the program. The bill calls for Americans to prove they work at least 80 hours per week in order to qualify. It also requires them to verify they are qualified twice annually.

	Medicaid is subject to strict income caps, which vary by state, but suffice to say recipients are not allowed to make enough money to live. By adding work requirements, Republicans are ordering Medicaid recipients to work — but not for too much money. States already check recipients' income levels once annually, and this process frequently results in eligible beneficiaries losing their Medicaid coverage for administrative reasons — such as if they fail to respond to a phone call or piece of mail.  


	Studies have shown that work requirements don't actually result in more employment, anyway, in part because Americans on Medicaid are already working. Health policy group KFF published a study earlier this year finding that in 2023, 92 percent of adults under 65 on Medicaid were working or not working because of school attendance, caregiving, or a disability, while the other eight percent were retired, unable to find work, or not working for other reasons. Republicans are pushing the idea that millions of Americans are sitting on their couches, snacking on junk food and laughing as they collect free health care, but this is simply not the case.

	











	The fallacy of the GOP's rhetoric about work requirements is exemplified in Luke Seaborn, a 54-year-old Georgia man whose maddening journey with state health care was highlighted by ProPublica. Georgia currently has a work requirement for Medicaid coverage, and the state used Seaborn, a mechanic, as one of the faces of the program. Seaborn advocated for the program on camera when it was introduced, but he's since been booted from it twice due to bureaucratic obstacles.


	“My head exploded,” he told ProPublica after he lost his coverage for the second time after failing to make a deadline to file an income statement he didn't know existed. “I didn't get a text or an email. I did what I was supposed to, but that wasn't good enough.”


	(ProPublica reported earlier in the year on the general failure of Georgia's Medicaid work-requirement program.)


	The Congressional Budget Office projects that 10.3 million Americans will ultimately lose their health care as a result of the cuts.


The New York Times recently published an op-ed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rolliins, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, in which the top Trump officials argued that the government is being too generous, and that too many Americans are mooching off welfare programs like Medicaid.


	Republicans in Congress have been making similar arguments. 


	“We've got some able bodies who really should not be on there or should be able to go to another insurance product that would help them to have health insurance,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) said this week. Carter did not explain where exactly these people should get health care otherwise, although he did say he wants to “make sure everybody has access” to it, which is a touching sentiment.


	“The person we're taking it away from is the able-bodied adult with no children who refuses to work,” Rep. Dan Crewnshaw (R-Texas) added in a gross misrepresentation of the effect of the cuts. “If they would just get a job, they would keep their Medicaid.”


	Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) has argued that the government needs to raise the bar on what constitutes a disability. Murphy, a doctor, complained specifically about two of his own patients, including a 48-year-old woman he said is hard of hearing but could hear his questions thanks to her hearing aids. “These are difficult challenges to overcome, but they are no reason someone should be on Medicaid, disabled and not working,” he said, adding: “I don't personally think they are disabled.”

	











There are some Republicans who seem to understand the reality of the Medicaid cuts, which is that millions of Americans, including working Americans, will lose their health insurance. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote an op-ed for the Times in which bashed the “corporatist Republicans” who prioritize “corporate giveaways” and “deep cuts to social insurance.”


	“Republicans need to open their eyes,” Hawley wrote. “Our voters support social insurance programs. More than that, our voters depend on those programs. And there's a reason for this that Republicans would do well to ponder. Our economy is increasingly unfriendly to working people and their families.”


	Democrats, at least some of them, are livid over the cuts. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, railed in a statement that “in no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage, hospitals will close, seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.”


	“This is not trimming fat around the edges, it's cutting to the bone,” he wrote. “The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking health care away from millions of Americans. Nowhere in this bill are they cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse' — they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires.”


	Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sparred with HHS Secretary Kennedy over the bill during a hearing earlier this week. “You cannot deny that the top two-tenths of one percent will get $235 billion in tax breaks while we cut Medicaid,” Sanders said in response to Kennedy trying to argue that the bill will benefit low-income Americans.


	Pete Buttigieg hasn't minced words, either. “Right now, front and center, we need to be talking about … Medicaid,” he said this week. “As we speak, congressional Republicans and Donald Trump are preparing to take Medicaid away from millions and millions of Americans. The impact on health, on poverty, on the economy, on their lives is enormous.”


	There isn't a ton Democrats in Congress or elsewhere can do to prevent the bill's passage, though, which is why Republicans need to ram it through now, while they still have their majority.

	Trump has insisted that his administration would not cut Medicaid. He told reporters in January that “we're going to love and cherish” the program, that “people won't be affected,” and that it will only be “better and more effective.” He insisted to Sean Hannity the following month that it wouldn't be “touched” and that it will only be “strengthened,” and reiterated to reporters at a Cabinet meeting a few weeks later that “we aren't going to touch it.”

	











	In every instance, Trump added the caveat that the administration is looking to eliminate waste and fraud — which he is now irrationally using as a pretext for taking a hatchet to the program he claims to “cherish” so dearly. Yes, millions of less fortunate Americans will have their lives thrown into flux, but the wealthy ones who put Trump back into office need their tax cuts.

Bad Bunny sure knows how to make his amphibian friend feel better. On Friday, the Puerto Rican star released the video for Debí Tirar Más Fotos track “Ketu TeCré,” which follows Concho during a night on the town.


	The video opens with Concho, the frog character from Bad Bunny's Number One album, getting ready to go out. He sprays cologne, poses in front of a mirror, then drives through Puerto Rican streets with his besties to the club. He texts Concha, his love interest, who says she's going to sleep.


	At the club, Concho is served by an insect bartender and spots a baddie frog — sadly, it's Concha — dancing with someone else, leaving him heartbroken.


	Concho leaves and sits alone, reminiscing on their relationship, before getting a text from Bad Bunny inviting him to a human strip club. There, dollar bills fly as Concho and Benito watch in awe. The video ends with Concho retelling the story in heartbreak.

	“I'm so jealous with my emotions. I get so angry and it hurts to share my feelings with someone who doesn't deserve them,” says Bad Bunny before Concho responds, “I need to be more of a fucker. I'm too nice!”

	











	The “KETU TeCRÉ” video follows videos for “BOKeTE” that dropped last month and “La Mudanza,” which came out the month before. Bad Bunny introduced Concho the frog in a teaser for the album featuring Jacobo Morales last December.

	Production designer Luke Hull and set decorator Rebecca Alleway brought the vast scope of Andor's second season to life with 180 sets, half of which were built from scratch. 


	The production used a number of real locations in the U.K., Spain, and Italy: Valencia's futuristic City of Arts and Sciences building was transformed into the Senate complex, while England's Greenham Common became the Rebel hideout used by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). Shots of Lake Como, Italy, were used to augment the planet of Ghorman and farmers' huts on Mina-Rau were built in the village of Watlington, England. All of the sets took several months to create.


	“Every set was a four-month lead time, so every day was we were trying to start new sets,” Alleway says. “It was a massive team effort of researchers, artists, drafts people, art directors, and more, all working in the set decoration department.”


	“It was a labor of love, for sure,” Hull says.


	Here, Hull and Alleway give Rolling Stone the inside story on the inspiration behind key sets from Andor Season Two.

	











Chandrilan WeddingSeason Two opens with the marriage of Mon Montha (Genevieve O'Reilly)'s daughter Leida into the Sculdun family. The opulent festivities on Chandrila gave the team an opportunity to create immersive, detailed sets at Pinewood and to use the real Montserrat mountain range in Spain. Hull imagined the lavish estate as an ancestral home with a deep history and tradition. The design was dictated by the ritualistic wedding, which used several spaces.


	“The complex is based on circles because I wanted a very kind of classical Star Wars look, even though it was a mansion set in the mountains,” Hull says. “There are concentric circles in the courtyard garden to inform the ritual. One of the references for me was Thomas Vinterberg's film Festen, which is around a wedding where things come to a boiling point and then in the morning there's an awkward breakfast.”

	Alleway says she had “a lot of fun” designing the food and flowers for the wedding scenes. She had previously designed and flowers for the Chandrilan Embassy in Season One, and wanted to expand on that aesthetic, which was Japanese-inspired. “We knew [the set] was going to be up for a really long time, so we used artificial flowers,” she says. “We made hundreds, all sculpted. It was a good thing they were artificial because [when] the actors strike happened that set stood and it all stayed as it was.”

	











Axis SafehouseCassian Andor (Diego Luna) and Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona) hide out in a run-down—but surprisingly spacious—apartment on Coruscant, and later Cassian rescues Kleya Marki (Elizabeth Dulau) from the same safehouse. Hull says that showrunnner Tony Gilroy wanted the safehouse to have its own backstory. “At first, it doesn't seem too bad. It doesn't have furniture, but there's some warmth here. It's safe. And then it becomes more and more decayed. Who knows who else has stayed here and hacked it apart and hidden things? There was space inside, but in a way I thought it felt more lonely than if we'd made it smaller.”


	Hull took inspiration from Parisian public housing, picturing the series of apartment blocks on the outskirts of Coruscant in an industrial area. “For French social housing they build these huge towers, often with quite a strong sense of design, and yet they are extremely soulless and repetitive,” Hull says. “The idea was to make [the characters] minuscule within the environment, and even lost within it.”


Coruscant BodegaWhen Cassian and Bix visit a shop called Samo's on Coruscant to buy Ukio melons and a spicy Moski pepper, they are actually in London's Barbican. But the location wasn't available until close to the shooting date, so the team spent several months designing, creating, and assembling all of the goods and products inside the shop in the props room at Pinewood Studios in London.

	“I was very lucky to have a buying team that had worked on a couple of Star Wars [productions] before so they understood the language and they started purchasing things,” Alleway says. “We designed and purchased shelves, and we started filling the shelves in the prop room and doing the graphics for them at least five months in advance. Everything had to be graphic-ed, hung, colored, organized, and rearranged.”


	Samo's housed hundreds of items, including fruit and packaged goods; It was a huge endeavor for a relatively short scene. “From a design perspective and set decorating perspective, it never got boring, so you wanted to make an effort on every on every level,” Alleway says. “I considered everything, from every small piece to every big design piece.”


Dedra's ApartmentDedra Meero (Denise Gough)'s sparse high-rise apartment on Coruscant was meant feel like the antithesis of Eedy Karn's home, where Syril Karn (Kyle Soller) grew up. “I think the reason Andor has gone down so well is it's Star Wars, but we get to see inside people's homes,” Alleway says. “We get to open their drawers, we get to see what they eat. We get to understand the background of their characters and why they became part of the Rebellion or part of the Empire. That was like a dream because [we could create] these total fantasy worlds that everyone loves, but go deeper and explore this [design] language in a really domestic way.”

	











	Hull again used a circular design, constructing the apartment with connecting rooms like four sections of a pie. It has a Soviet-era communist vibe. “She's given this sort of disc and it's not very homely,” Hull says. “She hasn't made it home because that's just not who she is. It's very functional, and yet it's also quite glamorous. It has that upper echelon look, and yet it's so sterile. But the main thing was that there are no doors to close and there's nowhere to hide.”


	The apartment is showcased in a pivotal scene when Dedra and Syril invite Eedy (Kathryn Hunter) over for dinner. Originally, Hull designed a revolving restaurant for the meal, but it became too ambitious. “We were like, ‘Maybe this is a bit extreme,'” he says. “It became better, in a way, to scale it down and put it in Dedra's world. I we'd had more scenes in Dedra's home because there's a whole section you don't really get to see in the living room.”


	For dinner, Dedra serves fondue, an idea Alleway presented to Gilroy and he eventually wrote into the script. The fondue set was based on a reference from an interior design magazine from the 1960s, presented on a circular dining table. The fondue itself was edible, but it wasn't made of cheese. “It was vegetarian-based,” Alleway says. “And the weird shrimp were edible, although they weren't actually shrimp. They were meant to be a Star Wars version of shrimp. I didn't expect it to be quite as messy or as runny as it was.”


GhormanPalmo, the capital city of Ghorman, was the largest set built for Season Two. It was constructed on a backlot at Pinewood and needed to include the plaza and numerous streets, which were later destroyed during the uprising and massacre. The buildings reflected the planet's history and tradition. The café, shops, and hotel in Palmo are the sorts of places you might find in Europe, particularly Italian cities like Milan and Turin. “We drew on Italy and France and old historic European and combined it with the language of Star Wars,” Alleway says. “Every set in Ghorman was quite challenging because how you make something like that Star Wars? Other sets are so obviously part of the universe, but this was a whole new world.”


	The café combines that historic architecture, which evokes the 1920s and 1930s, with shapes and textures that feel more otherworldly. The Ghorman spider can be seen in the wall décor as a nod to the planet's textile economy and to the marble mosaics found in places like Rome. The teapots were inspired by an Art Deco teapot Alleway found and its unusual shape informed the rest of the glassware and cutlery. “Everything was really carefully considered, down to every spoon,” she says. “Every morsel of food they ate in there was designed and baked by my food stylist into certain shapes.”

	











	Initially, there wasn't a café in the script, but Hull felt it was a good way to indicate the culture and history of the people. “It showed how the Ghormans would have been in their heyday with the intelligentsia going into this café,” Hull says. “Designers would be in there, tool makers would be in there. People would be discussing things, sketching things, spilling out at night, drinking coffee in the day, and having cocktails at night. When we jump it's more repressed, but it was a way of showing it as a social hub.”


	The textile shop that Cassian visits was created on location at London's Guildhall. “I liked it because it also has that plaza out front, which gave more scope to Ghorman rather than just having one central plaza,” Hull says. “This is a 300-year-old business that has passed from generations, so you feel the history in the building. He sells specific tones of silk and design. I loved the color swatches we had made for those.”


Davo Sculdun's PartyDavo Sculdun (Richard Dillane)'s lavish party was filmed in the Vestíbul Principal in Valencia, Spain, and dressed with consideration for how the Coruscant elite would eat and drink. Thinking about a character like Sculdun, who has a lot of money, Alleway imagined illuminated blocks of ice displaying sushi—but the Star Wars version of sushi. “I had five concept artists and one of them, for that scene, just [created] all of the sushi,” she says. “It was molded and painted and then shipped to Valencia. It based on some of the mad creatures that you've seen in in Star Wars before and I messed around with tentacles.”


	When Mon arrives at the party, a paparazzi drone accosts her inside, snapping a quick succession of photos. That droid was built and placed on a rig that a crew member carried across the set. “It spun properly and the lights went off and the rig was erased in post-production,” Hull says. “It was completely practical.”


Imperial HospitalKleya infiltrates an Imperial hospital to spare Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgård) from being forced to talk. The sequence required careful planning by Hull and Gilroy, who worked in tandem to figure out how the action would unfold in the spaces. Hull took loose inspiration from the Lloyd's of London building and created a U-shaped structure with floors stacked on top of each other. Due to budget constraints and logistics, only one floor was actually built. The team then redressed it several times to create the illusion that Kleya is moving from floor to floor. “We made each floor look completely different, but in reality it was the same set,” Alleway says.

	











	It had to be very clear where Kleya goes after she leaves the locker room, which was a separate set build, and there was a lot of consideration as to where she would set off an explosion to draw attention away. “Tony is really keen on geography and I think it's really important as well,” Hull says. “When you're dealing with so much scope and so many characters and so many moving parts you don't want the audience have to work too hard to understand where everything is.”


	Originally, Hull designed an emergency room on one of the levels, but that was cut as the design evolved. The hospital's technology also required a lot of thought. Alleway calls the approach “high-tech retro.” “If you think about the tech of Star Wars, generally, for the 1970s when it was created it was pretty high tech,” she says. “We're moving forward. It has to be high tech enough that it sits within our Star Wars timeline without tipping into being sci-fi.”


	Luthen's hospital bed in the stark, sterile hospital was a favorite creation. “That whole scene was really powerful,” Alleway says. “The room looked amazing, and Luke and I had such fun designing it.”


	Although most of the hospital was built on a soundstage, postmodernist building 125 London Wall can be seen as Kleya scopes out her approach. “Kleya walks out on the to the balcony for the first look at the hospital's exterior and you see where the ships are parked,” Hull says. “I've always wanted to shoot that location because it was so intrinsically Star Wars.


MarketplaceIn a late-season flashback, viewers learn how Luthen and Kleya met. The characters visit a marketplace in a small hillside town, which was created at Xàtiva Castle in Spain. The market stalls were individually designed and built. “I had a Spanish crew that helped dress it, but all of that was purchased and put together in the U.K.,” Alleway says. “I went to Valencia with a team and measured up everything first, and then it was designed and set up on the back lot. We designed each stall to come apart and pack down, and we tested everything. Concepts were done for every single market store.”


Yavin Rebel BaseEvolving what fans have previously seen of Yavin was a big challenge. The team used a stage and backlot at Longcross Studios to build the expansive set, which connected the hangar, the meeting room, and the airfield in a continuous space. “It wasn't a case of reimagining Yavin,” Hull says. “It was about expanding it and about giving it a little bit more humanity beyond just the rebellion planning of the temple itself.”

	











	Cassian's home on Yavin, which Hull dubbed Chez Andor, was filled with realistic detail and texture, including nods to his upbringing on Kenari. It had a kitchen, a wood chopping block, and even a shower, but it's still fairly rundamentary. “It's got to look like these characters actually exist in this environment,” Hull says. “They live here. They're bedded in. There were a few things that warm it up, but we were very careful not to go too far with it because the whole concept should be that they're ready to fail at any point.”

	 “We made practical drawers so that Cassian could go to a drawer and pull something out,” Alleway adds. “Everything was absolutely everything there, whether it was a tool on his work bench or a Star Wars stirring object, [which might] not necessarily be a spoon. We filled the homes you would a normal home.”


	Cassian and the other rebels are often drinking or eating as the scenes play out—something Hull felt was generally important on the series. “I'm always very wary that people should have something to do,” he says. “Even if they're not eating or drinking in camera. Like the security man who has the CCTV cameras in the hospital had a [Thermos] and a half-eaten sandwich. Anything that gives someone a sense of humanity. We always wanted to give the impression that these were real people who really lived in this world.”

A strange encounter in a back garden in Stockport has resulted in one ""freaked out"" witness claiming he has captured photographs of a mysterious flying craft in the sky.

Chris Longson, 59, from Hazel Grove in Stockport, said two strange incidents happened on Friday (May 16) just a couple of hours apart. He told the M.E.N that the first incident happened when he was out in his back garden around 9am.

He was looking over towards the direction of Pointon when he noticed something strange in the sky.

""I don't know what it was,"" Chris said. ""But all as I saw was this thing came over my shoulder to my left. It went in front of me. I kept my eyes on it and it disappeared in front of my very eyes.""

Asked how high the object was, Chris said: ""I'm guessing, not very high. I mean, it looked like it was about an inch, but it could have been six meters. I don't know because there's no depth perception when you've got something in the sky, unless there's something before, behind or in front of it.

""I'm kind of thinking 'Oh my god'. It looked like something off Star Trek that was going across the sky.

""Not very high, and it kind of just cloaked itself, and that's the word I'm going to use.""

Chris admitted the strange encounter left him ""a bit freaked out"". But a couple of hours later, while out again in the back garden, he noticed a plane travelling across the cloudless blue sky and decided to get his camera phone out to take a few snaps.

Chris said: ""Later on, when I got in my flat, I started looking through them and I thought, Oh my god, what's that?'

""What the hell is this now - I know that those weren't planes.""

Chris had taken a number of photos, and when he zoomed into the part showing where the plane was leaving a trail across the sky, he noticed two strange objects in one of the photographs.

Two dark objects are seen in the picture near where the plane appears. Chris describes one of them as ""cigar"" shaped, adding, ""It's got shape and form and edges. It looks like a cylinder.""

""It's definitely not normal,"" Chris said. Adding in the other images, there are ""other anomalies in the sky"" that are ""not planes, not helicopters, not drones.""

Chris said: ""These are, in my view, real UAPs.""

Previously referred to as UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), UAPs are now a more common term and stand for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. According to NASA, it's a term used to describe observations of events in the sky, air, sea, space, or land that cannot be identified as known aircraft or natural phenomena from a scientific perspective.

Asked what he thinks the objects in the photographs could be, Chris said: ""I had a really weird experience many, many, many years ago... it really freaked me out.

""So I sky watch all the time, and I've seen some pretty interesting stuff, to be fair. But I had never caught anything on camera.""

He added: ""I'm a firm believer that there is real alien life out there because of all the stars and all the planets. I'm not having it that we are the only things that are intelligent out there.""

On the other photos that Chris took, he said the objects have disappeared or appear elsewhere, giving the perception that they are travelling. He also added that the objects appear to high in the sky to be drones.

Despite the potential for ridicule, Chris says he wanted to report the sighting as he feels it's important not to keep such things secret, no matter how strange it appears.

He adds: ""I know that it's a UFO. Call it a UAP, UFO, flying saucer, God knows what.

""It is not a plane, it's not a helicopter and it's flying, which means it's an unidentified flying object.""

A US fighter jet has been struck by an unidentified object over the Arizona skies, sparking fresh alien speculation.

Score one for the aliens.

A United States F-16 Viper combat jet has been damaged after being struck by an “unidentified aerial phenomenon”.

It comes amid a fresh uptick in the number of strange flying objects being sighted over the southern US border state of Arizonza. 

The News Nation media service reports seeing Federal Aviation Authority documents confirming “numerous encounters” with strange craft. One reportedly struck the perspex canopy of a $A100 million F-16 fighter, causing the aircraft to be grounded for repairs. 

These aren't UFOS (Unidentified Flying Objects).

Instead, they are UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena).

So what's in a name?

Arizona shares extensive military testing grounds with neighbouring Nevada – home to the secretive Area 51 testing facility that has been associated with otherworldly flying saucers for decades.

But it also borders Mexico. That is the focus of fresh invasion fears.

President Donald Trump has invoked the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 in response to a “predatory incursion” of the United States.

Not the murderous alien Predators of Arnold Schwarzenegger fame, but the fundamentally human need to seek safety and security – or a quick buck.

Now, defence analysts are linking an uptick in the region's long history of alien invasion scares to a surge in the use of cross-border drug-smuggling drones.

Something in the air

“There has been a lot of activity, particularly on the Arizona border. A lot of people are reporting a lot of things,” former director of the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), Luis Elizondo, told News Nation.

One incident flared across local headlines in November.

Strange lights were seen in the night sky above Bullhead City. Footage quickly went viral on TikTok.

Despite being linked to the headlights of off-road vehicles driving through nearby hills, the incident has further fuelled the state's reputation as an alien sightseeing destination.

In 1997, photos of a V-shaped formation dubbed the “Phoenix Lights” attracted global attention. 

Few accepted the US Air Force's explanation that it was a group of A-10 “Tankbuster” aircraft practising formation-flying with their night-lights on.

Another incident, this time in 2011, convinced locals that the aliens had returned. 

Again, the explanation that the Arizona Skyhawks skydiving team was carrying high-intensity flares to kick off a nearby football match didn't appeal.

But now, the FAA documents suggest US Air Force pilots are adding to Arizona's collection of inexplicable sightings.

At least until they're explained.

Border patrols have been intensified in recent years and one of President Trump's first acts was to order 6000 extra troops into the region, supported by armoured personnel carriers, surveillance aircraft, combat helicopters and two navy destroyers.

Combined with intensified border police checks and patrols, this is making it more challenging for Mexico's cartels to feed America's illegal narcotics addiction.

Evidence suggests they're turning to a new generation of large drones to haul their deadly cargo directly to market.

Dones being used as delivery mules isn't exactly new. US authorities have been documenting seizures of small craft carrying 5 to 10kg for more than a decade. 

But technologies developed for the likes of Amazon to deliver large parcels across an urban landscape are being adapted for the drug trade.

That means they're flying higher and further than ever before.

The truth is out there

New research from the Manchester Metropolitan University and Liverpool John Moores University has examined the tendency for people to attribute unexplained events to paranormal or extraterrestrial events.

“When faced with events we cannot control, our minds look for patterns and explanations,” the study's authors write.

President Trump's new administration came to power, insisting it would tackle the UFO issue once and for all. 

And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did so in one of her first public appearances.

She addressed last year's spate of strange lights in the sky in the American Northeast.

They were not aliens. They weren't even Iranian drones. They were, she said, normal aircraft flying normal routes at normal times.

It's just that people had suddenly started paying attention to them.

“In time, it got worse, due to curiosity. This was not the enemy,” she explained.

Now, the Trump Administration has moved to shut down a secret FBI office dedicated to investigating “unidentified anomalous phenomena””. 

It had been public knowledge for decades that the Pentagon had been running the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to examine strange sightings. 

But the FBI had never admitted – before announcing it was about to be shut down – that this team existed. 

Questions, however, remain unanswered.

Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett wants to know more. He's told the US Congress that extraterrestrial craft are operating from secret undersea bases.

“I haven't been briefed on this, just from what I'm putting together, but we have some secret sonar … (They) tell me something's moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater … and this one was as large as a football field underwater, and this was a documented case, and I have an admiral telling me this stuff,” he told One America News.

The research psychologists say it's a natural tendency for people to turn to paranormal and conspiracy-theory beliefs in order to deal with anxiety.

“Realising that life is unpredictable and has an end can be unsettling,” they write. “Supernatural beliefs provide comfort by suggesting that a higher power controls human destiny.”

The illegal immigration crisis, the militarisation of the border – and increased military training and experimentation in the face of increasing global aggression – all converge on Arizona.

That may help explain why every light in the sky is suddenly a UFO or UAP.

“Instead of dismissing such beliefs, it is important to recognise their emotional and personal significance,” the psychologists conclude.

“Particularly, how beliefs shape people's perspectives and coping mechanisms.

“While they may not align with logic or evidence, the comfort they afford is deeply meaningful to those who hold them.”

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Steven Spielberg has been filming a movie this year in New Jersey and New York, but photos on social media suggest that the movie could be a close encounter for Kansas City.

Is the movie set in K.C.?

Last week a software engineer on X tweeted a photo from the set in New Jersey.

""Steven Spielberg just casually transforming my campus into Kansas City,"" he wrote.

He included a photo of a building dressed like a TV station with fake call letters, KCXE, on the front. Another picture showed satellite dishes locked behind a fence with this sign, ""KCXE 4 Broadcast Operations.""

In reality, that building is on the campus of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark.

A photo posted on Reddit showed the same building with the words ""Kansas City News"" emblazoned on the side in tall red letters.

Details about the film, set for a 2026 release, are sparse, though it is described as a UFO movie, familiar territory for the legendary Oscar-winner who directed ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""

Some entertainment outlets have tapped this new film as one of the most anticipated sci-fi movies coming down the road.

In late February, photos published by a local New York newspaper provided the strongest evidence that at least some of the action involves Kansas City.

The Journal News, which covers New York's Lower Hudson Valley, published a series of photos of the filmmaking underway in White Plains, New York.

They showed Spielberg and actress Emily Blunt (""Oppenheimer,"" ""The Devil Wears Prada"") on the set.

A Kansas City Police Department car was on set, too. Spielberg was seen crouching next to one as he worked.

Another photo showed a Kansas City Royals street signed posted high on a lamppost. It was Royals blue, bore the team's crown-shaped icon, its web address and read: ""You're in Royals country. Get your season tickets now.""

""We can see Steven Spielberg there standing next to a cop car. It says Kansas City on that by the way. So clearly parts of it are going to take place in Kansas City,"" UFO sleuth Patrick Scott Armstrong said on his podcast, ""Vetted,"" while discussing the film. ""Even though they're filming in Jersey, they make it seem like Kansas City.""

In March, as Spielberg filmed in Westchester County, New York, a Reddit user reported seeing the local library ""dolled up"" as the ""Jackson County Hospital,"" noting that Kansas City is in Jackson County, Missouri.

""I saw the ambulances on set all said Jackson County this morning,"" another Reddit user responded.

The Star asked the K.C. Film Office if it knew anything about the movie and whether, indeed, it takes place in a fake K.C.

Spielberg has filmed other projects in the Northeast and is so familiar with the area he reportedly told one mayor to never change his town.

With last year's popular Hallmark Christmas movie about the Chiefs and several reality TV shows filmed here in recent months, the K.C. film industry is in the midst of ""an exciting time,"" film office director Rachel Kephart told The Star recently.

""We have world-class crews, diverse locations, geographic accessibility and competitive film incentives that make filming in KC a good business decision,"" she said.

Asked about the Spielberg film, the office said in a statement that it did ""not have any further details to share regarding this project.""

The film is said to be based on an original story by Spielberg with a screenplay by longtime collaborator David Koepp, who worked with him on the first ""Jurassic Park"" film and two ""Indiana Jones"" movies.

The title hasn't been revealed, though it appears to be shooting under the name, ""Non-View.""

""Disclosure"" and ""The Dish"" have been bandied about, too.

Blunt stars alongside Wyatt Russell, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Josh O'Connor and Eve Hewson.

The film is slated for a June 12, 2026, premiere which sets it up to be Spielberg's return to big summer blockbusters like ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park.""

As for that KCPD car Spielberg huddled against, that vehicle could use a little more Hollywood magic.

""This car does not resemble any Kansas City Missouri Police cars,"" KCPD spokesman Jacob Becchina told the Star.

ET from the exhibition 'Alien', source: WOW Spazio Fumetto/ANSA

A small observatory at Harvard University watches the sky 24 hours a day. It's not searching for stars or supernovae, but for something far more controversial: UFO's or, to use the more modern and less sensational term, UAP: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. The initiative is called the Galileo Project, founded in 2021 by Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at Harvard known for his unconventional, yet always scientifically grounded, theories.

Among the team's most notable figures is Garance Dominé, a brilliant young French scientist trained at École Polytechnique and Stanford University, where she studied neutrinos, near-invisible particles capable of passing through the entire planet undisturbed. Rather than following a traditional academic path, Dominé chose an alternative route: helping to build a new science of the unexplained.

The observatory is a modest array of sensors: infrared cameras, particle counters, spectrometers, and magnetometers, all pointed skyward. But the true driving force behind the research is artificial intelligence. Advanced software analyzes vast amounts of data in real time, distinguishing between known objects such as aircraft, drones, birds and anomalies that defy classification.

Richard Cloete, Dominé's colleague, emphasizes that precisely because we don't know what we're looking for, it's essential to know exactly what a UAP is not. Cloete, a South African who began his career building Tesla coils and amateur radios, later earned an engineering degree in the UK. He now leads the development of an extensive database of flying objects both real and artificially generated, using software like Blender to train the project's algorithms.

These tools, connected to the university's powerful computing clusters, learn to recognize everything conventional in the night sky so they can alert researchers the moment something breaks the pattern. At that point, the observatory automatically activates additional cameras and stores the data for deeper analysis.

This isn't about chasing aliens in tinfoil hats, it's about applying scientific rigor to one of humanity's most compelling questions: are we alone? Loeb, known for his controversial views on the existence of extraterrestrial life, drew global attention in 2018 when he hypothesized that the interstellar object “Oumuamua” might be an alien probe. Since then, he has turned suspicion into systematic analysis, arguing that “the universe is too vast to rule out the extraterrestrial hypothesis a priori.”

The Galileo Project isn't just an academic effort. Following a 2017  New York Times report revealing the Pentagon's secret interest in UAP, the U.S. Congress mandated the Department of Defense to publish annual reports on the subject and established a dedicated office: AARO. Other institutions from Wellesley College to the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics are now launching similar research initiatives.

Dominé, who as a child was fascinated by languages and computer programming, has always sought answers to life's big mysteries. Her intellectual influences include not only Einstein but also Jacques Vallée, the French astronomer and ufologist who inspired the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. For her, studying UAP doesn't necessarily mean believing in aliens, it means exploring the unknown with scientific authority.

While ghosts and spirits have long been the conduit for cinematic scares and jolts, from The Innocents to Poltergeist to The Ring, a relatively recent wave of films exploring the supernatural has been more concerned with the tangible, emotional effects these specters can have on the living. In that sense, a spiritual cousin to the likes of Uncle Boonmee, Personal Shopper, A Ghost Story, and Light from Light, Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke's directorial debut A Useful Ghost is a strange, tranquil, humorous exploration of the conundrums that would emerge were ghosts an accepted occurrence in everyday life, and what such phantoms could illuminate about the social and political troubles of modern Thailand and industrialization at large.

“Dust is a necessary evil. There is no progress without dust.” These early words set the stage for the rampant commercialization in the aim of increased profits that afflict the characters, both corporeal and phantasmic, of A Useful Ghost. The daily life of an “academic ladyboy” (Wisarut Homhuan) is burdened by the accumulation of dust from the nearby construction site of a massive mall, replacing local shops and extravagant murals. After procuring a vacuum to clean up the debris floating into his apartment, he begins hearing strange coughing sounds seemingly coming from the device. A serviceman named Krong (Rungkumjad Krong) arrives near-instantaneously after a call is placed. In a nesting-doll structure of sorts, Krong begins to share a tale of the factory and the worker who haunted these appliances after dying from unsafe conditions. Peeling back more layers of the supernatural tale, he conveys that March (Witsarut Himmarat), son of the matriarch businesswoman Suman (Apasiri Nitibhon) running the factory, lost his wife Nat (Davika Hoorne) and their child-to-be after becoming afflicted with a respiratory disease. Nat then reappears in the form of a red vacuum cleaner and a human-ghost love story blossoms, complete with sexual encounters.

While the inherent absurdity of such a concept could've easily swerved into narrative territory too silly to earn emotional investment, Boonbunchachoke mostly finds the ideal tone of sly and serene satire to pull off such a difficult balancing act. As March interacts with Nat's spirit that is housed in the vacuum cleaner, we first see Nat in her human form, establishing an eternal physical bond that endures, even if only in the mind of March. Comical cuts reveal the reality of how the family and others see the possessed vacuum cleaner, snuggling up with March. Assertions of the “immoral” connection between machine and man start to fly. As comical as the situation is on the surface, the reactions of witnesses are matter-of-fact, accepting Nat's presence while rejecting the enduring relationship. This leads to rather humorous scenarios imagining what might happen if tangible ghosts appeared in everyday society and everyone took them at face value. Could a ghost be charged with stealing a vacuum cleaner that it possesses? Can ghosts give approval to use their frozen eggs for artificial insemination? What are the moral implications of ghosts entering others' dreams?

Cinematographer Pasit Tandaechanurat finds a beautiful elegance in each frame, accompanied by a harp-heavy score from Chaibovon Seelukwa that gives the sense of being whisked away on a magical, dream-like story, buoyed by playful wipe dissolves and iris shots. While the humor of an outlandish situation taken at face value can feel too labored and the passive approach can occasionally register as languid, Boonbunchachoke's script smartly expands the initial set-up to consider how love endures even as memory has faded, and what happens when a ghost finally achieves resolution. With the emergence of other themes––involving the scars of unsafe labor conditions, queerness, political uprising, and the machinations of a ghost society––one realizes A Useful Ghost has more on its mind than a peculiar love story. A surprising coda that leans into more genre-friendly jolts can feel at odds with what came before, yet A Useful Ghost marks an impressively ambitious, layered debut about a spirit's ability to illuminate the ills and complications of modern life.

A Useful Ghost premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.

""Making it to the top is not worth your life. It's just... not worth it."" Blue Harbor Ent. has revealed a teaser trailer for an intriguing new horror film called The Sound, made by filmmaker Brendan Devane. Has there been a rock climbing horror movie before (not counting Cliffhanger which is action)? A group of climbers embarks on a dangerous climb that has been off-limits for years. What begins as an audacious expedition transforms into a battle for survival against a force that toys with them. During their ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival. This poster hints at the supernatural force hanging over the rock wall. And they even have some rock music, too. Actor William Fichtner is in the cast with Marc Hills, Jocelyn Hudon, David Clennon, Christina Kirkman, plus special guests Kyle Gass and real climber Alex Honnold. Gotta say, I'm kinda intrigued by this - at least the climbing will be real and not bad Hollywood fake. Check out the quick first look below.

Here's the first look teaser trailer (+ poster) for Brendan Devane's film The Sound, from YouTube:





In terrifying horror thriller The Sound, a world-class group of climbers is granted access to the Forbidden Wall, a mysterious rock wall previously closed for decades. Among all the climbers is Sean (Marc Hills), whose grandfather made an ill-fated attempt 63 years earlier. During the group's ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival hundreds of feet above the ground. The Sound is written & directed by American indie filmmaker Brendan Devane, making his second film after directing The Canyonlands (2021) previously. It's also produced by Brendan Devane. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Blue Harbor Ent. will debut Devane's The Sound film in select US theaters + on VOD starting June 27th, 2025. Interested?

Kasamba


New York City, May  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

We've all seen scary movies. Maybe some of you have even had experiences that could be classified as paranormal. 

If you're curious to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, there are places online where you can speak to professional psychics who will explain much of it to you for free. 

One place that comes to mind is a platform called Kasamba. As a new customer on the platform, you can get a free psychic reading in the form of introductory minutes, plus 50% off your first reading. 

If you just recently started exploring the world of psychics, a psychic reading at Kasamba may be exactly what you need. If you're already familiar with the world of psychics, you probably already know what Kasamba has in store for you.

What Is Kasamba?

The word “Kasamba” is of African origin. Depending on where you're from, it can mean “a bathing child” in South Africa or a “dream chaser” in Uganda and Zambia.

On the internet, Kasamba is an online psychic reading platform that's been around for over 25 years. It offers readings via online chat and telephone, where you're charged by the minute to speak with highly screened psychics to guarantee legitimate readings. 

In other words, this is the real deal, so make sure you've burned some sage and are in the right frame of mind before you connect to a psychic on the site.

Reputation, User Base, and Credibility

To stay in business online for 25 years doing psychic readings is an impressive feat. Essentially, it can mean only one of two things. Either the readers on Kasamba are very good, or they're the best con artists ever. 

Yet if you read the site's customer reviews, the majority are overwhelmingly in favor of the former, especially when it comes to readings on love and relationships. 

According to their customers, love is the subject where Kasamba shines. If Cupid has been making your life a melodrama, the word is that their love psychics can not only dress the wounds from his arrows, but also inspire your heart to get back up on that horse and ride.>>Get 3 free minutes with 3 different advisors on Kasamba

Pros and Cons of Kasamba

Let's look at the potential upsides and downsides of dipping your toes into Kasamba's psychic pool with a free reading.

How Kasamba's Psychic Reading Promo Works

If you're new to the free Kasamba psychic reading offers, let's take a moment to show you how it all works.

The “3 Promo Minutes” Offer for New Users

Every new customer on Kasamba automatically gets a free 3-minute psychic reading with 3 different psychics. If it's your first reading, trying to pick the right Kasamba psychic can be like picking a lottery number. Therefore, getting a free psychic reading chat with 3 different readers considerably raises the likelihood of finding the right one.

Yet Kasamba is so confident in their psychics' abilities to fascinate and amaze you that they also offer 50% off your first reading if you opt to continue.>>Get 3 free minutes with 3 different advisors on Kasamba

Types of Psychic Readings Available on Kasamba

Seeking tailored insights? Kasamba offers diverse psychic readings, and studies suggest some find them more helpful for stress than therapy. Explore the specialties below to pinpoint the guidance you need.

Love and Relationship Readings

Whether you're looking for new love, working on improving a relationship, married, or suffering through a divorce or breakup, the experienced love psychics at Kasamba can help. Many turn to Kasamba for insightful online tarot readings to gain clarity on their romantic situations. 

  

They'll pick up on the vibe of you and a partner and will be honest about who needs to change, who can't, and if you should move on or stay and see if the other person is your soulmate. 

  

We know it sounds like practical magic, but they've been doing this for a quarter of a century, offering guidance through tools like love tarot reading, and people keep coming back. Think about it.

Career and Financial Insights

The legendary American Oligarch J.P. Morgan is rumored to have once said, “Millionaires don't use astrology, billionaires do.” Whether he actually said that or even meant it is up for debate, although he is said to have regularly visited the astrologer Evangeline Adams for advice.

  

If you aspire to financial security, you can use the psychics at Kasamba the same way to help figure out your financial direction, since over 75 of them specialize in the subject.

Tarot Card Readings

The tarot has been around since ancient times and is currently the most popular psychic tool used by modern readers for fortune telling. A compendium of arcane spiritual knowledge, its 78 picture cards can be arranged in multiple spreads, thus making it flexible enough to answer almost any question.

  

For fun and giggles, there are also automated AI tarot readings available on the site's articles section, offering a digital approach to fortune telling. There, you can get a free tarot reading using one or three-card spreads that are not only fun but quite uncanny with their answers.

Astrology and Horoscopes

Ever since humans have been able to look up at the sky and wonder, the planets and stars have been a point of study and fascination. With a Kasamba astrology session, you can get a reading based on your date of birth. 

  

That will help you recognize your astrological cycles, compatibility with others, and the best time to pursue goals. There is also a free Kasamba horoscope feature available daily to see what each day may have in store.

Spiritual Guidance and Life Questions

Whether you need a medium to contact a departed loved one in the afterlife, a clairvoyant for advice on spooky goings on at home, or just some sage life guidance, it's all available at Kasamba. You can even explore the meanings behind your subconscious narratives with dream analysis services offered by many Kasamba psychics.>>Get 3 free minutes with 3 different advisors on Kasamba

How to Pick the Best Psychic Reading Platform: A Quick Guide

Here are some tips to help you find the best psychic platforms for your needs:

Read User Reviews

The best indication of the quality of any service is customer feedback. They're paying for the service, and their opinion is numero uno. Make sure to study the customer ratings for any psychic you're interested in.

Check Specialization and Reading Style

Make sure the psychic you're choosing specializes in the topic you want to talk about. Most psychics focus on certain areas of questioning, like love and relationships, or career. If love is on your mind, especially if you're curious about love spells or finding a compatible partner, talk to a love psychic.

Try Different Psychics for Different Needs

Just as you might seek a second opinion from a doctor, don't be afraid to connect with different psychics for various questions or even for the same issue. Each psychic brings their unique gifts, perspectives, and connections. What resonates deeply with you from one advisor might offer a different angle from another.

How to Prepare for Your Psychic Reading

If it's your first time getting an online psychic reading, below are some things you can do to prepare.

Set Clear Goals or Questions in Advance

Before you even connect with a psychic, take a moment for some introspection. What are you truly hoping to gain from this reading? Having specific questions or areas of focus will help you steer the conversation and ensure you receive the insights that are most relevant to you.

Choose a Quiet Environment

A quiet environment will help you and your psychic to better concentrate on the matters at hand and best facilitate you being able to process the information that's being shared.

Stay Open-Minded But Aware of General Advice

If you knew the answer to your questions, you wouldn't need to consult a psychic for advice. Be prepared to hear something new you hadn't previously thought of. You need to be open to a different mindset than the one that created your problem and/or misunderstanding.

Note Down Relevant Insights for Future Reflection

It is often difficult to fully process and comprehend something you are hearing for the first time. Taking notes will allow you to go back and reflect on what was said with a different frame of mind, so you can experience a new level of understanding.

   06:13 EDT 17 May 2025, updated  07:02 EDT 17 May 2025    By STEPHEN BISSET FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA  

Former Real Housewives Of Melbourne star Jackie Gillies has revealed that a toxic relationship in her teens, helped tune her psychic abilities.

Writing in The Australian on Saturday, Jackie, 44, admitted that she had the ability to 'see spirits' from an early age, before blocking them out during her teenage years.

She revealed that it was a 'controlling relationship' she was in at 19 that had helped reacquaint the former reality star with her gift. 

'It wasn't until one day I remember I was crying in my bed and I said to God, why is this happening to me? And I saw a vision of every time this person ever cheated,' Jackie shared.

'I went to this person and told them what I'd seen. It was like I was looking at a movie theatre.

'I was looking at my bedroom wall, but it was like a movie theatre of images. It was after this relationship broke down that I started to do the inner work and tuned back into my intuition.'

She also revealed that, with the help of a 'manifestation board' she had used her gift to engender everything she wanted, including her RHOM role and marriage to Silverchair rocker Ben Gillies.

She shared that she knew her future hubby as a teen before losing touch after high school.

After becoming reacquainted with Ben at a party, that night she had a dream of her and Ben together and, upon telling Ben, he admitted he'd had the same dream.

'We hung out for about a year, I was 29 and I'd said to my Dad I'm going to be married by the time I'm 30,' she said.

'Finally Ben kissed me. Then two days later he proposed with a diamond that was on my vision board, that he had no idea about. We got married a day before I turned 30.'    

Jackie's admission comes after she made a surprise appearance on Real Housewives Of Sydney.

Having left RHOM back in 2020 after starring since 2014, Jackie was called in to offer her psychic and medium services to this season's Sydney cast.

The former reality star told news.com.au that she was encouraged to make her surprise cameo by current season cast member Terry Biviano.

'When I was asked by Terry to come on, she was like, ""Jackie, I want you to try and help this group because there's so much fracture in the group,""' she said.

'It was a no-brainer for me because I have been in this dynamic before.'

Jackie said she tried to lead the group to better themselves but 'a lot of ego' and 'a lot of jealousy towards some of the other ladies' among the cast.

'In the beginning, they were all willing, open and receptive, but it was almost like they were triggered by their experiences with whoever they've had those experience with – and it went like left field' she explained.

'It was gnarly. There's so much anger in this group'.

Jackie was asked if she would consider returning full time - and said she is absolutely up for getting the 'old school cast' back together.

'The fans want Real Housewives in Melbourne back, and I believe it's time to bring them back,' she said.

In 2020, Jackie announced she was quitting the show to focus on starting a family with her musician husband Ben Gillies, 45.

She told Stellar that she was confident in her decision to put a pause on the show and to grow their family in their hometown of Newcastle in NSW.

Jackie revealed to the publication that at the time, she was on fourth round of IVF and that she kept her treatments under wraps because she felt she'd be judged.

'Keeping it hidden meant I also wasn't being honest to who I am. And since I've started telling people, everyone has been so supportive,' the TV personality said.

She also revealed that her time in the South African jungle on Channel 10's I'm A Celebrity back in 2018 helped her realise she wanted to be a mother.

The medium added that while her physic abilities do not show her everything that will happen in life, she knew motherhood was for her.

'Do I know I'm definitely going to have children? From the depths of my heart, yes' she said.

'But what I haven't been prepared for is the way it was going to come' she said.

The pair welcomed twin boys, Bonham and Rocco, three years ago. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Humans have known the Earth is round for more than 2,000 years, but a movement questioning that fact has reached the corners of American politics.

People involved in politics in Alabama, Georgia and Minnesota have attracted attention for their links to the flat Earth movement, although their beliefs and reasoning vary.

To some, the beliefs have a spiritual connection. Others say they have a healthy skepticism of scientific consensus.

Data from a 2021 University of New Hampshire survey shows nearly 10% of Americans believe the Earth is flat, indicating how widespread pseudo-scientific conspiracy theories are emerging in the U.S.

Meanwhile, political observers have met the emergence of some flat Earth beliefs in politics with a mix of alarm and apathy.

Political candidates who believe the Earth is flat and other similar beliefs are ""consistent with the current dumbing down and anti-intellectualism of America,"" said James Taylor, a political science professor at the University of San Francisco. Taylor said these theories have thrived mostly due to the internet and social media compared to 20 years ago.

In Alabama, there's Dean Odle, a pastor who lost when he ran for governor in 2022, and is now seeking to become lieutenant governor next year. Odle, who describes himself as the ""Anti-estabishment Republican,"" told USA TODAY he became ""a flat-earth/biblical-earther believer"" in 2015, even attending the inaugural Flat Earth International Conference in 2017.

He cites his 2019 self-published book, titled ""Like Clay Under the Seal,"" saying his belief that the Earth is flat initially came as a ""spiritual download from the Holy Spirit."" Odle said he's aware of the flak he gets for his beliefs, but it won't stop him from running for office to try improving the state's low-ranking education status and stop the Second Amendment from being attacked.

""I typically refer to Article VI, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which says no religious tests should be put on a person as a qualification or disqualification to run for office,"" Odle said. ""What that means is we're all going to have different beliefs, but that doesn't mean we're unfit to protect the God-given constitutional rights of all Americans and Alabama residents.""

In Minnesota, Bret Bussman, an Army veteran who became Minnesota's 7th Congressional District Republican Party chair in March, has reportedly publicly shared videos on social media explaining why he believes the Earth is flat. That includes a 2024 Facebook post titled, ""5 Reasons Why I BELIEVE in the Flat Earth (And You Should Too!).""

When asked about his beliefs by the Minnesota Reformer in April, Bussman said, ""You can print whatever you want. I spent 20+ years in the Army defending that right, but if you do that, there would be no chance of me speaking with you in the future.""

(USA TODAY has reached out to Bussman for comment.)

And in Georgia, Kandiss Taylor, a former Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate and the state's current District 1 GOP Chair, has announced she's running for Congress in 2026. She faced scrutiny after interviewing two prominent flat Earth believers on a podcast two years ago, at one point saying:

""Everywhere there's globes. It's constant…and that's what they do to brainwash,"" Taylor said. ""For me, if it is not a conspiracy, if it is, you know, 'real,' why are you pushing so hard? Everywhere I go, every store, you buy a globe, there's globes everywhere—every movie, every TV show, news media. Why? It doesn't make sense.""

Taylor has since said she does not believe the Earth is flat, but that she remains skeptical.

""I will clearly state that I simply do not believe anything that I have not seen for myself,"" Taylor said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. ""With that being said, I will gladly take one of those 11-minute rocket flights to the stratosphere (Like Katy Perry did) and report back to the people what I see.""

In general, most flat-earthers believe Earth is a flat, hockey-puck-like object covered by a dome, sometimes called a firmament, with walls of ice around the edges of the dome. Flat-earthers think they can prove this because the seas appear level, not curved, and say it is not possible to view the Earth's curvature of the horizon from airplanes.

They also dispute photographic evidence from space, saying it cannot be trusted and that the NASA moon landing was a hoax.

Although some flat Earth believers have been active in politics, there's no evidence of an organized flat-earther movement in U.S. politics, political experts told USA TODAY.

""You're unlikely to have candidates openly saying they think the earth is flat because it sounds like a goofier position and a less widely held belief,"" said John Cluverius, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. ""I hesitate to think about this as a conspiracy theory as much as it is an anti-science belief that can be countered with scientific evidence.""

There's a common flat Earth error, popularized in the 19th century, suggesting that before scientific study began in the 17th century, most people believed the Earth was indeed flat.

However, ancient Greeks figured out the Earth was round around 500 B.C., and it's been commonly accepted by scholars, navigators and cartographers since.

The flat Earth belief as a conspiracy theory rose again in the mid-1800s in England. The Flat Earth Society was founded in 1956.

Then, flat-earthers had a resurgence in the 2010s as the rise of social media became a portal for conspiracy theorists, as James Taylor, the San Francisco political scientist, mentioned.

Elephants have the largest ears in the animal kingdom, and there's a practical reason for that.

Elephants are known for their intelligence, complex social behavior, memory and size, including their giant ears. The ears of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) can grow up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) long and 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, while Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) have slightly smaller and rounder ears.

That's about 17% of their body length, which means that while they're the animal with the largest ears, they're not actually the one with the largest ears relative to the size of their body. That award goes to the long-eared jerboa (Euchoreutes naso), but it's still impressive to have 6-foot-tall ears.

So why are elephants' ears so big? There's a practical reason for their large size, experts told Live Science: It keeps elephants cool.

An animal that big generates a lot of heat, especially in the hot savannas, forests and grasslands where they live. But unlike humans, elephants don't really sweat, William Sanders, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in fossil elephants, told Live Science. Instead, they have very little body hair and ""spectacular cooling devices"" — massive ears filled with large blood vessels that help the giant animals thermoregulate.

""When the animal gets really warm, it can force blood into its ears, and then it'll flap them,"" said Advait Jukar, an assistant curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Elephant ears have thin skin that is only millimeters thick and the blood vessels that pass through them are large, enabling elephants to move about 20% of their blood supply through their ears at any one time.

The larger the ears are, the more surface area they have to release heat into the surrounding air. Because the blood flowing through them is warmer than the air, the heat dissipates into the elephant's surroundings. Cooler blood then circulates back into the body, helping to reduce the animal's overall temperature, Jukar told Live Science. The animals can expand or constrict their blood vessels depending on whether it's cool or hot, which helps regulate their temperature

According to Jukar and Sanders, the fossil record supports this idea. Mammoths, which are relatives of modern elephants, first evolved in Africa. As they began moving into colder climates, their ears gradually became smaller, Jukar said.

""We know from mummified woolly mammoths in Siberia, for example, that they have very small ears compared to savanna African elephants,"" Sanders explained. ""It was more important that they had fur, right? They were woolly for a reason, and it's to maintain their body heat. So it's the other way around.""

While elephants likely have their big ears to keep themselves cool, their ears also have other uses. Some studies suggest that elephants use their ears to funnel sound waves, which can help them hear lower-frequency sounds. Elephants can also detect low-frequency vibrations through their feet, which have receptors called Pacinian corpuscles that can conduct the vibrations through their bodies. So, with their feet and massive ear bones combined, elephants can communicate over dozens of miles.

—What's the biggest group of animals ever recorded on Earth?

—Do elephant tusks or rhino horns ever grow back?

—Which animal has the largest head?

Their large ears help the highly social animals communicate with each other, Sanders said.

""They can't signal by waving their paws around, so they have to signal in other ways,” he said. Elephants that are going to charge will bring their ears forward and start moving them rapidly to appear larger, for example.

""That's a sign that they're really pissed off. And that's the time when you should be putting your car in reverse or should be vacating the area very quickly,"" he added.

Challenges in visual and spatial processing and a deficit in training data have revealed a surprising lack of timekeeping ability in AI systems


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


New research has revealed another set of tasks most humans can do with ease that artificial intelligence (AI) stumbles over — reading an analogue clock or figuring out the day on which a date will fall.

AI may be able to write code, generate lifelike images, create human-sounding text and even pass exams (to varying degrees of success) yet it routinely misinterprets the position of hands on everyday clocks and fails at the basic arithmetic needed for calendar dates.

Researchers revealed these unexpected flaws in a presentation at the 2025 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). They also published their findings March 18 on the preprint server arXiv, so they have not yet been peer-reviewed .

""Most people can tell the time and use calendars from an early age. Our findings highlight a significant gap in the ability of AI to carry out what are quite basic skills for people,"" study lead author Rohit Saxena, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said in a statement. These shortfalls must be addressed if AI systems are to be successfully integrated into time-sensitive, real-world applications, such as scheduling, automation and assistive technologies.""

To investigate AI's timekeeping abilities, the researchers fed a custom dataset of clock and calendar images into various multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which can process visual as well as textual information. The models used in the study include Meta's Llama 3.2-Vision, Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Google's Gemini 2.0 and OpenAI's GPT-4o.

And the results were poor, with the models being unable to identify the correct time from an image of a clock or the day of the week for a sample date more than half the time.

However, the researchers have an explanation for AI's surprisingly poor time-reading abilities.

""Early systems were trained based on labelled examples. Clock reading requires something different — spatial reasoning,"" Saxena said. ""The model has to detect overlapping hands, measure angles and navigate diverse designs like Roman numerals or stylized dials. AI recognizing that 'this is a clock' is easier than actually reading it.""

Dates proved just as difficult. When given a challenge like ""What day will the 153rd day of the year be?,"" the failure rate was similarly high: AI systems read clocks correctly only 38.7% and calendars only 26.3%.

This shortcoming is similarly surprising because arithmetic is a fundamental cornerstone of computing, but as Saxena explained, AI uses something different. ""Arithmetic is trivial for traditional computers but not for large language models. AI doesn't run math algorithms, it predicts the outputs based on patterns it sees in training data,"" he said. So while it may answer arithmetic questions correctly some of the time, its reasoning isn't consistent or rule-based, and our work highlights that gap.""

The project is the latest in a growing body of research that highlights the differences between the ways AI ""understands"" versus the way humans do. Models derive answers from familiar patterns and excel when there are enough examples in their training data, yet they fail when asked to generalize or use abstract reasoning.

""What for us is a very simple task like reading a clock may be very hard for them, and vice versa,"" Saxena said.

—Scientists discover major differences in how humans and AI 'think' — and the implications could be significant

—If any AI became 'misaligned' then the system would hide it just long enough to cause harm — controlling it is a fallacy

—Researchers gave AI an 'inner monologue' and it massively improved its performance

The research also reveals the problem AI has when it's trained with limited data — in this case comparatively rare phenomena like leap years or obscure calendar calculations. Even though LLMs have plenty of examples that explain leap years as a concept, that doesn't mean they make the requisite connections required to complete a visual task.

The research highlights both the need for more targeted examples in training data and the need to rethink how AI handles the combination of logical and spatial reasoning, especially in tasks it doesn't encounter often.

Above all, it reveals one more area where entrusting AI output too much comes at our peril.

""AI is powerful, but when tasks mix perception with precise reasoning, we still need rigorous testing, fallback logic, and in many cases, a human in the loop,"" Saxena said.

Follow:


            Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country favors negotiations with the United States to avoid war, but rejected what he described as threats by President Donald Trump.
    


            “We are not seeking war, we favor negotiation and dialogue, but we are not afraid of threats either, and we will in no way retreat from our legal rights,” Pezeshkian said at an event at the port city of Bandar Abbas Saturday.
    


            It's unclear what comments Pezeshkian was referring to, but Trump told reporters during a trip to the Middle East this week that Iran has to “move quickly” in the negotiations with the US or “something bad's gonna happen.”
    


            The US and Iran concluded Sunday their fourth round of talks in Oman, aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear ambitions and stopping its uranium enrichment program. A new round has not yet been announced.
    


            “No one but Trump himself believes his words against the Iranian nation,” Pezeshkian said. “On the one hand, he speaks of peace and stability and, on the other hand, he threatens (us) with the most sophisticated tools for homicide and with contradictory statements. He simultaneously sends messages of peace, bloodshed and insecurity.”
    


            Also on Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei referred to unspecified comments by Trump on Iran, calling them a “disgrace to the American nation” and “not worthy of a response at all.”
    


            Trump said Friday that the US had put forward a formal proposal for a nuclear deal, but Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said the same day that Iran had not received any such written proposals from Washington, either directly or indirectly.
    


            “There is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to (uranium) enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other (Non-Proliferation Treaty) signatories, too,” Araghchi said.
    


            In an interview with Breitbart last week, US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff said Iran's uranium enrichment program must be dismantled, though in an earlier interview with Fox News he had suggested that Iran could be allowed to enrich uranium to low levels.
    


            The most recent round of talks between the US and Iran, in the Omani capital Muscat, was described by the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson as “difficult.”
    


            A senior Trump administration official gave a more positive assessment, telling CNN the discussions, which lasted over three hours, were encouraging.



            During his Gulf tour, Trump repeatedly warned that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon, threatening to strike the country if it fails to reach a nuclear deal with the US. But he has not explicitly ruled out Iran enriching uranium. While enriched uranium can be used for peaceful purposes such as energy generation, it can be turned into a weapon if enriched to high levels.

NATO is urging Germany to significantly expand its military forces, Die Welt revealed on Saturday, citing sources. Officials in Berlin reportedly believe that the country, which is burdened by high dropout rates, will struggle to meet the proposed targets.As NATO members are poised to convene for the July summit in The Hague, discussions about increasing national defense spending to 5% of GDP – a target the US reportedly insists on – and expanding troop numbers are expected to loom large on the agenda.Germany, for its part, is facing “particular challenges,” including a proposal to increase the Bundeswehr's personnel to between 240,000 and 260,000 soldiers by 2030, an increase of up to 80,000 troops from current levels of around 183,000, according to Welt.

Difficulties with ballooning the military are exacerbated by high dropout rates among new recruits, with up to 30% leaving within the first six months, the paper says. Other factors contributing to attrition include harsh training, distant postings, and limited career prospects, as many potential soldiers view the private sector as a much more attractive option. In addition, some military branches reportedly resist accepting soldiers trained in other divisions.The German paper also warned that if the Bundeswehr attempts to adopt the new target, “the debate about reactivating conscription is likely to flare up,” and the recruitment effort could be quite unpopular.On Wednesday, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius signaled that if there are not enough volunteers Germany may need to revive conscription, which was abolished in 2011. In April, the Interior Ministry also proposed introducing civil defense lessons in schools to prepare students for potential crises and conflicts.

This comes as a number of Western officials have claimed that Russia could launch an attack on NATO within several years. Moscow has repeatedly denied having such plans, dismissing the speculation as “nonsense.”

ISTANBUL, May 17. /TASS/. The conflict in Ukraine cannot be resolved through military means - peace talks must be initiated and this opportunity should be seized, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his pool reporters.

""First of all, to put an end to the war, the parties must lay down arms and resort to diplomacy. Peace talks must begin, and the parties should not miss this opportunity. This war cannot be ended by military confrontation and weapons. Our greatest desire is to see a final result from the peace talks. Therefore, we are determined to continue our mediation role to end this war. We will make every effort to keep the channels of dialogue between the parties open and continue the talks,"" Anadolu Agency quoted the Turkish leader as saying.

Since the very beginning, we have made intensive efforts to stop this war. These talks, arranged through our initiatives, are an important step toward opening the door to peace. Turkey seeks a just and lasting peace. We are not only calling for an end to the war - we are also proposing methods and preparing the ground,"" Erdogan added.
