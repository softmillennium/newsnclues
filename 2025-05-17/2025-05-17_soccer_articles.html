Christian Richards played a pivotal role for Crystal Palace in its huge win. U.S. men's national team players Christian Richards and Matt Turner must be having the time of their lives right now as Crystal Palace captured its first major championship on Saturday. The London-based Premier League side defeated Manchester City, 1-0, to win the English FA Cup at Wembley Stadium. Turner, who backstopped three FA Cup matches this season, watched from the bench as an unused substitute. He produced clearance from the right end line that found Jean-Philippe Mateta at midfield. It was then left up to goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who was outstanding in the net as Man City lost in the cup final for the second consecutive time. Richards was outstanding, producing four blocked shots and a dozen clearances. He also won five duels and four out of five in the air and never was dribbled past once. His passing also was almost perfect, converting 14 of 17 attempts. City came close to knotting things up late in the first half. Palace defender Tyrick Mitchell tripped Bernardo Silva and referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Athletic's Adam Crafton is reporting that at the recent FIFA Congress, which took place this week in Paraguay, New Zealand has explored plans to partner with the United States and Fiji to bid for the 2038 World Cup. The 2030 World Cup is already confirmed for Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, while the 2034 World Cup will be in Saudi Arabia. That means for 2038, unless FIFA decides to change its bid procedure, only bids from Oceania and Concacaf will be accepted. Enter New Zealand, who co-hosted the 2023 Women's World Cup with Australia. However, with Australia being a part of the Asian Football Confederation, they are not allowed to band with their island neighbor to bid on 2038 with the confederation hosting in 2034. That is forcing New Zealand to get creative in exploring a possible bid. That creativity, according to Crafton's report, includes partnering with the United States and Fiji. NEW: Inside FIFA congress FIFA reduce Club World Cup prices again, many group games now available for $30 New Zealand target 2038 trans pacific World Cup, seeking co-hosts, which may mean USA + Fiji (!) Fiji has long wanted to build a stadium that they think would be capable of hosting big time matches, and it would add to New Zealand's potential plan for a 2038 World Cup that could have at least 48 teams but potentially 64. Part of those plans could also include hosting matches in Hawaii, who is building a new stadium to replace Aloha Stadium. The new stadium would be less than the old stadium's 50,000-seat capacity, but could be temporarily expanded for a World Cup. With both the men's and women's World Cups now at 48 teams and lots of serious chatter about expanding the men's tournament to 64 teams, FIFA has now created an issue that only some nations could bid for the World Cup without partnering with a co-host. That increases the complexity of the logistics for players, staff, and fans to get from one place to another. That includes visas, accommodations, and flights even before you get to the match tickets. A trans-Pacific World Cup would see teams and fans potentially flying 15 hours or more to get from a match in New Zealand to a match on the west coast of the United States, which means jet lag could be a major factor. For the USMNT, it would mean that after two rotations, they would once again automatically qualify for a World Cup as the co-hosts. There's also the possibility that FIFA could allow other nations from confederations that are technically excluded from consideration. Concacaf president and FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani has reportedly encouraged England to bid for the 2038 World Cup. An England bid, if allowed by FIFA, could be seen as a more popular option, especially if paired with another country. However, that feels unlikely given that Asia (Saudi Arabia) is hosting in 2034 and they won't allow a confederation to host two consecutive World Cups. There's a long way to go before FIFA decides on the 2038 World Cup. But, it's possible that American fans may once again have matches end up on our soil 13 years from now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trent Alexander-Arnold has given his approval to participate in the Club World Cup with Real Madrid. But one detail is still missing, Liverpool's approval. This is confirmed by diario AS, where they are practically certain that Arnold will play the Club World Cup with the merengue team. He is one of Xabi Alonso's great reinforcements. Especially when Liverpool is not participating in this competition. The English club insisted a lot on renewing him, but as soon as Real Madrid appeared, Arnold didn't hesitate. It is a huge step in his sports career to aspire to be among the greatest in history. At Real Madrid, they are very excited about this signing and the idea is to present him right after the season ends. First of all, the Madrid entity wants to finalize and confirm his participation in the Club World Cup. What they are clear about at Real Madrid is that there will be no problem with Liverpool. Despite any anger they may have with the player, they have maintained a great relationship for a long time. In the coming days, conversations will intensify to reach a final agreement so Arnold can be in the World Cup.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The drama began when The Athletic revealed last week that FIFA president Gianni Infantino would not be attending a scheduled in-person meeting of the FIFA Council in Paraguay on Tuesday, making it a virtual call and instead joining President Donald Trump on a visit to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. This rankled several members of the Council, but matters really blew up on Thursday morning when flight tracking data of a Qatari private jet travelling from Doha — via Lagos in Nigeria — showed that Infantino appeared to still be in the air to Paraguay, delaying the Congress by three hours. A UEFA statement chastised the late changes to timings and accused Infantino of making changes “for what appears to be simply accommodating private political interests”. Victor Montagliani, the FIFA vice-president and president of Concacaf, later said “two wrongs do not make a right” in response to UEFA's walk-out. This was just one flashpoint during what became a tricky week for FIFA in South America, and The Athletic was present, speaking to federations, stakeholders and insiders to uncover, among other matters: This summer's revamped and expanded FIFA Club World Cup tournament will see 32 teams from across the world compete to win a tournament hosted across 11 cities in the United States. In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA confirmed: “New batches of more affordable match tickets have been released this week on FIFA.com/tickets.” The organisation did not clarify what this new bracket refers to, but tickets on FIFA's partner Ticketmaster are now showing up as vastly reduced compared to the lowest prices that were available to fans earlier this year. For example, as of Friday morning, the lowest priced tickets for the following group stage matches involving major European sides were presenting lowest-priced options of $30 or less: Manchester City v Al Ain in Atlanta, Inter v Urawa Red Diamonds in Seattle, Paris Saint-Germain v Botafogo in Pasadena, Chelsea v Esperance de Tunis in Philadelphia. When demand is high, this can lead to prices skyrocketing, while when demand is low, it can work in the favour of the consumer and lead to lower prices. Some prices appear to have remained more resilient, particularly group games involving Real Madrid. Via general sale, the cheapest seat for their game against Saudi side Al Hilal is $194.38, while it is $101 against Mexican side Pachuca and $100 against Red Bull Salzburg, despite 20 sections of the stadium in Philadelphia showing 100+ seats remaining available for non-luxury seating. FIFA has been buoyed by the take-up for some games, such as Boca Juniors against Bayern Munich, which is scheduled for a Friday night in June at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. Other venues, most notably the 90,000-capacity Rose Bowl, are braced for lots of empty seats. FIFA recently announced it had gifted 30,000 tickets for matches in Los Angeles to first responders who fought the wildfires that recently devastated the region. There is some good news for fans, as supporters who acquired tickets via their club's allocation may be in line for partial reimbursements if prices for equivalent seating within stadiums have dropped since they first bought their tickets. FIFA is in contact with clubs to explore the possibility of partial refunds to supporters who bought tickets in the current and previous sales periods. Under FIFA's confederation rotation principle, two tournaments need to pass by before a single confederation is able to host a World Cup again. In 2030, three confederations are hosting the World Cup because FIFA has split the tournament between South America, Africa and Europe, playing games in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Morocco, Spain and Portugal. This rules out those four confederations, which leaves only Concacaf and Oceania as potential destinations for 2038. One federation has already made clear that it is interested in exploring hosting arrangements for the tournament, and that is New Zealand. Ordinarily, we might expect New Zealand to partner with neighbouring Australia, but Australia is part of the Asian confederation, which would rule it out of hosting in 2038 due to Saudi Arabia's host status for 2034. This leaves New Zealand, who co-hosted the 2023 women's World Cup with Australia, seeking more innovative options. During an extended interview with The Athletic in Paraguay, the New Zealand federation CEO Andrew Pragnell said: “It's clearly not realistic we could ever host one on our own. They're getting bigger and the capacity requirements are well known. But we are certainly capable of hosting a group and a couple of knockout games, so the key for us is partnership. What's really interesting is the way that 2030 is playing out, where you've got literally three confederations involved and crossing the globe. “But you'd like to think that given the philosophy of FIFA, which is about more distribution of wealth to more of the game, they'd go, ‘You in this small region can have a group stage and then relocate'. You could argue we could partner with anyone based on the 2030 model, but geographically, New Zealand looks two ways frequently in economic discussions — either as part of Asia or part of the wider Asia-Pacific region, so you look across to the west coast of the Americas.” He said no discussions with potential partners have yet taken place. A potential trans-Pacific World Cup could even hypothetically involve Hawaii. The 50,000-seater Aloha Stadium there is due to be demolished and a new stadium built — at a reduced capacity — so this hypothetical would require particular leniency from FIFA who usually want bigger stadia but as the tournament expands, it may be that a hot-ticket smaller venue has a role to play. Fiji, meanwhile, is also currently exploring building a stadium. President Infantino's adventures across the Middle East this week put European noses out of joint, and The Athletic also heard various whispers of increasingly disgruntled Canadians and Mexicans in the corridors of power within sport and politics. Infantino joined President Trump and the Qatari emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha. Not only did Infantino join them for a state banquet at Lusail Palace, but he also posted an image on Instagram of the emir presenting Trump with a ball from the 2022 edition of the men's World Cup in Qatar. One problem with that (or two): there are three hosts of the World Cup in 2026, because the tournament is being shared with Mexico and Canada, neither of which had representatives present in Doha. People briefed on FIFA's position pointed out this was not an official handover, but the optics did cause some consternation, particularly because Infantino's increasingly cosy relationship with the White House has produced some rather awkward moments for the two other hosts of FIFA's tournament for next summer. Remember, for example, how Infantino was seen laughing hysterically as Trump unveiled his plan to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America during his inauguration speech in January, or how Infantino stood next to Trump and smiled awkwardly as the U.S. president joked that trade wars with his neighbours would make the World Cup “more exciting”. Multiple people at the Congress in Paraguay told The Athletic that all of this has not gone down well with officials in Canada and Mexico. Infantino's involvements with Trump — and frequent Instagram posts thanking the U.S. president — have secured some wins so far for FIFA, notably in the establishment of a White House World Cup Task Force, while Trump also indicated last week that he was open to providing the security funding necessary to cover costs required for host cities during the tournament. JD Vance, the U.S. vice-president, last week said of fans travelling for the tournament: “We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game. But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. As for the apparent handover in Qatar, the Concacaf president, Montagliani, who is Canadian and also FIFA vice-president, sought to calm any tensions when asked if Canada and Mexico are receiving enough attention from FIFA's leadership.”From what I understand, it was a state issue, so it's up to Qatar and the U.S. to invite who they want to invite. It would be lovely to ask Infantino about any of this, but he did not do a press conference for media at the Congress — for the second year in a row — and left the mixed zone scrum for his vice-presidents and general secretary to endure. Alejandro Dominguez, CONMEBOL president and FIFA vice-president, was one of the headline speakers. The 2030 tournament will include a game each for Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, but it would appear that CONMEBOL would like to have more games to host, and rather than taking them away from Spain, Portugal or Morocco, the plan by Dominguez is to simply expand the tournament from 48 teams (which will happen for the first time in 2026) to 64. Dominguez did not mention 64 teams during his speech at the FIFA Congress this week, but he did urge the room to think differently about a big centenary celebration. Dominguez added: “I would like to invite you to reflect together so we can do something that the world is waiting for, that the football community deserves. It is what football teaches us — to play as a team.” And I want to underline the words of Alejandro in this speech. He told all of us to think on how we can really celebrate it in the way it deserves to be celebrated. We haven't even kicked the ball for 48, and obviously they can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beppe Bergomi feels that Napoli are “under pressure” while Inter Milan “have the wind in their sails” in the Serie A title race. The legendary former Nerazzurri captain and 1982 World Cup winner with Italy gave his thoughts on the title race in today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews. There are now just two matches to go in the Serie A title race. Therefore, it will go down to the wire, without question. And the question of momentum could prove to be crucial. Particularly considering that Napoli dropped points against Genoa last weekend. Beppe Bergomi writes that “It's impossible to say exactly what will happen in this round of fixtures.” “In any event, this will be an unpredictable weekend for everyone,” Bergomi continues. “But it's obvious that the pressure they're under is increasing.” “Meanwhile, Inter suddenly have the wind in their sails.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of speculation, it was confirmed earlier in the month that Alexander-Arnold will depart Anfield this summer, upon the expiration of his contract. He said: "This is easily the hardest decision I've ever made in my life. It is widely expected that Alexander-Arnold will join Spanish giants Madrid on a free transfer upon leaving Liverpool. As things stand, Alexander-Arnold's contract with Liverpool is set to expire on June 30. However, Madrid would like him to join the club before that, as the FIFA Club World Cup is set to begin on June 15. In order for that to happen, it has been reported that the two clubs could discuss a fee for Alexander-Arnold's early release. Now, as reported by Spanish news outlet Diario AS, via Madrid Zone on social media, Madrid will pay Liverpool €2 million for Alexander-Arnold and he will join the club before the start of the FIFA Club World Cup. Fabrizio Romano wrote on social media: "Real Madrid have offered €2M to Liverpool for Trent to play at the Clubs World Cup, reports Diario AS." Reacting to the boos, Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah was left unimpressed. He said: "I think somehow the fans were being harsh with him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles FC will host Mexico's América on May 31 in their Club World Cup qualification playoff, FIFA finalized on Friday. León broke tournament integrity rules being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca. FIFA announced the date and venue 10 days after León's appeal against expulsion was lost at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. LAFC's 22,000-seat home BMO Stadium - next to the LA Memorial Coliseum and shared with Angel City - will stage the game at 7:30 p.m. local time. That is several hours after the Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. The Club World Cup entry for LAFC or América is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA for a CONCACAF region team, plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament. FIFA planned the LAFC-América game in March after first ruling to expel León, which qualified by winning the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League. It was unclear why América - one of Mexico's best-supported teams - is eligible when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the four-year qualifying period through 2024. Mexico already has Pachuca and Monterrey in the tournament that has been heavily promoted by FIFA President Gianni Infantino with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has said he will attend the July 13 final at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to present the gold trophy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both men have much at stake as the World Cup heads to North America next year, with the potential for President Donald Trump's immigration policies to chill international attendance. DOHA, Qatar — As President Donald Trump drove to a palace here the other night, he passed by a gleaming and glittery Lusail Stadium, the crown jewel of the sports complexes built to host what would become an electrifying 2022 World Cup final. As they had dinner, Trump again called out for him. When he left, Infantino was there once more. There may be other reasons for the genuine affection between Trump and Infantino. There is an aspect of Trump's foreign policy approach that aligns with FIFA's president. They want to expand global reach with glitz and glamour, and they are willing to stretch ethical boundaries and turn a blind eye to autocrats who crack down on their populations. FIFA has approached the world much like Trump has — in a transactional way that can elevate countries with questionable records in human rights. Russia was picked to host the 2018 World Cup, and Infantino accepted high honors from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Qatar relied heavily on migrant labor to remake its capital and construct gleaming stadiums from scratch. Saudi Arabia, widely condemned for its own human rights abuses, including the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, will host in 2034. Trump has likewise looked the other way in his dealings in the Middle East this week, notably with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the CIA concluded had ordered Khashoggi's death. Trump instead focused on one of the things that unites them all: World Cup hosting duties. “It's going to be really exciting next year.” Trump and Infantino share ties dating back years. “President Trump is definitely a sportsman,” Infantino said. He wants to show who is the best.” Infantino came to Trump's inauguration, and he has also visited the White House. Much is on the line for Trump and Infantino — including whether the president's crackdown on immigrants will chill international attendance. There have also been concerns about whether the United States would grant visas for foreigners to come and support their countries in what is normally an event marked by its global flavor and fervent support. The Trump administration has not exactly signaled a welcoming tone. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home.” He rescheduled several events of his organization's governing body in Paraguay and then still arrived late. The episode triggered protests from several high-ranking members. Infantino has defended his relationship with Trump, which he said is critical to put on a smooth World Cup next year. He apologized to the forum for being late. “Some important World Cup discussions took place, and I needed to be there to represent football and all of you,” he said of the Middle East trip. “We had an issue with our flight, which made this delay happen — apologies, sorry, and I am looking forward to spending time with you here.” The mood was demonstrably brighter a few nights earlier in Doha. At the center was a stand holding an official World Cup ball from 2022. Trump arrived and held the ball aloft proudly.</p>
