Despite withholding pre-release RTX 5060 drivers from reviewers, Nvidia has reportedly given select outlets access to its upcoming RTX 5060 driver to create strict "preview" articles about the new mid-range Blackwell GPU. One such outlet, Ascii.jp, published an article benchmarking the RTX 5060 against the RTX 5060 Ti (8GB and 16GB) and other graphics cards in Doom: The Dark Ages, Cyberpunk 2077, and Marvel Rivals. GameStar Tech claims there are strict Nvidia guidelines for the RTX 5060 previews. According to the German publication (machine translation), "The reason for this unusual situation: Nvidia has decided to only make the driver, which is essential for GPU testing, available in advance under certain conditions and to a very limited number of media outlets worldwide. The news outlet goes on to state, "What's particularly crucial is that we weren't able to freely choose which graphics cards and games we would measure and with which settings for this preview." The list of allowed titles is reportedly limited to Avowed, Doom: The Dark Ages, Marvel Rivals, Cyberpunk 2077, and Hogwarts Legacy. Meanwhile, the settings must be configured to 1080p resolution, ultra image quality, DLSS in quality mode, and ray tracing. Surprisingly, Ascii's RTX 5060 "preview" only included Doom: The Dark Ages, Cyberpunk 2077, and Marvel Rivals. Graphics settings were also limited to running frame generation exclusively, with the RTX 3060 and RTX 2060 running FSR 3 frame generation (since they don't support the DLSS counterpart). Across all three titles, the new RTX 5060 trails the RTX 5060 Ti by 15% on average using 2x DLSS frame generation. If it wasn't obvious, take these results with a massive grain of salt. Frame generation is not a perfect multiplier of native performance, so there is bound to be a bit of variance between all six GPUs. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti comparisons can be taken with more weight since they rely on the same GPU architecture and use identical frame generation techniques. We wouldn't be surprised if the performance difference between the two GPUs is very similar with frame generation turned off. The RTX 3060 and RTX 2060 exclusively used FSR 3 frame generation, with no notes on whether or not the two GPUs used FSR 3 upscaling. This time, DLSS upscaling was used on the RTX 3060 and 2060 in conjunction with FSR 3 frame generation (though there are no notes on what version of DLSS was used on these GPUs). This is the first time Nvidia has greenlit a "preview" of its future GPU products. Traditionally, reviewers are given one to two weeks (sometimes more) with a pre-release driver to create a review of a future Nvidia GPU that will go live before the GPU launches. For the RTX 5060, Nvidia has opted to stop reviewers from starting their GPU testing until launch day (May 19) when the card releases, forcing reviewers to publish their reviews days after the RTX 5060 release. In the meantime, Nvidia is using "preview" articles to stir hype for its upcoming mid-range GPU.

Good news is that Seagate has replenished its stock and the timing could not be more opportune: the 22TB drive is now available for a record low price tag of just $249, which is a massive discount from its usual $599 retail price. This is a record-low for an external drive of this enormous size, but it also trumps most other players and even used internal drives on sale. You can get it for $249.99, and you're only paying approximately $11.36 per terabyte while the 24TB comes out to approximately $13.75 per TB. This Seagate external hard drive features USB 3.0 connectivity for fast data transfer and comes loaded with Seagate's Rescue Data Recovery Services which offers peace of mind should there be involuntary loss of data. Putting this offer into context with cloud storage services sheds its price into even sharper perspective: Professional cloud storage services generally charge monthly or yearly fees which can mount in no time. To put it in perspective, maintaining 22TB or more in the cloud often costs hundreds of dollars a year, and that's just for standard access. Within two years, the total cost of cloud storage far surpasses the initial price of a high-capacity external hard drive. Furthermore, with physical storage like the Seagate HDD, your data is entirely in your control, with no concern over account hacks, service outages, or terms-of-service changes. The reality that the 20TB and 22TB models haven't been available for days is evidence of how rapidly smart buyers are snapping up these deals. Whatever the reason of this external hard drive discounts, consumers stand to benefit: If you've been waiting for the right moment to expand your local storage whether for backups, media libraries or professional archives, this is a rare opportunity that Amazon offers you.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Lunar Lake unequivocally shook the market by blending an ultra-efficient design typically seen in Arm-based SoCs with the established foundation of x86. The result is extremely similar to that of Arm-based alternatives from Qualcomm while efficiently trading blows with Apple Silicon. Innovation isn't free, however, as Lunar Lake-powered laptops still hover in the four-figure territory. Even ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger characterized Lunar Lake as "a one-off" design, which explains why Intel's leaked roadmaps do not mention a successor. Despite sharing the same core microarchitectures and process node as Arrow Lake, Intel took a completely different development approach with Lunar Lake. The TSMC N3B fabbed Compute Tile hosts four Lion Cove-based Performance (P) cores, sharing 12MB of L3 cache, with 2.5MB of private L2 cache per P-core. As opposed to Arrow Lake, the Skymont-based efficiency core cluster (E) doesn't share the same L3 cache pool, but sits on a "Low Power Island" with its own dedicated L2 cache (4MB). Next to E-cores is the NPU (Neural Processing Unit), which is believed to have six NCE (Neural Compute Engines) for almost 48 TOPS of AI performance. The Compute Tile is also home to a Battlemage-based integrated GPU with up to eight Xe2-LPG cores and the Media Engine. Intel has essentially packed all key processing elements on one chiplet, significantly reducing inter-die communication's latency and power consumption. All these chiplets are hosted atop a 22FFL-based active interposer, connected via Intel's Foveros 3D packaging technology. These are just the chip's overall specifications; the precise arrangement varies, as it's impossible to know how Intel has laid out all these components without help from an engineer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Y Combinator-backed startup Firecrawl is back on the hunt for AI agent employees. As we reported back in February, its first attempt didn't yield an AI worth hiring. But it's now placed three new ads on YC's job board for “AI agents only” and has set aside a $1 million budget total to make it happen. Firecrawl offers a web crawling tool that scrapes data from websites for LLMs. This is, Peffer admits, a shady part of the AI ecosystem where bad behaving web crawlers can sometimes pound websites like DDoS attacks. But Firewcrawl has gained popularity by trying to bring in some guardrails, he says. Additionally, the tool honors robot.txt settings and can be set to only scrape a public website once and share the data with others. Consequently, one job opening is for a content creation agent “that never sleeps and always ships” that will autonomously produce “high quality” SEO-pleasing blog posts and tutorials on how to use its product, the startup's ad says. In other words: the agent should decide what to create, create it, post it, measure the audience, and grow mastery from that feedback, autonomously. The company is also looking for a customer support engineer agent that will be tasked with crafting the AI workflow that responds to customer issues within two minutes and can handle tickets on its own, knowing when to escalate to a human. The third opening is for a junior developer agent who'll be tasked with prioritizing incoming Github issues, writing documentation and writing code in TypeScript and Go. But here's the catch: Firecrawl is also hoping to hire human creator or creators behind these bots — and the $1 million budget is for hiring both agents and humans, though it's not clear how many years the budget is supposed to cover. The startup might hire the humans full time, or as contractors (which might make more sense if they're creating lots of agents for lots of companies). Firecrawl is also entertaining bids from other startups that specialize in creating the types of agents that it's looking for, say in customer service, Peffer says. ”The future, what we see, is a world where the next 10x engineers are operating armies of agents, AI systems that they're building, maintaining, and monitoring.

Photographs of a cancelled AMD RX 7000-series prototype have reportedly surfaced on X. When tested using GPU-Z, it was shown to have 6GB of memory with a 96-bit bus, 1,536 shading units, and 64 ROPs. By comparison, the AMD Radeon RX 7600 has 8GB of GDDR6 memory with a 128-bit bus, 2,048 shading units, and 64 ROPs. After all, it's unlikely that AMD will release an XT version of a base-spec GPU.

The unearthed card seems like a competitor to Nvidia's most affordable GPU offering. If Team Green released an RTX 4050 6GB, this GPU would probably comfortably land within the same performance and price bracket. However, because the RTX 4050 desktop GPU never arrived, AMD apparently thought it did not make sense to make an alternative to something that does not exist. Even the 8GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti has been significantly falling behind its 16 GB brother, even encountering performance issues when attached to a PCIe 4.0 slot. So, if AMD released this GPU for the masses, it would only cause pain and misery to penny-pinching gamers. This is likely because it lacks a proper driver, which is hindering the PC from fully utilizing what little muscle it has. This is an interesting view of what could have been AMD's last sub-$200 GPU, but I still think we should leave it and its 6GBs of VRAM in the past.

Many of us are primarily laptop users. It's comfortable to work from the couch, bring it to a coffee shop, or always have it with you when traveling for either work or leisure. However, a docking station allows you to open up possibilities with a larger work space when needed. And right now, this 14-in-2 USB-C docking station for MacBook is on sale for 70% off at Amazon: That brings it down from $99 to just $29. But the deal doesn't end there. That brings the price to just $19, which is saving you a full 80% on your purchase on Amazon. Sure, it feels fine to work just with the laptop alone but we deserve better than fine: sometimes it's better to have a fully robust workstation. This is great for viewing multiple tabs at once or for gaming or video editing. I have a mechanical keyboard with raised, clicky-clacky keys which I find much more satisfying to type on than the flat keypad of my laptop. The speakers on my desk are louder and deeper than the ones built-into my computer. My laptop simply does not support all of those at once on its own. This 14-in-2 USB-C docking station is compatible with all MacBooks. That's a lot of compatibility you're opening up your laptop to. Amazon has reduced the price of this docking station to just $19 for a limited time, make sure you grab yours. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the Wall Street Journal, more than three dozen people who have either worked under or are associates of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have been placed in roles at federal agencies that oversee the businesses of their Silicon Valley bosses. Per WSJ, at least 18 federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Labor, Treasury Department, and Department of Defense, all employ at least one person with ties to one of Trump's four favorite tech bros. Musk's network is the most robust, with connections now occupying more than a dozen agencies. The WSJ found that companies founded, owned, or invested in by Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey have already snagged about $6 billion worth of federal contracts just since Donald Trump took office. And while some of the bidding process started before Trump's second term began, those companies are currently pitching themselves for many more contracts worth billions of dollars and will likely find themselves with a leg up in the procurement process. There have been some high-profile wins for these companies in that time. Palmer's Anduril Technologies took over a government contract originally awarded to Microsoft to build mixed-reality goggles for the Army, which could ultimately pay out $22 billion. Musk's SpaceX scored $5.9 billion to launch Space Force missions. Thiel's Palantir got tapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to build software for deportation processing. That's a solid payout for the billionaires, who have poured their own money into Trump's campaigns. Musk spent $290 million on the project of getting Trump back to the White House, while Andreessen gave at least $2.5 million, and Luckey gave at least $400,000. Thiel, unlike these more recently Trump-curious opportunistic ghouls, has been a long-time Trump backer and gave around $1.5 million to Trump-related groups going back to the 2016 election. It's hard to say some of those cuts didn't seem at least in part targeted. Staffers at the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration who were researching the safety of self-driving technology like Tesla's FSD were forced out, too. Trump has always claimed his goal was to drain the swamp. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. In an open letter, the senators expressed concerns that the Trump administration may be offering countries tariff relief if they do business with Elon Musk. Trump called former FBI Director James Comey a "dirty cop" and said he would leave it up to his underlings. Comey wrote "86 47," which the MAGA cult took as a death threat. The billionaire's social media site is awash in extremist content from sanctioned terrorist groups, a report claims. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Global Accessibility Awareness Day was Thursday, so it's fitting that both Apple and Google have announced a raft of new accessibility features for their devices this week, all slated to land in the coming year. This is integrated with Accessibility Reader, so you can use your iPhone camera to zoom in on a distant whiteboard or sign and magnify it on your MacBook screen, tweak contrast and colors to make it more legible, or extract the text into your preferred format. For deaf and hard-of-hearing people, Apple has beefed up Live Listen by adding Live Captions support and extending it to the Apple Watch. You can use your iPhone's microphone to boost audio for AirPods or hearing aids with Live Listen, but with Live Captions, you can get instant transcription on your wrist. The Apple Watch can also serve as a remote control for capture, so you can leave your iPhone close to the speaker (ideal for a meeting, classroom, or lecture hall). Other noteworthy additions include Braille Access, which turns your Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Vision Pro) into a braille note taker, enhanced eye and head tracking for iPhone and iPad, plus new Accessibility Nutrition Labels in the App Store, which will allow people to see at a glance what accessibility features an app or game supports. You can find the full list on Apple's website. Google's accessibility update focuses in on existing Android and Chrome features, as well as some new ones aimed at Chromebooks in the classroom. The relentless drive of AI has seen Google's Gemini enhance several existing services like Android's Talkback screen reader, which offers AI-generated descriptions of images for low-vision and blind folks. Page Zoom has also been improved for Chrome on Android, so you can increase text size without affecting the webpage layout and customize your preferred zoom levels for different pages, bringing it into line with Chrome on desktop. For students using Chromebooks in the classroom, Google has enabled hands-free navigation with Face control, which uses the webcam to track facial movements. The caret browsing setting enables folks with visual impairment to navigate and interact with web pages using a keyboard instead of a mouse. ChromeVox is a built-in screen reader that can read onscreen text aloud and will soon be able to output audio captions in braille when the Chromebook is connected to a braille display. Chrome also now features more natural-sounding voices for text-to-speech. Finally, the College Board's Bluebook testing app (where students can take the SAT and Advanced Placement exams) can access all of Google's built-in accessibility features, including ChromeVox, Dictation, and the College Board's digital testing tools. Ever since Sonos bungled its app update last year, Sonos stans have been clamoring for a whole-home streaming alternative that reliably works. I've been enjoying the company's streaming player and stand-alone streaming speaker for months, with no issues playing music in different zones, starting Spotify jams with my wife on her phone and me on mine, and generally imbuing our home with music. WiiM's latest is a smart speaker and wireless subwoofer that can take your system to the next level. The speaker, called the Sound, looks remarkably familiar to anyone who has seen an Apple HomePod and features a small, round display on the front to help you know when it's listening (and what is playing). The subwoofer adds a bit of low-end extension and should be great for folks who want to use this system to fuel a dance party. In addition to the two speakers, WiiM also announced a new streaming amp called the Amp Ultra which features a touchscreen and large physical volume knob. It looks like a great, affordable competitor to options from Cambridge Audio, Naim, and others. This amp has a dedicated subwoofer output and HDMI, so you can use it and your new subwoofer with your TV too. Sony hasn't sold an Xperia smartphone in the US for two years, which doesn't seem to be changing with the new Xperia 1 VII. For example, the new Xperia adds an artificial intelligence-powered Auto Framing mode to recognize humans during video capture—it records the whole scene, but it'll also provide a cropped close-up view of the person, so you can intermix footage despite using one camera. The phone's speakers have also been upgraded, with better treble and mid-bass output. Nothing announced this week that it is working with British hi-fi wizards KEF on “several acoustically co-developed” audio products that it said are already in progress and launching later this year. A few days later, it dropped a video on its YouTube channel announcing it was releasing its first pair of over-ear headphones this summer. Some of the things the designers seem keen to address in the forthcoming cans include a better, easier-to-use design, more interesting and unique features, and a cheaper price than comparable headphones—all with a “better than AirPods Max” performance. That's helped by a number of features—the acrylic platter and chassis aim to provide top-notch resonance control and minimize unwanted vibrations, there's an optical speed sensor positioned under the spindle for ensuring the most accurate playback speeds, and an external power supply to prevent any electrical interference affecting the turntable's sensitive audio components. The AT-LPA2 will also come fitted with Audio-Technica's well-regarded AT-OC9XEN dual moving coil cartridge alongside a newly designed straight carbon-fiber tonearm and adjustable anti-skate mechanism. It runs Huawei's HarmonyOS but also works with Huawei's app on Android or iOS to bring notifications to your wrist (there's even an eSIM option). It boasts solid health and fitness tracking, partly thanks to a pressure sensor you can press with your other fingertip for ECG and PPG measurements, making it easy to track your heart health and blood oxygen levels. (You can get around a week with it off.) With a rectangular design reminiscent of the Apple Watch, they mix sapphire glass and an aluminum body with a titanium alloy bezel. Both are solid fitness trackers, but the svelte (9.3-mm) 4 Pro adds water sports tracking and a new Air Pressure Sensor. Neither requires daily charging, and they are relatively affordable. Huawei also announced open-fit earbuds, the FreeBuds 6 and the MatePad Pro 12.2-inch 2025, an OLED tablet that can be paired with Huawei's Glide Keyboard. French retro tech brand Rewind is releasing a boombox to sit alongside its excellent Walkman-style portable cassette player. It's a single-deck device with clean lines that showcase two bright, backlit VU meters. There are four speakers onboard, with the company aiming for a neutral sound rather than an 1980s-style bass monster. The GB-001 will also function as a Bluetooth speaker and has battery power. Google I/O, the annual developer conference where we learn what's new from the search giant, kicks off on May 20 in Mountain View, California. That includes a new design language for Android and an expansion of the Gemini assistant onto new platforms like Wear OS and Android Auto. Android is also getting some fancy new security and privacy boosts. For example, Google is expanding its Scam Detection AI tool in the Google Messages app to flag more types of digital fraud, and there's a new Advanced Protection mode in Android 16 that offers extra security for at-risk users.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sonali De Rycker,  a general partner at Accel and one of Europe's most influential venture capitalists, is bullish about the continent's prospects in AI. But she's wary of regulatory overreach that could hamstring its momentum. Europe's complex regulatory landscape and, in part, its pioneering but controversial Artificial Intelligence Act. Still, she said she worries that the AI Act's broad reach and potentially stifling fines could deter innovation at the very moment European startups need space to iterate and grow. “The issue is that we are also faced with headwinds on regulation.” With U.S. support for Europe's defense and economic autonomy waning under the current Trump administration, De Rycker sees this moment as a decisive one for the EU. “If we were truly one region, the power you could unleash would be incredible,” she said. “We wouldn't be having these same conversations about Europe lagging in tech.” Cities like Zurich, Munich, Paris, and London are starting to generate their own self-reinforcing ecosystems thanks to top-tier academic institutions and a growing base of experienced founders. Accel, for its part, has invested in over 70 cities across Europe and Israel, giving De Rycker a front-row seat to the continent's fragmented but flourishing tech landscape. Still, on Tuesday night, she noted a stark contrast with the U.S. when it comes to adoption. “We see a lot more propensity for customers to experiment with AI in the U.S.,” she said. Meanwhile, U.S investors are “spending money on these kinds of speculative, early-stage companies. Accel, whose London team closed their newest fund with $650 million last year, can afford to lean in a bit more than many other regional players. “We feel very comfortable with the application layer,” said De Rycker. “These foundational models are capital intensive and don't really look like venture-backed companies.” De Rycker (who dodged questions about Accel's reported talks with another big name in AI), sees these as early examples of how AI can create entirely new behaviors and business models. If Europe leans too heavily into regulation, it risks stifling the innovation that could help it compete globally – not just in AI, but across the entire tech spectrum. With geopolitical uncertainty rising and the U.S. increasingly looking inward, Europe has little choice but to bet on itself. On Tuesday, asked by one attendee of the event what EU founders can do to be more competitive with their U.S. counterparts, she didn't hesitate. “I think they are [competitive],” she said, citing companies Accel has backed, including Supercell and Spotify. She's also the founder of StrictlyVC, a daily e-newsletter and lecture series acquired by Yahoo in August 2023 and now operated as a sub brand of TechCrunch.
