                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The best crypto coins typically offer distinct features, strong market performance, or a combination of both. According to experts, JetBolt (JBOLT), Sui (SUI), and Solana (SOL) are the top 3 cryptos gaining momentum amid a recovering crypto market. JetBolt boasts zero-gas technology and an ongoing presale that has hit its new milestone of selling over 353 million tokens so far. Meanwhile, Sui is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems, and Solana offers a high-speed blockchain. Our team of analysts dug deep to uncover why large buyers are intently watching these top 3 cryptos. JetBolt (JBOLT) is one of the best crypto coins crypto whales are crazy about, as evidenced by its presale's rapidly rising token sales. Since the presale began, JetBolt has already sold in excess of 353 million tokens. Fueling whale interest in JetBolt are its revolutionary features, like zero-gas technology. Powered by the Skale network, JetBolt eliminates gas fees typically associated with blockchain transactions. Large buyers are clearly drawn to JetBolt's frictionless crypto-staking platform. In addition to a user-friendly token staking interface, participants can enjoy extra rewards when they stake JBOLT tokens and simultaneously interact with friends on the platform. This innovative tool delivers snippets of crypto news and insights about top cryptocurrencies. While its presale is in full swing, JetBolt offers exciting perks for early buyers. Although still in its presale phase, JetBolt's high-tech features and generous bonuses continue to magnetize crypto whales, making it one of the hottest cryptos today. Thanks to its unique object-centric data model and the Move programming language, the Sui network is an ideal platform for a wide range of blockchain applications. With an infrastructure powered by cutting-edge tech like Move and a DAG-based consensus model, Sui efficiently addresses these challenges. Chart demonstrating SUI's price action over the past month, sourced from CoinGecko Sui's recent collaboration with Bitlayer caught the market's attention. In fact, over the past month, SUI has gained 86.4%. With such strong momentum and standout features as a Layer-1 blockchain, it's no surprise that Sui is one of the best crypto coins crypto whales are crazy about. Its network supports a wide range of blockchain applications and other Web3 projects. These meme coins have previously helped SOL rally—and they're doing it again. Recently, the stellar market performance of popular Solana meme coins like Fartcoin, Pudgy Penguins, and Moo Deng helped SOL gain 15.5% over the past two weeks. Its compelling attributes make Solana one of the best cryptocurrencies that crypto whales can't take their eyes off. Based on data gathered by market experts, JetBolt, Sui, and Solana are the top 3 cryptos, making them strong contenders that crypto whales may be closely watching to acquire right now. Experts identify JetBolt, Sui, and Solana as the top 3 trending crypto coins due to their impressive price performance and recent remarkable milestones. JetBolt is on experts' shortlists of the best cryptos to buy right now, thanks to its explosive presale and advanced features like zero-gas technology and an AI-powered crypto tool.

MiCA sets a clear regulatory framework, ensuring that ICOs are conducted transparently and securely. But what does this mean for investors, startups, and the global crypto market? In this article, we'll explore MiCA's impact on ICOs, key provisions, obligations, and how it's reshaping the industry with fresh 2025 statistics. Its primary objective is to create a harmonized regulatory environment for crypto-assets while fostering innovation and protecting investors. Since its partial implementation in 2024, MiCA has already started reshaping the European crypto landscape, bringing stability and trust to ICOs. Under MiCA, an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is defined as the public sale of newly issued crypto-assets to investors in exchange for funds, typically cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. Unlike traditional ICOs, which operated in a legal gray area, MiCA enforces strict rules to ensure accountability. Every ICO whitepaper must be approved by regulators before launching, and issuers are required to provide proof of financial stability. With MiCA now in full force, ICOs are becoming more structured, transparent, and trusted, setting a new global standard for crypto fundraising. MiCA has introduced a well-defined regulatory structure for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), aimed at protecting investors and ensuring transparency. MiCA imposes strict obligations on ICO issuers to ensure transparency, investor protection, and financial stability. These obligations set clear expectations for companies looking to raise funds through ICOs. By enforcing these obligations, MiCA is setting global benchmarks for ICO transparency and investor confidence. MiCA not only regulates the launch of ICOs but also governs how these crypto-assets are listed on exchanges. Compliance is required for both issuers and exchanges, ensuring seamless integration into financial markets. As we move through 2025, new trends are emerging that highlight how MiCA is influencing the crypto-funding ecosystem. These trends signal a maturing ICO ecosystem, where investor protection and long-term project viability are the key drivers of success. MiCA's impact on ICOs in Europe has made waves worldwide, influencing global regulatory trends and market activity. These figures highlight Europe's leadership in ICO regulation, setting a precedent for global markets to follow. While challenges exist, MiCA opens the door to new opportunities for ICOs in 2025: These developments indicate that MiCA is influencing global crypto regulations, reinforcing Europe's leadership in blockchain legislation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use cookies to improve your experience. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is preparing to take legal steps against individuals alleging that he manipulated the blockchain to take control of 318 million ADA tokens. The accusations, which recently emerged on the social media platform X, suggest he used his Genesis keys in 2021 to seize funds belonging to early investors. It then rerouted those tokens to Cardano's reserves. “In 2021, the Cardano ‘Allegra' Hard Fork (HF) wasn't just a routine upgrade. Alexander claimed that although they intended to reissue the funds to their rightful owners, they allegedly withheld a large portion. Most of the tokens, he alleged, were staked to generate an estimated 25 million ADA in additional rewards. “Only a tiny fraction went to Intersect… Where did the VAST majority of that ₳318 MILLION actually go after being moved from reserves? Separately, the funds were staked, earning 25m additional,” Alexander alleged. In addition, Alexander criticized the lack of clear documentation on the fund's path, suggesting there is no verifiable audit trail. Ironically, Charles recently emphasized needing community input for scaling solutions, citing the importance of governance.Yet, when ₳318M was at stake, he acted unilaterally via genesis keys to alter the ledger and control these funds.Interesting. However, Hoskinson has strongly rejected the allegations. The Cardano founder explained that these assets were transferred to a custodial account managed by the Token Generation Event (TGE). This account continued processing redemptions for three years. They were rolled into a custodial account controlled by the TGE that then continued redemption for 3 more years to distribute the genesis funds to the original buyers,” he said. While the Cardano team has not released a full public report, Hoskinson noted that the redemption process is still ongoing. He warned that he will sue Alexander and others who repeat the claims if they keep alleging that Input Output Global stole funds. “As we are now considering litigation against those slandering us, we will make no further statements until the closing report is published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's Dominance Is Falling—But Don't Count on Altcoin Season Yet, Analysts Say But that doesn't mean “altcoin season” is around the corner, according to analysts. “When markets are focused on macroeconomic instability and risks to the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin's dominance will likely rise,” Zach Pandl, head of research for crypto asset manager Grayscale, told Decrypt. Bitcoin dominance markers vary in how many coins they track, but they consistently show BTC at a four-year high compared to either major altcoins or the entire field. Earlier this month, Bitcoin dominance reached 64.89% on that chart, representing its highest level since January 2021. CoinGecko data, by comparison, shows Bitcoin dominance at 60.4% compared to all other tracked coins on the market. Ethereum was among digital assets crushed by Trump's initial efforts to reshape global trade, with its price plummeting 45% in the first quarter and slipping below $1,500 in April, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Bitcoin has benefited from its portrayal as a non-sovereign asset like gold, while absorbing the bulk of capital flows into crypto through products like exchange-traded funds—which were approved last year—said Pandl. During previous market cycles, Bitcoin's dominance has fallen after its price peaks and traders rotate funds into altcoins that are further out on the risk curve—that was once the industry's prevailing mythos, at least. It's a tough call, he added, considering Bitcoin and altcoin have distinct tailwinds that could both be in play. Juan Leon, senior investment strategist for crypto asset manager Bitwise, told Decrypt that Bitcoin's falling dominance reflects investors' increased risk appetite. Trump's 90-day tariff pause, combined with lower inflation, is easing broader concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, while lifting hopes of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, he said. Leon's sentiment was echoed by Greg Magadini, director of derivatives for crypto data provider Amberdata, who told Decrypt that the market has been “having a huge rebound in risk-on assets all week, [and] that has been great for altcoins.” Magadini noted that gold's price has fallen as trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have progressed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please conduct your own research before taking any action based on the content. Bitcoin's grip on the cryptocurrency market is loosening, and analysts are speculating about a potential altcoin season set to ignite in June 2025. Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, predicts a significant shift, with altcoins already outperforming Bitcoin. But what does this shift mean for your portfolio, and which cryptocurrencies are primed for the next wave of growth? Recent data from TradingView reveals Bitcoin's dominance rate has slipped from 65% to 62% in just one week, ending a five-month uptrend. This decline signals a potential shift in investor sentiment, with capital likely to flow from Bitcoin's $2 trillion market cap into altcoins. Joao Wedson points to this trend as evidence that an altcoin season is already underway. His proprietary index, tracking 57 select altcoins, shows that 37 of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 60 days. He recently noted on X that part of Bitcoin's market cap will likely flow into altcoins, suggesting that many altcoins have already found their price floors. Broader market indicators like CoinMarketCap's altcoin index are still hovering at 27, indicating a “Bitcoin season”. These shifting tides suggest that altcoins are gearing up for a breakout. The allure of altcoins lies in their diversity and innovation. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value, altcoins often integrate advanced blockchain technologies or unique use cases. From Ethereum's smart contract dominance to emerging projects like Dawgz AI, altcoins offer investors a chance to tap into high-growth sectors of the crypto market. Wedson's analysis highlights that altcoins are not just following Bitcoin's lead — they're carving their own path. As exchanges list more altcoins and trading volumes rise, projects with strong fundamentals and community support are likely to shine. This is a clear indication that the best crypto to buy now isn't just about chasing short-term pumps; it's about identifying coins with potential for long-term adoption and value creation. Among the top cryptocurrencies vying for attention, $DAGZ emerges as a compelling option. Unlike traditional memecoins that rely solely on hype, Dawgz AI offers a unique value proposition: AI-powered trading algorithms designed to optimise returns for holders. The project's blackbox AI system, crafted by a team of Wall Street veterans and algorithmic trading experts, reacts to market trends in real-time, aiming to deliver consistent yields with minimal effort. This makes $DAGZ an accessible investment for both seasoned traders and newcomers looking to invest in the best crypto to buy now. Dawgz AI's presale, currently priced at $0.004 per token, has already raised nearly $3.6 million, signaling strong investor confidence. Early stakers gain access to exclusive AI-powered rewards, making it an attractive option for those aiming to hold for the long term. Additionally, the project's smart contracts, audited by SolidProof on June 4, 2024, ensure security and transparency, addressing a key issue in the crypto market that has been associated with scams and hacking. Beyond its technical prowess, Dawgz AI leans into meme culture to build a passionate community. The project keeps engagement high through meme contests and social media campaigns, positioning itself as a fun and profitable altcoin. As Wedson's altcoin season prediction looms, $DAGZ could capture a significant share of the capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins. Wedson's insights suggest that altcoins are poised to outperform, even if Bitcoin experiences short-term volatility. “Most altcoins have already bottomed out,” he stated, urging investors to focus on projects with strong fundamentals and growth potential. Centralised and decentralised exchanges are seeing increased trading activity for altcoins, making it easier to access promising projects. Dawgz AI, for instance, supports purchases via ETH, USDT, BNB, and SOL, catering to a wide range of investors. Its staking option, which unlocks rewards seven days after the presale, adds an extra layer of incentive for long-term holders. Wedson's prediction of a full-blown altcoin season in June highlights the urgency for investors to identify the best crypto to buy now. Projects like Dawgz AI, with its AI-driven trading algorithms and vibrant community, could be at the forefront of this shift, offering a blend of meme-tastic fun and long-term potential. The best crypto to buy now depends on market trends and project fundamentals. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out for its AI-powered trading algorithms and strong community, making it a potential top pick for the anticipated altcoin season in 2025. Its low entry price and Ethereum-based ecosystem position it for a potential explosive growth in the next bull run. Predicting exact price targets can be challenging, but Dawgz AI could see substantial gains if the altcoin season materialises as forecasted. Its current presale price of $0.004 offers room for growth, especially with strong market adoption. Dawgz AI is gaining momentum with over $3.5 million raised in its presale, driven by its unique AI-memecoin model and Ethereum foundation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discover how these revolutionary AI-powered crypto projects are transforming digital assets with unprecedented functionality and real-world applications. Our investigation reveals which projects lead the market and why they merit investor attention. A wave of innovative AI-powered crypto projects is fundamentally reshaping the blockchain ecosystem, offering enhanced functionality, efficiency, and real-world utility. Blockchain provides AI with transparent, immutable data sources and decentralized computing resources, while AI brings automation, prediction, and optimization capabilities to blockchain networks. According to recent data from KuCoin, AI and big data tokens experienced a remarkable 131% increase in market capitalization in late 2024, reaching $42.1 billion by November. This surge reflects both technological maturity and increasing market demand for intelligent decentralized systems. The technical architecture of these projects typically involves either AI systems operating on blockchain infrastructure, blockchain-based marketplaces for AI services, or AI-optimized consensus mechanisms. Each approach offers unique advantages for specific use cases, from financial services to supply chain management and beyond. The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance represents a groundbreaking collaboration between three prominent decentralized AI projects: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. Launched in July 2024, the alliance aims to create a unified, decentralized AI ecosystem by merging their respective tokens (FET, AGIX, and OCEAN) into a single ASI token. Fetch.ai's technology enables autonomous economic agents capable of performing various tasks without human intervention. These AI agents can process and share data among IoT devices, execute crypto transactions, and facilitate trades on decentralized exchanges through trading bots [CryptoPotato, February 2025]. The platform recently launched DeltaV, which “simplifies complex tasks and enhances user experiences through AI-powered chat interfaces,” allowing users to process everyday practical tasks like holiday bookings and finding electric vehicle charging points. Best AI Crypto Coins in 2025: Top 12 Projects to Watch This development has contributed to FET becoming one of the largest crypto AI tokens by market capitalization in early 2025. Currently, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is priced at $0.74 – well short of its $3.20 all time high from March last year. NEAR Protocol has established itself as a leading layer-1 blockchain focused on AI integration and development. In November 2024, NEAR unveiled an ambitious plan to build the world's largest open-source AI model with 1.4 trillion parameters, 3.5 times larger than Meta's Llama model. What makes this initiative particularly noteworthy is the background of NEAR's leadership. Co-founder Illia Polosukhin was a contributor to the seminal “Attention Is All You Need” paper that laid the groundwork for modern AI models like ChatGPT. His expertise is complemented by co-founder Alex Skidanov's experience at OpenAI during ChatGPT's development. GitHub data analyzed by Electric Capital indicates that AI crypto projects have experienced a significant increase in monthly active developers over the past 12 months, outpacing the broader crypto ecosystem. This surge in developer interest often precedes mainstream adoption and market growth. For individual projects, transaction volume and network usage provide meaningful insights into real-world adoption. The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, for example, frequently demonstrates strong trading volumes exceeding $100 million in 24-hour periods, indicating substantial market activity and interest. The investment landscape for AI crypto projects presents both significant opportunities and distinctive risks. Tokenomics vary considerably among projects, with some focusing on utility within their ecosystems while others incorporate governance or staking mechanisms. Analysts from reputable sources predict varying growth trajectories for these tokens. However, investors should be aware of the substantial risks in this sector. The competitive landscape is dominated by tech giants with greater resources which hinders market penetration for smaller projects. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding both cryptocurrencies and AI adds another layer of risk. While major AI crypto assets maintain healthy trading volumes on tier-1 exchanges, newer projects often suffer from limited liquidity, creating potential entry and exit challenges for investors. The regulatory environment surrounding AI crypto projects is rapidly evolving. In March 2025, the European Union's AI Act introduced specific provisions addressing AI-blockchain integration, requiring enhanced transparency for algorithms operating on public blockchains. Looking ahead, several trends appear likely to shape the future of AI crypto projects: According to industry experts interviewed by DL News, the AI-linked crypto market is worth almost $55 billion as of early 2025, with researchers estimating that the combination of AI and blockchain could add another $20 trillion to the global economy by 2030. However, the sector's rapid evolution demands careful analysis and due diligence. For investors, the most successful approaches will likely balance exposure to established AI crypto projects with selective positions in promising newcomers. Technical evaluation of the underlying AI capabilities—not merely blockchain functionality—will be crucial for identifying projects with sustainable competitive advantages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks. The meeting, which also involved the SEC's Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law. The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party. They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product. Related: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFs In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce's call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering. In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: Analyst Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction. Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing' MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We sat down with Arthur Leclerc, the Monegasque young talent, who serves as a development driver for Ferrari racing, working side by side with his brother Charles, who is one of the two Formula 1 drivers for the Italian Scuderia. The occasion of the meeting was created by zondacrypto, an emerging crypto exchange and digital suite for decentralized finance services – which dominates in Easter Europe and is growing reach and awareness now across Western Europe and the USA (compliant with all rules and regulations in the markets where they operate), and it took place at Top Marques Monaco 2025, the luxury car fair. Leclerc recently joined as an ambassador for the crypto platform, who is sponsoring sports teams, athletes and events, including world know Juventus FC. Leclerc shared some insights into his passions beyond the racetrack, revealing his love for playing the piano. “It's something that I really like doing,” he said. In the small amount of free time that I have, I go to Spotify to share my music with everyone.” He hopes to share his own compositions with a wider audience soon. Leclerc admitted that, being young and having spent most of his life in a racing car, it has been challenging to adjust to these new fields and own them completely. However, he has been closely watching the growth of crypto over the past few years. “I see how big it has become,” he said. “I have several friends who are working in the space, so I'm getting to know more and more about it. It's amazing to watch the improvements happening around crypto.” Leclerc is impressed with platforms or solutions that simplify transactions and make everything more accessible. “When I see spaces that make everything simple, the transactions and everything else, I feel it was really the right call to join as an ambassador for zondacrypto,” he added. “Technology is a big part of the sport,” he explained. “In Formula 1, we have a whole department dedicated to technology. It's all about analyzing data, predicting numbers, and developing software. There are a lot of things involved, and I really love that.” He has also been fascinated by physics and new technologies. “I think Formula 1 is at the top of technology, in every detail of a car,” he said. Absolute perfection on the track could potentially be achieved with the use of artificial intelligence, paradoxically without any human intervention some time in the future. “Maybe in the future, let's see what happens,” closes Leclerc. In the world of business, exactly like in racing, winning means always being number one. In sports, it's even more challenging, as it can boil down to fractions of a second ahead of a competitor. “Competition has always been something that runs in the family,” he said. “I have my brothers, and it can be everywhere – from paddle to PlayStation to the track. “There's the research to maybe have a faster car, but there's also the competition, and that's why you need to be better every day, improve your skills, and extract more from yourself. Winning in Formula 1 or motorsport means everything to me. It's the best thing of all.” Humanity and technology are heavily intertwined in Formula 1, and the same thing goes for finance. Leclerc is young and has a full plate, between music, racing, tech, crypto and winning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price may surge above $200,000 next year, according to recent analysis by X account Apsk32. He warns that the familiar four‑year cycle for BTC often lines up with fresh highs. This time, bulls say Bitcoin could even top $250,000 in 2025. According to Apsk32, Bitcoin often trails gold by a few months. Gold hit a record $3,500 per ounce earlier this year. If Bitcoin follows that path, it could surge. That way, money printing and inflation don't skew the view. It fits Bitcoin's market cap in gold ounces to a smooth curve. He told X followers that “if Bitcoin's position relative to gold keeps improving, returns could top expectations.” Bitcoin's position relative to gold has improved considerably since April. While some models push for $444,000 this year—what Apsk32 credits to “five years ahead of support”—he thinks a more realistic goal is $220,000. The $220,000 level would still mark a 10× jump from Bitcoin's low near $22,000 in late 2022.Gold Market Scenarios They looked at how much Bitcoin could be worth if it claimed part of gold's total value. If gold reaches, say, $5,000 per ounce by 2030 and Bitcoin grabs half of gold's market cap, BTC could hit a price of more than $920k. But then, these figures are scenario‑based, not firm predictions.Supply And Demand Factors But demand could shift if big investors pull back.Risks And Opportunities Volatility in both gold and Bitcoin could upend these models. Gold can face sudden drops when traders take profits. Bitcoin has swung 20% or more in a single day before. Regulatory moves, geo‑political events, and tech upgrades all play a part.</p>
