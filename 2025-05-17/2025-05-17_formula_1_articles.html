Oscar Piastri claimed his third pole position of the season for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, pipping Max Verstappen and George Russell as two red flags disrupted an incident-filled Qualifying.

The current Drivers' Championship leader, who has won the last three Grands Prix, set a 1m 14.670s with his final effort despite not improving in the final sector after complaining of traffic.

Verstappen fell short by just 0.034s, as Russell beat the second McLaren of Lando Norris to third having used a medium set of tyres as drivers struggled to keep the soft C6 tyre alive for the whole lap around the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit.

The opening Q1 session was red-flagged twice following crashes for Yuki Tsunoda, the Japanese driver rolling his Red Bull at the Villeneuve chicane, and the returning Franco Colapinto hitting the barrier in his Alpine at the Tamburello chicane.

Meanwhile, Ferrari suffered a dreadful Qualifying in front of the Tifosi as both Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton failed to make it through Q2 having lacked pace.

The DAMS Lucas Oil driver started second but took the lead into the Tamburello chicane with a better launch than pole man Ritomo Miyata.

From there, the Aston Martin Development driver escaped out of DRS range and then managed the gap to those behind, only coming under slight pressure from Arvid Lindblad in the closing laps.

The Campos Racing and Red Bull Junior Team driver had started fifth on the grid, but with a great getaway and decisive move on Miyata for second in the opening stages, secured second place.

Luke Browning rounded out the podium places, the Hitech TGR driver going from fourth and also clearing Miyata by the halfway stage.

Browning had to fend off the sister ART Grand Prix car of Victor Martins and Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne in the final laps, with the McLaren Development Driver completing the top five.

Miyata fell to sixth by the chequered flag and he was followed by Invicta Racing team mates in the remaining points-paying positions. Leonardo Fornaroli moved himself up to second in the Drivers' Championship with P7 on home soil, while Roman Stanek went from 12th on the grid to eighth for his third points finish of the season.

Ferrari had a nightmare first home Qualifying session of the season as Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton – having complained of brake issues throughout practice – both missed the Q3 cut en route to 11th and 12th places. It was also a disappointing run for home favourite Kimi Antonelli, who could not match team mate Russell's pace as he exited in 13th. Haas were another team to experience a tough day, with both Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman dropping out in Q1, the latter following a lengthy review into whether he got an improved lap time in just before the red flags were thrown for Colapinto's shunt – the final answer being no. Drama ensued only a few minutes into the session, though, when Tsunoda suffered a scary crash through the Variante Villeneuve section, causing significant damage to all four corners of his upgraded Red Bull and bringing out the red flags. Following a delay for barrier repairs, Qualifying resumed with Albon provisionally leading the way on softs from Alonso, Hamilton, Sainz and Leclerc, while half of the grid – including the likes of Piastri, Norris and Verstappen – had not yet posted a lap time. Verstappen continued his apparent overnight progress to go quickest from Piastri on a 1m 15.175s, followed by an inspired Alonso, Russell, Gasly and Norris. Hulkenberg joined Lawson in the bottom five after running wide at Rivazza and losing a time for track limits, followed by Ocon and Bearman – who appeared to get a lap in before the second red flag, only to lose it after checks – and Tsunoda. 2025 Emilia Romagna GP Qualifying: Colapinto crashes out in Q1 on F1 return After another delay while Race Control worked out whether Bearman's final time should stand or not, Verstappen continued where he left off in Q1 by going quickest on the opening Q2 runs, before Norris and then Piastri (1m 15.241s) moved to the fore. Aston Martin opted for a different approach as the cars rolled back out of the pit lane – both Alonso and Stroll emerging on sets of medium tyres, rather than softs. As the clock ticked down and the chequered flag came out, Sainz delivered a magical final lap to go fastest on a 1m 15.198s – putting him just ahead of Piastri, Norris, Russell and Verstappen, with the updated, medium-shod Aston Martins also safely through. Antonelli and the two Ferrari drivers could not make it through to Q3 Piastri punched the air with delight after securing pole position The lap was good, I had about four cars [around me] in the last corner which didn't help, but it was enough, so I'm very, very happy with the job we've done and excited for tomorrow now.” The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday.

Franco Colapinto became the second driver to crash out of Qualifying at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, with the Argentinian bringing out the red flags during his first weekend back in action for Alpine.

As the Q1 segment entered into its final minutes – and Colapinto fought to make it through to Q2 – the 21-year-old took too much kerb at the exit of Turn 3, causing him to spin into the barriers.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Are McLaren the team to beat again at Imola – or can a rival cause an upset? And while many seemed content to wait it out in their respective garages, other cars slowly began to emerge onto the circuit as the session got going. Elsewhere in the Red Bull stable, Verstappen had gone fastest on a 1m 15.130s, leading from Norris and Hadjar. With attentions for many turning to the soft-shod flying runs, George Russell ran wide out on track before reporting: “This ride is definitely a bit worse today.” The Mercedes man was not the only one to have a wobble, with Verstappen and Piastri also making mistakes during their laps.

Fernando Alonso claimed P11 for Aston Martin – a team that ran a different strategy by gathering data on the hard tyre during the session – ahead of Haas' Ollie Bearman, Lance Stroll, Lawson and Alpine's Pierre Gasly.
