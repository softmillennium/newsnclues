Colton Herta was involved in a terrifying crash during Indianapolis 500 qualifying on Saturday. He was entering Turns 1 and 2 at 236 mph when he lost control of his vehicle and spun around. As he drove backward, Herta's car went airborne and flipped over. Herta was able to get out of the car and walk away from the frightening accident. Luckily, nowadays, these crashes look scarier than they feel," Herta told FOX Sports after leaving the emergency care center. "Not to say that that one felt good, but I think the team's gonna be hard at work right now trying to get the backup car ready. Andretti Global with Curb-Agajanian driver Colton Herta (26) stands by his pit box Friday, May 16, 2025, during Fast Friday ahead of the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

As of Saturday, Herta was a 16-1 shot to win the Indy 500. Herta has nine wins in his IndyCar Series career. He last won at Nashville to end the 2024 season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court unfroze a lower court's preliminary injunction blocking President Donald Trump‘s March order aiming to end collective bargaining for hundreds of thousands of government workers. Trump issued an executive order earlier this year calling for the end of collective bargaining across various executive agencies. A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the executive order, but on Friday a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 in favor of staying the lower court's ruling. The Friday decision allows the order to be unfrozen, but it noted that the government said it would not terminate any collective-bargaining agreements until after lawsuits surrounding the legality of the order have been resolved. “The Union asserts that without a preliminary injunction it will lose bargaining power and suffer reputational harm that will deter present and future membership,” the majority opinion said. “But those harms are speculative because they would materialize only after an agency terminates a collective-bargaining agreement, and the Government directed agencies to refrain from terminating collective-bargaining agreements or decertifying bargaining units until after the litigation concludes,” the Friday ruling continued. The court's opinion did not address the merits of the argument, but only found that the lower district court erred by giving an injunction when there was no evidence of irreparable harm to the union. The order on collective bargaining is the latest to go through legal challenges, as the president faces intense legal scrutiny for most of his executive actions. The March order was one of several aimed at reshaping the federal workforce, an undertaking his administration has prioritized in the beginning of his second term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Walz speaks at a town hall event at Roosevelt High School, Friday, March 14, 2025, in Des Moines, Iowa. Tim Walz of Minnesota assailed Donald Trump in a law school graduation speech Saturday, accusing the Republican president of creating a national emergency by repeatedly violating the rule of law. Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, used his remarks at the University of Minnesota's law school commencement ceremony to call on graduates to stand up to abuses of power. Lawyers, he said, “our first and last line of defense.” Because, I have to be honest with you: You are graduating into a genuine emergency,” Walz told the crowd, which greeted him with loud applause. Walz pointed to Trump's immigration crackdown, which includes deporting alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador without due process, and the offer of a gifted jet from the Qatari ruling family to the president. And it's exactly what the founders of this nation feared: A tyrant, abusing power to persecute scapegoats and enemies,” he said. Since Kamala Harris' loss to Trump in November, Democrats have been debating which direction to take the party amid deep frustrations from Democratic voters that its leaders are failing to do enough to check the new administration. Walz is among a long list of potential 2028 candidates who have been traveling to early voting states. JB Pritzker, who sharply criticized “do-nothing” Democrats last month for failing to oppose Trump. Pritzker, who is scheduled to headline a Minnesota Democratic dinner in June, drew attention in February when he used part of his joint budget and State of the State address to draw a parallel between Trump's rhetoric and the rise of Nazi Germany. This past week, President Joe Biden's transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, returned to Iowa for a town hall where he criticized Trump's administration while demanding that Democrats make their agenda clear and reach out to people who disagree with them. Gavin Newsom has been hosting a high-profile podcast. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been drawing huge crowds to rallies across the country. Wes Moore of Maryland have scheduled stops in South Carolina at the end of May. “Some would say, 'Boy, this is getting way too political for a commencement address.' But I would argue: I wouldn't be honoring my oath if I didn't address this head on,” he said to applause and cheers. Later, he scoffed at some Democrats who have urged the party to focus on issues such as trade, where Trump is polling badly, instead of the rule of law. He also attacked “feckless” and “cowardly” big law firms that have acquiesced to Trump in the face of threats, with some offering millions in pro bono work and other benefits. “It's a flagrant betrayal of the oath they took as lawyers,” he said, urging graduates to refuse to work for or with those firms as they make their way into the workforce.</p>

Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert and his reportedly pregnant girlfriend Julia Bonilla split up before the team's Western Conference Finals appearance. Gobert and Bonilla already have a child together and she was seen at a Timberwolves game back on April 13, TMZ Sports reported Friday. But a source close to the players' wives and girlfriends told the outlet that despite their closeness, things apparently changed once she revealed that she was pregnant. Rudy Gobert and Julia Bonilla attend the 3.Paradis Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 21, 2024, in Paris, France. Bonilla sought to move back to France after the break-up, but Gobert wants her and their child to stay in the U.S. in hopes of finding an amicable co-parenting situation once Minnesota's season ends, TMZ Sports reported. "I'm going through one of the most painful times in my life, feeling isolated, far from my family and friends," Bonilla wrote on her Instagram Stories before deleting her account. "I considered Rudy the love of my life. I gave him a child and poured my heart into our relationship. Despite how I have been treated, I choose to protect his name for the sake of my children. I have NEVER EVER been unfaithful to the father of my children. Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert (27) warms up before the game against the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center. Thank you for respecting my privacy during this challenging time." Gobert responded to what he called "inaccurate information." "Julia and I are currently in the painful process of redefining our co-parenting relationship," he wrote on Instagram. "Being a father is one of the most profound and meaningful experience I will get to live. It is one of my most important life purposes and will be so forever. I'm asking everyone to please refrain from speculating and to respect our privacy in these difficult times."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After President Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election, foreign agents working on behalf of the Qatari government appear to have shifted their focus to right-wing media, fueling speculation that the terror-linked Gulf state is attempting to win influence among conservatives. Since Republicans won control of the White House and Congress on election day, the proportion of messages sent by Qatari operatives to conservative outlets and commenters has surged to more than half of their total correspondence with the media. Perhaps Qatar's biggest victory in its post-election right-wing media campaign thus far was securing an interview between Tucker Carlson and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in March. Foreign Agents Registration Act records show that Lumen8 Advisors LLC, a legal consulting company for which very little public information is available, helped facilitate between Carlson and the Qatari dignitary. “Qatar wants to further cement ties with Trump and allies for many reasons, including to defend itself against Republican attacks for its relationship with Hamas and Iran,” Anna Jacobs, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, said of the Carlson interview. Qatar's gifting of a $400 million luxury jet to the Department of Defense, which will be transferred to Trump's presidential library upon his retirement, has spurred intense debate in Washington over foreign influence and ethics. Trump and his allies maintain, however, that since the jet is government property, and because the president says he won't use it after leaving office, there is no possibility of impropriety. Carlson was far from Qatar's only target in its quest to influence conservative media. Some of these publications did, however, publish pro-Qatar stories shortly after receiving pitches from foreign agents. The New York Post and Fox News did not respond to requests for comment. GRV Strategies, which also reached out to outlets like Just the News and the Daily Mail, is a natural choice for any foreign power attempting to place stories in conservative media. Its founder and principal, Garrett Ventry, is deeply embedded in Washington's right-wing circles. Ventry has occupied top-level staffing positions in Republican congressional offices, was a senior adviser at CRC Advisors, one of the top conservative public affairs firms in DC, and is the cofounder of the Washington Reporter, a conservative alternative to email newsletters like those produced by Politico and Punchbowl News. Qatar pays Ventry's firm $80,000 a month to assist it with media relations, records show. Trump's rhetoric on Qatar, alongside some other Republican leaders, has recently shifted in favor of the country. While the president now praises Qatar for its role in helping the United States achieve its strategic priorities, he once railed against it for being a state sponsor of terrorism. Qatar indeed has a history of providing financial support to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, al-Qaida, Hamas, the Nusrah Front, and ISIS. The Qatari embassy did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

Water flows beneath a dam, Tuesday, May 13, 2025, in Freedom, Maine. FREEDOM, Maine (AP) — Heather Donahue is walking through the woods once again. But this time she is merely picking up an old soda can someone carelessly left on a trail. And she wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Heather Donahue walks on a rural road, Tuesday, May 13, 2025, in Freedom, Maine. “For me, reading fairy tales, I always wanted to live in the forest,” said Donahue, 51, who moved on from acting long ago and now lives in rural Maine. But the last several months of Donahue's time in the Maine woods have been anything but magical, or peaceful. In a twist of fate harkening back to her movie career, Donahue has been embroiled in a spat with locals in her tiny, 700-resident town of Freedom that hinges on her marking trees with the kind of orange blazes that help people find their way in the dense forests. Donahue had been a member of the town's governing body, its Select Board, but lost a recall election recently after a controversy about whether a rural road that cuts through the woods is public or private. The road in question is Beaver Ridge Road, a narrow, partially hilly stretch flanked by wild plants and songbirds that goes from paved to gravel to dirt as it stretches deeper into the forest. Several abutters of the road say the unimproved section is private and to use it for activities such as all-terrain vehicle riding constitutes trespassing. Donahue painted the orange blazes using historical maps to show what she holds is the center of a public easement. Abutting property owners were incensed and the first successful recall petition drive in the town's 212-year history followed. Donahue was removed in April and an election to pick her successor is planned for next month. He said it addressed a pattern of behavior by Donahue that chafed longer-established residents in the year since she took office. Water flows beneath a dam, Tuesday, May 13, 2025, in Freedom, Maine. I thought Heather's demeanor and behavior toward others was just unbecoming of a town official,” Hadyniak said. Donahue, who is originally from Pennsylvania and has spent long stretches of time living in California and traveling abroad, said she is aware of her status as what she called “a lady from away.” Donahue said she came to the Pine Tree State eight years ago, overcame her addiction and bought land in Freedom in 2020. Recently, she has worked as a life coach and shared her passions for gardening and medicinal plants with anyone who will listen. She isn't especially interested in reliving the glory of starring in “The Blair Witch Project,” which was released in 1999 and is one of the most successful independent movies of all time. The film sparked a resurgence of interest in “found footage” style horror movies, wowed critics and polarized audiences with its homespun take on terror. It also led Donahue to years of legal wrangling over compensation and the right to her likeness.

Donahue makes occasional tongue-in-cheek references to the movie in passing, but also said it struck her several years ago that her life was inseparable from the film in ways that weren't entirely comfortable: “I had this really difficult moment of realizing my obituary was written for me when I was 25.” Donahue has defenders in town, including Bob Kanzler, who served on a local roads committee and agrees the disputed path is public. “I mean, this is where humans flourish,” she said of the Freedom woods. That was all kind of centered around being able to walk in the woods.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, shakes hands with Colombia's President Gustavo Petro after delivering his opening speech for the opening ceremony of the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Forum of China and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States at China National Convention Center in Beijing, Tuesday, May 13, 2025. MIAMI (AP) — Colombia's government has applied to join a China-based development bank, another sign of Latin America's drift away from the U.S. as the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts, trade barriers and crackdown on immigration spurs many leaders in the region to seek closer ties with Washington's geopolitical rival. Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrapped up a visit to China this week with a stop in Shanghai, where he met with former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, the head of the New Development Bank. The multilateral lender was set up a decade ago as a project of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — the so-called BRICS nations of major developing markets — as a counter to U.S.-dominated institutions like the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. To date, the New Development Bank has approved loans for 122 infrastructure projects totaling more than $40 billion in areas such as transport, sanitation and clean energy, according to Rousseff. Petro, speaking to reporters in China on Saturday, said that Colombia is committed to purchasing $512 million worth of shares in the bank. But Colombia's traditional role as a staunch U.S. ally and caretaker in the war on drugs is likely to raise eyebrows in Washington. The U.S. State Department this week said that it would “vigorously oppose” financing of projects linked to China's Belt and Road Initiative in Latin America. Petro signed up to the initiative during a summit with fellow leftist leaders from Brazil and China. Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, said he wouldn't be dissuaded by U.S. pressure and reaffirmed that Colombia seeks to remain neutral in a new era of geopolitical wrangling. “We made this decision freely,” Petro told reporters from Shanghai.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) — The world's largest live music event has reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with the grand final on Saturday of the Eurovision Song Contest, a celebration of music and unity ruffled by discord over Israel's participation. A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland. Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture “Bara Bada Bastu,” followed by Austrian singer JJ's pop-opera song “Wasted Love.” Israel's Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic “New Day Will Rise,” but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza. Acts from 26 countries — trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals — will perform to some 160 million viewers for the continent's pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display has been spared by musicians who have 3 minutes to win over millions of viewers who, along with national juries of music professionals, pick the winner. The live show is also set to feature a guest performance by nonbinary Swiss singer Nemo — who won last year's contest in Sweden — and a face-off between two fan favorites: Baby Lasagna of Croatia, the 2024 runner up with “Rim Tim Tagi Dim,” and Finland's Käärijä, whose rap-pop party anthem “Cha Cha Cha” came second in 2023. There are also rumors of an appearance by Celine Dion. Before she was a global star, the Canadian chanteuse won Eurovision in 1988, competing for Switzerland. She sent a video message to one of the semifinals, where three singers performed her winning song, “Ne partez pas sans moi” (Don't Leave Without Me). There are songs in 20 languages this year, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Albanian, Latvian and Maltese. But in the past decade “we've seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.” “In recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn't succeeded,” he added. Dozens of former participants, including Switzerland's Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year's event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member. A pro-Palestinian demonstration is planned for Saturday evening in central Basel, about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the St. Jakobshalle arena contest venue. She said “it would be such a strong statement against antisemitism,” if Raphael won. The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, tightened the contest's code of conduct this year, calling on participants to respect Eurovision's values of “universality, diversity, equality and inclusivity” and its political neutrality. After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country's flag. Axel Åhman, one third of favorites KAJ, acknowledged that it's tough to keep Eurovision an unpolitical event. “But we're here to represent Sweden and we have prepared for this for all our lives and want to make the best of our moment as artists in this huge and legendary competition. Eurovision director Martin Green told reporters that the organizers' goal was to ”re-establish a sense of unity, calm and togetherness this year in a difficult world.” “All 37 delegations, in difficult times, have behaved impeccably,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump wasted no time enacting his immigration crackdown after being inaugurated for a second term. On the campaign trail, he promised mass deportations and more arrests — and to do it, he's resurrecting old policies. Immigration policy being at the forefront of politics is nothing new. Members of the Trump administration are “very, very familiar with our immigration laws throughout the country's history and (are) looking back to see what provision they might use to achieve their current policies on immigration,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the US Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. But, according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS, about 52% of Americans say Trump has gone too far in deporting undocumented immigrants and 57% say they do not believe the federal government is being careful in following the law while carrying out deportations. In fact, while weighing the issue before the election, some young voters told CNN current laws don't keep up with the times and they wanted to see bipartisan reform. The problem: accomplishing a comprehensive overhaul of the system is no easy task in an increasingly divided political climate. It ratified the recently written Constitution, granting the power to establish a “uniform Rule of Naturalization” for “free white person” who lived in the United States for at least two years. It was part of four laws, collectively known as the Alien and Sedition Acts, that were passed when the US was on the verge on conflict with France. It could be invoked by a president if the US was at war with another country, or if a foreign nation or government invaded, or threatened to invade, the US. The Sedition act also permitted deportations of anyone who was deemed a threat or who published false writing against the US. Large numbers of Chinese immigrants began arriving during the California Gold Rush. The mass migration of speculators swelled California's population to more than quadruple in size in about a decade's time, growing to more than 370,000 people by 1860. So, when economic panic ensued in the US in the 1870s, White citizens scapegoated Chinese immigrants for taking away jobs. Signed into law by President Chester Arthur, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the first and only federal law to prevent a specific nationality of people from becoming US citizens. It blocked Chinese workers from coming legally to the country, and blocked Chinese immigrants who were already living here from becoming US citizens. Between its opening on January 1, 1892, and when it closed in 1954, Ellis Island received more than 12 million people, NPS said. It also imposed a literacy test, requiring newcomers older than 16 years old to show basic reading comprehension in any language. Some context: With World War I in full swing, US lawmakers who drafted and passed the Immigration Act of 1917 characterized it as necessary for the country's security. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed it, arguing the law prevented good people from joining American society. Most people from Asia were still barred, per the Immigration Act of 1917. It came during a time of growing isolationism, immigration fears and increased global displacement during and after WWI, the NPS said. The Immigration Act of 1924 reflected desires to tamp down on overall immigration, “but also try to shift the origins of immigration back to the western and northern European origin,” Gelatt said. This meant more visas were available for people from the British Isles and Western Europe, the office said. Immigrants from Asia were still excluded, it said. It is merely a recognition of their fundamental dissimilarity from ourselves.” “There was a concern that these were lower quality people, basically, who were coming from eastern and southern Europe.” Many Americans at the time blamed Mexican communities for taking away jobs and public assistance resources. The USCIS notes many people also returned to Mexico voluntarily, but state and local officials often used coercive methods or threats. In the wake of the US entering World War II, Roosevelt signed an executive order targeting Japanese-Americans to be put into “relocation centers” or “internment camps.” As a result, approximately 120,000 Japanese-Americans were forced to evacuate their homes and leave their jobs to live in the camps that were surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, conditions that are now drawing comparisons to modern-day detention facilities. The Chinese Exclusion Act and other related measures were repealed with the Magnuson Act of 1943, the Library of Congress said, establishing quotas for immigrants from China and making them eligible to receive citizenship. But caveats still made the law discriminatory in practice. For example, the law used race instead of nationality in its quotas of Asian countries, which only received 100 visas each year, the office said. It also laid out legal framework to deport people in the US illegally, according to USCIS, and prioritized skilled workers and family reunification, which is still used today, the office said. During deliberations about the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, some lawmakers wanted more liberal immigration laws, fearing that a restrictive quota system would lead to tension with other countries, the Office of the Historian outlined. “Operation Wetback” was an aggressive and unprecedented sweep by US Border Patrol agents in the mid-1950s that plucked Mexican laborers from fields and ranches in targeted raids, bused them to detention centers along the border and ultimately sent many of them deep into the interior of Mexico, some by airlift, others on cargo boats that typically hauled bananas. During his first campaign in 2015, Trump cited the operation as a model for how he would carry out mass deportations. More than 200,000 people fled Cuba in the span of three years after Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution. The Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 helped provide funding and resources for refugees who came to the United States, including resettling them in the US and providing aid through international organizations. It made several changes to immigration policy — but also several miscalculations that have had lasting consequences in which politics has since made it difficult to correct, experts said. The law abolished quotas, established a preference system prioritizing immigrants' skills and family reunification and opened the door to more non-European immigration. During debates around the 1965 act, some members of Congress were worried that eliminating national origins quotas would shift the origins of immigrants away from Europe, Gelatt said. Their concerns were stated in “rather racist terms,” she said. There were enough other pathways into the country — including student or temporary visas, for example — for immigrants from other parts of the world to also sponsor their own family members, leading to “a very large increase in immigration from Latin America and from various Asian countries,” Gelatt said. There was also an effect on illegal immigration. That “served over time to shift some immigration flows” from happening “within the law, to causing those to happen outside of the law,” especially from Mexico, she said. Six years later, President Ronald Reagan tried to address undocumented immigration with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 which set up restrictions on employers. It made it illegal for people to knowingly hire undocumented immigrants and established an “employment verification system,” according to the bill. It also gave more money to the Border Patrol and other federal agencies. The Immigration Act of 1990 was the first significant revision of immigration policy since the Immigration and Nationality Act and tried to address some of the 1965 law's pitfalls by creating more avenues for skilled and educated workers. It defined three categories of immigration, based on family, employment and diversity, the MPI said. It set a cap of 700,000 total immigrant visas for fiscal years 1992-1994, but still did not include the immediate family members of US citizens in that count. Notably, the 1990 law also set up five categories of employment visas, targeting skilled workers, according to the MPI, and used a lottery system to determine which H-1B petitions would proceed further. “Most of the rules that we're operating under, in terms of legal immigration, were set in 1990,” Gelatt said. Additionally, the 1990 law created Temporary Protected Status, which has been a big topic in immigration policy today, she said. Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act put in place measures that intensified the law enforcement focus of US immigration laws, Gelatt said. It expanded the number of immigrants with criminal convictions eligible to be deported, introduced expedited removal procedures and put restrictions on many unauthorized immigrants from legalizing though family relationships, she said. Terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, putting new emphasis on national security, border security and immigration. After the attacks, immigration was reframed as a “critical part of our national security infrastructure and so the emphasis on vetting and screening of immigrants just really increased,” Gelatt said, adding that there has also been a focus on integrating government databases since then. The Secure Fence Act under President George W. Bush authorized construction of about 700 miles of barriers and surveillance along the US-Mexico border. In an effort to “make our borders more secure,” Bush, at the time, called it an “important step toward immigration reform,” according to a White House fact sheet. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was introduced by President Barack Obama. It allowed certain immigrants who were brought to the US as children to receive renewable protection from deportation and be eligible for work permits, obtain drivers licenses and enroll in college. However, the program didn't give them a path to become US citizens or legal permanent residents — something immigrant rights advocates have criticized, saying it left people in limbo. When President Donald Trump took office for this first term, he took a series of controversial actions aimed at reducing illegal immigration and enhancing border security. Biden reversed many of Trump's immigration policies, including the travel ban and limits on asylum seekers. He also stopped border wall construction and established a task force for family reunification. Toward the end of his term, Biden spent a lot of time trying to defend his administration's immigration actions against Republican attacks. Biden often pointed to a comprehensive, bipartisan border deal that failed in the Senate twice, at the direction of then-candidate Trump. Now more than 100 days into his second term, Trump has pushed legal boundaries in trying to enact his immigration promises — one of which was to complete “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” It has only been invoked three times in US history — all during war. The Supreme Court has paused these deportations. Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the US southern border to bolster military presence and send migrants to Guantanamo Bay, and has kicked off the process to end birthright citizenship, which was met with legal challenges.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When dozens of refugees from Africa arrived this week at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., they were greeted warmly by a pair of Trump appointees — and shunned by the political Left. This was not a typical group of refugees from the continent. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February that prioritized the admission of Afrikaners “who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.” Critics complained that the Afrikaners skipped to the front of a line of refugees from other countries who have been waiting years for a chance to be resettled in the United States. They noted that Trump closed the country to virtually all other refugees but cracked open the door for a group of white ones. Progressive Democrats insisted there is no evidence that white South Africans have faced any kind of persecution that would qualify them for entry under refugee programs that Democrats have typically pushed to expand. South African government officials, meanwhile, maintain that the violence Afrikaners have experienced isn't racially motivated or limited to white victims but is a reflection of a crime problem the whole country is battling. Centuries later, “they are not connected to Europe at all,” Njoya said. That was the solution floated by one Democratic commentator this week, however. “The people who are native to that land deserve their rightful land back,” Ashley Allison, a former Obama administration official, said on CNN. They, too, are immigrants, from West Africa,” Njoya said. “So even when they say, ‘What about our historical grievances?' Anybody who knows the story of Africa will laugh.” Still, the legacy of apartheid, a South African system of government that legalized segregation and discrimination against black citizens, has led the country's current government to pursue radical policies that proponents describe as an effort to rebalance the historical scales. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has called the persecution of white South Africans a “false narrative,” signed into law earlier this year a policy that allows the state to seize farmland from private owners without compensation if the government determines that doing so is “just and equitable and in the public interest.” The concept, known as expropriation, could be taken even further if the South African government passes another bill under consideration. The Equitable Access to Land Bill, proposed in February, would require all South African landowners to register their race with the government so that race could be used as a factor in land redistribution programs. “It's not that the government is doing anything illegal. They've actually passed laws allowing them to persecute the Afrikaners,” Njoya said. South African officials stopped keeping track of “farm attacks,” which became a polarizing term due to its association with white farm owners, in 2007 and now lump those incidents in with general crime data. And in some parts of the country, police can take more than an hour to respond to a call about a violent crime in progress. “Kill the Boers,” an anti-apartheid song often sung or chanted in Zulu, was for years considered illegal hate speech in South Africa. The roughly 50 Afrikaners who arrived in the U.S. this week on a State Department-chartered flight quickly learned that their race made them a controversial group of refugees in a country that has proudly accepted thousands of other refugees every year. The Episcopal Church said its commitment to “racial justice” prevented it from fulfilling its obligations under a federal grant agreement to resettle the white South Africans. “I don't think I've ever seen, in my 30 years of doing this, an organization reject a specific population to resettle,” Lora Ries, director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation, told the Washington Examiner. The Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe said this week that he does not believe the Afrikaners have faced genocide or racial discrimination. “In this case, it seems to be that people who are white seem to be more valuable than those who are people of color,” Rowe told NPR. Trump suspended refugee admissions when he took office in January. “It's so deeply and morally wrongheaded and repulsive,” Richard Stengel, former undersecretary of state under President Barack Obama, said on MSNBC this week. “It's taking places away from people who are really being crushed by authoritarian governments … for these folks who have never had anything happen to them,” he added. Ries said the situation the Afrikaners are facing has gone “beyond reparations” and has involved “too many instances of actual violence.” “It doesn't matter what color skin you are, anyone can be persecuted,” she said. “It's pretty galling to see this church organization, which has made billions of dollars off the federal government, say, ‘We're not going to do it for this white population.' You know, they're judging someone, [a] population, by the color of their skin.”</p>

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The most closely watched news out of the Supreme Court on Thursday was the argument in Trump v. CASA, a case asking whether President Donald Trump has power to cancel many Americans' citizenship. The justices appeared skeptical that Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship is constitutional, but may hand him a temporary victory on a procedural question about whether a single trial judge may block his order nationwide. Just minutes before that hearing began, however, the Court also handed down an important — and unanimous — decision rebuking a federal appeals court's bizarre approach to police violence cases. Barnes arose out of what began as a routine traffic stop over “toll violations.” Shortly after Officer Roberto Felix Jr. stopped driver Ashtian Barnes in Houston, Barnes started to drive away while the officer was still standing next to his vehicle. Felix decided to jump onto the moving car, with his feet resting on its doorsill and his head over the car's roof. After twice shouting, “don't fucking move” while clinging to Barnes's car, Felix fired two shots, killing Barnes. The ultimate question in this case is whether Felix used excessive force by blindly firing into the car while he was precariously clinging to the side of a moving vehicle. But the Supreme Court did not answer this question. In a case like Barnes, in other words, the Fifth Circuit told judges to act as if Felix magically found himself transported to the side of a moving vehicle, forced to make a split-second decision about how to extract himself from this situation without being injured or killed. “The ‘totality of the circumstances' inquiry into a use of force has no time limit,” she writes, noting that “earlier facts and circumstances may bear on how a reasonable officer would have understood and responded to later ones.” As Kagan notes, a wider lens will not necessarily favor either police or people who are injured by police. “Prior events may show, for example, why a reasonable officer would have perceived otherwise ambiguous conduct of a suspect as threatening,” she writes, “or instead they may show why such an officer would have perceived the same conduct as innocuous.” The Supreme Court held in Plumhoff that the shooting was reasonable, because the driver showed that he was “‘intent on resuming' his getaway and, if allowed to do so, would ‘again pose a deadly threat for others. Judges would only ask whether it was reasonable to shoot someone who was reversing away from a crash after colliding with a police car, without considering the high-speed chase that led up to that crash. Notably, a total of four justices joined a concurring opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which reads like a paean to the peril faced by police during traffic stops. When a suspect flees such a stop, Kavanaugh writes, “every feasible option poses some potential danger to the officer, the driver, or the public at large—and often to all three.” Still, Barnes wipes away a Fifth Circuit rule that all but ensured absurd results. It makes no sense to evaluate a police officer's use of force — or, for that matter, nearly any allegedly illegal action committed by any person — by divorcing that use of force from its context. Much of the hearing focused on whether Richard Nixon can save Trump's tariffs. America's most powerful legal organization confronts Trump's incompetence. Republicans have somehow managed to violate Bush v. Gore. We're about to get our first window into whether the judiciary will allow Trump's trade war to continue.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A violent, tornado-spawning storm system tore across the central US, leaving at least 21 people dead in Missouri and southeastern Kentucky as it cut a path of destruction through several states. About 540,000 homes and businesses across a dozen states were without power as of midday Saturday, with Missouri, Kentucky and Michigan among the hardest hit, according to Poweroutage.us. Storm kills at least 5 in St. Louis as millions remain under the threat of strong tornadoes and violent winds Andy Beshear said on social media Saturday at least 14 people had died there “but sadly, this number is expected to grow as we receive more information. Please pray for all of our affected families.” Mahala Watts told CNN affiliate WLKY her family was watching the news after 11 p.m. Friday when their phones started blaring with tornado warnings. A bathroom mirror fell on Watts before the roar went silent. “We were just kind of praying, you know, scared it was going to come back,” she said. “We had no idea the roof was gone. Watts told WLKY her family climbed over the refrigerator and stood outside in the dark, fearing another hit. Cars were overturned and debris was strewn about. Earlier Saturday, Laurel County sheriff's spokesperson Deputy Gilbert Acciardo had reported nine deaths after a possible tornado in southeastern Kentucky. Drone video over London, Kentucky, at daylight Saturday showed a vast wasteland of damaged and overturned vehicles and flattened homes as first responders searched heaps of rubble for possible survivors. In separate video from Laurel County, first responders are seen descending on the Sunshine Hills area, a barren landscape of twisted cars, downed trees and piles of debris. Deaths were also announced by London Mayor Randall Weddle, CNN affiliate WKYT reported. London is about 75 miles south of Lexington, in Kentucky's Laurel County. There's a lot of devastation,” Weddle told WKYT. The National Weather Service reported a radar-confirmed, “large, extremely dangerous” tornado sweeping east across lower Kentucky shortly after midnight. Video and photos from southeastern Kentucky show a trail of destruction that began in Pulaski County before moving east into neighboring Laurel County. Police in Corbin, south of London, were responding to mutual aid calls for tornado victims and described the devastation as overwhelming. “Stop and pray for Laurel County residents and victims of the tornado that touched down there,” the department wrote. Heavy damage can be seen in Somerset, a city in Pulaski County to the west of London, where emergency officials urged residents to stay indoors. “Please avoid the area, poles and power lines are down!” Pulaski County Judge Executive Marshall Todd declared a state of emergency, and crews are working on cleanup efforts, county spokesperson John Alexander told CNN. A storm that produced a devastating tornado in the St. Louis area Friday afternoon has left five people dead and many others injured, according to local authorities. About 5,000 buildings have been impacted by the severe weather but she noted, “This community is coming together in a truly, truly amazing way.” First responders looking for victims or people in distress searched about 4,000 residences. More technical searches with boom microphones and cameras were being conducted Saturday. Mike Kehoe said he has a﻿lready been in contact with federal officials about disaster relief. One victim was identified as Patricia Pendleton, her family told CNN affiliate KMOV, which reported the storm caused a roof to collapse at Centennial Christian Church. Ben Herzog, a science and operations officer with the National Weather Service, said a tornado warning was issued at 2:34 p.m Friday and a “likely tornado” touched down seven to eight minutes after that. His message for residents: “I think the biggest thing would be staying away if you don't need to be around.” Sarah Russell, commissioner of the City Emergency Management Agency in St. Louis, said the citywide system of tornado sirens was being replaced and had undergone testing on Thursday. She said residents were encouraged to rely on multiple warning systems, including mobile apps and weather radio. Some of the tornado sirens did not go off, which will be investigated, said Russell. “We're looking into that,” she told reporters Saturday. Fifteen patients with storm-related injuries went to St. Louis Children's Hospital and three were admitted, officials said. Additionally, Barnes-Jewish Hospital received between 50 and 60 people injured in the storm; most have been discharged. More than 130 miles to the south, in Scott County, two others were killed during Friday's storms, Sheriff Derick Wheetley announced on social media. The Plains will remain the main focus of severe weather on Sunday and Monday as well, with damaging storms possible in much of Oklahoma and Kansas. CNN's Kelly Murray, Scott Withers and Phil Gast contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Large metal plates will be placed at key points along the 250th Army celebration parade route to protect the streets of Washington, D.C. The June 14 parade, which also falls on President Donald Trump's birthday, will include 25 M1 Abrams main battle tanks rolling through the capital. The inclusion of the tanks, which weigh about 66.8 metric tons, has raised concerns about their impact on D.C. streets. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the parade organizers should have to cover the cost of any repairs needed as a result of the tanks. The metal plates, which weigh hundreds of pounds, were determined to be the best way to prevent damage because they will strategically be placed at points in the route where the tanks will turn. When tanks turn, their metal and rubber tracking can do the most damage, an official told the Associated Press. The parade will include 6,600 soldiers, some of whom will be dressed in historical costumes representing uniforms worn by soldiers from each conflict dating back to the Revolutionary War. There will also be 150 vehicles, including the M1 Abrams main battle tanks, and 50 helicopters. The parade is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, receiving criticism from some Democrats as being wasteful and a boost to Trump's ego, as it falls on his 79th birthday. Last month, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced legislation that would prohibit federal dollars from being spent on a military parade “primarily intended to celebrate the birthday, personal milestone, or private interest of any individual, including President Donald J. Trump.”</p>
