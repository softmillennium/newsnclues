                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain has its own Bigfoot living in Rendlesham. Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk is the location of “British Roswell” incident where a UFO is believed to have crashed just outside RAF Woodbridge, which was used at the time by the United States Air Force. But the forest also holds another secret, a creature known as the Rendlesham Shug Monkey, which has been described by witnesses as being part giant dog, part bear and part enormous ape. Now, Britain's leading ufologist and paranormal investigator Mark Christopher Lee is going in pursuit of the cryptid creature in a bid to capture it on film. Mark said: “I'm going to go to Rendlesham, because there is talk there of the English Bigfoot – this creature is called the Rendlesham Shug Monkey. The first sighting of the Shug Monkey was reported in 1956 by dog walker Sam Holland who described it as being 10ft tall, covered in black fur and possessing intelligent-looking, piercing eyes and terrifyingly huge jaws. During his investigation of the crash site, Mark and his crew heard a terrifying howl coming from the forest which panicked them into fleeing for safety. Mark is convinced that howl was the Shug Monkey. He said: “When we were there filming, it was really pitch black in the middle of the night, and on out way back we heard a really weird howl and it scared the crap out of the film crew. From his investigations Mark believes Mark believes that Rendlesham could be a contact point for aliens in the same way that Skinwalker Ranch in Utah is. The ranch – which has been visited by UFO enthusiast Robbie Williams - has recorded multiple UFO sightings as well as numerous incidents of paranormal activity. Mark said: “People talk about this area as being like Skinwalker Ranch in America, I think we could be dealing with something similar here. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In that sense, a spiritual cousin to the likes of Uncle Boonmee, Personal Shopper, A Ghost Story, and Light from Light, Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke's directorial debut A Useful Ghost is a strange, tranquil, humorous exploration of the conundrums that would emerge were ghosts an accepted occurrence in everyday life, and what such phantoms could illuminate about the social and political troubles of modern Thailand and industrialization at large. After procuring a vacuum to clean up the debris floating into his apartment, he begins hearing strange coughing sounds seemingly coming from the device. In a nesting-doll structure of sorts, Krong begins to share a tale of the factory and the worker who haunted these appliances after dying from unsafe conditions. Peeling back more layers of the supernatural tale, he conveys that March (Witsarut Himmarat), son of the matriarch businesswoman Suman (Apasiri Nitibhon) running the factory, lost his wife Nat (Davika Hoorne) and their child-to-be after becoming afflicted with a respiratory disease. Nat then reappears in the form of a red vacuum cleaner and a human-ghost love story blossoms, complete with sexual encounters. While the inherent absurdity of such a concept could've easily swerved into narrative territory too silly to earn emotional investment, Boonbunchachoke mostly finds the ideal tone of sly and serene satire to pull off such a difficult balancing act. As March interacts with Nat's spirit that is housed in the vacuum cleaner, we first see Nat in her human form, establishing an eternal physical bond that endures, even if only in the mind of March. Assertions of the “immoral” connection between machine and man start to fly. This leads to rather humorous scenarios imagining what might happen if tangible ghosts appeared in everyday society and everyone took them at face value. Can ghosts give approval to use their frozen eggs for artificial insemination? What are the moral implications of ghosts entering others' dreams? Cinematographer Pasit Tandaechanurat finds a beautiful elegance in each frame, accompanied by a harp-heavy score from Chaibovon Seelukwa that gives the sense of being whisked away on a magical, dream-like story, buoyed by playful wipe dissolves and iris shots. While the humor of an outlandish situation taken at face value can feel too labored and the passive approach can occasionally register as languid, Boonbunchachoke's script smartly expands the initial set-up to consider how love endures even as memory has faded, and what happens when a ghost finally achieves resolution. With the emergence of other themes––involving the scars of unsafe labor conditions, queerness, political uprising, and the machinations of a ghost society––one realizes A Useful Ghost has more on its mind than a peculiar love story. A surprising coda that leans into more genre-friendly jolts can feel at odds with what came before, yet A Useful Ghost marks an impressively ambitious, layered debut about a spirit's ability to illuminate the ills and complications of modern life. A Useful Ghost premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not searching for stars or supernovae, but for something far more controversial: UFO's or, to use the more modern and less sensational term, UAP: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. The initiative is called the Galileo Project, founded in 2021 by Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at Harvard known for his unconventional, yet always scientifically grounded, theories. Among the team's most notable figures is Garance Dominé, a brilliant young French scientist trained at École Polytechnique and Stanford University, where she studied neutrinos, near-invisible particles capable of passing through the entire planet undisturbed. The observatory is a modest array of sensors: infrared cameras, particle counters, spectrometers, and magnetometers, all pointed skyward. Advanced software analyzes vast amounts of data in real time, distinguishing between known objects such as aircraft, drones, birds and anomalies that defy classification. Richard Cloete, Dominé's colleague, emphasizes that precisely because we don't know what we're looking for, it's essential to know exactly what a UAP is not. Cloete, a South African who began his career building Tesla coils and amateur radios, later earned an engineering degree in the UK. He now leads the development of an extensive database of flying objects both real and artificially generated, using software like Blender to train the project's algorithms. This isn't about chasing aliens in tinfoil hats, it's about applying scientific rigor to one of humanity's most compelling questions: are we alone? Loeb, known for his controversial views on the existence of extraterrestrial life, drew global attention in 2018 when he hypothesized that the interstellar object “Oumuamua” might be an alien probe. Since then, he has turned suspicion into systematic analysis, arguing that “the universe is too vast to rule out the extraterrestrial hypothesis a priori.” The Galileo Project isn't just an academic effort. Other institutions from Wellesley College to the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics are now launching similar research initiatives. Dominé, who as a child was fascinated by languages and computer programming, has always sought answers to life's big mysteries. For her, studying UAP doesn't necessarily mean believing in aliens, it means exploring the unknown with scientific authority.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Real Housewives Of Melbourne star Jackie Gillies has revealed that a toxic relationship in her teens, helped tune her psychic abilities. Writing in The Australian on Saturday, Jackie, 44, admitted that she had the ability to 'see spirits' from an early age, before blocking them out during her teenage years. She revealed that it was a 'controlling relationship' she was in at 19 that had helped reacquaint the former reality star with her gift. And I saw a vision of every time this person ever cheated,' Jackie shared. It was after this relationship broke down that I started to do the inner work and tuned back into my intuition.' She also revealed that, with the help of a 'manifestation board' she had used her gift to engender everything she wanted, including her RHOM role and marriage to Silverchair rocker Ben Gillies. After becoming reacquainted with Ben at a party, that night she had a dream of her and Ben together and, upon telling Ben, he admitted he'd had the same dream. Then two days later he proposed with a diamond that was on my vision board, that he had no idea about. We got married a day before I turned 30.' Jackie's admission comes after she made a surprise appearance on Real Housewives Of Sydney. Having left RHOM back in 2020 after starring since 2014, Jackie was called in to offer her psychic and medium services to this season's Sydney cast. The former reality star told news.com.au that she was encouraged to make her surprise cameo by current season cast member Terry Biviano. 'When I was asked by Terry to come on, she was like, "Jackie, I want you to try and help this group because there's so much fracture in the group,"' she said. 'It was a no-brainer for me because I have been in this dynamic before.' Jackie said she tried to lead the group to better themselves but 'a lot of ego' and 'a lot of jealousy towards some of the other ladies' among the cast. 'In the beginning, they were all willing, open and receptive, but it was almost like they were triggered by their experiences with whoever they've had those experience with – and it went like left field' she explained. Jackie was asked if she would consider returning full time - and said she is absolutely up for getting the 'old school cast' back together. In 2020, Jackie announced she was quitting the show to focus on starting a family with her musician husband Ben Gillies, 45. And since I've started telling people, everyone has been so supportive,' the TV personality said. She also revealed that her time in the South African jungle on Channel 10's I'm A Celebrity back in 2018 helped her realise she wanted to be a mother. From the depths of my heart, yes' she said. 'But what I haven't been prepared for is the way it was going to come' she said. The pair welcomed twin boys, Bonham and Rocco, three years ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A FUTURISTIC jet that ditches windows for ‘supernatural vision' is set to take to the skies by 2030 – aiming to combine speed, efficiency, and a new king of in-flight experience. The Phantom 3500 is the latest transonic aircraft in development, offering an unconventional take on modern private air travel. Developed by Otto Aviation in California, the Phantom 3500 is designed to cruise through the skies at altitudes of 51,000 feet while delivering a smooth, fuel-efficient ride for four to six passengers. It swaps traditional windows for ultra-realistic high-definition screens, offering passengers panoramic virtual views in a sleek, seamless cabin. According to engineers, they're a structural nightmare. By removing them, Otto has created a near-perfect aerodynamic body that glides through the air with minimal resistance. This is achieved with a precision-shaped carbon-fibre hull that reduces drag, burns less fuel, and extends range. The company estimates fuel savings of up to 35 per cent compared to traditional jets, with emissions potentially slashed by 80 per cent. Instead of feeling boxed into a metal tube, passengers will step into an 800-cubic-foot luxury cabin wrapped in digital ‘windows'. The jet will be powered by twin turbofan engines and features short, wide wings for greater lift and versatility. It's expected to fly 3,200 nautical miles on a single tank and can use shorter runways than many current business jets – meaning access to smaller, regional airfields. Across the Atlantic, Venus Aerospace is working on the Stargazer, a hypersonic aircraft that could travel at speeds of Mach 4 and beyond. Backed by NASA, it's aiming to shrink the London-to-New York journey to just over an hour, with a commercial debut also targeted for the 2030s. The Stargazer uses a rocket-based propulsion system and a revolutionary new nozzle design to reach speeds of up to Mach 9. It's being billed as the first reusable hypersonic aircraft that could make two-hour global travel a reality. Between Otto's transonic windowless jet and Venus Aerospace's hypersonic speedster, the future of flight is shaping up to be faster, cleaner, and far more stylish. With the Phantom 3500, jet-setters may soon be swapping window seats for a high-tech view that's better than the real thing – all while flying smoother, higher, and greener than ever before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Making it to the top is not worth your life. has revealed a teaser trailer for an intriguing new horror film called The Sound, made by filmmaker Brendan Devane. Has there been a rock climbing horror movie before (not counting Cliffhanger which is action)? What begins as an audacious expedition transforms into a battle for survival against a force that toys with them. During their ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival. And they even have some rock music, too. Actor William Fichtner is in the cast with Marc Hills, Jocelyn Hudon, David Clennon, Christina Kirkman, plus special guests Kyle Gass and real climber Alex Honnold. Gotta say, I'm kinda intrigued by this - at least the climbing will be real and not bad Hollywood fake. In terrifying horror thriller The Sound, a world-class group of climbers is granted access to the Forbidden Wall, a mysterious rock wall previously closed for decades. Among all the climbers is Sean (Marc Hills), whose grandfather made an ill-fated attempt 63 years earlier. During the group's ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival hundreds of feet above the ground. The Sound is written & directed by American indie filmmaker Brendan Devane, making his second film after directing The Canyonlands (2021) previously. will debut Devane's The Sound film in select US theaters + on VOD starting June 27th, 2025.
