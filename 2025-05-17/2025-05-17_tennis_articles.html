                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jasmine Paolini needed just 89 minutes to stop Coco Gauff and end four decades of waiting, becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome title on home soil in the Open Era. With President Sergio Mattarella watching from the stands, No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini thrilled the home crowd and swept past No. 4 Coco Gauff 6–4, 6–2 in Saturday's final on Campo Centrale. Paolini is the first Italian woman to win her country's biggest tournament since Raffaella Reggi in 1985. "It's pure joy to have this trophy in my hands here in Rome at home," Paolini said. "Really happy about it and grateful, as well." Fast facts: In the matchup between Top 5 players, Paolini needed 1 hour and 29 minutes to best Gauff and pick up her second career WTA 1000 title, following 2024 Dubai. This is Paolini's third WTA singles title overall -- and her first on clay. Gauff won their first two career meetings, but those were on hard court, and Paolini has taken control of their rivalry on clay. Paolini beat Gauff for the first time last month in Stuttgart on indoor clay, and now she has backed up that win on the dirt in Rome, leveling their overall head-to-head at 2-2. Gauff, meanwhile, will still rise back to her career-high of No. "[Paolini] forced me to play that way," Gauff said after the match. She and Sara Errani will play Sunday's doubles final in an attempt to defend their title -- and if they win, Paolini will become the first player to sweep the singles and doubles titles at a WTA 1000 event since Vera Zvonareva in Indian Wells in 2009. The first three games went against serve. Gauff, though, erased that break point with a fierce backhand down the line, and held to stay within touching distance. At 5-4, a rally groundstroke found the baseline to set up triple set point, and she held at love to clinch the first set as light drizzle began to fall. A post shared by Internazionali BNL d'Italia (@internazionalibnlditalia) Coming into Rome, Paolini was 18-1 this year after winning the first set (only Elina Svitolina beat her from a set down this season, at the Australian Open) and that pattern continued. She converted five of seven break points in a clinical performance. "It's a dream to win in Rome, of course ... for every maybe kid that's playing in Italy," Paolini said. Jasmine Paolini needed just 89 minutes to stop Coco Gauff and end four decades of waiting, becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome title on home soil in the Open Era.</p>

Justine Henin, a former tennis champion, believes that Roland-Garros could be the stage where Swiatek “perhaps finally sinks” before rising again. Despite her early success and rise to the top of the rankings, Swiatek has faced challenges in defending her titles and reaching WTA finals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andy Roddick has warned fans to ‘watch out' for a key factor, early on during the 2025 Italian Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. “Then you look at the graphics and he is winning six matches for everyone that he loses and you are going ‘What standard are we comparing him to?' During Sinner's semi-final match against Tommy Paul, the Italian seemed to struggle when stretching for forehand shots, not wanting to put pressure on his right leg – something which visibly caused him pain when he did. “I will keep an eye – Sinner in that third set it looked like he was managing his movement a little bit. I think that is something to watch out for early days on Sunday,” warned Roddick. “Also, if you are Sinner, and there is anything wrong and we don't know that there is yet, it's just the eye test, he was pulling up on some of the movement. “If he is feeling anything, you play it safe for Roland Garros.” “Since the third round, I have a small blister under my feet that doesn't allow me to move in some moments,” stated Sinner. “I felt it more today than in other matches. “There are no excuses and for Sunday, I am 100% not concerned.” Geneva Open 2025 draw: Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz learn their fates at ATP 250 event “Carlos Alcaraz is a genius at finding a way to hit behind his opponents, especially when the footing isn't as solid,” analysed the American. Sinner knows that Casper Ruud can attack him by going high and heavy, right? But Sinner knew he didn't have to defend TP's backhand line over and over, especially if he hits a good ball. “He can create the high balls like a Casper Ruud. So it's not going to be as simple for Sinner just to get into that kind of exchange where he's the best in the world. “So, Carlos doesn't want Jannik hitting multiple shots from the same position. And Carlos is probably the most well-equipped person on earth to deal with Jannik Sinner.” Carlos Alcaraz also addressed being labelled the French Open favourite by Lorenzo Musetti.

This week, the ATP Tour brings top-tier talent to Hamburg and Geneva, while the WTA heads to Strasbourg and Rabat, Morocco. Each event offers players one last opportunity to find form, gain ranking points, and sharpen their clay-court instincts. The Hamburg European Open returns with a stacked ATP 500 draw, headlined by World No. 3 Alexander Zverev, American Frances Tiafoe, and former winner Andrey Rublev. Tiafoe, known for his explosive forehand and relentless baseline play, will be aiming to gain some much-needed confidence as he heads into Roland Garros. With several young guns and clay-court specialists in the field, including Argentine and Spanish talents, Hamburg promises high-octane matchups from the first round. The scenic Geneva Open offers a different tempo—both literally and figuratively. Played at altitude, the conditions can favor big servers and aggressive baseline play, which suits Taylor Fritz and Grigor Dimitrov perfectly. However, it's Casper Ruud, a two-time French Open finalist, who enters as the heavy favorite. Ruud has made a career of dominating the pre-Roland Garros swing, and Geneva's slower clay suits his grinding style. His top-spin-heavy forehand and impeccable movement could see him lift another trophy on Swiss soil. Dimitrov, a semifinalist in Madrid, will look to continue his resurgence, while Fritz continues to chase a signature clay-court result. A late entry in the event is none other than Novak Djokovic. The tennis master is in search of his first win on clay this season, and the Geneva Open is a great place for him to start. The Internationaux de Strasbourg offers a fascinating mix of proven champions and rising stars. Spanish star Paula Badosa is also in the mix, continuing her return from injury with renewed optimism. Her heavy topspin and athleticism are a perfect fit for Strasbourg's red dirt. Navarro's baseline consistency and court IQ make her a real threat as she continues to climb the rankings in 2025. The Strasbourg field features a balanced mix of veterans and next-gen talents, offering compelling matchups and a potential preview of second-week contenders in Paris. Over in North Africa, the Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem in Rabat, Morocco brings a more intimate setting to the WTA Tour, but no shortage of intrigue. 38 in the world, Avanesyan will be keen on capturing her first Tour title ahead of next week's French Open. The tournament has historically served as a springboard for lesser-known players to shine, and with several top-100 players looking to fine-tune their games, Rabat promises compelling early-round drama. Expect breakout runs, tense three-setters, and perhaps a few unexpected champions before the world turns its eyes to Paris.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the Grand Slam, they decided to extend their work together until Wimbledon. After withdrawing from the Italian Open, Djokovic and Murray decided to part ways. Speaking to the Tennis Channel podcast, when asked if Djokovic may try a brand new coach, Roddick said: “I don't think so. If anything, you bring in one of the people that he's worked with before just for comfort, just because they know how he operates. I think it's more familiarity at this point. Expressing how he felt Murray was on a hiding to nothing working with Djokovic, Roddick then brutally added: “But if I am being honest, our cats could coach Novak. Like what do you tell someone who's won that many times on tour, right? If he's searching for motivation and maybe hasn't got the reps in, then guys can knock him off.” In a statement announcing the departure, Djokovic said: "Thank you, coach Andy, for all the hard work, fun and support over last six months on and off the court – really enjoyed deepening our friendship together." This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. It's currently unclear as to whether Djokovic will bring in a new coach before the start of the French Open on Monday, May 19. Last year, Djokovic split with Goran Ivanisevic not long before the French Open and was then joined by fellow Serbian and long-time ally Boris Bosnjakovic, the head coach at Novak Tennis Centre. It's understood by Tennis365 that Djokovic has been photographed training with Bosnjakovic. When explaining his fellow Serbian's role last year, Djokovic said: “Boris is a part of my technical team when it comes to the analysis of my rivals, matches and my own game. "We've been cooperating for several years in many roles and Boris remained the head coach at Novak Tennis Centre. He is going to be my tennis coach in Paris; he will work with me on analysis, preparation and tactics. As for what comes after this tournament, I don't have a long-term coaching solution at the moment.” Saturday, 17th May 2025See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court, where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches. A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976. "If I want to win Sunday, I have to play some of my best tennis for sure," said Sinner. "Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming, but from my side, it's incredible to be here in the final." Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6(4). "I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match," said Alcaraz after his win. Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display. And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik," he told reporters. Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour. The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph. But from nowhere, he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory. Follow the ATP Italian Open final with Flashscore.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European clay-court swing continues on the ATP Tour this week ahead of Roland Garros, with a host of stars in action across two tournaments. Former champion Alexander Zverev has accepted a wild card to lead the field at the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, where #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik will also make his debut at the ATP 500. He will aim to find that form again this week. Hamburg native and 2023 champion @AlexZverev will play at home 🔥 Owning a 11-11 record on the season, the 27-year-old will be eager to rediscover his spark after an opening-round defeat to Fabian Marozsan in Rome. 3) #NextGenATP Mensik's Debut: Mensik has enjoyed a stirring start to the 2025 season, and will aim to continue his form this week upon debut at the ATP 500. 4) Davidovich Fokina Aims To Bolster Turin Chances: The sixth-seeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has been a serious contender in 2025. With finals in Acapulco and Delray Beach, as well as a run to the semi-finals in Monte-Carlo, the Spaniard is 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He will aim to keep pace with a strong showing in Hamburg. 5) Heliovaara/Patten Eye First ATP 500 Crown: Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten enter as the top seeds, where they will continue their pursuit of a maiden title at ATP 500 level. 1) Djokovic Chases 100th Title: Making a late entry into the ATP 250 in Geneva, Djokovic continues his pursuit of a landmark 100th tour-level crown. A victory would place him alongside Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to reach triple-digit titles in the Open Era. Djokovic is seeded for a quarter-final meeting with Matteo Arnaldi, who prevailed in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash in Madrid. 4 Taylor Fritz has had a disrupted season due to an abdominal injury that kept him off court for a month between his semi-final run in Miami and his return in Madrid. Now healthy, the American is keen to regain his rhythm following an opening-round defeat to countryman Marcos Giron in Rome. The top-seeded Fritz starts against Jaume Munar or Quentin Halys. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Tomas Machac arrives in Geneva after an impressive start to the season, highlighted by his maiden title at the ATP 500 in Acapulco. As last year's runner-up, the Czech will look to replicate — and ideally surpass — his deep run from 2024, when he sunk top seed Djokovic in the semi-finals before falling to Casper Ruud in the final. 4) Former Champ Jarry: Nicolas Jarry has this week dropped outside of the Top 100 for the first time since February 2023, but will hope to reignite fond memories of his time in Geneva to spark an uplift in form. Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic, first in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Rankings, will headline the doubles action. After a stellar start to the season, in which they completed the coveted 'Sunshine Double', the duo will aim to sustain their momentum ahead of their title defence at Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While several top ATP players have been resting or missing out on lower-tier events prior to the French Open, American tennis star Taylor Fritz is going against the trend. Instead of joining the trend of mass withdrawals, Fritz is going ahead with his schedule to compete in the 2025 Geneva Open, which is scheduled to be played from May 18 to May 24, barely a week before Roland Garros's opening. After his sixth Italian Open campaign, Taylor Fritz is already in Geneva to prepare for the ATP 250 tournament. The disappointing loss, however, has not dampened Fritz‘s spirits. He posted a video on his Instagram stories showing him working hard on the clay courts in Geneva, indicating that he was focusing on perfecting his form before the Paris clay-court Grand Slam. This is Fritz's third appearance at the Geneva Open. Since Dimitrov is one of the top names withdrawing from playing this year, Fritz will be seeking a better performance than before while gaining momentum for Roland Garros, which starts on May 25. Fritz's move is opposite to that of a number of top-tier players who have opted to forego playing ATP 250 events before Paris. High-profile stars such as Jannik Sinner, Tommy Paul, Holger Rune, Lorenzo Musetti, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Casper Ruud all withdrew from their respective pre-Roland Garros events, specifically the Geneva Open and the Hamburg Open, to rest or prevent possible injuries. Musetti, on the other hand, recently ended his run in Rome with a semifinal loss at the hands of Alcaraz. Other high-profile withdrawals from the Geneva Open include Denis Shapovalov, Jordan Thompson, Roberto Bautista Agut, Lorenzo Sonego, and Camilo Ugo Carabelli. The Hamburg Open also experienced some withdrawals, with Sebastian Korda, Ugo Humbert, and Hamad Medjedovic being among those to withdraw.

France has long been a powerhouse in the tennis world, producing stars in both the men's and women's circuits. Born in Russia, Golovin moved to France as a young child, eventually obtaining French citizenship and representing her adopted country on the global stage. She trained at the prestigious Nick Bollettieri Academy in Florida, a proving ground for many tennis greats. In 2002, at just 14 years old, she turned pro. Two years later, she made her mark by winning the mixed doubles title at Roland Garros alongside fellow French prodigy Richard Gasquet. By 2006, she had advanced to the quarterfinals of the US Open, and in 2007, she captured her first two WTA singles titles—at Amelia Island and Portoroz. Early in 2008, despite struggling with back pain, she achieved her career-high ranking of No. Tatiana Golovin and Richard Gasquet of France celebrate with the trophy after winning their mixed doubles Roland Garros. Golovin grabbed headlines during Wimbledon in 2007 for an unexpected reason—her outfit. 2, won five Grand Slams, retired at 38 and has a unique WTA record The bold choice wasn't just a fashion statement. Golovin later revealed she wore the shorts because she was on her menstrual cycle, a topic rarely discussed openly in tennis at the time. Her decision drew significant attention, sparking debates about Wimbledon's traditional dress code. Years later, Wimbledon adjusted its rules, allowing female players to wear colored undergarments to ease stress during their periods. After competing in just a handful of tournaments, she decided to take a break, hoping to recover and return in 2009. Unfortunately, her injuries worsened, and by the end of that year, Golovin was forced to retire at just 20 years old. Reflecting on her return, Golovin told BeIN Sports: “In 2009, I had to stop because my body couldn't meet the demands of high-performance tennis due to my condition. Over the past 18 months, I've been exploring treatments that might allow me to come back. Since officially stepping away from competition, Golovin has built a successful career in broadcasting. She currently works as a commentator for BeIN Sports and frequently participates in exhibition matches. In 2022 and 2024, she played in special events at Roland Garros, including a victory alongside compatriot Nathalie Tauziat over Argentine legends Gabriela Sabatini and Gisela Dulko.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff is set to be one of the hot favourites for Roland Garros this year, and with good reason. After all, she has enjoyed another solid clay-court season, and could cap it off with a title in the Italian Open final on Saturday. However, if she is to claim another Grand Slam title, the 21-year-old will definitely have to dig deep. Tracy Austin, one of America's greatest-ever tennis exports, has actually outlined another potential competitor set to push her, Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka for the crown. Speaking to Tennis Channel during their live watch-along of Mirra Andreeva's win over Clara Tauson, the panel utilised their time with the Hall of Famer well. After all, they peppered her with questions about her illustrious past within the sport, as well as picking her brains on some of tennis' brightest contemporary stars. Naturally, Coco Gauff‘s name cropped up, with Austin actually inserting her into the conversation to challenge for the French Open. However, she started by acknowledging Andreeva's credentials and capability of winning the event, with attention then returning to her compatriot: ‘I think Coco Gauff [to challenge for RG] first of all as well. She then picked back up where she left off, but this time with a critique: 'I think it all comes down to the forehand. When she is backing up on her forehand, your racket head has to be squared up for contact. Whilst there have been some rather obvious holes in Gauff's game of late, the manner in which she has been able to offset them with quality elsewhere is admirable. Gauff's win over Qinwen Zheng in Rome made history for the length, finishing after three hours and 14 minutes. However, she faces a completely different task in the final, with last year's French Open finalist Jasmine Paolini standing between her and another Masters 1000 title.</p>
