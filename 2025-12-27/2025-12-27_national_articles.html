Cleveland Browns legend Joe Thomas called his former teammate Myles Garrett the "best defensive pass rusher I've ever seen," in an interview with Fox News Digital. Cleveland Browns superstar Myles Garrett is on the verge of NFL history, as he is just a half-sack away from tying the single-season record set by Hall of Famer Michael Strahan and Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt. Garrett, 29, said it would be "special" to break the record by sacking Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. And it's a legendary record I'm out here chasing. So that'd be a great one to put a picture on the wall with," Garrett said at a press conference Friday. Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett (95) warms up before an NFL Week 10 game between the New York Jets and the Cleveland Browns at MetLife Stadium. Rodgers is quick to get the ball out, and Garrett said it's important to take away his easy reads. "Gotta take away those easy access throws, make him look at his second read, and he's gotta keep rushing. There'll be (opportunities) if we continue to get stops during the game, and he can't continue to lean on those quick passes, when you gotta score points," Garrett said. The Browns, who are 3-12, play the Steelers at home on Sunday at 1 p.m. Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett (95) reacts during the second half of an NFL football game against the San Francisco 49ers, Sunday, Nov. 30, 2025, in Cleveland. Garrett hopes the Browns play spoiler, so if he sets the record on Sunday, he would do it in a win. And I think we have the guys who are locked in who want to do that as well," Garrett said. The seven-time Pro Bowler said there is no pressure that comes with the record looming. Like I said, it's going down. So, I'm not stressed or worried about if I'm going to get it. Just a matter of when," Garrett said. Garrett has established himself as one of the NFL's premier pass rushers since being selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. The four-time All-Pro has an astounding 124.5 sacks in 132 career games. Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

The Las Vegas Raiders will be without their two best players in a game that will determine who gets the rights to the No. The New York Giants will head west Sunday in a battle between two 2 and 13 teams — Big Blue currently owns the No. 1 pick but would forfeit it to the Raiders with a victory. Raiders tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve earlier this week, ending his season. A few days later, defensive end Maxx Crosby was listed as out because of a nagging knee injury. Crosby, who said earlier this week he did not "give a s---" about the No. 1 pick, then left the team facility because he disagreed with his status for the remainder of the year, according to Fox Sports NFL reporter Jay Glazer. Crosby, a Pro Bowler in each of the past five seasons, has played in each of the Raiders' 15 games this season and has recorded 10.0 sacks. Maxx Crosby of the Las Vegas Raiders sniffs smelling salts during an NFL game between the Las Vegas Raiders and Denver Broncos at Empower Field At Mile High on Nov. 20, 2022, in Denver, Colorado. The Las Vegas Raiders won in overtime. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world," Crosby told reporters Tuesday. "That's what I focus on every day, and being a great leader, and being an influence, and being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. But that's got nothing to do with me. I've learned that lesson in the past, you can't control everything. That's not my job description, my job is to be the best in the world at what I do." The Giants seem to have found their franchise quarterback in Jaxson Dart, which would likely prompt a trade back if they hold the pick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Ramy Youssef attends the, "#1 Happy Family USA,” premiere at Metrograph on April 16, 2025, in New York. Mohammed Amer attends the Gotham Independent Film Awards at Cipriani Wall Street on Nov. 28, 2022, in New York. COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Whether it's stand-up comedy specials or a dramedy series, when Muslim American Mo Amer sets out to create, he writes what he knows. The comedian, writer and actor of Palestinian descent has received critical acclaim for it, too. The second season of Amer's “Mo” documents Mo Najjar and his family's tumultuous journey reaching asylum in the United States as Palestinian refugees. Amer's show is part of an ongoing wave of television from Arab American and Muslim American creators who are telling nuanced, complicated stories about identity without falling into stereotypes that Western media has historically portrayed. “And once you do that, it just feels very natural, and when you accomplish that, other people can see themselves very easily.” At the start of its second season, viewers find Najjar running a falafel taco stand in Mexico after he was locked in a van transporting stolen olive trees across the U.S.-Mexico border. Both seasons of “Mo” were smash hits on Netflix. His third comedy special on Netflix, “Mo Amer: Wild World,” premiered in October. In addition to “Mo,” shows like “Muslim Matchmaker,” hosted by matchmakers Hoda Abrahim and Yasmin Elhady, connect Muslim Americans from around the country with the goal of finding a spouse. The animated series, “#1 Happy Family USA,” created by Ramy Youssef, who worked with Amer to create “Mo,” and Pam Brady, follows an Egyptian American Muslim family navigating life in New Jersey after the 9/11 terrorists attack in New York. The key to understanding the ways in which Arab or Muslim Americans have been represented on screen is to be aware of the “historical, political, cultural and social contexts” in which the content was created, said Sahar Mohamed Khamis, a University of Maryland professor who studies Arab and Muslim representation in media. A show like “Muslim Matchmaker” flips this narrative on its head, Elhady said, by showing the ethnic diversity of Muslim Americans. “It's really important to have shows that show us as everyday Americans,” said Elhady, who is Egyptian and Libyan American, “but also as people that live in different places and have kind of sometimes dual realities and a foot in the East and a foot in the West and the reality of really negotiating that context.” Women often had little to no agency in these media depictions and were “confined to the harem” — a secluded location for women in a traditional Muslim home. This idea, Khamis said, harkens back to the term “orientalism,” which Palestinian American academic, political activist and literary critic Edward Said coined in his 1978 book of the same name. The outsiders in this case, he said, were the colonial/imperialist powers that were actually controlling these lands for long periods of time.” Among those who study the ways Arabs have been depicted on Western television, a common critique is that the characters are “bombers, billionaires or belly dancers,” she said. Alesafar argues there is still a need for diverse stories told about people living in the Middle East and the English-speaking diaspora, written and produced by people from those backgrounds. Deana Nassar, an Egyptian American who is head of creative talent at film production company Alamiya Filmed Entertainment, said it's important for her children to see themselves reflected on screen “for their own self image.” Nassar said she would like to see a diverse group of people in decision-making roles in Hollywood. Without that, it's “a clear indication that representation is just not going to get us all the way there,” she said. Representation can impact audiences' opinions on public policy, too, according to a recent study by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Results showed that the participants who witnessed positive representation of Muslims were less likely to support anti-democratic and anti-Muslim policies compared to those who viewed negative representations. He said the success of shows like his and others are a “start,” but he wants to see more industry recognition for his work and the work of others like him. “Just keep creating and keep making and thankfully I have a really deep well for that, so I'm very excited about the next things,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — When Cami Teacoach's son turned three she set out to find volunteer opportunities they could do together. He helped harvest produce at community gardens and made seed balls out of mud, throwing them into the forest to promote wildflower growth. Teacoach had reached out to many organizations looking for volunteer projects that she could do with her young child, but most places said no, so she came up with her own. “Everyone was like, ‘A 3-year-old can't do that,'” Teacoach said. During the holiday season, many people seek such opportunities, looking for ways to give back. But often nonprofit organizations seek helpers who are at least 18 years old. Finding volunteer work to do as a family with young children can be challenging, but there are opportunities, if you persist. “There's a million different ways to help people and volunteer. So many families want to do this and literally just don't know where to start,” said Polly Lagana, executive director of Volunteer New York!, which connects people with service opportunities. This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Children excel at activities such as sorting coats, packing groceries and following through on tasks, said Sapreet Saluja, executive director of New York Cares, which works with organizations to develop volunteer programs in New York City. And in many cases, they're more detail-oriented than the adults, which I think is very inspiring.” To get started, look for organizations in your community that match volunteers with family-friendly projects and reach out to ask if there's a minimum age requirement. Here are some other ways to involve little ones in projects that help the community. “Let them know what problem you're trying to fix in your community, and maybe one or two options of how that problem can be fixed,” Lagana said. For example, you can explain there are people who don't have enough food, and children in the hospital who might not have blankets, and then ask, ‘Which one do you think you want to help out with?' Children understand hunger, and they can help alleviate the problem. They can sort grocery boxes at a food pantry or help deliver sustenance to home-bound individuals. Aviva Davis was about eight years old when she and her brother Brendan began helping her parents deliver Meals on Wheels to senior citizens and medically frail individuals in Denver. “It definitely opened my eyes to what the world is like outside of our bubble. Davis became a resource at school for fellow students looking to volunteer. She still does monthly meal deliveries with her parents. “When we're not all on our phones, you get some pretty cool quality time.” Her brother is now in college, but when he's home, they do deliveries altogether. When Teacoach couldn't find organizations willing to accept her toddler, she started a group in Pittsburgh called VolunTOTs, which creates service opportunities for children as young as 3. The children and their parents pack 500 boxes of groceries to distribute to families in need, play bingo with seniors in nursing homes and make dog treats for an animal rescue center, among other projects. Parents have told Teacoach their children's conduct improves after volunteering. Stephanie Bernaba's family started “Tough Cookies,” a project where they bake and deliver cookies to veterans, when her son Matthew was in eighth grade and had to complete a service project for school. “Going up to the houses, it was very nice, because they're mostly living alone. A lot of their family or friends died,” said Michael Bernaba, 14, now a freshman at The Prout School in Wakefield, Rhode Island. They were very happy, especially for someone to bring them treats like that.” The project also helped the teens learn social skills and meet people in various stages of life and health conditions, Stephanie Bernaba said. “We went to the first couple of places and I was really scared, because I'm more of a shy person,” Matthew Bernaba, now 15, said. “For the first couple of deliveries I was more to myself, and as we kept going, we talked more with the veterans and got to hear great stories from them.” You can also connect with a nonprofit in need of a service and invite other families over to do a project together, as Lagana's friends have done, organizing clothing donations or assembling snack packs in living rooms. Bonnie Davis organized a drive for menstrual supplies, and families gathered in her backyard to assemble the baskets. Send your wellness questions and story ideas to [email protected].

'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the Trump administration's efforts to crackdown on crime as youth violence trends higher. An uptick in international organized crime groups smuggling stolen vehicles from the Motor City to countries in the Middle East is alarming law enforcement officials looking to crack down on the thefts, as experts say criminals are leveraging juveniles to do their dirty work. In September, eight men were indicted in federal court for allegedly operating a car theft and international smuggling operation in Detroit, Michigan, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said in a news release. Once the vehicles were delivered, prosecutors said the men would pack at least two of the stolen vehicles into shipping containers and send them to nearby port cities by freight or rail. Trucks cross the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada, on March 4, 2025, in Detroit, Michigan. Daniel Bartok told FOX 2, including locations like Iraq and Dubai. The Port Detroit Port Authority at the General Motors Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan on Thursday, April 17, 2025. "Our efforts have led to the recovery of over 350 stolen vehicles and behind every one of those stolen cars is a victim," ICE HSI Detroit acting Special Agent in Charge Matthew Stentz said in a statement. "Our HSI special agents and law enforcement partners will continue to do the work necessary to take down these operations that harm everyday Americans." In 2023, the state saw 28,408 reported cases of motor vehicle thefts, according to the Michigan Department of Attorney General. The Michigan Department of Attorney General did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Trucks cross the Ambassador Bridge as they carry cargo between Canada and the United States on Feb. 3, 2025, in Detroit, Michigan. "I think any large metropolitan area has some auto theft issues," Kyle McPhee, a stolen vehicle identification specialist and retired detective sergeant with the Michigan State Police, told Fox News Digital. "Detroit happens to be a port city. You can put something in a shipping container, and it can be at a port in no time." Organized crime groups will often swipe vehicles from a manufacturer's lot or ones simply parked on the street, with some criminals recruiting juveniles due to the less-harsh legal penalties for minors, according to McPhee. The Marathon refinery is pictured in Detroit, Michigan, on Oct. 14, 2024. Once a shipping container arrives at port, McPhee said criminals will often fabricate the manifest logs to fool officials regarding its contents. "They'll say ‘household goods,' and there might be five cars in there and two mattresses," McPhee added. The process makes it nearly impossible for authorities to verify the contents of each of the millions of containers passing through each port every year, with organized crime groups within the United States often coordinating with international criminals, according to McPhee. "They have backscatter machines and x-rays that look into the shipping containers, but you're talking about a million shipping containers on some of these ports are tough," McPhee said. You have to also be careful of what's coming into the country, and now we have to look at what's going out." The rise in vehicle thefts throughout Michigan has led state officials to create the Auto Fraud Task Force (AFTF) earlier this year. The unit combats both auto insurance fraud and large-scale criminal auto theft operations within Metro Detroit by partnering with various law enforcement agencies throughout the area, according to the Michigan Department of Attorney General. "With the rise of auto thefts across our communities, expanding the Auto Fraud Task Force is an important step to strengthen our fight against both vehicle theft and insurance fraud, crimes that impact far too many Michigan residents each year," Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. "Through this new structure, we are enhancing our efforts to dismantle these sophisticated, organized auto crime enterprises across our state." As authorities race to track down stolen vehicles before they are loaded onto shipping containers, while also investigating how criminal groups on American soil are working with international crime organizations, McPhee insisted there is one key component in what is driving the uptick in vehicle thefts throughout Michigan. "The one key connection is somebody's getting paid," McPhee told Fox News Digital. So if you have a local organized gang, they can be connected internationally to another group very easily. We have the internet, it's not hard." You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California dropped a lawsuit this week over the Trump administration‘s funding cuts for its high-speed rail project. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) called the cuts “a political stunt to punish California.” The California High-Speed Rail Authority says it will now look elsewhere for funding. The project is estimated to cost more than $100 billion. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said the federal funding was canceled because of the administration's lack of confidence that it would be done timely or efficiently. After over a decade of failures, CHSRA's mismanagement and incompetence has proven it cannot build its train to nowhere on time or on budget,” Duffy said. President Donald Trump reflected Duffy's sentiment, saying the bullet train “never will” exist. “The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump posted on Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.” The authority will seek funding from private investors and recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A shooter armed with several guns opened fire in the lobby of an Idaho sheriff's office and the street outside Friday, injuring three people before being killed in a standoff with law enforcement, the local sheriff said. The suspected gunman fired shots at a pickup truck outside the Shoshone County Sheriff's Office in Wallace before entering the lobby and firing into the station toward the dispatch center, Shoshone County Sheriff William Eddy said at a news conference. The shooting drew a massive police response, with a SWAT team and multiple agencies responding to the sheriff's office at around 2:40 p.m. PT, the sheriff's office said. An officer-involved shooting followed, and the suspect was pronounced dead at 4:15 p.m., he said. No information was available on the suspect or their motive. The injuries of the three people shot were described as minor, according to Eddy, who said two female victims in the pickup truck were shot in the leg and a deputy received a gunshot wound to the ear. Initial reports indicated the suspect may have gained access to the jail, Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris said, which “ramped up” the response from law enforcement. At least eight law enforcement agencies assisted the Shoshone County Sheriff's Office, Eddy said. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office and the Coeur d'Alene Police Department will handle the criminal investigation while Idaho State Police will investigate the officer-involved shooting, he said. Wallace, Idaho, is about 70 miles east of Spokane, Washington. Wallace resident Julie Swindell-Ward told CNN affiliate KXLY she was in the grocery store across the street when she heard someone say something about a person with a gun at the sheriff's department. “I walked out to the parking lot, I see sheriff's cars, lights coming down,” she told the affiliate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Along a nine-mile stretch of river between two waterfalls in the Australian rainforest lives a tiny fish that's been there for millions of years, hiding between rocks along the riverbank by day and emerging at night to feed. This is the only place in the world you'll find the planet's sole tropical cod –– a remnant of times past that is believed to have split from its closest southern relatives about 25-30 million years ago. “It's a beautiful little fish,” said Kennard, now deputy director of the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, who still works with Pusey, a senior research fellow at the same university, more than 30 years on. But this ancient species that grows to just 10 centimeters is now under threat from introduced predators and violent storms produced by man-made global warming. Cyclone Jasper, one of Australia's most destructive tropical cyclones, tore through the cod's habitat between two waterfalls on the Bloomfield two years ago –– felling trees, flooding the river and washing more introduced predators into its sanctuary. “If we lost this, we'd lose a representative of a really complex and long period of evolution,” said Pusey. Getting to the Bloomfield River takes at least four hours along an inland road from Cairns, where tourists board boats to visit the Great Barrier Reef. The longer, wilder and more scenic route winds around the coast, on unsealed roads through “croc country” where Australia's giant saltwater crocodiles dominate the briny waterways and smaller freshwater crocs occupy rivers and streams. At this time of year, summer dials up the heat and humidity, steam rises from roads after sudden downpours, and the smell of sweat mixed with sunscreen and insect repellent lingers in the air. Kennard and Pusey were on a research trip to survey Queensland's Wet Tropics when they found the fish in the 1990s. They initially had no idea what it was. “When you find new species here, they're almost always so minor a difference, and most of the time it's not until people do the genetics, and they go, ‘oh, that is a new species.' But this was clearly new, and it is quite exciting to find that,” Pusey said. Their biggest predatory threat is the Tully Grunter, a larger native Australian fish up to 35 centimeters long, that scientists believe was introduced to the river by recreational fishers wanting a decent catch. The grunter is now competing with the Bloomfield Cod for food and potentially eating its eggs and young. “There's been an explosion in their population in the last five to 10 years, and that's why we are so concerned. They've spread throughout most of that upper catchment area where the cod population is,” said Kennard. In parts of the river where there are no Tully Grunters, cod could be seen from the riverbank, swimming openly, seemingly without fear, he said. But in places inhabited by grunters, researchers diving with snorkels found the cod hiding behind rocks. Along with the grunters, researchers have found eel-tailed catfish, native to rivers further south, and guppies that come from Central America, suggesting pets were freed and have since started breeding. “They say it's one of the most intense weather events ever recorded in Australian history.” Cyclone Jasper had weakened by the time it made landfall in December 2023, but it stalled over Cape York Peninsula for several days, dumping rain on already saturated land. Around 975 mm of rain fell on some places in one day – the highest ever 24-hour total reliably measured in Australia. So much rain fell, it turned the Bloomfield River into a raging torrent. “But a lot of that has been stripped out and flushed downstream.” Scientists feared some little fish had been flushed out, too – downstream into the path of other predatory fish, like Barramundi and Mangrove Jack, or into a salty estuary where they might not survive. Funding from the National Environmental Science Program has broadened the team to include scientists from James Cook University and natural resource management group Terrain NRM, who know this rugged landscape better than most. Bobby Kulka, an Eastern Kuku Yalanji Traditional Owner, said stories passed down through his ancestors didn't include mention of the mysterious fish. I've never heard any stories about them,” he said. So little is known about how the fish reproduces that no one has been able to successfully breed them in captivity. One option to save the species may be to start a captive breeding program in case they become extinct in the wild. Another potential solution is to try to establish other populations in nearby catchments, where introduced species aren't a threat. Introducing populations at other sites is fraught with risk, too. Or create unintended consequences for other species that live there? Clearing the river of introduced species is not an option, Kennard said. The Bloomfield Cod is listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of endangered species, but that was before Cyclone Jasper and before researchers discovered non-native fish within the catchment. A listing would raise its profile and create new opportunities to save one of Australia's rarest fish that Kennard warns could become extinct within 10 to 20 years. “I think it's at real risk of becoming extinct,” he said. “That's not going to happen on my watch.”</p>

Brooks Koepka's decision to leave LIV Golf years after becoming one of the notable faces to join the renegade league sent shock waves through the sport this week. Koepka played in the LIV Golf series for more than three seasons, winning five events and taking home the PGA Championship in 2023. Golf commentator Brandel Chamblee on Friday offered his two cents on fans clamoring for Koepka to return to the PGA Tour, writing in a post on X he disagreed with the notion. "I certainly disagree with this," he wrote. "Allowing Brooks Koepka to return to the PGA Tour with no consequence, would undermine the very meritocratic foundations that make the PGA Tour legitimate — not because of who he is, but because of what his return (will) signal." Chamblee said there should be a penalty of some kind for Koepka or anyone else who jumped to the league, which is backed by the Saudi Arabian government. "LIV did not merely offer an alternative league, it fractured fields, diluted competitive meaning, triggered legal warfare, undermined sponsorship stability, and forced structural change across all of professional golf," he continued. "You don't punish him for being influential, but you cannot pretend his influence didn't matter. Chamblee suggested a penalty would suffice and being reintegrated into the PGA Tour would be the route that officials should go with. "He could have limited season eligibility and/or a suspension tied to prior contracted breach. They had to absorb the uncertainty, play in weaker fields, shoulder reputational risk and take on a greater responsibility of protecting the tour's continuity." "It is about whether the PGA Tour believe commitments mean something. If elite players can destabilize the system, take guaranteed money and then return instantly because they are popular or successful, the message is that rules apply only to the expendable," Chamblee wrote. "If excellence alone erases consequences then the PGA Tour ceases to be a meritocracy and becomes a marketplace of convenience. LIV Golf said Koepka was leaving the series to prioritize the "needs of his family and staying closer to home."
