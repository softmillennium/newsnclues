                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Spanish energy-tech company is testing a new way to pay for cleaner power, and it could transform how renewable projects get funded around the world. Turbo Energy has launched a pilot program, as reported by Cointelegraph, to tokenize financing for solar-plus-storage systems. Starting with an on-site installation at a supermarket, the project will use the Stellar Development Foundation's blockchain to raise capital. Here's how it will work: Instead of relying on traditional lending or large institutional investors, blockchain tokens let many participants fund a project by purchasing fractional shares of the debt. Each token represents a contribution toward the installation — in this case, Turbo Energy's Sunbox solar-plus-battery system — which generates cleaner power under a long-term power purchase agreement. If the model works, it could streamline financing for commercial and industrial solar projects. That matters because upfront cost is one of the biggest holdups for businesses that want to switch to clean energy. But this opens the door to a wider pool of investors. The pilot is an example of energy as a service, which is now valued at more than $74 billion and expected to double by 2030, according to Grand View Research. With EAAS, customers don't have to buy or maintain equipment; instead, they simply pay for the clean electricity they use. This is an interesting pivot within the crypto industry, which has been heavily criticized for its environmental footprint. While proof-of-work models like bitcoin use massive amounts of electricity — often tied to dirty energy sources — moves like this show some innovation toward eco-friendly strategies. We've seen similar efforts in the industry, such as Argo Blockchain mining crypto with hydropower and Soluna building data centers near renewable energy farms. In fact, the Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report found that bitcoin now uses 52.4% of its energy from sustainable sources, up from 37.6% in 2022. Reactions from those involved in the project have been enthusiastic. "We are combining real-world solar storage infrastructure with blockchain technology to create a pathway for new revenue streams and wider access to sustainable investments," said Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, per Stellar. "We see it as our responsibility to ensure that blockchain innovation benefits real economies and real communities," added Lamine Brahimi, co-founder and managing partner of Taurus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NFT market failed to deliver a year-end Santa rally in December, extending its downturn as valuations slid to their lowest point of 2025. On the other hand, weekly sales volumes struggled to regain momentum throughout the month.Meanwhile, attention is shifting toward AI crypto coins, particularly AI crypto projects that offer real utility and scalable growth narratives. One standout is DeepSnitch AI, one of the top artificial intelligence cryptocurrencies gaining traction as its launch draws near, with early investors positioning for what many believe could be 100x upside potential. The NFT sector continued its downward trajectory in December, closing out the year under mounting pressure as overall market values slipped to their weakest levels of 2025. To fulfill this, the project deploys five specialized AI agents designed to monitor, analyze, and interpret on-chain activity, market sentiment, and abnormal trading behavior. Three of these agents are already live: SnitchFeed, SnitchScan, and SnitchGPT. That live utility and value is what separates DeepSnitch AI from most AI-powered tokens. While many projects promise future features, DeepSnitch AI is already delivering value in real time. SnitchFeed surfaces emerging narratives before they trend, SnitchScan tracks suspicious wallet movements and smart money behavior, and SnitchGPT helps traders interpret complex data without needing advanced technical knowledge. This is exactly why DeepSnitch AI is increasingly framed as one of the top AI crypto coins despite the market's volatile conditions. As NFTs stall and speculative capital dries up, traders are gravitating toward AI crypto projects that can actively improve decision-making rather than just ride hype cycles. As more investors search for the best AI crypto coins, projects with working products, low early-stage valuations, and real demand stand out. DeepSnitch AI checks all three boxes, making its current window one that many believe won't stay open for long. Traders are still watching to see how TAO responds, especially after its halving event, which took place on December 4. While it was a structural change that was expected to support scarcity, it has so far coincided with the gentle bearish sentiment in the market. Near Protocol's native token NEAR experienced a modest downturn over the past week, dipping roughly 2% from about $1.52 on December 19 to $1.48 on December 25. Technical data shows NEAR trading around key support levels, with some analysts noting that price compression patterns suggest the market is waiting for clearer direction before committing to new positions. DeepSnitch AI stands out in this environment by offering live tools when traders need them most, a low early-stage valuation, and a clear launch timeline at the end of January. For example, a $5,000 allocation today effectively doubles in token count before the launch even happens. In a market where capital efficiency matters more than ever, this presents a unique opportunity that no one should miss.Check out the official website before the next price increase and visit X and Telegram for their latest community updates. DeepSnitch AI is considered one of the best AI crypto coins because it already delivers live trading intelligence despite being in its early presale stages. AI crypto coins are likely to remain in high demand as traders and investors increasingly seek data-driven tools rather than speculation alone. DeepSnitch AI benefits directly from this trend by serving both active traders and long-term holders. Yes, DeepSnitch AI is still in its presale phase, meaning early investors can access tokens before full launch and price discovery. While other tokens may post gradual gains, DeepSnitch AI's impressive features and bonus offers support its narrative as a potential 100x opportunity for those who enter before the next price jump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meme coins continued to trade like high-beta proxies for broader risk appetite as large-cap crypto remained choppy into year-end. Bitcoin's rebound attempts haven't shown consistent follow-through during U.S. hours, and that lack of momentum has kept speculative corners of the market under pressure. With ETH struggling to regain traction, flows have leaned toward caution in higher-risk sectors, and meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB have been among the first to get sold into strength. Thin liquidity and position cleanup into late December have amplified moves around obvious technical levels, even when headline news is limited. If that level fails, the next real demand pocket sits near $0.00000707, while rebounds are likely capped in the $0.00000722–$0.00000725 zone unless volume returns in a sustained way. That divergence usually signals sector-wide fragility rather than selective accumulation. SHIB is more vulnerable because the breakdown already happened. If bitcoin can't sustain rebounds and ether remains heavy, meme coins tend to keep bleeding — not in one straight flush, but in repeated failed bounces that invite more selling. Those two levels will tell you whether this is base-building or another leg down. L1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Institutional appetite for XRP exposure continued to build through exchange-traded funds, with investors adding $8.19 million in recent sessions. The flow trend fits a broader pattern in institutional crypto allocation: portfolio managers increasingly prefer structured products that reduce custody and compliance friction, especially when liquidity is deep and regulatory clarity is improving. XRP's depth across venues and the steady ETF bid has kept longer-term demand intact, even as short-term price action remains choppy. In the wider market, bitcoin's attempted rebound lacked follow-through during U.S. hours, leaving majors stuck in a risk-off, range-bound tape where flows matter but technical levels still dictate the day-to-day trade. XRP fell from $1.88 to $1.86, staying pinned inside a $1.85–$1.91 channel as sellers repeatedly defended the $1.9060–$1.9100 resistance area. Volume rose sharply during the session's most active window, with 75.3 million changing hands — about 76% above average — during the rejection, underscoring that this isn't a low-liquidity drift. But the move lacked persistence, and XRP rotated back toward $1.86 as supply returned. The repeated defense of $1.90+ suggests sellers are still using that zone to distribute into strength. Two forces are competing, and that's the story: ETF flows keep leaning supportive in the background, but near-term traders are still treating $1.90–$1.91 as a sell zone. For now, the tape reads like consolidation with distribution overhead — but with ETF flows acting as a stabilizer that could make downside moves more grinding than free-falling unless bitcoin breaks down sharply again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While it may be surprising, but even in a country as financially advanced as Canada, hundreds of thousands of people still lack access to basic banking services. According to a 2022 Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) study (1), roughly 600,000 Canadians are “unbanked,” meaning they have no chequing or savings account. Millions more are “underbanked,” relying on payday lenders, prepaid cards, or money-transfer services that charge steep fees. Warren Buffett used these 4 solid, repeatable money rules to turn $9,800 into a $150B fortune. Tariffs have pushed up costs for Canadians in 2025 — start the new year strong with these 6 essential money moves Using smart contracts — self-executing code on public blockchains — users can send, borrow, lend, or earn interest without ever stepping into a branch. Crypto banks built on blockchain “offer borderless wealth mobility, programmable finance, and seamless entry into emerging products such as tokenized real estate and private credit,” explains Mike Foy, CFO of Amino Bank (2). This kind of “always-on” infrastructure could be transformative for people who struggle with access to traditional banking. A DeFi wallet doesn't care about your credit history, immigration status, or postal code. Schmidt, a contributor to The AI Crypto Boom report (3), described it as “a new economic reality where AI and digital systems can manage and move value independently.” That same autonomy — without branches or back offices — could help democratize access to financial tools long reserved for those inside the system. Canada's financial system is widely regarded as one of the world's most stable. In rural and remote areas, physical bank branches are disappearing faster than ever. A 2023 Senate report on Indigenous economic participation found that many First Nations residents are “effectively cut off” from basic banking due to a lack of branches, ID verification barriers, and mistrust of institutions (4). For these Canadians, crypto-based solutions — such as digital wallets that can receive remittances or store savings — may offer a bridge. Dominic Volek of Henley & Partners describes this trend (5): “Cryptocurrency democratizes capabilities once reserved for the ultra-wealthy. For rural or marginalized users, that could mean the first true opportunity to store, send, and grow their money—without needing to rely on the big five banks. The potential isn't theoretical — it's already emerging in small but powerful ways. Lower-cost remittances: For newcomers to Canada sending money home, blockchain transfers can cut costs dramatically. The Crypto Wealth Report 2025 notes that over US$2 trillion in stablecoin activity each month is already handled by AI and automated systems, many facilitating global peer-to-peer payments. Microloans via blockchain: Emerging fintech firms in Toronto and Vancouver are experimenting with blockchain microloan platforms that let users borrow small amounts against tokenized assets or proof-of-savings, without credit checks. These mimic high-interest savings accounts but operate via blockchain protocols rather than bank-led products. As the Crypto Banking 2025 report emphasizes (6), custody and regulatory safeguards are “critical, particularly for those seeking security with blockchain-based innovations.” The Bank of Canada has already begun research into a central bank digital currency (CBDC), exploring how a “digital loonie” could improve inclusion and payment efficiency. But progress has been slow, in part due to privacy and governance concerns. The UAE's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) licensing regime, Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulation, and Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) framework are already integrating crypto into their mainstream banking systems. Read more: Here are 5 expenses that Canadians (almost) always overpay for — and very quickly regret. Price volatility, fraud, and the absence of deposit insurance remain major concerns. Crypto's open-access model makes it easier for scams to spread, and market swings can wipe out savings overnight. As Volek cautions in his report (8): poorly designed or overly punitive regulation could backfire, “accelerating the very disintermediation governments seek to prevent.” But as blockchain systems mature, they could deliver the very things Canada's big banks have struggled to provide: affordability, accessibility and autonomy. If properly integrated and regulated, DeFi could one day offer a parallel financial system — one where access isn't determined by income, location, or institutional trust, but by digital literacy and connectivity. As observed by Volek (9): “We are at an inflection point in global wealth management. For Canada's underserved citizens, that frontier might not be a distant concept. Crypto may never replace banks — but it can fill the gaps they leave behind. If Canada can align its regulation and infrastructure with innovation, blockchain could finally make banking what it should have been all along: borderless, affordable, and inclusive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The biggest and oldest digital coin was trading for close to $87,404 per coin on Saturday morning New York time, down by nearly 2% over a 24-hour period. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin has dipped by close to 1%. Ethereum, meanwhile, was trading lower over the past week, having dropped by more than 2% to nearly $2,927. XRP dropped further over a seven-day period and was priced at $1.85. Perhaps more disappointing for investors, though, is that while Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have missed out on a “Santa rally,” gold, silver and US equities have touched new highs. Bitcoin in October broke a new record when it touched $126,080. But investor fatigue and a brutal crash that wiped out a record $19 billion in liquidations has stunted the coin's rise since then. The virtual coin and other cryptocurrencies are now down year-to-date; Bitcoin was trading for close to $95,000 on January 1 and continued to surge that month following the inauguration of crypto-friendly president Donald Trump. Meanwhile, gold, silver and platinum have continued to notch new highs thanks to geopolitical headwinds and as the so-called debasement trade gains momentum. US stocks, too, have rocketed with both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending at record closing highs on Wednesday. This was supposed to be Bitcoin's year: President Trump campaigned on a ticket to help the industry and signed landmark digital asset bills after taking office. But a lack of liquidity has not helped the coin. Other industry observers have also said that Bitcoin's typical four-year cycle is now over and despite some traders selling on the fear that digital assets will drop in 2026, the asset class is likely to deliver returns next year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuela's economic collapse has given rise to an unlikely savior: cryptocurrency. Years of hyperinflation (prices jumped by over 1 million percent in 2018, escalating to IMF predictions of 10 million percent in 2019) and U.S. sanctions isolating Venezuela from global banking have driven many to digital currencies as a financial lifeline. Crypto is now used to preserve savings from inflation, move money across borders, and even conduct oil sales. As the bolívar's value evaporated, Venezuelans began rapidly converting bolívars into Bitcoin or dollar-pegged stablecoins to protect their earnings. Compared to the past adoption index for Latin America (LatAm), between July 2024 and June 2025, Venezuela raked in $44.6 billion in transaction volume, as the Chainalysis data below shows. Notably, in late 2020 the opposition led by Juan Guaidó even worked with a U.S. fintech to distribute pandemic aid via USDC stablecoins to Venezuelan healthcare workers, bypassing Maduro's banking controls. The government even required Petro to make some payments, such as passport fees and taxes. However, the Petro never gained public trust or international backing. By early 2024 some oil contracts required part of the payment in USDT. Selling oil for crypto was unprecedented, but it reduced the risk of proceeds being frozen in banks under U.S. sanctions. On the ground, crypto has become part of daily life for many. Some shops and cafes accept payment in Bitcoin or Dash, and countless people use mobile apps to swap bolívars for USDT to store their day-to-day money. When LocalBitcoins later shut down, users migrated to other venues. Cheap electricity also turned Venezuela into a hotspot for Bitcoin mining. By the late 2010s, miners were using nearly free power to generate crypto, earning more stable value than any local job could pay. In 2020 it set up a licensing system under the crypto regulator (Sunacrip). Authorities alleged that billions in PDVSA funds were siphoned off via crypto wallets. Dozens of officials were arrested, including Sunacrip chief Joselit Ramírez, who had overseen the Petro. The government suspended Sunacrip and ordered police to shut down unregistered mining farms. By 2024, Venezuela outright banned Bitcoin mining, blaming it for straining the electrical grid.

When traditional money systems failed, Venezuelans improvised: street vendors hedge their daily sales in stablecoins, families rely on crypto remittances, and savers trust digital dollars over bolívars. The government's own crypto initiative may have flopped, but grassroots usage continues to grow. As of writing time, Venezuela still ranks among the world's most active crypto markets, a testament to how necessity and ingenuity have made digital assets a vital lifeline in the country's ongoing economic storm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoin-backed loans are on the rise, especially as crypto investors look for liquidity solutions. But with that boom comes the wild volatility of altcoins, which can put both borrowers and lenders in precarious situations. Let's dive into multi-collateral frameworks and dynamic risk management strategies that may help. In the world of single-collateral lending, that volatility can spell disaster. A sharp drop in the value of an altcoin could push a loan right under safe collateral levels, leading to margin calls or forced liquidations. The risk to lending platforms ramps up significantly, especially if multiple loans are tied to assets that are moving in tandem during a market downturn. To help keep the madness at bay, platforms like Clapp are taking a different approach by using multi-collateral frameworks. These frameworks allow borrowers to secure loans using a broad range of assets, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but a variety of altcoins like SOL, BNB, and LINK, along with stablecoins. This method of risk management is somewhat akin to what we see in traditional finance, where exposure isn't just analyzed on an asset-by-asset basis but rather at the portfolio level. Dynamic risk management is also a must in the world of altcoin lending. Platforms like Clapp let borrowers actively manage and rebalance their collateral positions in real-time. If an altcoin starts getting volatile, users can add more stable collateral, reduce exposure to that asset, or shift weight toward Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. This flexibility means borrowers can be more proactive and prevent their loans from hitting those dreaded liquidation thresholds. Unlike traditional fixed-loan models, Clapp's revolving credit line structure actually encourages more cautious borrowing. Unused credit has a 0% APR, and interest only accrues on the portion of funds actually withdrawn, which makes it less tempting to overborrow. Clapp operates under a VASP license in the Czech Republic, aligning its operations with European regulatory standards for crypto service providers. This compliance mandates that they comply with anti-money laundering (AML) obligations and operational transparency requirements. While regulation won't magically eliminate market risk, it does significantly lower counterparty and operational risks, creating a safer environment for borrowers and lenders alike. Navigating the world of altcoin-backed crypto loans calls for more than just basic collateral ratios. It requires a holistic approach that incorporates portfolio-level thinking, flexible management, and disciplined borrowing structures. Clapp's strategies—melding multi-collateral design, dynamic rebalancing, and regulatory compliance—show how altcoin risk can be managed without stifling borrower flexibility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many investors hope for a “Santa Claus Rally,” Ethereum ETFs have seen the opposite this December. Since 11 December, they've been stuck in a steady outflow cycle, losing $853.9 million in two weeks as per Farside Investors. Only on 22 December did ETH ETFs see positive inflows of $84.6 million. Even though Ethereum [ETH] and Bitcoin [BTC] prices rose slightly over the last 24 hours, institutions appear to be de-risking or locking in tax losses before the year ends. Ethereum was trading at around $2,964 at press time, but the pressure from huge ETF outflows may be keeping traders nervous. If outflows continue at the same pace, this important support level could be tested. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs have also faced a tough month, on an even bigger scale than Ethereum. Since 11 December, they have recorded $1.538 billion in outflows, showing a clear and sustained pullback from institutional investors. Despite these brief moments of strength, however, the overall picture suggested that major players have been steadily withdrawing capital throughout December. In fact, thanks to this selling spree and other multiple factors, Bitcoin was down and trading at $88,514.79 at press time. Despite their insignificant price gains, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for both BTC and ETH was still below 50 at press time. This suggested that bearish momentum is still strong in the short term. However, both the RSIs moving north could be early signs of a bullish divergence. To put it simply, a potential trend reversal might be incoming. As we approach 2026, Bitcoin and Ethereum are each following their own distinct paths. As it stands, both ETH and BTC seem unable to reach that level of confidence. Trading, buying or selling cryptocurrencies should be considered a high-risk investment and every reader is advised to do their own research before making any decisions.</p>
