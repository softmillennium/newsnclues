                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has threatened legal action against jazz musician Chuck Redd after Redd canceled his scheduled Christmas eve concert over President Donald Trump's appointed board's decision to rename the venue after himself. “Regrettably, your action surrenders to the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left, who have sought to intimidate artists into boycotting performances at our national cultural center.” Grenell said that the letter served as “official notice” that “we will seek $1 million in damages,” from Redd, calling his nixing of the concert a “political stunt.” Redd did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment. Since Trump's self-appointment as Kennedy Center chairman in early February, at least 26 performances have been canceled, including 15 by the scheduled acts themselves. Issa Rae canceled her Feb. 14 show, citing “an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums.” On Feb. 13, Low Cut Connie, the Philadelphia rock and soul band fronted by Adam Weiner, canceled their March 19 concert. Pink Floyd's Mesmerizing 'Wish You Were Here' Video Arrives 50 Years After Song's Release ‘American Idol' Comes to Jesus, Finds Rebirth in Faith-Based Music Bono and Imelda May Bring 'Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)' to the Streets of Dublin We're just not going to be part of it.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Kris, 70, also posted a photo on Christmas — the day of the film's release — wearing a black and blue “Marty Supreme” jacket. Fans turned to social media to discuss the shoutout, as the family has been more open about Kylie, 28, and Chalamet's private relationship. “I think we'll be seeing them and Timmy have more interactions,” one fan said.

Chalamet's name appeared above his girlfriend's on the roof of the edible home, along with her children, Stormi, 7, and Aire, 3, with ex Travis Scott. “This has happened before — but she talked him into getting back together,” the insider claimed. “She is crazy about him so that could well happen again.” A second source at the time claimed that their relationship isn't “completely over.” The split speculation continued when Chalamet, 30, skipped out on Kris' 70th birthday party in November. Sources shut down breakup rumors to People, claiming the actor was out of the country filming “Dune: Part Three.” Kylie proved they are still going strong herself when she accompanied him to the Los Angeles premiere of “Marty Supreme” earlier this month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Wydra breaks down Zosia's final look to Rhea Seehorn's Carol in that cliffhanger season-ender. [This story contains major spoilers from Pluribus's season one finale, “La Chica o El Mundo.”] Pluribus star Karolina Wydra has a surprisingly glass-half-full take on the ominous ending of season one. Her character, Zosia, may have had to honor Carol Sturka's (Rhea Seehorn) request for an atom bomb, but based on their parting glance, Wydra still senses some indecision from Carol about this manner of escalation. It's a big swerve when you factor how resistant Carol was to Manousos' (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) violent approach to undoing the Joining. 'Pluribus' Star Carlos-Manuel Vesga Breaks Down That Season Finale Betrayal 'Pluribus' Star Rhea Seehorn Breaks Down Carol's Escalation in the Season Finale “What [the parting glance] was for me is that maybe there's somehow still a chance [to reconsider]. Are you sure about whatever is the next chapter? Zosia and Carol's globe-trotting romance took a dark turn in Big Sky, Montana, when Carol learned that Zosia and the rest of the Joined were nearing completion on another method to turn her into one of them. Prior to Zosia initiating their first kiss, Carol accused her of manipulation by recreating the beloved haunt that was lost to a fire. She felt they were trying to divert her attention away from restoring the human race. And Seehorn — per her own finale postmortem with THR — now believes that the Joined's scheme to use Carol's frozen eggs to belatedly “join” her confirms that episode eight was all an elaborate seduction, even if there were some lovely qualities to it. For Wydra, she still takes her character at her word when she says that everything the Joined do is out of love and a desire to make Carol happy. “So it was just about making sure that she's coming from a place of true honesty and just doing things to be of service to Carol.” In episode four, Carol tried to persuade Zosia into revealing how to reverse the Joining, and despite having the inability to lie, Zosia stated, “We can't answer questions like that.” Thus, it's possible that the Joined's programming also won't let them entertain the notion that they're manipulating someone, something Gilligan acknowledged in another finale postmortem with THR. “Can you think of examples in real life where people are manipulating without knowing it? “I don't know that the Others are any simpler than human beings in real life.” Below, during a conversation with THR, Wydra also discusses the morsels of backstory that Zosia reveals about her pre-Joining self, as well as how the character was rewritten to be Polish like her. In episode three, Zosia fetched Carol a hand grenade, and in the finale, she ups the ante by fetching her an atomic bomb. Well, what was funny about the grenade is that “we” misunderstood [her sarcasm]. But then we realize, “Oh wait, you're messing with us.” With the atom bomb, it's another one of those moments where we will give her whatever she needs and whatever she wants to make sure that she's happy. Where are we going to go with this?” (Laughs.) Do you now have some idea of where it's going? What's also great is it doesn't color your performance. What happens in 109, I wonder if knowing that information would've somehow seeped into my subconscious and made Zosia be more, “Ooh, I have a secret.” Vince and I talked about how they're not manipulative and Zosia is not sinister. So it was just about making sure that she's coming from a place of true honesty and just doing things to make Carol happy and be of service to Carol. What it was for me is that maybe there's somehow still a chance [to reconsider]. Are you sure about whatever is the next chapter?” I think that's what it is, and it's not wanting to let her go because [the Joined] can't be around Manousos. If she goes back home, they have to separate themselves from her. Zosia and Carol were able to go on this epic journey [around the globe] because they were away from Manousos. But did Vince at least tell you ahead of time that romance was in the cards? He didn't reveal to me where the season was going to go, so I don't think I knew that. We had a lot of discussions about that episode. So it was really interesting to come together and find what that moment means. I don't want to say what it means because I want the audience to have their own interpretation of what [108] is and who Zosia is in that episode and what that kiss means. Is she finding a little bit of her personality and individuality within the collective? Or is Zosia just really trying to make Carol happy? Prior to the kiss, Carol had just called Zosia out for her diner theatrics because she felt like Zosia was trying to manipulate her. So my interpretation of episode eight has evolved now that we know about the collective's secret plan to “join” Carol. Carol was conscious of her own plotting, but I don't think the Joined's programming allows them to know when they're manipulating someone. When Zosia volunteers some information about the original Zosia being from Gdańsk, Poland, and loving mango ice cream, I now think that was part of an [unconscious] effort to soften Carol and lull her into this false sense of security. I love that we got to see a glimpse of who Zosia was in her past life. She grew up during a time of scarcity, and this guy [with a cart] took pity on [the neighborhood kids] by giving them leftover ice cream. I thought that was such a sweet moment of connection with Carol. There's a moment where Zosia pauses to think [about her favorite food], and we talked about that moment of pause as Zosia having to separate herself from the collective and go to the memory lane of who Zosia was prior to the Joining. So she has to separate herself from the collective mind to find what that answer is, and then she comes back with that information. I haven't seen the episode yet, but when we were shooting it, there was a moment of excitement, like, “Oh yeah! I like mango!” So, for me, it came from a pure place of connection and sharing of oneself, but I love that you thought it was very manipulative [in hindsight]. Did Vince and co. rewrite her to be Polish after they cast you? Whoever Vince found, the character would've been named after [whatever their background is]. The fake sides had a woman named Anna, and when I got the [first two] scripts, her name was Yara. Then they changed it to Zosia when I got cast. They decided to give her a Polish name, which I thought was pretty cool. It's an especially harrowing moment when you consider that Rhea and a lot of the same crew also experienced a real-life version of that when Bob Odenkirk had to be revived on the Better Call Saul set. So could you feel a heaviness on set that day? But was it because the scene brought up their feelings from having gone through that with Bob? People were in tears everywhere, creating this very eerie feeling. And then pretending to revive me, as Zosia, had a very particular feeling in the air. ***Pluribus season one is now streaming on Apple TV.

Here's what to know about Boxing Day — now stretching into Boxing Week — and how to shop the best deals this year. Once reserved as a day for packing Christmas boxes to deliver to people in need, Boxing Day soon became a day where people would open boxes (I.e. their holiday presents) as well. Related: The Best Gift Cards to Get Delivered Instantly In many countries around the world, Boxing Day is a national holiday, with many referring to it as the second day of Christmas. Despite the growing popularity of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Boxing Day continues to be big business for retailers in Canada, along with Australia, New Zealand, the UK and other countries in Europe and the Caribbean. New data shows more and more U.S. stores getting in on the Boxing Day buzz this year as well, with retailers using the day to clear excess inventory and off-load goods before new products and pricing come in for 2026. Boxing Day 2025 offers a chance to save big, with some analysts noting that “discounts during Boxing Day are often deeper than regular seasonal sales,” thanks to “extreme markdowns, especially online.” Even better: while it used to just be on Dec. 26, Boxing Day sales have now expanded into Boxing Week sales, offering even more days to save.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their time together was horrifically cut short when Romy found the filmmaker and her mother, Michele Singer Reiner, stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14. Days later, her troubled brother Nick was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. “Happy birthday to my other best friend,” she wrote on Instagram at the time, along with several photos capturing their sweet memories. Just weeks before his death, Romy was seen enjoying a family vacation with her dad. Romy notably had a big smile as she splashed around with the late Hollywood icon. Last October, Romy posted an Instagram video in which she was seen cutting her dad's hair while asking him for career advice. “Since the nepo thing isn't working out, I'm asking my dad for some help in another arena… what do you think?” she captioned the adorable post. “My career hasn't even remotely taken off,” she said in the clip before jokingly asking if he would be willing to pay for her to get a “Brazilian Butt Lift” surgery to make people take her more seriously. The video ended with Rob offering some sage advice, deadpanning, “I would say don't do it, but my feeling is — it's your ass.” Romy and Rob have a hilarious back-and-forth in which they both decide not to further discuss his second rule. “I don't wanna know about the middle one,” Romy said, to which he replied, “No, I don't think you want to hear about that…This is a father-daughter thing… How much do you need to know about your father's prostate?” Romy wasn't just best friends with her dad — they were also neighbors, as she lived right across the street from her parents' home. “Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” Romy and Jake said in a statement to Page Six on Dec. 17. The siblings described Rob and Michele as being more than just parents, calling them their “best friends.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life,” they wrote. “Everyone just wants to help in any way that they can.” Romy has also been leaning on Jake, with a source sharing that they are both “numb right now.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dolly Parton was lonely when, at age 18, she moved to Nashville as an aspiring singer/songwriter. She was also desperately poor — so much so that she sometimes resorted to cruising hotel hallways at night, searching for half-eaten room-service trays waiting to be picked up. “Even a basically honest person,” she has said, “can do desperate things when hunger begins gnawing at them.” But there was one bright spot during her early days in the country music capital: Parton had met a local boy at the laundromat. Carl Dean's good looks struck Parton, as author Martha Ackmann notes in her upcoming biography of the singer, “Ain't Nobody's Fool.” Parton liked that “he seemed more interested in who she was than what she looked like.” “In addition, Dolly had seen the price women paid for marrying early and having a bunch of kids.” She also didn't see herself as a typical housewife. “They just flipped over each other,” Parton's longtime pal Judy Ogle, who she grew up with in Sevier County, Tennessee, says in the book. “If Clint Eastwood and the Marlboro Man had a kid, it would be Carl.” There was one big thing Dean and Parton did not have in common. Once, he visited his sweetheart in the studio while she was recording 1966's “Dumb Blonde” but quickly left. One of Parton's most iconic songs, “Jolene,” meanwhile, came about after she noticed that a redheaded bank teller appeared to have a crush on Dean and began teasing him about it. (The name, however, came from a little girl who asked Parton for an autograph.) Both Dean, who owned a paving company, and Parton had conditions for each other: He would never attend a movie premiere or awards show with her. While he would sometimes drive her to appearances at the Grand Ole Opry, Ackmann writes, “Carl told Dolly he had no stomach for glitz or a tuxedo. Dolly's friend Fred Foster lived near them and told Ackmann that the couple went on camping trips out West and had getaway vacations to Florida. Foster says “their marriage may seem strange to a lot of people, but they seem[ed] to get along with their style.” Dean would also secretly visit Dollywood, Parton's theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, near where she grew up. Parton, meanwhile, proved herself to be a savvy businesswoman who knew her worth. When Elvis Presley's manager, the infamous Colonel Tom Parker, called to say Presley wanted to record “I Will Always Love You,” Parton — a longtime fan — was overjoyed. Then she found out that Presley only recorded songs for which he owned all or half of the publishing rights. By the mid-70s, Parton was touring incessantly but not making much money after expenses. “When you son-of-a-bitches learn how to sell a female Elton John with long hair and big boobs that dresses like a freak,” she reportedly said, “then we'll make some money.” “I'll go somewhere, drink some beer, and shoot the bull with you,” he told reporters. “But I am absolutely and positively not going to discuss Dolly.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A vivid $77 million sexual assault and sexual battery lawsuit against Tyler Perry filed by the same lawyer behind a similar action earlier this year is just more of the same in search of a payout, claims the “betrayed” Madea star's high-profile attorney. “Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,” Alex Spiro said today of the big-bucks jury-trial-seeking claims from Mario Rodriguez against Perry and “Boo! Spiro, who has successfully repped Alec Baldwin, Jay-Z and many an A-lister over the years with a slugger's approach, is certainly putting forth the narrative of how he wants the Jonathan Delshad-represented Rodriguez's Los Angeles Superior Court case to go down in flames. There is no denying Rodriguez's suit is similar in tone and format to the ongoing $260 million sexual harassment and assault suit initially filed in June in LASC by Delshad for his client, The Oval actor Derek Dixon, against Perry. At the same time, there is no denying that Rodriguez's 23-page complaint filed December 25 is full of potentially damning text message screen grabs, remarks about oral sex and other suggestive conversation from an allegedly predatory Perry. There are also apparent cringey proclamations by the filmmaker like, “You know Mario, I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner.” and a number of subsequent meet-ups — such as a November 14, 2018 Beverly Hills dinner at Mastro's Steakhouse to discuss more potential roles for model Rodriguez that saw a cameo of sorts from John Cena — the complaint is also full of graphic and specific details. Perry reached into Mr. Rodriguez's underwear and grabbed his penis,” the filing exclaims of an alleged assault eight years ago. Perry was making sexual moaning noises and saying, ‘Stay here, stay here,' while he pressed his body against Mr. Rodriguez and continued to grab his penis.” Capping off that alleged incident, the filing claims Perry “stuffed $5,000.00 in Mr. Rodriguez's pocket” as the slightly inebriated Rodriguez was waiting for an Uber to take him home from Perry's house. Claiming “PTSD … psychological, emotional and economic injuries” from Perry's alleged actions towards him, Rodriguez (who did play a “very good looking college student” in 2016's Boo!) and lawyer Delshad have hauled Lionsgate into all this. Their argument is disarmingly simple, though with an odd misspelling of the studio's name. “Lions Gate should have known of Perry's misconduct as Perry has had many such allegations made against him in the past,” the complaint states. “But for Lions Gate's failure to act and enforce their morality clauses and other safeguards, the sexual assaults would not have occurred as Perry would not have been in a position of power.” Lionsgate, as it is actually spelled, did not respond tonight to Deadline's request for comment on the lawsuit and its place in it. In terms of someone who did respond, Spiro may be swinging in defense of his client, but the NYC-based Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan partner is not altogether off the mark with his strong statement. Rodriguez decided to take action with his claims after a Sean “Diddy” Combs-referencing friend texted him on June 18 with news of Dixon's case. Rodriguez realized that Mr. Perry was continuing to use his power and influence to sexually assault hopeful actors, and, with the voice of others, decided it was time to tell his story, obtain justice, and finally stop Mr. Perry,” this week's filing says. Interestingly, with all the text exchanges displayed in Rodriguez's filing, this possibly explosive one is not there to see. Now, to Spiro's slamming of Rodriguez via Delshad and the Dixon matter, it is more nuanced in reality. For instance, the case hasn't actually “failed,” as Spiro claims. Delshad's case against Perry for Dixon hasn't exactly nosedived, but it has had an unconventional path through the legal system so far. On December 12, a federal judge ruled that Dixon had not proved he had residence in the state and denied the return to state court. A consequence of Judge John Walker's decision was that Dixon's case was then shifted to federal court in Georgia, Perry's home base. Sitting with Judge Sarah E. Geraghty in the Peach State the past two weeks of this holiday season, Dixon's case hasn't seen much more movement. Which means, once Lady Justice picks up the pace and assuming there is no settlement, 2026 could very likely see Tyler Perry fighting pricey sexual assault cases on two sides of the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Law & Order” and “FBI” actor Bret Shuford offered a quiet, heartfelt update as he continues treatment following his cancer diagnosis. Stephen wore a matching hat and leaned in close, turning the photograph into an emotional holiday moment for the couple. We are so grateful for your love and support! The couple, widely known as Broadway Husbands through their joint account, received an outpouring of encouragement. “So many hugs and blessings for you guys. Brett, we are thinking of and cheering you on to beat this thing. “Sending love through these tough days,” a third commented. Earlier this year, Shuford revealed he had been diagnosed with HLH and T-Cell Lymphoma, described as “a rare and life-threatening immune condition, according to his GoFundMe page. According to a GoFundMe page created by a close family friend, the diagnosis forced Shuford to step away from his graduate studies at the University of Central Florida. The health setback arrived as he and Stephen were settling into a new home in Orlando with their young son, Maverick. “What should have been a season of new beginnings has instead turned into an unexpected battle for health and stability,” the fundraiser states. Last month, Shuford and Stephen looked back on a joyful memory from the previous Christmas, when they celebrated their first holiday season as a family of three. The video showed Shuford holding their son as he and Stephen danced in front of a decorated tree, all three wearing Santa hats. “Flashback to our first Christmas dance as a family! Excited to all be together again for more holiday fun!” the caption read. Shuford's television credits include a 2018 appearance on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and a 2023 role on “FBI: Most Wanted.” Shuford and Stephen, who works at Walt Disney World, got married in April 2011.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sex is hot, but it's the swoony romantic highs and tender insights into queer first love and self-acceptance that make HBO's breakout hit special. Much has been written, including by my THR colleague Seth Abramovitch, about the phenomenal numbers of women devouring Canadian streamer Crave and HBO's sizzling gay hockey series, Heated Rivalry. Episode three perhaps encapsulates that appeal in a few simple words. “Can I fuck you?” asks Scott Hunter (François Arnaud), captain of the New York Admirals. “Absolutely,” replies his new boyfriend, smoothie barista and grad student Kip (Robbie G.K.), with gusto. I'm thrilled that the ladies are getting a kick out of Jacob Tierney's addictive series based on the novels by Rachel Reid, I really am. Sure, I've been known to scowl when the Provincetown ferry dumps packs of Boston bachelorettes onto the wharf and they flood Commercial Street in their crooked tiaras, drunkenly squealing, “Omigod, the gays are so much fun!” Or when they stagger up to male couples and slur, “You guys are so cute! So if women want to experience the sexual and emotional frisson of a show about gay hockey players rattling the closet doors while fucking like bunnies, I say “All are welcome” — to quote fabulous gay icon Tangina from Poltergeist. But so much attention to female fandom — “wine moms,” as Tierney affectionately calls them — risks overshadowing what a bountiful gift Heated Rivalry is to the gays. That becomes increasingly apparent as each successive episode taps into richer veins of queer experience concerning the fight between desire and self-denial. But what sneaks up on you is the sweetness with which Heated Rivalry captures a transitional time in gay men's lives, a time that can be terrifying or freeing, isolating or joyfully communal — or sometimes all those things at once. (All the teams are fictional, though modeled on self-evident real-world NHL counterparts.) It's months in narrative time though minutes in screen time until they first get naked and go at it together — following a horny shower scene that launched a double-butt meme for the ages. Their clandestine encounters, evolving over years in secrecy whenever they find themselves in the same city as their fame continues to rise, grow more physically urgent but also more anxiety-inducing. When lust makes way for deeper feelings, things get more complicated than just coordinating hotel rendezvous. The hyper-masculine world of professional sports is its own thing, and for countless athletes past and present, a uniquely intimidating arena in which to navigate coming out — or staying in hiding. For those of us who go back far enough to recall a time of minimal cultural representation and legislative rights, the memory will always be raw. Heated Rivalry captures that limbo state with compassion and tenderness. Tierney deftly amplifies that suspense by stoking their reputations as fierce competitors on the ice and even in private. Playful teasing initially allows them to keep their guards up. Ilya, whose chilly family life in Moscow, with a stern, impossible-to-please father and a leech of a brother, has contributed to his sharp-edged manner, hides behind his cocky swagger, repeatedly reminding Shane that he's “boring.” Mixed-race Shane — more openly vulnerable and socially awkward, his career micro-managed by his loving but laser-focused Japanese Canadian mother (Christina Chang) — informs Ilya more than once that he's “an asshole.” There's a wrenching private moment in an elevator after Adorable Baby Keanu, sorry, I mean Shane, pulls away and we see how much his romantic yearning is hurting him. The brief scene hits acute notes of impossible love and inevitable heartbreak. But ultimately, it's smoldering tough guy Ilya who cracks first, confessing his feelings during a phone call — in Russian — that represents a major breakthrough in emotional transparency for the character, even if Shane doesn't understand a word of it. After reeling us in with two opening episodes entirely centered on the Shane-Ilya connection, Tierney turns the tables in episode three by abruptly shifting to Scott, a character previously observed only in passing, and Kip, the only one of the four principals who is out and at ease with who he is. Scott has endured the crushing loss of Kip, for whom being kept in hiding was suffocating. It's a scene familiar from the emotional climaxes of innumerable movies and TV shows as obstacles crumble and exultant love reigns, though it's seldom afforded to queer couples. And damned if it's not a ravishing thrill, given an extra kick by the shock and confusion on the unsuspecting faces of Shane and Ilya, watching the championship game on TV in different parts of North America. Potential problems arise, such as how they sustain their relationship without jeopardizing their hockey careers, or what happens when Shane's father stops by and catches them mid-smooch. Sure, there will be challenges ahead, but the simple fact that they tackle these questions together makes nothing seem insurmountable. Plenty of other TV shows have charted the rocky paths of love between gay men — Queer as Folk, Looking and Heartstopper, to name three prominent examples. But the combination of sex-positivity and swoony romantic wish-fulfillment makes Heated Rivalry hugely satisfying, taking it far beyond the notion of “Canadian gay hockey smut,” as it's been reductively called. Perhaps it was inevitable that female viewers would respond to a series not only rejoicing in man-on-man love but also expressing gratitude for the precious lifeline of friendships between women and gay men, in which the absence of sexual tension can make way for a unique kind of intimate understanding. With disarming generosity of spirit, Tierney and Reid give their characters fortitude through female besties who intuit their desires, often before they themselves can take ownership of them. Bisexual Ilya's occasional fuck buddy Svetlana (Ksenia Daniela Kharmalova) knows everything there is to know about hockey and everything there is to know about her friend's heart. His colleague at the smoothie shop, Maria (Bianca Nugara), can cram a full hilarious spectrum of approval into the word “Girl!” every time Scott stops by for his regular blueberry and banana blend. And Kip's closest pal Elena (Nadine Bhabha) is like a glam guardian angel, looking out for his emotional safety — and even Scott's — with the protectiveness of a devoted big sister. But let's not understate what a tonic the show is for queer audiences. Only one gay friend out of many who have been watching has expressed reservations, complaining that the hockey scenes are unconvincing. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toby Morton, a 'South Park' alum, has been cleverly buying up domains of mostly right-wing politicians, then satirizing their motivations, policies and the way power repackages itself. A former South Park voice-over actor and writer turned online activist who has been purchasing the web domain names of mostly Republican politicians and action groups, is sharing news about his latest project after he made a prescient move in snatching up two Trump Kennedy Center domains months ahead of the president's naming overhaul of the national arts institution. Toby Morton's career in satirical comedy started when he loaned his voice to the long-running hit series back in the early aughts as Eric Cartman's red-headed foil, Scott Tenorman; as Morton tells The Hollywood Reporter, this led to some consulting work with the series and he then moved between a range of projects, script rewrites, punch-ups, and development work across different productions. He also found a more politically motivated way to spend his time around 2019, when he began buying political domains as a means of pre-meddling in the politics of the right. Trump's Christmas of Chaos: Hosting a Rebranded Kennedy Center Honors, Over 100 Angry Truth Social Posts Bill Maher Says Larry David "Certainly Is Not My Friend" Following NYT Essay Mocking Trump Visit “It began as a kind of absurdist experiment: What happens if you take the branding of powerful or loud political figures and simply tell the truth through it?” he posited. But if Morton has his way, this won't come as easily online. He's also been at this for six years, and in that time has not only had fun satirizing politicians but also initiated real political change. It didn't just get attention; it helped shift public awareness during the 2023 school board races and, in many places, contributed to keeping extremist candidates out of local power. Moms for Liberty, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is a “far-right organization” that engages in “anti-student inclusion activities” that self-identifies as part of the modern parental rights movement. The group grew out of opposition to public health regulations for COVID-19, opposes LGBTQ+ and racially inclusive school curriculum, and has advocated for book bans, the SPLC indicates. On Morton's website, the homepage introduction reads: “We are an extremist organization that prides itself on making sure that freedom of speech and choice only applies to those who believe gays are demonic, Hitler actually wasn't that bad so Jews should stop overreacting, any transgender are considered trash and need to be disposed of, current teachers in this society should be under the control of fascists who know better, and that any teachers who disobey deserve to be handled by any means necessary and this includes physical control.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Avatar: Fire and Ash is already halfway to $1B worldwide in its first week, James Cameron has a contingency plan in place for his massive franchise. The 3x Oscar winner teased his plans for Avatar 4 and 5 after the third installment's premiere, noting that he will “hold a press conference” if he decides not to continue the movie franchise, which began in 2009. “I don't know if the saga goes beyond this point. I hope it does,” he told Entertainment Weekly. If we don't get to make 4 and 5, for whatever reason, I'll hold a press conference and I'll tell you what we were gonna do. The writer/director also noted that, despite there being “no business model for it anymore,” Cameron also wants to novelize the films, noting “it might be good to have the canonical record of what it was all supposed to be.” Despite already filming some scenes for Avatar 4, Cameron previously said on Deadline's Behind the Lens of the possibility of another film, “I always say ‘if,' but will it be profitable enough, and only we will know that.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. I've studied film and worked in television my whole life at this point. I understand his whole filmography and revere the man.

In Boston, we fell short of that, and I'm truly sorry to everyone who was impacted.” Jane's Addiction also shared a statement of their own, saying that the band “unilaterally determined it would be best to not continue the tour,” adding that they “made inaccurate statements about Perry's mental health, which we regret.” Pink Floyd's Mesmerizing 'Wish You Were Here' Video Arrives 50 Years After Song's Release ‘American Idol' Comes to Jesus, Finds Rebirth in Faith-Based Music Bono and Imelda May Bring 'Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)' to the Streets of Dublin Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maxton Hall and The Culpables have set streaming alight, smashing viewing records and bringing in a prized younger demo. As the influence of BookTok and the social chatter around key titles grows, a raft of young adult and Wattpad titles are set for the film and TV treatment in 2026. We run the rule over what's cooking for 2026 and dish up a tip sheet for the year ahead. It's safe to say, love is in the air. Mercedes Ron is a Wattpad star writer, so much so that Prime Video has created a ‘House Of Ron' brand for all of the upcoming film and series interpretations of her novels. Ron's Culpables series has defined the modern era of Wattpad adaptations, and in Culpa Mia (My Fault), Culpa Tuya (Your Fault) and Culpa Nuestra (Our Fault) have delivered Prime a hit franchise. A Look Ahead At London's West End In 2026: Cynthia Erivo, Josh O'Connor, Tilda Swinton & Gary Oldman Among Stars Returning To The Theater Two Enfrentados movies are coming, based on Ron's two-book series. Marfíl (Ivory) and Ébano (Ebony) are made by Pokeepsie Films, which produced the Culpables trilogy and they tell us they are taking things up a level with the new movies. Ester Expósito (Élite) plays Marfil, the daughter of a Spanish tycoon whose NYC lifestyle is shaken after she is kidnapped and then released. The first three of Flor M. Salvador's ‘Boulevard' series have racked up over 140M reads on Wattpad, and a fourth instalment is on the way. The first movie, Boulevard, is in production in Spain with a screenplay from the pen of YA author Javier Ruescas. She knows she should stay away from Luke, but is inexplicably drawn to him, seeing beyond the damaged exterior that everyone else is quick to judge. Based on Isabelle Ronin's novel, the plot turns on a straight-A student, Veronica, who refuses to be college heartthrob Caleb's latest conquest…despite the undeniable chemistry between them. Circumstances see Veronica end up under Caleb's roof, and secrets unravel in the slow-burn romance. Another one from Wattpad Webtoon Studios, Rehab Entertainment and the Jim Henson Company are also on board the adaptation of Meredith Moriarty's title. It is being worked up as a supernatural series with Ray Utarnachitt (DC's Legends of Tomorrow) on writing detail. The story follows Ellie whose world is upended when she meets paranormal detective Ichabod, who may hold answers to her psychic powers. The pair investigate paranormal mysteries involving ghosts, vampires, witches, demons, and more. Another webcomic adaptation in the works is Stagtown, with Benjamin Brewer, Lead VFX Artist on Everything Everywhere All at Once, writing and directing, and Margot Robbie's Lucky Chap Entertainment and Wattpad Webtoon Studios producing. Comic artist Punko created ‘Stagtown', and Brewer will bring it to life as a live-action movie. June White moves to Italy for a fresh start after her brother's death. At her new elite school, she is drawn to James, a dangerous bully involved in clandestine MMA fights, but then begins dating his best friend, Will. That's the set-up for Love Me Love Me, an Italian YA movie, based on the first novel in the four-book series from Stefania S, and which has notched 23M-plus views. Tamara Lush has been one of Wattpad's most popular writers for some time and has finally landed her first feature adaptation with her 2022 Wattpad original, Drive. Soon the lie threatens to destroy everything, including what has long since become more than just a game. Amazon has teamed with Bavaria Fiction to adapt the webnovel, which Karsten Guenther is producing, Chris Silber and Malina Nwabuonwor wrote the screenplay, and Sergej Moya is directing. Spanish filmmaker Marçal Forés began shooting his latest feature, Bad Boy's Girl, in early December. The movie is a co-production between Italy and Spain with Lotus Production and Diamond Films España on board. The story follows Tessa O'Connell, who has only two goals for senior year: to keep her head down, and to get over the heartbreak of seeing her longtime crush date her ex-best friend.
