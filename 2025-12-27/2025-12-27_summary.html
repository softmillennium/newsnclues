Amani Abdramane bustled around her donkey in the makeshift camp where she lives in the Central African Republic.

In this northern part of the country, on the edge of the Sahel, the sun is scorching and sand is swallowing the last traces of vegetation.

The 18-year-old adjusted a pink scarf covering her head and shoulders, and pondered what she wanted from today's general election that would choose local and regional officials, members of parliament and a new president.

“I hope the person I vote for brings peace,” she said of the seven candidates vying to become head of state.

They include Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who is seeking a third consecutive term.

Displaced by decades of conflict, young people such as Abdramane who live in camps around the town of Birao see the elections as a chance for a better future.

Abdramane in 2015 fled ethnic violence in Sissi, her home village, with her mother and eight siblings. Her father had been killed a few months earlier.

“I just want my brothers, sisters and me to be able to go to school,” she said.

Abdramane had just completed her second year of school, aged eight, when her family had to flee. She has not returned to lessons since.

Now the teenager and other young people are counting on the elections to bring them peace, education and opportunities beyond life as displaced persons.

The last polls were in 2020, but lack of security meant even those old enough to vote at the time were unable to do so.

There is a crowd outside the community radio station in the Korsi neighborhood of Birao, which serves as a distribution center for voter registration cards.

Marina Hajram, 18, would be voting for the first time.

“I'm so happy,” she said, clutching her voter card.

Behind her in the queue, 25-year-old Issa Abdoul agreed the elections were essential “to continue the reconstruction of our country.”

Korsi is home to thousands of internally displaced people, as well as many refugees from Sudan.

Across the country, there were 416,000 internally displaced people as of last month, the vast majority of whom are younger than 25 and would be voting for the first time.

For them, the mere act of obtaining a voter registration card is a challenge. They must produce an identity document, but many lost everything when they fled, including ID papers.

Peace is one of the things these young people most want.

Although the situation has improved in much of the country, particularly in cities, violence persists in the northeast on the border between the two Sudans. This is mainly due to incursions by Sudanese armed forces, who are waging war in a region already plagued by abuses blamed on rebel groups.

Issene Abdoulkasim, 23, only made it to the third year of primary school. Now, he wants to become a tailor so he could afford to study again.

“I dream of studying so I can become a member of parliament. Because as an MP I'll be able to bring peace and development,” he said. “I want to put an end to conflicts, tensions and everything that is destroying our country.”



                                                                                The death of a former head of China's one-child policy has been met not by tributes, but by castigation of the abandoned policy on social media this week.
State media praised Peng Peiyun (彭珮雲), former head of China's National Family Planning Commission from 1988 to 1998, as “an outstanding leader” in her work related to women and children.
The reaction on Chinese social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.
“Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there” in the afterlife, one person posted on China's Sina Weibo platform.

‘POLITICAL LOYALTY':
                                        The move breaks with decades of precedent among US administrations, which have tended to leave career ambassadors in their posts                                        US President Donald Trump's administration has ordered dozens of US ambassadors to step down, people familiar with the matter said, a precedent-breaking recall that would leave embassies abroad without US Senate-confirmed leadership. 
The envoys, career diplomats who were almost all named to their jobs under former US president Joe Biden, were told over the phone in the past few days they needed to depart in the next few weeks, the people said. 
They would not be fired, but finding new roles would be a challenge given that many are far along in their careers and opportunities for senior diplomats can                                    


RUSHED:
                                        The US pushed for the October deal to be ready for a ceremony with Trump, but sometimes it takes time to create an agreement that can hold, a Thai official said                                        Defense officials from Thailand and Cambodia are to meet tomorrow to discuss the possibility of resuming a ceasefire between the two countries, Thailand's top diplomat said yesterday, as border fighting entered a third week.
A ceasefire agreement in October was rushed to ensure it could be witnessed by US President Donald Trump and lacked sufficient details to ensure the deal to end the armed conflict would hold, Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs Sihasak Phuangketkeow said after an ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
The two countries agreed to hold talks using their General Border Committee, an established bilateral mechanism, with Thailand                                    



                                                                                Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese yesterday announced plans for a national bravery award to recognize civilians and first responders who confronted “the worst of evil” during an anti-Semitic terror attack that left 15 dead and has cast a heavy shadow over the nation's holiday season.
Albanese said he plans to establish a special honors system for those who placed themselves in harm's way to help during the attack on a beachside Hanukkah celebration, like Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian Muslim who disarmed one of the assailants before being wounded himself.

This past June, Ashley Voss-Barnes received a court summons in the mail.

PrairieStar Health Center, a nonprofit community health center in south-central Kansas, was suing her for $675 and her wife for $732 in unpaid medical bills. Voss-Barnes knew the clinic received federal funding to make preventive health care accessible in a region where many families, including her own, needed financial help.

She didn't understand what led to the lawsuit. She and her wife had a blended family of five kids that cost a lot to keep healthy. As a result, years ago, the couple had asked PrairieStar if they could set up an ongoing payment plan to automatically take money from their checking accounts multiple times a month. Voss-Barnes would later state in a court filing that PrairieStar never informed her those payments were not enough to cover her bills and keep her out of collections. 

“If I have something due, then I will try to pay it,” she said to ProPublica. “It came out of nowhere.”

Voss-Barnes, a nurse who feels confident navigating the health care system, wanted to push back. She reached out to a local lawyer to see if he could represent them, but he said the debt was too small to be worth it. So she represented herself, filing a letter in court objecting to the lawsuit and asking to continue the existing payment plan.

Eventually, Voss-Barnes and her wife agreed to set up new payment plans with the collections agency for the debt, to avoid having the money taken directly from their paychecks through wage garnishment. To their dismay, they owed hundreds more in interest, court costs and lawyer fees as a result of PrairieStar's decision to sue. 

They worry about PrairieStar suing them again. “I know we're not the only ones this has happened to,” Voss-Barnes said.

The lawsuits against the two women are among at least 1,000 that PrairieStar has filed against patients since 2020 for unpaid medical bills, according to a ProPublica analysis of state court records over that period. Many patients PrairieStar sued were uninsured and made so little money they qualified for discounted care, a former patient accounts employee told ProPublica.

Community health centers like PrairieStar Health, also known as federally qualified health centers, were created to serve as medical safety nets for people who struggle to afford primary care. They were established during the Civil Rights Movement-era “War on Poverty,” when federal officials realized that low-income Americans, overwhelmed by long drives and crowded hospitals, were forgoing medical attention. The health centers receive federal grants in exchange for serving patients regardless of their ability to pay, increasing access across large swaths of the country.

But ProPublica found that several of these health centers are suing patients and garnishing their paychecks — which experts say contradicts their mission. We identified two other centers in Kansas, plus one in rural Virginia and one in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that consistently filed lawsuits against patients since at least 2020. Our search, which was not exhaustive, focused on states and counties where court records are publicly accessible online. We also reviewed documents from a municipality in Alaska and a county in California that run community health centers, which showed they use outside debt collectors to pursue what patients owe.

Leaders of five community health centers, including PrairieStar, told ProPublica they send patients to collections or file lawsuits against them as a last resort, after sending statements and offering payment plans. Three pointed to the financial instability that community health centers face as a reason to pursue patient debt. All five stressed that they did not turn away patients who could not afford medical care, citing a goal to make health care accessible.

In response to questions from ProPublica, PrairieStar CEO Bryant Anderson said that the health center faces “a perfect storm” caring for patients while also dealing with higher costs and unstable funding. “With all the challenges PrairieStar faces to maintain access to care for the uninsured and the underinsured, having someone imply that we don't fulfill our mission is certainly rubbing salt in the wounds,” he wrote in an email.

Anderson said PrairieStar generally tries six times to communicate with patients before sending them to collections. He also said every patient is given the option to apply for sliding-scale discounts based on income and about a third choose not to provide that information.

Other health center leaders also explained their decision to pursue patient debt through lawsuits, in response to questions from ProPublica. “We understand that sending accounts to collections can seem at odds with that mission, and it's not a decision we take lightly,” said Renee Hively, the CEO of CareArc, a community health center in Kansas. CareArc has appeared in local news for pursuing one patient's medical bill through a lawsuit and wage garnishments for more than 12 years, contributing to her being unable to afford basic utilities. (CareArc did not respond to a request for comment about that particular case.)

A spokesperson for the department that oversees community health centers in Monterey County, California, told ProPublica that most unpaid bills it sends to collections “involve small amounts that do not justify the cost of initiating legal proceedings.” As a result, none of its patients have been sued since 2019. If the health centers ever stopped sending patients to collections, the spokesperson said, the financial effect would be “minimal.”

Most of the public attention on medical debt and related lawsuits has been focused on hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals that receive tax breaks in order to make care more affordable. Hospitals must provide emergency care regardless of whether the patient can afford it but are not required to provide primary care like checkups or routine screenings. Nonprofit hospitals are required by federal law to check whether patients qualify for financial help before suing them or garnishing their wages.

Community health centers, on the other hand, must make “every reasonable effort” to collect money from patients before writing it off, according to federal law. 

Though experts and leaders of other health centers say the centers have ample freedom to decide what “reasonable” means — and whether to pursue debt through collections agencies and the courts — Anderson said the manner in which PrairieStar collects debts is mandated by the law. 

He also said that ProPublica may be trying to “induce” other health centers to violate federal law by reporting and writing this story. “Your messaging would therefore be dangerous and intimate that such health centers were not required to make ‘every reasonable effort to secure payments' for their services,” he wrote.

But experts on community health center finances said that federal law does not require the centers to send patients to collections. “There's no law that says you have to garnish wages or that you have to go after someone through collections,” said Ray Jorgensen, a health care billing consultant who said he has worked with hundreds of community health centers over about 30 years. “I would say that's an anomaly. That's not the norm.”

Anderson did not answer specific questions about PrairieStar's lawsuits or wage garnishments. He repeatedly said that ProPublica did “not have all the facts” and that the story would be “potentially defamatory,” but he did not clarify what he felt was missing or inaccurate. Nor did he respond directly to questions about Voss-Barnes' experience, even though she and her wife signed privacy waivers allowing him to do so. Voss-Barnes said that he reached out to her directly, telling her that everyone in their Kansas city would know that she had failed to pay her medical bills if she moved forward with the article. (He did not respond when asked about that outreach.) He did tell ProPublica that he personally contacted both a former employee and another patient who ProPublica had asked him about. The patient stopped responding to ProPublica.

Medical debt experts said they were surprised and horrified to hear that community health centers were using lawsuits and third-party debt collectors to recover money from patients, given their intended purpose of providing care to people who have no other options. Under federal law, community health centers must provide discounted care on a sliding scale for patients who make at or below 200% of the federal poverty guideline, an amount that varies based on family size and household income. A family of four must make under $64,300 to receive a discount. Medical debt disproportionately burdens Black, Hispanic, low-income and uninsured patients — groups more likely to use community health centers for affordable care.

“Patients who have been sued because of medical debt are likely to avoid care in the future,” said Miriam Straus, policy adviser for Community Catalyst, a health advocacy group. “These collection activities seem to violate at least the spirit of the requirement to provide health services available to all.”

On Virginia's Eastern Shore, a narrow peninsula bordered by the Atlantic and the Chesapeake Bay, getting sued by the community health care center is a regular occurrence. Over the last decade, Eastern Shore Rural Health filed more than 7,000 lawsuits for unpaid medical bills in two counties where 45,000 people live.

It sued one couple for $59 in January 2024, an amount that ballooned by more than 600% within months due to interest, court costs and lawyer fees. Court records show money regularly garnished from people working in the low-wage industries that abound on the Eastern Shore, including poultry processing and retail.

On an August morning in Accomack County's civil court, Eastern Shore Rural Health accounted for most of the cases on the judge's docket. One man who showed up to court told ProPublica that the visit potentially cost him hundreds of dollars because he missed out on lucrative hours harvesting oysters and clams. He only spoke Spanish and the court did not make a translator available; the judge told him to return for another hearing in the fall. Most people didn't show up to court at all, meaning the health center won by default.

ProPublica did not find any other community health centers in Virginia consistently suing patients for unpaid bills in the court records.

Eastern Shore Rural Health began using lawsuits to collect medical debt about 20 years ago after conversations about “maximizing our revenue,” according to Kandy Bruno, the organization's chief financial officer. A local company called Bay Area Receivables handles its collections and takes 30% to 40% of what it recovers from patients through the court. The minimum amount that Eastern Shore sends to collections is $25, Bruno said.

Bruno said Eastern Shore sends patients to collections when it has exhausted other options, including sending out letters, offering interest-fee payment plans and helping fill out Medicaid applications. “We should never have to send anyone to collections,” she said. “It should be 100% avoidable.” She also said the number of lawsuits the company had filed in a decade was not very high compared to the 32,400 patients seen there last year.

Patients are never refused health care, no matter how much they owe, she said.

Virginia recently passed a law that experts say would stop at least some of Eastern Shore Rural Health's debt collection practices starting next summer. The law prohibits large medical providers from garnishing wages of patients who qualify for financial assistance. 

Bruno said she hasn't yet looked into how the Virginia law would affect the health center or its patients on the sliding scale. “We will absolutely comply with and make adjustments to comply with the letter of the new law,” she said.

The health center is the main option for preventive care on the peninsula; otherwise, people have to make the long drive up to Maryland or pay tolls, often totaling more than $20, to cross the bridge over the Chesapeake Bay. More than 70% of people who live on the Eastern Shore see doctors at the health center, including higher-income people with private insurance through their jobs, Bruno said. 

That means some of the patients, she said, make enough to “take responsibility for their care.” But the health center does not track what percentage of patients sent to collections receive financial assistance or make so little that their checks legally cannot be garnished. 

Brittney Shea, a single mom with two teenagers, has been sued three times by Eastern Shore Rural Health since 2021. She and both of her children have chronic health conditions that require them to see doctors and specialists frequently, and the $25 co-payments add up quickly, she said.

Most recently, the health center sued her last October for about $2,000 in medical bills and an additional $760 in lawyer fees and court costs, records show. The money was garnished from multiple paychecks from her Walmart job.

Shea is aware that she ends up paying more through garnishments than she would if she paid her medical bills on time. But she said the money just isn't there on the front end, especially when she has been out of work due to health emergencies. Sometimes she avoids seeing doctors when she is feeling sick to avoid owing more money. 

The cycle of lawsuits and garnishments has made it harder to provide for her children, she said. “You expect this money, but then they're garnishing you,” she said. “Now you got to figure out how you're going to feed them, how you're going to put gas in your car to go back and forth to work, how you're going to pay your rent.”

Many regions served by community health centers lack primary care options and have a real need for them. That was the case in Hutchinson, Kansas, a historic salt mining town northwest of Wichita, in the 1990s when the local hospital came up with the idea to start PrairieStar Health.

When Aimee Jones started working at PrairieStar in 2015, she had only ever been on the patient side of debt collection. After a difficult divorce decades earlier, she'd had trouble paying outstanding medical bills and filed for bankruptcy to avoid having her wages garnished.

As a patient accounts representative, Jones was responsible for handing patients' debt over to an outside collection agency once she had exhausted efforts to get them to pay. PrairieStar would send out three statements and two collections notices and often make an additional phone call reminding patients of their unpaid balances and encouraging them to set up a payment plan. The last notice told them that their bill would be sent to collections. (Anderson, the PrairieStar CEO, told ProPublica the collections agency also sent patients multiple notices before escalating to lawsuits.)

Jones said she convinced her bosses to change some policies in favor of patients. The company was initially sending bills as low as $30 to collections, which Jones felt was pointless because the outside agency took a third of the money. She pushed PrairieStar to raise the threshold to $200 in outstanding debt. In more recent years, that amount increased to $500, she said.

In Kansas, unlike Virginia, lawmakers have not significantly limited how health care providers can recover medical debt. Kansas is also one of 10 states that has chosen not to expand Medicaid, leaving thousands of people unable to get health insurance — and potentially more reliant on community health centers.

Many of the patients who qualified for discounted care based on their income had no insurance, Jones said. And even with lower fees, some struggled to afford medical care at PrairieStar. “You don't stay on top of it or you come in a lot, it's going to accumulate quite fast,” Jones said. According to the health center's financial assistance policy, not all services qualify for discounts.

Jones tried hard to convince patients to pay even a few dollars each month so they could stay out of collections. Often, it worked. She was aware that some people, especially those on fixed incomes, had almost nothing to spare. If they didn't pay their bills or sign up for a payment plan within about six months, she handed their names over to the collection agency.

Jones could request permission to write off some bills for people who had endured extreme hardship, like a woman whose baby died in a house fire or another whose boyfriend and son died in a car accident. But she couldn't help everyone.

Once the collection agency referred a case for a lawsuit, it was largely out of Jones' hands, she said. PrairieStar hired a company that handles collections for hospitals in many Kansas counties — Account Recovery Specialists Inc., which has a documented history of requesting arrest warrants for patients who don't show up to court. (The collections agency told ProPublica that the warrants were ordered by a judge and that it could not discuss its contract with PrairieStar. It has previously denied using the threat of jail to get people to pay.) Each summer, the agency would send PrairieStar a long list of patient accounts deemed “uncollectible” because they had no income or assets, Jones said.

Jones, who retired last year, looks back on nearly a decade of work with a mixture of pride and sadness. She wonders if PrairieStar could have convinced more people to agree to payment plans if it hadn't contracted with an outside agency. The health center's patients would have benefited from a law like Virginia's, she said, which prevents providers from garnishing wages of patients receiving financial assistance.

“We serve the poorest of the poor. These people don't have any money,” Jones said.

Pursuing debt in court is a choice, and some community health center leaders have opted out. 

Several years before Krista Postai founded the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas in the state's poorest region, she worked at a hospital that took extreme measures to collect medical debt. As part of her job, she fielded calls from patients unhappy with the billing process. At times, she said, patients reported receiving warnings that they would be sent to collections, even though they hadn't received a bill.

When she began applying for grants to start her own clinic in 2002, she knew there had to be another way. “If your goal is really keeping people healthier, it makes more sense to deliver care at the lowest cost possible and not drive them into ERs and hospitals,” she said.

Hospitals do not make much from suing their patients, according to research in several states. (Experts did not know of similar studies on community health centers.) One study of Virginia hospitals found that wage garnishment brought in just a fraction of a percent of their total revenue, on average. But patients can see their finances devastated by these lawsuits, especially with the added interest charges, lawyer fees and court costs.

The National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit that focuses on consumer protection, urges states to set limits on health care providers collecting medical debt. Their recommendations include capping interest rates for debt at 2% a year — much lower than Kansas's 10% maximum — and prohibiting lawsuits for patients who qualify for financial help. It recommends banning wage garnishment for all patients.

Community health centers should be held to the same requirements when possible, said Berneta Haynes, policy adviser for the center. “The idea here is that certain types of egregious and aggressive debt collections really should just be banned,” she said.

Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, based in a county with a poverty rate almost twice that of the state as a whole, provides care to many people who can't afford to immediately pay their bills. Postai said the health center makes “every reasonable effort” to collect money from patients, as required by federal law. But she is determined to never outsource that work to a collections agency, despite the weekly calls she gets from companies hoping to purchase the health center's debt.

The center's internal policy says it will not send patients to collections “to ensure that patient dignity is maintained.” Its peers, she said, should do the same.

“Most people try to pay,” she said. “It makes no sense to take an already stressed population and stress them further.”

Instead, the health center finds creative ways to pull in more patients — using federal grants to open discount pharmacies, serving patients at jails and prisons, partnering with other local nonprofits. It has branched out to neighboring counties with no other sources of affordable medical care. Last year, it wrote off about $5.3 million of bad debt from patients who didn't pay their bills, about 5% of its total revenue, federal reports show.

Postai said the clinic is willing and able to sustain the loss, and she cringes thinking about patients at PrairieStar and similar health centers who may avoid returning there for medical help. 

“That's a big hole in the safety net,” she said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky take part in a signing ceremony at Mariinskyi Palace in Kyiv, Ukraine, on  Aug. 24.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Prime ‍Minister Mark Carney on ‍Saturday ​announced an additional $2.5-billion of ⁠economic aid for Ukraine.

The assistance will ‌help ‍Ukraine unlock ‍financing from ‌the International ⁠Monetary ​Fund, Carney said during an appearance with Ukrainian ​President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also spoke briefly ⁠to ⁠reporters.

Carney and Zelensky met in Halifax today ahead of peace talks hosted by the U.S. President this weekend.

Zelensky is on his way to Florida for meetings with Donald Trump, who is trying to broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.

The Ukrainian leader's stop in Canada follows a phone call between him and Carney on Friday.

Ukraine, U.S. negotiators discussed how to end war, Zelensky says

Canada has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February, 2022, committing military support along with humanitarian aid.

Zelensky has said the U.S-backed peace plan is about 90 per cent ready, but sticking points remain on security guarantees and other issues.

In a social media post after speaking with Carney, Zelensky said he believes much can be accomplished between Ukraine and the U.S., though he accused Russia of dragging its feet and trying to waste time.

Meanwhile, Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with missiles and drones early Saturday morning, killing one person and wounding 27 others, a day before the talks, local authorities said.

Explosions boomed across Kyiv for hours as ballistic missiles and drones hit the city. The attack began in the early morning hours Saturday and was continuing as day broke.

The attack came as Zelensky prepares to meet with the U.S. President in Florida on Sunday for further talks in an effort to end the nearly 4-year-old war. Zelensky said they plan to discuss issues including security guarantees and territorial issues in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that it carried out a “massive strike” overnight, using “long-range precision-guided weapons from land, air, and sea, including Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles” and drones, on energy infrastructure facilities “used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” as well as “Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises.”

The ministry said the strike came in response to Ukraine's attacks on “civilian objects” in Russia.

Ukraine open to creating demilitarized zone in Donbas, Zelensky says

Earlier on Saturday, the ministry said its air defenses shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight.

Poland scrambled fighter jets and closed airports in Lublin and Rzeszow near the border with Ukraine for several hours during the Russian attacks, the country's armed forces command said on X. There was no violation of Polish airspace, it said. Civil aviation authority Pansa said the two airports had since resumed operations. It was unclear what caused the alert in Poland when the Russian attacks were focused on Kyiv, which is far from the border.

Russia targeted Ukraine with almost 500 drones and 40 missiles of various types, Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The main target was energy and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv, he said. In some districts of the region there is no electricity or heating because of the attacks, he added.

“There have been many questions these days. Where is the Russian response to the proposals to end the war, which were made by the United States and the world?” Zelensky said. “Russian representatives hold long talks, in reality the `Kinzal' and `Shaheds' speak for them.“

There were over 10 damaged residential buildings in the attack, said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, in a post on Telegram. People were being evacuated from under the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Two children were among those wounded in the attack, which affected seven locations across the city of Kyiv said the head of Kyiv's City Military Administration Tymur Tkachenko in a statement on Telegram. A body was found under the rubble of one damaged building, said Klymenko.

A fire broke out in an 18-story residential building in the Dnipro district of the city, and emergency crews rushed to the scene to contain the flames.

A 24-story residential building in the Darnytsia district was also hit, Tkachenko said, and more fires broke out in the Obolonskyi and Holosiivsky districts.

In the wider Kyiv region, the strikes hit industrial and residential buildings, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. In the Vyshhorod area, emergency crews rescued one person found under the rubble of a destroyed house.

            When patients come to Eric Frankenfeld's chiropractic practice with insurance woes, his wife, Lisa, the office manager, tells them not to worry because she'll work with them to keep care affordable.
    


            But starting in January, the Frankenfelds might need to ask for the same treatment from their own doctors, since they will become uninsured. The Point Pleasant, New Jersey, couple will no longer be able to afford their Obamacare plan after the enhanced premiums subsidies lapse at year's end. They decided to forgo coverage after learning that their plan's premium will skyrocket to $1,928 a month, up from $340 this year.
    


            Though they are both healthy, the idea of losing coverage keeps Lisa Frankenfeld, 62, up at night — worrying one of them might be diagnosed with cancer, suffer a stroke or heart attack or get into a serious accident.
    


            “We are health care providers who cannot afford benefits. Oh, the irony,” she told CNN. “Purchasing a plan doesn't make financial sense. We're just going to cross our fingers and hope for the best.”
    


            The Frankenfelds are among the millions of Affordable Care Act enrollees who are facing tough decisions this open enrollment season, which ends January 15 in most states. More than 90% of ACA policyholders — or about 22 million people — receive the enhanced subsidies, which spurred record sign-ups for Obamacare coverage this year.
    


Obamacare enrollees: Worried about losing the enhanced subsidies? Share your story



            A sizeable share of those enrollees are self-employed or own or work at small businesses. Nearly half of adults in the individual health insurance market — the vast majority of which is purchased through Obamacare exchanges — are affiliated with a small business, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    


            Employer policies are often too pricey for small businesses and for those who work for themselves, leading many to turn to the Affordable Care Act exchanges. And even though several told CNN their Obamacare coverage requires they spend a lot out of pocket for care, they say it's still better than being uninsured.
    


            However, without the enhanced subsidies, which were enacted by the Biden administration as part of a 2021 Covid-19 relief package, enrollees' premium payments are expected to jump 114%, on average, next year. The provision's lapse also means that consumers who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level — about $62,600 for an individual and $84,600 for a couple — will no longer qualify for any federal aid.
    


            The House is set to vote in January on extending the beefed-up assistance for three years after four Republicans bucked their caucus and supported a Democratic proposal. But the measure faces a difficult path in the Senate, which voted down a similar Democratic bill earlier this month.
    


            Increasingly squeezed by the rising cost of electricity, groceries, personal and business insurance and supplies for their garage door installation and repair company, Kathy and Jeffrey Many of Brandon, Vermont, decided not to renew their Affordable Care Act coverage for 2026. The premium for their plan is shooting up to nearly $2,670 a month, from $625 this year. The cheapest one they could find is nearly $1,870 a month.
    


            Although the couple had high out-of-pocket costs for care, their Obamacare policy gave them peace of mind in case one of them had to deal with a major illness or accident, Kathy Many told CNN. Being uninsured next year will be “very nerve-wracking,” she said.
    


            “Every time Jeffrey leaves to go out on a job, I'm going to be like ‘Jesus Christ, I hope nothing happens to him today,'” said Many, 61, her voice breaking, “because everything that I've worked my whole life for could be lost to bankruptcy.”
    


            Instead of having health insurance, Many plans to sock away the $625 a month they were paying this year and “pray” that it will cover their health care expenses until her husband enrolls in Medicare in the fall and she qualifies in 2029.
    


            A lot of enrollees have been waiting to explore their Obamacare options because they didn't want to learn how much they would have to pay for coverage come January.
    


            Jeff , a freelance musician from New York City who earns so little that he did not have to pay a premium this year and last year, waited until mid-December to sign onto his state's exchange. When he saw the cheapest plan for 2026 would cost him $275 a month, he closed his laptop since he knew he couldn't afford it and would become uninsured. Instead, he went back to searching for a gig to replace one he just lost.
    


            The fact that Republicans in Congress are not renewing the enhanced subsidies infuriates Jeff, 50, a registered Democrat who asked that his last name not be used to protect his privacy.
    


            “We can find money to build an arch and a ballroom that are completely unnecessary and tax cuts for billionaires,” he said, referencing President Donald Trump's construction plans and the GOP domestic agenda package that passed this summer. “But we can't insure people medically in this country. It's unconscionable.”
    


            Some small business owners, however, can't afford to go without health insurance because they have medical conditions and need care. The spike in premiums is forcing them to consider big decisions.
    


            Sonja, who owns several real estate businesses with her husband, said they are looking into joining with another company in the hope that they can obtain group health insurance with lower premiums if they have a larger workforce. She asked not to include her last name to protect her and her business' privacy.
    


            The Minnesota couple will have to shell out more than $2,150 a month next year to cover themselves and their daughter, up from roughly $1,000 this year. Sonja, 49, is not willing to go without insurance, especially after her husband had to have surgery this year, though the higher premiums might force them to sell part of their holdings or stop saving for retirement.
    


            “In the event that we would have a major health issue, paying for insurance would be a much better spend than being uncovered and opening ourselves to the potential of losing way more,” she said.

            Vivek Ramaswamy barreled into politics as a flame-thrower willing to offend just about anyone. He declared America was in a “cold cultural civil war,” denied the existence of white supremacists, and referred to one of his rivals as “corrupt.”
    


            Now, he says he wants to be “conservative without being combative.”
    


            Ramaswamy is rebranding himself both for the Ohio governor's race, where he hopes to succeed the conservative but mild-mannered Gov. Mike DeWine, and to establish a clear lane for himself in the ongoing Republican Party debate over racial and political identity.
    


            He took the stage at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest this month to criticize Nick Fuentes and the so-called “groyper right.” He's denounced what he called the “rising prevalence of the blood-and-soil view” within his party.
    


            Having once rejected a famous line from Ronald Reagan by declaring it was “not morning in America,” Ramaswamy cited the 40th president before the Turning Point audience.
    


            “Ronald Reagan understood this,” he said. “He famously said, you know, you could go to Italy, but you would never be an Italian. You can move to Germany, but you would never be a German. You could pack your bags in China or Japan. You would never be Chinese or Japanese. But you can come from any one of those countries to the United States of America, and you can still be an American.”
    


            A lot has changed since 2023, when the 40-year-old biotech entrepreneur launched his bid for president and made himself into a national figure.
    


            Briefly a co-chair of Elon Musk's program to slash government, Ramaswamy left Washington as President Donald Trump took office and entered the race for governor of his native Ohio. And as the recent Turning Point gathering made clear, the nationally conservative movement is riven by infighting over whether to denounce or “de-platform” figures promoting racism and antisemitism.
    


            Ramaswamy distinguished himself during the last GOP primaries with radical policy proposals — among them, raising the voting age to 25 and abolishing the FBI — and confrontational interviews and debate performances. He decried the “climate change hoax,” called TikTok “digital fentanyl,” and wholeheartedly embraced Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement while still running against him.
    


            Ramaswamy accused opponents of being “bought and paid for.” Several opponents fired back.
    


            “I've had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like ChatGPT standing up here,” Chris Christie said during one debate. After Ramaswamy suggested in another debate that Nikki Haley was a hypocrite for proposing a ban on TikTok despite her daughter using the app, Haley called Ramaswamy “scum.”
    

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie joins “CNN This Morning” to discuss his 2024 presidential opponents Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy after facing off in the fourth GOP debate hosted by NewsNation.


            Now, Ramaswamy is attempting to succeed DeWine, who hails from a different era of GOP politics.
    


            Notably, despite no other major Republicans running in the gubernatorial primary, DeWine has declined to endorse Ramaswamy yet. DeWine told Cleveland's WEWS-TV that he wanted “to get a better understanding of his positions, what his vision is.”
    


            “For me, I want to get to know him. I'm still doing that,” DeWine said.
    


            Ramaswamy, a Cincinnati native, has focused his campaign on state issues, offering critiques of Ohio's budget, taxes and education policies.
    


            “If you care about your kids living the American dream, in this state, and getting a world-class education in this state – then I'll tell you this, we're on the same team,” he said in March.
    


            Jai Chabria, advising Ramaswamy's campaign, said that “obviously, he has a national platform, but you know, he's actually gone out this last year, and he's actually traveled to all 88 counties in the state of Ohio. So he is going there. He's going where voters are. He's meeting them in person. And I think that that grassroots effort is a really big deal.”
    


            Terry Casey, a veteran conservative commentator in Ohio, said Ramaswamy “is a curious guy who listens and learns better than a lot of other politicians.” And former Rep. Jim Renacci, speaking to CNN's Audie Cornish, said it was still early in the process ahead of Ohio's May 5 primary and that Ramaswamy was still introducing himself to voters.
    


            “This governor's been very interesting over the years,” said Renacci, who challenged DeWine four years ago in the GOP primary and lost. “I ran against this governor because in many ways, I didn't believe he was a conservative Republican either. And I think Vivek in a way is calling him out at the same time.”
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, are increasingly confident that Ramaswamy's potential nomination gives them an opening to win again at the statewide level. While Republicans backed Trump in the last three presidential elections, Barack Obama won the state twice, and longtime former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is making a comeback bid next year after losing in 2024.
    


            Ramaswamy is likely to face Amy Acton, a physician and public health expert who is running virtually uncontested for the Democratic nomination after playing a key role in the DeWine administration's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            In the same interview in which he declined to endorse Ramaswamy, DeWine came to Acton's defense as she's faced criticism from Ramaswamy over her support for pandemic restrictions.
    


            “The decisions about what to do were mine,” DeWine said. “Buck stops with the governor… Buck stops with me. I made the decisions.”
    


            Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, the last Democrat to hold the top office, told CNN that his state “may surprise a lot of people.”
    


            “I will admit that Ohio has historically been a slightly center-right state, even in the times when Democrats were winning. I felt like Ohio was, you know, a little to the right but contestable and winnable,” Strickland said. “I think that very well may be true this election season.”
    


            Democrats are also energized by Brown's 2026 comeback campaign, optimistic that with strong candidates for governor and Senate gliding through uncontested primaries, they can put Ohio back in play.
    


            “I think they chose their weakest candidate. I don't think (Ramaswamy is) well-liked,” Strickland said. “He's an arrogant guy.”
    


            Acton on Friday posted on X a video of Ohioans reading aloud the text of a widely shared Ramaswamy post from 2024 in which he argued U.S. engineers were losing jobs to immigrants and their children because “our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.”
    


            The video ends with the text: “Vivek Ramaswamy thinks you're lazy.”
    


            Republicans maintain they have the upper hand.
    


            “I feel very confident, even up to the gubernatorial level,” said Matt Dole, chair of the Republicans in Licking County, east of downtown Columbus. “And I know there's people who look at that race and see it being nationalized because of who (Ramaswamy) is, right? I understand that. But at the end of the day, he's going to appear on an Ohio ballot in a statewide election year with an ‘R' after his name.”
    


            Just before his Turning Point speech, Ramaswamy took to the editorial pages of The New York Times, a vanguard of the legacy media he's often derided, to chastise the GOP for not denouncing racism and extremism.
    


            “Older Republicans who may doubt the rising prevalence of the blood-and-soil view should think again. My social media feeds are littered with hundreds of slurs, most from accounts that I don't recognize, about “pajeets” and “street s**tters” and calls to deport me ‘back to India',” wrote Ramaswamy, the Ohio-born son of Indian immigrants. “Pajeet” is a racist term for Indians that Fuentes used to describe second lady Usha Vance.
    


            It was a striking shift for Ramaswamy. Two years ago, he told an Iowa crowd that “I'm sure the boogeyman White supremacist exists somewhere in America, I've just never met him. Never seen one. Never met one in my life. Right. Maybe I'll meet a unicorn sooner. And maybe those exist too.”
    


            But for months, Ramaswamy has seemed eager to pull back from the tenor that distinguished his presidential campaign.
    


            “I think the more deep lesson that I took away about the future direction of the country is that – we're sold this myth of national division. That we're deeply divided as a people. I began my presidential campaign with that premise as well,” he said on an episode of the “13th and Park” podcast over the summer.
    


            “One of the things I learned is that we are not nearly as divided as the media would have you believe. I think most people in this country actually share the same foundational values in common.”
    


            Elisao Calderon, a 24-year-old Texas A&M University student and self-described “Ramaswamy guy,” told CNN at Turning Point USA's recent event that the party needs to plan for the future by embracing figures who resonate with younger voters.
    


            While the youth conservative organization has begun lining up behind Vance as a 2028 contender, Calderon said it would be a mistake to overlook Ramaswamy.
    


            “He's really good with Gen Z,” Calderon said. “That's why he relates so much to me and to a lot of people in the younger generation.”

            The “Epstein files” saga will spill into 2026, despite a deadline last week to release all of the records.
    


            Congress passed a law last month — with near-unanimous support — requiring the Justice Department to release all of its files about Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who was accused of abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein died by suicide in 2019.
    


            The so-called “Epstein files” are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, papers, videos, photographs and audio files that live within the FBI's main electronic case management system and largely originate from the FBI's two major investigations into Epstein, in Florida and New York, spanning decades.
    


            The new transparency law gave the Justice Department a December 19 deadline to release all the records related to Epstein. The department has since published hundreds of thousands of files over the past week to a landing page on the DOJ website, dubbed the “Epstein Library.”
    


            The records included on the Justice Department website include court records, responses to public records requests, and documents previously released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government reform.
    


            But many of Epstein's victims, as well as lawmakers from both parties, have criticized these releases for being incomplete and over-redacted. Others raised concerns about under-redacted portions that exposed at least one victim's identity.
    


            And then the Justice Department made a surprise announcement Wednesday that there are over a million more newly discovered documents potentially related to Epstein — and that they'll take “weeks” to review and release them.
    


            Trump appointees at the Justice Department say they're acting in good faith to release as much material as fast as possible, while also going through the painstaking work of reviewing every file to make sure victims' identifies are shielded, as required by the law.
    


            The Justice Department didn't respond to CNN's request for comment Friday.
    


            Here's what you need to know about the records that have already been released, how many files might come out in the next few weeks, and which documents to look out for in the new year.
    


            The first release came Friday, December 19 — which was the deadline to release all of the records.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said at the time “several hundred thousand” documents would be posted to the “Epstein Library” website that day. In a post on X that day, the Justice Department said it was “releasing a massive tranche of new documents,” and took a swing at the Obama and Biden administrations for not releasing these same files.
    


            The Department continued to post records into the early hours of Saturday, December 20.
    


            Another larger trove of records was posted on Tuesday, December 23. The Justice Department said this contained nearly “30,000 more pages.” That was the most recent release.
    


            It's important to remember that back in November, the House Oversight Committee separately released about 23,000 pages of Epstein-related documents that it got from his estate, and has followed that up with some additional releases, with more potentially to come. The previously released records from the House were among those re-posted to the new Justice Department website.
    


            The “Epstein Library” clearinghouse is broken down into four categories.
    


            One category is “Court Records,” which contains already-public filings from more than 50 civil and criminal cases related to Epstein and his now-incarcerated associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            Other categories include “Freedom of Information Act,” which contain documents released over the years by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies through public records requests. There's also a category with a link to the House Oversight disclosures.
    


            But the key category is “DOJ Disclosures,” which contains most of the new material.
    


            This is where we learned about the 2021 subpoena to Mar-a-Lago before Maxwell's trial and the email from federal prosecutors about Trump flying on Epstein's jet in the 1990s. It's also where we saw new photos of former President Bill Clinton hanging out with Epstein, and swimming in a pool Maxwell and another woman whose face is redacted.
    


            (Trump and Clinton deny any wrongdoing. Neither man has been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing or charged with any crimes in connection with Epstein.)
    


            That category also included a handwritten letter purportedly signed by “J. Epstein” and addressed to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar, which included crude references to Trump. The lewd note went viral almost as soon as it was released Tuesday, but by the end of the day, the Justice Department announced that the document was fake.
    


            One reporter asked on X why the DOJ would release a known fake document. The DOJ account responded that the law requires it to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. “Are you suggesting we break the law?” the post said.
    


            On December 19, the day of the first document drop, Blanche said, “I expect several hundred thousand more” files to be released in the future. A Justice Department “fact sheet” posted on Sunday, December 21, stated that there were still “hundreds of thousands of pages of material to release.”
    


            The Justice Department's leadership had asked Tuesday, two days before Christmas, for career prosecutors in Florida to volunteer over the “next several days” to help redact the Epstein files.
    


            But the bombshell came on Christmas Eve. That's when the DOJ announced that its Manhattan office, and the FBI, “uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.”
    


            In its announcement, the Justice Department pleaded for patience, saying “We have lawyers working around the clock,” but that, “due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,” before all of the new documents are posted.
    


            That drew bipartisan anger on Capitol Hill, and from the community of Epstein survivors.
    


            Some asked how so many new files could be discovered, one month after the law was passed, and ten months after Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the FBI to “deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office” — and set a February 28 deadline.
    


            “From the very beginning, as we've said, this has been a disaster,” James Marsh, an attorney for Epstein survivors, said Friday on CNN's “The Situation Room.”
    


            “They came in to this administration, going to unseal all of these documents on the very first day,” Marsh continued. “They backtracked. They released some. They had binders. They've had at least a year to start working on this. And it's somewhat no surprise that it's come down to the last minute, and beyond, that we begin to see actual compliance.”
    


            It's unclear what's in the potentially new, million-document batch. But it comes from the FBI and the DOJ's Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Maxwell and Epstein earlier, before his suicide. Court filings from her case indicate there were “millions of documents produced in discovery” for her trial.
    


            Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, has been among the most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill for releasing the files. He told CNN's Kaitlan Collins last week that, “The most important documents are missing.”
    


            He said he's eager for the Justice Department to release a 60-count draft indictment against Epstein that was written — but never filed — by federal prosecutors in 2007. There is also an 82-page memo that was written in support of pursuing that prosecution.
    


            Instead of facing federal charges that year, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to state prostitution charges, including one involving minors, in 2008 and was sentenced to 13 months in jail, though he was permitted to spend a significant chunk of that time on “work release” at his office, an arrangement that drew the ire of victims and has been widely criticized.
    


            Khanna and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, have threatened to possibly hold DOJ leaders in contempt if they don't follow through and release these documents, as well as all the other remaining files required by law.

Mamady Doumbouya accused of betraying his promise to be the restorer of democracy after leading 2021 coup

In September 2021, a tall, young colonel in the Guinean army announced that he and his comrades had forcibly seized power and toppled the longtime leader Alpha Condé.

“The will of the strongest has always supplanted the law,” Mamady Doumbouya said in a speech, stressing that the soldiers were acting to restore the will of the people.

Not long after, Doumbouya announced a 36-month timeline for transition to civilian rule in the resource-rich west African nation on the Atlantic coast, shrugging off pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), which wanted a swifter return to democracy. His actions triggered widespread protests and criticism from opposition groups and civil society, most of whom doubted his vow not to personally run for office.

On Sunday, 6.7 million eligible voters in Guinea will head to the ballot box for the first presidential election since the 2021 coup. Among the nine candidates are the former minister Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea and the former junta supporter turned critic Faya Millimono of the Liberal Bloc party.

But thanks to a controversial referendum in September that led to the adoption of a new constitution allowing him to run and extending presidential terms from five to seven years, the clear frontrunner is Doumbouya.

The opposition coalition Forces vives de Guinée has called his candidacy a betrayal. “The man who presented himself as the restorer of democracy chose to become its gravedigger,” it said in a statement last month after Doumbouya officially deposited his intent to run with the supreme court.

Political upheavals have been a recurring feature in west Africa, a region that has earned the moniker of “coup belt” after seven successful coups and several unsuccessful attempts since 2020. While Guinea has remained under the Ecowas umbrella, fellow juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, angered by its post-coup sanctions, have split from the regional bloc to form the pro-Russian Alliance of Sahel States (AES). If it holds, the Guinean election will be the first in any of the junta-run states since 2020.

Within Guinea, many believe the general's victory is a foregone conclusion, given his consolidation of power since ascending to the presidency and promoting himself to a general. Even now, the presidential race is notable not for those who are on the ballot, but for those who are not.

The biggest opposition parties remain suspended, and their most prominent leaders have been detained, barred from running or – like the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, are in exile. Many say a climate of fear pervades the country due to the junta's crackdown against its critics, with several dissidents in jail.

Conversely, Doumbouya pardoned the former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara who was given a 20-year sentence for his role in one of Guinea's most serious human rights atrocities: the 2009 massacre and mass rape of protesters at a stadium in Conakry. The pardon, granted before the final hearing, prompted several human rights groups to write a joint open letter to the junta leader alongside families of victims, urging him to reconsider. That process is now in limbo.

Ahead of the vote, Doumbouya has been accumulating goodwill.This month, the shiny new Simandou mine, which has the world's largest untapped reserve of iron ore, was launched after nearly three decades of delays caused by political instability and corruption. Doumbouya's government is touting the project as a bridge to prosperity for Guinea and a sign of incoming development, despite mass job losses and environmental complaints.

The election stakes are high: in the coming years, the multi-layered Simandou mine project – which also includes the construction of ports and a railway – is expected to transform the economy of Guinea, where half of the population lives on below $2 a day. Given existential concerns around transparency, many are waiting to see what the winning government does after the election.

“Our salvation lies in a return to the [proper] constitutional order,” said Abdoulaye Koroma, a presidential candidate for the Rally for Renaissance and Development party.

Region famed for molecular gastronomy begins video project to collect and share rustic recipes

Catalonia's avant garde chefs have made a name for themselves with their revolutionary techniques and molecular gastronomy, yet they are fond of saying they are merely paying homage to the simple dishes served at their grandmother's table.

Maybe so, but now the grannies have been given a chance to show off the real thing under a Catalan government initiative called Gastrosàvies.

A double play on the Catalan words for wise and grandmother, Gastrosàvies provides a platform for more than 100 women of a certain age to share videos cooking traditional dishes “with a view to preserving and communicating traditional Catalan cuisine for future generations”.

No spherification and liquid nitrogen for these chefs – just some basic ingredients, a sharp knife and a couple of pots and pans.

The project has collected more than 300 recipes from all over Catalonia, and videos of home cooks preparing 12 of them have been posted on the Gastrosàvies website, with more to follow.

These simple creations such as rice with cabbage and peas, thyme soup, chicken with apple, duck with turnips or pork chops with chestnuts hark back to an era where people cooked with what was at hand and in season, using basic equipment and techniques handed down over generations.

While these rustic dishes can still be found in bars and restaurants in rural Catalonia, they are increasingly hard to come by in Barcelona where they have been usurped by pizza, kebabs, ramen, sushi and the ubiquitous Argentinian empanadas.

Working in her farm house kitchen in the village of Santa Margarida i els Monjos in Penedès, a region 45 minutes south of Barcelona, Maria Antònia Udina, 76, prepares a Penedès cockerel with dried fruit and nuts and a dash of cognac, a dish characteristic of Catalan cuisine.

“Catalonia is small but we have mountains and sea and we like mixing the two,” she says. “That's why we cook meat with fruit or meat with fish in dishes such as meatballs with cuttlefish, chicken with prawns or xató, a salad made with frisee, salt cod, tuna and romesco sauce.”

Udina's mother cooked for her and her five siblings, “simple dishes with local products, a lot of potatoes, a lot of rice. We did the dishes and laid the table but my mother did the cooking. I didn't really know how to cook. I wasn't a good eater as a child but I loved mashed potatoes with a bit of oil poured over them.”

She is also a champion of local produce such as the Penedès cockerel that she and her husband farmed until a few years ago. She says the Penedès variety has more flavour and a better texture than supermarket chicken because it's reared for twice as long and is fed on grape seeds from local vineyards.

She lists what in her view are Catalan cuisine's three essential characteristics: the sofregit made with olive oil, onions, tomatoes and sometimes peppers or carrots, which is the ground zero of dozens of dishes; the use of herbs such as rosemary, bay and thyme, and finally the picada, a paste made from olive oil, ground almonds or hazelnuts, garlic, parsley and fried bread, served as an accompaniment to many dishes and a key ingredient in suquet de peix, the Catalan version of bouillabaisse.

Although Udina has a reputation as an excellent cook, she has never worked as a professional chef. However, she has dined in some of the region's most famous restaurants, among them Can Fabes, the first in Catalonia to be awarded three Michelin stars, and El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world.

She admires these avant garde chefs and accepts that their cuisine is rooted in tradition. However, she is sceptical about the claim that it's simply a homage to their mother's and grandmother's tables.

For example, Udina says, wild mushrooms are a staple of Catalan cooking but at Can Fabes, “we had six or seven dishes that were all made with wild mushrooms, including an ice-cream”.

“That's nothing like what their mothers would have cooked,” she says, adding that she believes there's a move back towards simpler, less innovative cuisine and hopes that Gastrosàvies will encourage “our children and grandchildren to cook traditional food instead of pizza, hamburgers and Pot Noodles”.

MAEBASHI — Two people died and 26 were injured in a massive pileup involving 67 vehicles, 20 of which caught fire, on the Kan-Etsu Expressway in Gunma Prefecture on Friday night, according to police.

The collision occurred on outbound lanes near the Minakami Interchange.

Miyuki Wakita, 77, died after being transported to a hospital. In addition, a body was found in the driver's seat of a burned-out truck. Police confirmed that five of the injured were in serious condition.

As of Saturday evening, the expressway remains closed in both directions between the Yuzawa and Tsukiyono interchanges in Minakami.

According to the prefectural expressway police, the initial collision occurred at about 7:25 p.m. A medium-sized truck skidded and stopped sideways on the road and was struck from behind by a large truck.

A chain reaction followed as oncoming vehicles collided with one another to avoid the initial crash. One of the vehicles caught fire, and the blaze quickly spread to at least 15 others.

The accident occurred on a two-lane downhill stretch with a gentle curve to the left. The road was under a heavy snow warning at the time of the crash, and the surface was slippery due to compressed snow, according to the police.

WASHINGTON, December 27. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed his concern by the recent military escalation in southeast Yemen and urged both sides to show restraint.

"The United States is concerned by recent events in southeastern Yemen. We urge restraint and continued diplomacy, with a view to reaching a lasting solution," the top US diplomat wrote on the X social network.

Rubio also expressed US support to diplomatic efforts of its partners in the region - the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

On December 9, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, chairperson of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, declared full control over the Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates. Next-stage plans, he noted, include establishing institutions of a future state in southern Yemen. December 25, the Saudi Foreign Ministry slammed separatists' actions as an unjustified escalation and urged the STC to withdraw its forces from the two regions. Earlier, Mustafa Ahmed Noman, deputy foreign minister in Yemen's internationally recognized government, warned that Riyadh could give a tough response if the situation escalated.

Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday that Moscow was concerned about the escalation of the military-political situation in the southern Yemeni provinces of Hadramout and Mahra, and called on all parties involved to exercise restraint and seek mutually acceptable solutions to the problems.

North Korea leader speaks of ‘really meaningful year' for alliance with Moscow; Zelenskyy accuses Russia of using Belarus apartments to attack Ukraine. What we know on day 1,403

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has highlighted how his country and Russia had shared “blood, life and death” in the Ukraine war in a new year's greeting to Vladimir Putin. In the message, published by the state-run KCNA news agency, Kim said 2025 was a “really meaningful year” for the bilateral alliance that was consolidated by “sharing blood, life and death in the same trench”. North Korea confirmed in April that it had deployed troops to support Russia's military campaign against Ukraine and that its soldiers had been killed in combat. Earlier this month, Pyongyang acknowledged that it had sent troops to clear mines in Russia's Kursk region in August 2025.

Several powerful explosions rocked Kyiv on Saturday as authorities warned that the Ukrainian capital was under threat of missile attack. “Explosions in the capital. Air defence forces are operating. Stay in shelters!” Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote on Telegram. Ukraine's air force also announced a countrywide air alert in the early hours of Saturday and said on social media that drones and missiles were moving over several Ukrainian regions, including the capital. Agence France-Presse journalists in Kyiv heard several loud explosions, some accompanied by bright flashes that lit the horizon orange. A military Telegram channel said cruise and ballistic missiles were being deployed in the city.

Moscow has accused the EU of trying to “torpedo” an agreement between Russia and Ukraine ahead of a meeting between Zelenskyy and Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy's input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said on Russian television. “Especially in a context where Kyiv and its sponsors – notably within the European Union, who are not in favour of an agreement – have stepped up efforts to torpedo it.” Ryabkov added: “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord.” He said any deal had to “remain within the limits” fixed by Trump and Putin when they met in Alaska in August, or else “no accord can be reached”.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of using apartment blocks in Belarus to attack Ukrainian targets. “We note that the Russians are trying to bypass our defensive interceptor positions through the territory of neighbouring Belarus,” the Ukrainian president wrote on Telegram. He said Ukrainian intelligence had observed that Belarus was deploying equipment to carry out its attacks “in Belarusian settlements near the border, including on residential buildings”. “Antennae and other equipment are located on the roofs of ordinary five-storey apartment buildings, which help guide Shaheds [drones] to targets in our western regions. This is an absolute disregard for human lives.”

Moscow may be stationing new Oreshnik nuclear-capable hypersonic ballistic missiles at a former airbase in eastern Belarus, two US researchers have claimed, after studying satellite imagery. Jeffrey Lewis and Decker Eveleth said they based their finding on imagery from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, that showed features consistent with a Russian strategic missile base. Lewis and Eveleth said they were 90% certain that mobile Oreshnik launchers would be stationed at the former airbase near Krichev, 307km east of the Belarus capital, Minsk. The researchers said reviews of the Planet Labs imagery revealed a hurried construction project that began between 4 and 12 August and showed features consistent with those of a Russian strategic missile base. One “dead giveaway” in a 19 November photo is a “military-grade rail transfer point” enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train, said Eveleth.

Russia's defence ministry claimed on Friday it had captured a new village in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region. The ministry wrote on Telegram it had seized the village of Kosivtseve, north of the town of Huliaipole, which has come under severe Russian pressure in recent weeks. It said Russian troops had taken more than 23 sq km of territory in securing the village, giving the “east” group of forces “a base for further offensive actions”. The defence ministry said its forces had deployed drones to prevent fresh Ukrainian troops from entering Huliaipole.

Hundreds of flights into New York have been cancelled as the state braces for 10 inches of snow.

Millions of people have been told to rearrange their travel plans on one of the busiest weekends of the year, with much of the state placed under winter storm warnings.

More than 60 million people across the north-east of the US have received winter weather alerts with New York expected to experience its heaviest snowfall in four years.

So far, more than 750 flights into or out of the city on Friday have been cancelled and hundreds more delayed, including more than a dozen to or from London, according to data from FlightAware.

Travel to or from John F Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport has been the worst affected, with 329 and 224 flights cancelled, respectively.

LaGuardia international airport follows closely behind with 204 cancellations either flying into or out of New York.

Kathy Hochul, the New York Governor, warned passengers flying on Boxing Day that they “may wish to rearrange travel plans”.

“If you must be on the road, leave yourself extra time between destinations and ensure your vehicle is packed with safety essentials,” she said.

Eric Adams, the outgoing mayor, also issued a storm warning advising New Yorkers to leave work early and stay off the roads if possible.

The storm first hit Wisconsin and Michigan in the Midwest on Friday morning before moving east towards Pennsylvania and New York.

The National Weather Service (NWS) announced a storm watch in New York starting at 4pm (9pm GMT) on Friday until 1pm (6pm GMT) on Saturday.

The storm is set to intensify throughout the evening, with up to two inches of snow expected to fall per hour and temperatures plunging below zero overnight, the forecaster said.

The last time New York saw more than four inches of snow was in 2022, when eight inches fell in Central Park. The record was set in 2016, when 27.5 inches of snow blanketed the city.

Ms Hochul said the state was set to deploy more than 1,600 large snow ploughs to help tackle the icy deluge.

Over 100 salt spreaders were also working throughout the city on Friday as the NWS warned of “hazardous travel from snow-covered roads”.

“If you must drive or travel in the storm, remember to share your travel plans with your friends…and make sure you have an emergency kit,” the forecaster said.

The storm was expected to cause widespread disruption, with around 15 million travellers expected to pass through New York and New Jersey's tunnels and airports this week, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Forecasters said a secondary storm on Sunday night may wash away the snow and sleet that is expected to fall over the next 24 hours.

Weather warnings have been issued in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, while Massachusetts and Rhode Island are also expected to be hit with heavy snow.

MOSCOW, December 24. /TASS/. Ukraine considers holding a presidential election, while US President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a Golden Fleet. Meanwhile, gold prices have surged 70% over the past year. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

A potential election in Ukraine can hardly be considered fair unless the votes of millions of Ukrainians living in Russia are counted, Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large Rodion Miroshnik told Izvestia. Earlier, the Verkhovna Rada, or Ukraine's parliament, announced the formation of a working group to organize a potential presidential election, something on which the US president has insisted. However, it is not clear when the voting could take place. Experts doubt it will be held any time soon, while Ukraine's Central Election Commission has said it would be optimal to arrange an election within the next six months.

Vladimir Oleinik, a former Ukrainian MP, dismissed the idea as pure lies meant to avoid saying no to Donald Trump. "If we take [Vladimir] Zelensky's statement regarding holding an election within the next 60 to 90 days, I'll tell you as a lawyer and a former parliamentarian that it would be impossible," he said.

Zelensky is likely to try to delay the process as he realizes that he will stand very low chances of winning, according to Oleg Karpovich, vice rector of the Diplomatic Academy. He cited opinion polls showing Zelensky trailing former Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny and head of Ukraine's military intelligence Kirill Budanov (listed in Russia as a terrorist and extremist). "Anti-corruption probes raise a question mark over his future, while a conflict with oligarchs poses a threat to his life. He will cling to power as long as he can," the expert opined.

Bogdan Bezpalko, a member of the Russian Presidential Council for Interethnic Relations, argued that the election process, if it ever takes place, will at least face delays, "because Ukrainian and European politicians may also expect the geopolitical situation to change <…> which would dispense with the need to hold this election at all," he added.

Meanwhile, amid battlefield failures affecting Ukrainian troops and economic problems in the country, the popularity of the head of the Kiev regime has significantly dropped. Against this background, he has been actively floating the idea of online voting, which creates opportunities for fraud, as the Verkhovna Rada fears. Political analyst Denis Denisov said in an interview with Izvestia that developing a fully secure remote-voting system within a matter of months is almost impossible.

 

The United States is planning to develop a new class of battleships that will be named after President Donald Trump. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the future Trump-class battleship will be "the largest, deadliest and most versatile and best-looking warship anywhere on the world's oceans." Besides standard weapons and missiles, Trump emphasized, the new battleships will be equipped with hypersonic missiles, electromagnetic railguns, and high-powered lasers.

As of December, the ambitious project was at the design stage, with a plan to build the first warship in the early 2030s. Phelan said the US Navy would need 20 to 25 such vessels. The battleship initiative will replace the Pentagon's earlier plans to build a DDG(X)-class destroyer.

Senior research fellow in the Department of Military-Political Studies at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies Igor Shkrobtak dismissed the idea as controversial, saying he questioned the specific use of such battleships. According to the expert, one such battleship could cost $10 billion, while Trump said it could cost at least $5 billion. CNN estimated a price tag as high as $15 billion.

The US is unlikely to build such battleships soon at an optimal price, Shkrobtak continued. "The American shipbuilding industry, including warship building, faces major systemic problems that would hamper implementing this project any time soon," he said. Therefore, Shkrobtak emphasized, not only the Trump administration but also future Republican administrations might put it into practice, and Trump's successors, especially Democrats, may abandon the initiative.

However, the idea itself is not unreasonable, Ilya Kramnik, research fellow with the Center for Strategic Planning at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, told Vedomosti. According to him, this could be a good, secure battleship with structural protection that would withstand attacks with most types of drones, but such a vessel has yet to be designed and built. "The ability to design new ships and launch their serial production has been completely lost, and this is the case for all manned ship projects currently being implemented for the US Navy without exception," Kramnik maintained. Therefore, the expert concluded, the Trump-class battleship idea is unlikely to outlive the current administration even if a Republican president succeeds Trump.

 

On Tuesday, gold soared past $4,500 per troy ounce, and analysts say it will rise above the psychological level of $5,000 per ounce in 2026. Even if gold prices correct lower, the precious metal will be very expensive going forward.

Gold has risen to a new all-time high of $4,550, the latest exchange data showed. Gold prices stood at below $3,000 per ounce at the start of 2025, therefore gold has so far risen by approximately 70%, yielding such a return to those who had bought it in advance.

Gold prices have been mostly driven by a global liquidity glut, deglobalization, trade wars, expectations of Fed rate cuts, the risk of the Federal Reserve losing its independence amid pressure from the Trump administration, the rapid US sovereign debt growth rate and dollar weakening, according to Mikhail Vasilyev, chief analyst at Sovcombank.

The latest spike in gold prices in the past few days was triggered by yet another bout of geopolitical tensions, this time between the United States and Venezuela, Marina Nikishova, lead economist at Bank Zenit, added. Among other key factors pushing gold prices higher is the strong growth in demand for the metal from global central banks, especially in developing economies. Actually, this, among other aspects, shows a declining confidence in the USD as a global reserve currency as countries attempt to hedge their foreign reserves with something safer or less ephemeral than another currency.

As long as global stability has not been increasing in either geopolitical, economic or trade terms, the above-mentioned drivers behind gold's rise are highly likely to persist into at least 2026. According to Vasilyev's estimates, gold prices will climb beyond $5,000 per troy ounce in 2026, and a similar forecast is valid for the next few years as well. "We believe that deglobalization will continue in the next few years, with the United States actively increasing its debt and printing dollars. Therefore, we expect that gold will continue to rise and that its prices will hover above $3,400 to $4,000 per ounce from now on," Vasilyev predicts.

However, gold will hardly keep rising at this year's pace. "Given the precious metal has reached its record highs, a price correction is inevitable. While we do not expect it to dive, we see a range between $3,900 and $4,000 per ounce as quite possible," Nikishova told Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

 

Donald Trump initiated quite an unusual rotation of US ambassadors in as many as 29 countries. African nations account for more than half of that number, with the US president planning a radical diplomatic reform. The United States will focus on getting access to natural resources there and squeezing rivals, mostly China. The White House will no longer prioritize promoting democracy or providing free aid for humanitarian reasons on the Black Continent.

The New York Post said Trump will recall as many as 48 ambassadors. Neither Joe Biden nor Barack Obama reshaped the US diplomatic corps at such a scale. Trump's critics say he'd better concentrate on filling the existing personnel gaps in countries that are key to the United States' foreign policy. The country has yet to appoint an ambassador in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, South Korea, Australia, and, surprisingly, Ukraine.

While the New York Post report has not been formally confirmed and is based on information from sources, the chiefs of US missions in 29 countries have received letters saying that their tenures will expire in January, the AP reported. The move will barely affect US ambassadors in the Western Hemisphere, nor will South Asia see any large-scale changes. Meanwhile, the heads of US diplomatic missions in 15 African countries will leave their posts.

"In the past few years, the United States has shown heightened interest in African countries, primarily in terms of access to their natural resources. I think the removal of ambassadors may indicate that the United States has activated its policy in this direction. Furthermore, the competition for influence over Africa against rivals, mostly China, will intensify. Under these circumstances, humanitarian issues and democracy, which used to serve as ideological wrappers to conceal the true US interests in the region, will likely fade into the background," Sergey Nenashev, a senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for African Studies, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

 

The dollar exchange rate globally has fallen to levels of three months ago amid bearish sentiment as investors anticipate more Fed rate cuts and the declining share of dollar assets in global central banks' foreign reserves. The USD has been weakening in Russia, too, including because of increased supply from exporters. However, analysts argue that the recent dollar weakening is unsustainable and that the USD will return to the level of between 78 and 82 rubles per/$1 ahead of the New Year holidays.

On December 23, DXY fell to as low as 97.85 points, or the lowest level since October 3, data from Investing.com showed. Over the past two days, the US currency dipped by 0.8% and has weakened by 2.3% over the past month.

Analysts question the sustainability of the dollar weakening trend as they say the USD volatility in Russia may rise. Alexey Mikheyev, investment strategist at VTB My Investments, said the global dollar rate will climb higher if investors flee risk assets. The euro rate can return to $1.15 in the next few months, which would push the USD rate in Russia higher too, he told Kommersant. "In the first quarter of 2026, the USD could trade at 85-90 rubles," Mikheyev said.

Big retailers across America are charging shoppers to return their unwanted holiday gifts and purchases.

Nearly three out of four retailers will make customers pay a restocking or return fee that can be as high as $45 if they ship their product back, according to data reviewed by The Epoch Times and the National Retail Federation.

Cleveland Browns legend Joe Thomas called his former teammate Myles Garrett the "best defensive pass rusher I've ever seen," in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Cleveland Browns superstar Myles Garrett is on the verge of NFL history, as he is just a half-sack away from tying the single-season record set by Hall of Famer Michael Strahan and Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt.

Garrett, 29, said it would be "special" to break the record by sacking Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. 

"It'd be special. He's legendary himself. And it's a legendary record I'm out here chasing. So that'd be a great one to put a picture on the wall with," Garrett said at a press conference Friday.

Rodgers is quick to get the ball out, and Garrett said it's important to take away his easy reads. 

"Gotta take away those easy access throws, make him look at his second read, and he's gotta keep rushing. There'll be (opportunities) if we continue to get stops during the game, and he can't continue to lean on those quick passes, when you gotta score points," Garrett said. 

The Browns, who are 3-12, play the Steelers at home on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. The Steelers would clinch the AFC North and a playoff spot with a win over the Browns.

Garrett hopes the Browns play spoiler, so if he sets the record on Sunday, he would do it in a win.

"Yeah, I just play. I want to get it, and you know, like I said, I want to win while doing it. And I think we have the guys who are locked in who want to do that as well," Garrett said. 

The seven-time Pro Bowler said there is no pressure that comes with the record looming.

"Pressure? Nah, no pressure. Like I said, it's going down. So, I'm not stressed or worried about if I'm going to get it. Just a matter of when," Garrett said. 

Garrett has established himself as one of the NFL's premier pass rushers since being selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. The four-time All-Pro has an astounding 124.5 sacks in 132 career games.

The Las Vegas Raiders will be without their two best players in a game that will determine who gets the rights to the No. 1 overall pick next April.

The New York Giants will head west Sunday in a battle between two 2 and 13 teams — Big Blue currently owns the No. 1 pick but would forfeit it to the Raiders with a victory.

Raiders tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve earlier this week, ending his season. A few days later, defensive end Maxx Crosby was listed as out because of a nagging knee injury.

Crosby, who said earlier this week he did not "give a s---" about the No. 1 pick, then left the team facility because he disagreed with his status for the remainder of the year, according to Fox Sports NFL reporter Jay Glazer.

Glazer said the Raiders wanted to shut the star defensive end down for the team's final two games of the regular season, but Crosby "vehemently disagreed" with the idea and left the facility. Crosby, a Pro Bowler in each of the past five seasons, has played in each of the Raiders' 15 games this season and has recorded 10.0 sacks.

"I don't play for that. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world," Crosby told reporters Tuesday.

"That's what I focus on every day, and being a great leader, and being an influence, and being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. The front office, the coaches, they do that. But that's got nothing to do with me. I've learned that lesson in the past, you can't control everything. That's not my job description, my job is to be the best in the world at what I do."

The No. 1 overall pick would give the Raiders a chance to select the top quarterback in the class, as Geno Smith doesn't appear to be the long-term answer. 

The Giants seem to have found their franchise quarterback in Jaxson Dart, which would likely prompt a trade back if they hold the pick.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Whether it's stand-up comedy specials or a dramedy series, when Muslim American Mo Amer sets out to create, he writes what he knows.

The comedian, writer and actor of Palestinian descent has received critical acclaim for it, too. The second season of Amer's “Mo” documents Mo Najjar and his family's tumultuous journey reaching asylum in the United States as Palestinian refugees.

Amer's show is part of an ongoing wave of television from Arab American and Muslim American creators who are telling nuanced, complicated stories about identity without falling into stereotypes that Western media has historically portrayed. 

“Whenever you want to make a grounded show that feels very real and authentic to the story and their cultural background, you write to that,” Amer told The Associated Press. “And once you do that, it just feels very natural, and when you accomplish that, other people can see themselves very easily.” 

At the start of its second season, viewers find Najjar running a falafel taco stand in Mexico after he was locked in a van transporting stolen olive trees across the U.S.-Mexico border. Najjar was trying to retrieve the olive trees and return them to the farm where he, his mother and brother are attempting to build an olive oil business.

Both seasons of “Mo” were smash hits on Netflix. The first season was awarded a Peabody. His third comedy special on Netflix, “Mo Amer: Wild World,” premiered in October. 




Narratively, the second season ends before the Hamas attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but the series itself doesn't shy away from addressing Israeli-Palestinian relations, the ongoing conflict in Gaza or what it's like for asylum seekers detained in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. 

In addition to “Mo,” shows like “Muslim Matchmaker,” hosted by matchmakers Hoda Abrahim and Yasmin Elhady, connect Muslim Americans from around the country with the goal of finding a spouse.

The animated series, “#1 Happy Family USA,” created by Ramy Youssef, who worked with Amer to create “Mo,” and Pam Brady, follows an Egyptian American Muslim family navigating life in New Jersey after the 9/11 terrorists attack in New York. 

The key to understanding the ways in which Arab or Muslim Americans have been represented on screen is to be aware of the “historical, political, cultural and social contexts” in which the content was created, said Sahar Mohamed Khamis, a University of Maryland professor who studies Arab and Muslim representation in media.

After the 9/11 attacks, Arabs and Muslims became the villains in many American films and TV shows. The ethnic background of Arabs and the religion of Islam were portrayed as synonymous, too, Khamis said. The villain, Khamis said, is often a man with brown skin with an Arab-sounding name. 

A show like “Muslim Matchmaker” flips this narrative on its head, Elhady said, by showing the ethnic diversity of Muslim Americans.

“It's really important to have shows that show us as everyday Americans,” said Elhady, who is Egyptian and Libyan American, “but also as people that live in different places and have kind of sometimes dual realities and a foot in the East and a foot in the West and the reality of really negotiating that context.”

Before 9/11, people living in the Middle East were often portrayed to Western audiences as exotic beings, living in tents in the desert and riding camels. Women often had little to no agency in these media depictions and were “confined to the harem” — a secluded location for women in a traditional Muslim home.

This idea, Khamis said, harkens back to the term “orientalism,” which Palestinian American academic, political activist and literary critic Edward Said coined in his 1978 book of the same name.

Khamis said, pointing to countries like Britain and France, the portrayal in media of people from the region was “created and manufactured, not by the people themselves, but through the gaze of an outsider. The outsiders in this case, he said, were the colonial/imperialist powers that were actually controlling these lands for long periods of time.”

Among those who study the ways Arabs have been depicted on Western television, a common critique is that the characters are “bombers, billionaires or belly dancers,” she said. 

Sanaz Alesafar, executive director of Storyline Partners and an Iranian American, said she has seen some “wins” with regard to Arab representation in Hollywood, noting the success of “Mo,” “Muslim Matchmaker” and “#1 Happy Family USA.” Storyline Partners helps writers, showrunners, executives and creators check the historical and cultural backgrounds of their characters and narratives to assure they're represented fairly and that one creator's ideas don't infringe upon another's. 

Alesafar argues there is still a need for diverse stories told about people living in the Middle East and the English-speaking diaspora, written and produced by people from those backgrounds. 

“In the popular imagination and popular culture, we're still siloed in really harmful ways,” she said. “Yes, we're having these wins and these are incredible, but that decision-making and centers of power still are relegating us to these tropes and these stereotypes.”

Deana Nassar, an Egyptian American who is head of creative talent at film production company Alamiya Filmed Entertainment, said it's important for her children to see themselves reflected on screen “for their own self image.” Nassar said she would like to see a diverse group of people in decision-making roles in Hollywood. Without that, it's “a clear indication that representation is just not going to get us all the way there,” she said.

Representation can impact audiences' opinions on public policy, too, according to a recent study by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Results showed that the participants who witnessed positive representation of Muslims were less likely to support anti-democratic and anti-Muslim policies compared to those who viewed negative representations. 

For Amer, limitations to representation come from the decision-makers who greenlight projects, not from creators. He said the success of shows like his and others are a “start,” but he wants to see more industry recognition for his work and the work of others like him.

“That's the thing, like just keep writing, that's all it's about,” he said. “Just keep creating and keep making and thankfully I have a really deep well for that, so I'm very excited about the next things,” he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — When Cami Teacoach's son turned three she set out to find volunteer opportunities they could do together. He made Valentine cards for senior citizens. They hiked and picked up trash. He helped harvest produce at community gardens and made seed balls out of mud, throwing them into the forest to promote wildflower growth.

Teacoach had reached out to many organizations looking for volunteer projects that she could do with her young child, but most places said no, so she came up with her own.

“Everyone was like, ‘A 3-year-old can't do that,'” Teacoach said. “And I was like, ‘No, I swear, he really can if you would just give him a chance.'”

Volunteering with children can instill confidence in youngsters, teach social and problem-solving skills and provide unique ways for families to bond. During the holiday season, many people seek such opportunities, looking for ways to give back. 

But often nonprofit organizations seek helpers who are at least 18 years old. Finding volunteer work to do as a family with young children can be challenging, but there are opportunities, if you persist.

“There's a million different ways to help people and volunteer. So many families want to do this and literally just don't know where to start,” said Polly Lagana, executive director of Volunteer New York!, which connects people with service opportunities. “In a turbulent time in our world, families — and parents in particular — are very interested in showing their kids how they can help out and how they can give back.”

This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.

Children excel at activities such as sorting coats, packing groceries and following through on tasks, said Sapreet Saluja, executive director of New York Cares, which works with organizations to develop volunteer programs in New York City.




“I've been very impressed with the detail-orientation and the precision and the following of directions and the care that some kids I've seen, as young as six, take to the tasks that they're doing,” Saluja said. “It's been explained to them that this is to benefit someone, and it's important, and they're following the directions and they want to get it just right. And in many cases, they're more detail-oriented than the adults, which I think is very inspiring.”

To get started, look for organizations in your community that match volunteers with family-friendly projects and reach out to ask if there's a minimum age requirement.

Here are some other ways to involve little ones in projects that help the community.

Children prefer to have agency and information to make a decision, so include them when you're choosing an activity, Lagana said.

“Let them know what problem you're trying to fix in your community, and maybe one or two options of how that problem can be fixed,” Lagana said. For example, you can explain there are people who don't have enough food, and children in the hospital who might not have blankets, and then ask, ‘Which one do you think you want to help out with?' she suggested.

Consider volunteering for a mission that you can explain to your child, such as cleaning up litter at a park. 

“Kids are unbelievably curious. They ask questions about what they're doing, what they're seeing, what they're feeling, what they're hearing, and it opens up a dialogue,” Saluja said. “It helps you see even at a young age some of the challenges that society is facing and it gives you agency to know that you can be a part of the solution.”

Children understand hunger, and they can help alleviate the problem. They can sort grocery boxes at a food pantry or help deliver sustenance to home-bound individuals.

Aviva Davis was about eight years old when she and her brother Brendan began helping her parents deliver Meals on Wheels to senior citizens and medically frail individuals in Denver. Initially, they rode in the car with their parents and helped bring food to the door. When they were older, they took turns driving.

“It definitely opened my eyes to what the world is like outside of our bubble. We saw all sorts of different things and I saw not everyone lives the same way,” said Davis, now 17. “But even at such a young age I could realize it's amazing what we're doing that we could help people that aren't as lucky as we were.”

Davis became a resource at school for fellow students looking to volunteer. She still does monthly meal deliveries with her parents.

“It's a great chance for us to catch up as a family,” said her father, Seth Davis. “When we're not all on our phones, you get some pretty cool quality time.”

Her brother is now in college, but when he's home, they do deliveries altogether. 

“The older they get, the harder it is to get that time together,” said their mother, Bonnie Davis, who found the Meals on Wheels opportunity after extensive research.

When Teacoach couldn't find organizations willing to accept her toddler, she started a group in Pittsburgh called VolunTOTs, which creates service opportunities for children as young as 3. The children and their parents pack 500 boxes of groceries to distribute to families in need, play bingo with seniors in nursing homes and make dog treats for an animal rescue center, among other projects.

Parents have told Teacoach their children's conduct improves after volunteering. “They feel so good about themselves, they were a helper, and that translates into better behavior,” she said.

Stephanie Bernaba's family started “Tough Cookies,” a project where they bake and deliver cookies to veterans, when her son Matthew was in eighth grade and had to complete a service project for school. 

“Going up to the houses, it was very nice, because they're mostly living alone. A lot of their family or friends died,” said Michael Bernaba, 14, now a freshman at The Prout School in Wakefield, Rhode Island. “It's just nice to be there and bring it to them ... They were very happy, especially for someone to bring them treats like that.”

The project also helped the teens learn social skills and meet people in various stages of life and health conditions, Stephanie Bernaba said.

“We went to the first couple of places and I was really scared, because I'm more of a shy person,” Matthew Bernaba, now 15, said. “For the first couple of deliveries I was more to myself, and as we kept going, we talked more with the veterans and got to hear great stories from them.” 

Children can be more willing to try new activities with a buddy, so consider signing up with people you know. 

You can also connect with a nonprofit in need of a service and invite other families over to do a project together, as Lagana's friends have done, organizing clothing donations or assembling snack packs in living rooms.

Bonnie Davis organized a drive for menstrual supplies, and families gathered in her backyard to assemble the baskets. She also turned half of her son's graduation party into a volunteer project assembling kits of bean soup. 

“It's a win for everybody. You get quality time, you're raising your children with what feels like good values, and people benefit,” she said.

'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the Trump administration's efforts to crackdown on crime as youth violence trends higher. 

An uptick in international organized crime groups smuggling stolen vehicles from the Motor City to countries in the Middle East is alarming law enforcement officials looking to crack down on the thefts, as experts say criminals are leveraging juveniles to do their dirty work. 

In September, eight men were indicted in federal court for allegedly operating a car theft and international smuggling operation in Detroit, Michigan, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said in a news release. 

According to the 12-count indictment, the eight suspects conspired among themselves and others to coordinate the deliveries of stolen vehicles at one of four commercial or industrial lots throughout the Detroit metropolitan area. Once the vehicles were delivered, prosecutors said the men would pack at least two of the stolen vehicles into shipping containers and send them to nearby port cities by freight or rail. 

Once the containers arrived at the various port cities, the containers transporting the cars would allegedly be shipped overseas.

"A lot of the cars were shipped to the Middle East," Dearborn Police Cpl. Daniel Bartok told FOX 2, including locations like Iraq and Dubai.

The suspects have been identified as Haydar Al Haydari, 41, of Garden City; Karar Alnakash, 43, of Detroit; Abbas Al Othman, 42; of Dearborn Heights; Mohammed Al Hilo, 36, of Detroit; Moustapha Al Fetlawi, 46, of Dearborn Heights; Terrill Davis, 33, of Detroit; David Roshinsky Williams, 32, of Harper Woods; and Mohammed Al Abboodi, 35, of Detroit, according to federal prosecutors. 

All eight men are charged with one count of conspiracy to transport stolen vehicles and one or more counts of transportation of a stolen vehicle, prosecutors said.

"Our efforts have led to the recovery of over 350 stolen vehicles and behind every one of those stolen cars is a victim," ICE HSI Detroit acting Special Agent in Charge Matthew Stentz said in a statement. "Our HSI special agents and law enforcement partners will continue to do the work necessary to take down these operations that harm everyday Americans."   

The recent indictment is merely the latest in what has become a surge in vehicle thefts throughout Michigan in recent years. 

In 2023, the state saw 28,408 reported cases of motor vehicle thefts, according to the Michigan Department of Attorney General. The uptick marked a 4.1% increase in thefts when compared to the previous year, and a 48.4% spike when compared to data from the past five years.

The Michigan Department of Attorney General did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"I think any large metropolitan area has some auto theft issues," Kyle McPhee, a stolen vehicle identification specialist and retired detective sergeant with the Michigan State Police, told Fox News Digital. "Detroit happens to be a port city. You can put something in a shipping container, and it can be at a port in no time."

Organized crime groups will often swipe vehicles from a manufacturer's lot or ones simply parked on the street, with some criminals recruiting juveniles due to the less-harsh legal penalties for minors, according to McPhee. 

"They'll pay juveniles very little to go out and bring these vehicles back to wherever they're going to cool them off," McPhee said. "They'll remove any tracking devices and they might cut the vehicle up so they can put it in a shipping container and call it ‘auto parts.' Then when it gets to its destination, they might reassemble it."

Once a shipping container arrives at port, McPhee said criminals will often fabricate the manifest logs to fool officials regarding its contents. 

"They'll say ‘household goods,' and there might be five cars in there and two mattresses," McPhee added. 

The process makes it nearly impossible for authorities to verify the contents of each of the millions of containers passing through each port every year, with organized crime groups within the United States often coordinating with international criminals, according to McPhee.

"They have backscatter machines and x-rays that look into the shipping containers, but you're talking about a million shipping containers on some of these ports are tough," McPhee said. "It's a tough duty. You have to also be careful of what's coming into the country, and now we have to look at what's going out." 

The rise in vehicle thefts throughout Michigan has led state officials to create the Auto Fraud Task Force (AFTF) earlier this year. 

The unit combats both auto insurance fraud and large-scale criminal auto theft operations within Metro Detroit by partnering with various law enforcement agencies throughout the area, according to the Michigan Department of Attorney General. 

"With the rise of auto thefts across our communities, expanding the Auto Fraud Task Force is an important step to strengthen our fight against both vehicle theft and insurance fraud, crimes that impact far too many Michigan residents each year," Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. "Through this new structure, we are enhancing our efforts to dismantle these sophisticated, organized auto crime enterprises across our state."

As authorities race to track down stolen vehicles before they are loaded onto shipping containers, while also investigating how criminal groups on American soil are working with international crime organizations, McPhee insisted there is one key component in what is driving the uptick in vehicle thefts throughout Michigan. 

"The one key connection is somebody's getting paid," McPhee told Fox News Digital. "There's money to be made. So if you have a local organized gang, they can be connected internationally to another group very easily. We have the internet, it's not hard."

California dropped a lawsuit this week over the Trump administration‘s funding cuts for its high-speed rail project.

The state sued the administration in July after the Transportation Department cut $4 billion in funding for the project. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) called the cuts “a political stunt to punish California.”

The California High-Speed Rail Authority says it will now look elsewhere for funding. The project is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.

“This action reflects the State's assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said the federal funding was canceled because of the administration's lack of confidence that it would be done timely or efficiently.

“Federal dollars are not a blank check – they come with a promise to deliver results. After over a decade of failures, CHSRA's mismanagement and incompetence has proven it cannot build its train to nowhere on time or on budget,” Duffy said.

President Donald Trump reflected Duffy's sentiment, saying the bullet train “never will” exist.

“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump posted on Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”

The authority will seek funding from private investors and recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.

The rail authority says the shift away from federal funding constituted a “new opportunity.”

“Moving forward without the Trump administration's involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.

            A shooter armed with several guns opened fire in the lobby of an Idaho sheriff's office and the street outside Friday, injuring three people before being killed in a standoff with law enforcement, the local sheriff said.
    


            The suspected gunman fired shots at a pickup truck outside the Shoshone County Sheriff's Office in Wallace before entering the lobby and firing into the station toward the dispatch center, Shoshone County Sheriff William Eddy said at a news conference.
    


            The shooting drew a massive police response, with a SWAT team and multiple agencies responding to the sheriff's office at around 2:40 p.m. PT, the sheriff's office said.
    


            An officer-involved shooting followed, and the suspect was pronounced dead at 4:15 p.m., he said. No information was available on the suspect or their motive.
    


            The injuries of the three people shot were described as minor, according to Eddy, who said two female victims in the pickup truck were shot in the leg and a deputy received a gunshot wound to the ear.
    


            Initial reports indicated the suspect may have gained access to the jail, Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris said, which “ramped up” the response from law enforcement.
    


            “This is a fairly significant event when you have a person that goes into a lobby of a sheriff's office and starts a shootout,” he said.
    


            The suspect appears to have stayed in the lobby and the people in the jail weren't injured, Eddy said.
    


            At least eight law enforcement agencies assisted the Shoshone County Sheriff's Office, Eddy said. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office and the Coeur d'Alene Police Department will handle the criminal investigation while Idaho State Police will investigate the officer-involved shooting, he said.
    


            Wallace, Idaho, is about 70 miles east of Spokane, Washington.
    


            Wallace resident Julie Swindell-Ward told CNN affiliate KXLY she was in the grocery store across the street when she heard someone say something about a person with a gun at the sheriff's department.
    


            “I walked out to the parking lot, I see sheriff's cars, lights coming down,” she told the affiliate. “And then as I'm approaching my car, I heard gunshots.”
    


            It was a surprising thing to witness in such a small town, especially on a quiet Friday, she said.

            Along a nine-mile stretch of river between two waterfalls in the Australian rainforest lives a tiny fish that's been there for millions of years, hiding between rocks along the riverbank by day and emerging at night to feed.
    


            This is the only place in the world you'll find the planet's sole tropical cod –– a remnant of times past that is believed to have split from its closest southern relatives about 25-30 million years ago.
    


            For all that time, the tiny cod swam undetected and undescribed by modern science until 1993 when two researchers –– Mark Kennard and Brad Pusey –– stumbled upon the fish in the Bloomfield River, along the northern reaches of the Daintree Rainforest, which is recognized by UNESCO as the world's oldest rainforest and is brimming with rich and unique biodiversity.
    


            “It's a beautiful little fish,” said Kennard, now deputy director of the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, who still works with Pusey, a senior research fellow at the same university, more than 30 years on.
    


            Back then, Kennard and Pusey named the fish the Bloomfield River Cod, with the scientific name Guyu wujalwujalensis, after the Aboriginal name for fish and the Wujal Wujal community, the land's traditional owners. It's also known as the tropical nightfish.
    


            But this ancient species that grows to just 10 centimeters is now under threat from introduced predators and violent storms produced by man-made global warming.
    


            Cyclone Jasper, one of Australia's most destructive tropical cyclones, tore through the cod's habitat between two waterfalls on the Bloomfield two years ago –– felling trees, flooding the river and washing more introduced predators into its sanctuary.
    


            This October, Kennard and Pusey returned to the river to survey the damage and count the cod in the hope of having it formally listed as endangered under Australia's biodiversity laws, which would offer it more protection.
    


            “If we lost this, we'd lose a representative of a really complex and long period of evolution,” said Pusey. “It would be a tragedy… certainly a personal tragedy.”
    


            Getting to the Bloomfield River takes at least four hours along an inland road from Cairns, where tourists board boats to visit the Great Barrier Reef.
    


            The longer, wilder and more scenic route winds around the coast, on unsealed roads through “croc country” where Australia's giant saltwater crocodiles dominate the briny waterways and smaller freshwater crocs occupy rivers and streams.
    


            At this time of year, summer dials up the heat and humidity, steam rises from roads after sudden downpours, and the smell of sweat mixed with sunscreen and insect repellent lingers in the air.
    


            Kennard and Pusey were on a research trip to survey Queensland's Wet Tropics when they found the fish in the 1990s.
    


            They initially had no idea what it was. But on a return trip a few years later they found enough information to confirm it was a new species.
    


            “When you find new species here, they're almost always so minor a difference, and most of the time it's not until people do the genetics, and they go, ‘oh, that is a new species.' But this was clearly new, and it is quite exciting to find that,” Pusey said.
    


            The stretch of river that's home to the Bloomfield Cod is inaccessible to most visitors – but not remote enough to guarantee the cod's safety.
    


            Their biggest predatory threat is the Tully Grunter, a larger native Australian fish up to 35 centimeters long, that scientists believe was introduced to the river by recreational fishers wanting a decent catch.
    


            The grunter is now competing with the Bloomfield Cod for food and potentially eating its eggs and young.
    


            “There's been an explosion in their population in the last five to 10 years, and that's why we are so concerned. They've spread throughout most of that upper catchment area where the cod population is,” said Kennard.
    


            In parts of the river where there are no Tully Grunters, cod could be seen from the riverbank, swimming openly, seemingly without fear, he said. But in places inhabited by grunters, researchers diving with snorkels found the cod hiding behind rocks.
    


            Along with the grunters, researchers have found eel-tailed catfish, native to rivers further south, and guppies that come from Central America, suggesting pets were freed and have since started breeding.
    


            But it's the impact of Cyclone Jasper they were most interested in assessing on their most recent trip.
    


            “You can still see the scarring in the landscape,” said Kennard. “They say it's one of the most intense weather events ever recorded in Australian history.”
    


            Cyclone Jasper had weakened by the time it made landfall in December 2023, but it stalled over Cape York Peninsula for several days, dumping rain on already saturated land.
    


            Around 975 mm of rain fell on some places in one day – the highest ever 24-hour total reliably measured in Australia.
    


            So much rain fell, it turned the Bloomfield River into a raging torrent.
    


            “Normally what happens in forested rivers like this, the trees fall into the river and provide habitat for fish and other animals that live in the river,” said Kennard.
    


            “But a lot of that has been stripped out and flushed downstream.”
    


            Scientists feared some little fish had been flushed out, too – downstream into the path of other predatory fish, like Barramundi and Mangrove Jack, or into a salty estuary where they might not survive.
    


            A lot has changed in the three decades since Kennard and Pusey first discovered the fish.
    


            Back then, they were a team of two in a vehicle, without even a mobile phone to communicate their whereabouts. “We're probably lucky not to get lost or die or get bogged,” said Kennard.
    


            Now, drones map the stream and the vegetation from above, and environmental DNA samples indicate the presence of creatures in the water, without having to catch them.
    


            Funding from the National Environmental Science Program has broadened the team to include scientists from James Cook University and natural resource management group Terrain NRM, who know this rugged landscape better than most.
    


            Most significantly, scientists have been working closely with the Jabalbina Yalanji Indigenous Rangers, who manage the land and are learning more about the cod.
    


            Bobby Kulka, an Eastern Kuku Yalanji Traditional Owner, said stories passed down through his ancestors didn't include mention of the mysterious fish.
    


            “It's good to know they're here. I've never known they were here before. I've never heard any stories about them,” he said.
    


            Local Aboriginal people are being trained to help monitor the fish so that when the scientists leave, their work will help fill in the blanks about the Bloomfield Cod.
    


            So little is known about how the fish reproduces that no one has been able to successfully breed them in captivity.
    


            One option to save the species may be to start a captive breeding program in case they become extinct in the wild.
    


            Another potential solution is to try to establish other populations in nearby catchments, where introduced species aren't a threat.
    


            But finding those protected catchments could be difficult, given the dense forest that surrounds the river and the spread of invasive species.
    


            Introducing populations at other sites is fraught with risk, too.  Would they upset the natural balance? Or create unintended consequences for other species that live there?
    


            Clearing the river of introduced species is not an option, Kennard said.
    


            “You could potentially remove an isolated population. But when they're in a big river like this, and it's all connected, it's impossible,” said Kennard.
    


            The Bloomfield Cod is listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of endangered species, but that was before Cyclone Jasper and before researchers discovered non-native fish within the catchment.
    


            Right now, the emphasis is on gathering enough data to nominate the fish for legal ﻿protection.
    


            A listing would raise its profile and create new opportunities to save one of Australia's rarest fish that Kennard warns could become extinct within 10 to 20 years.
    


            “I think it's at real risk of becoming extinct,” he said. “That's not going to happen on my watch.”

Brooks Koepka's decision to leave LIV Golf years after becoming one of the notable faces to join the renegade league sent shock waves through the sport this week.

Koepka played in the LIV Golf series for more than three seasons, winning five events and taking home the PGA Championship in 2023.

Golf commentator Brandel Chamblee on Friday offered his two cents on fans clamoring for Koepka to return to the PGA Tour, writing in a post on X he disagreed with the notion.

"I certainly disagree with this," he wrote. "Allowing Brooks Koepka to return to the PGA Tour with no consequence, would undermine the very meritocratic foundations that make the PGA Tour legitimate — not because of who he is, but because of what his return (will) signal."

Chamblee said there should be a penalty of some kind for Koepka or anyone else who jumped to the league, which is backed by the Saudi Arabian government.

"LIV did not merely offer an alternative league, it fractured fields, diluted competitive meaning, triggered legal warfare, undermined sponsorship stability, and forced structural change across all of professional golf," he continued. "Koepka was not a passive bystander, he was a marquee legitimizer.

"You don't punish him for being influential, but you cannot pretend his influence didn't matter. His credibility made LIV viable, his stature normalized defection and his success (especially after joining LIV) validated the disruption."

Chamblee suggested a penalty would suffice and being reintegrated into the PGA Tour would be the route that officials should go with.

"A penalty would not so much be a punishment as it would be an acknowledgment of choice and the consequence does not need to be punitive to be meaningful," he added. "He could be made to re-qualify for the PGA Tour (his 5 year exemption for winning the PGA Championship for majors may stand but not for the PGA Tour).

"He could have limited season eligibility and/or a suspension tied to prior contracted breach. The players who stayed on the PGA Tour paid a price. They had to absorb the uncertainty, play in weaker fields, shoulder reputational risk and take on a greater responsibility of protecting the tour's continuity."

Ultimately, Chamblee wrote, the penalty wouldn't be about punishing anyone but rather the consequences for sending a ripple effect through the sport and protecting the PGA Tour.

"It is about whether the PGA Tour believe commitments mean something. If elite players can destabilize the system, take guaranteed money and then return instantly because they are popular or successful, the message is that rules apply only to the expendable," Chamblee wrote.

"If excellence alone erases consequences then the PGA Tour ceases to be a meritocracy and becomes a marketplace of convenience. Great players most certainly deserve respect, but institutions deserve protection."

As a relationship counselor with over 10 years of experience, I've learned that even the strongest couples face conflict. What sets emotionally intelligent couples apart is their ability to stay connected, even when disagreements arise.

I'm often more concerned about couples who never fight, because avoiding conflict entirely can hide unresolved hurts. After all, the closer you are, the more likely ruptures are to happen, and how you handle them matters.

Here are three things emotionally intelligent couples do differently when they are in conflict.

We've all been there. One sharp comment can seem like an attack on your character. For example, you forget to text back and it is interpreted as not caring. A request for space could be misconstrued as abandonment.

Research shows that when couples are distressed, they're more likely to interpret a partner's behavior in ways that make it feel intentional, fixed, and personal ("you did this because you're that kind of person"). Psychologists call this "negative attribution bias."

Before conflicts devolve into defensiveness and character attacks, I give my clients a simple exercise.

Write down what you want to say. For example, "Why do you shut down every time I bring something up?" Then cross out every sentence that diagnoses your partner's motives ("you don't care," "you're trying to…," "you always…").

Next, try a reframe. Write down the observable behavior, its impact on you, and one clear, workable request: "When you go silent in moments like this, I start filling in the gaps on my own. I tell myself you don't care or that I've done something wrong, and I feel alone pretty quickly. What would really help is just hearing where you are, even if you don't know what else to say yet."

This is a great way to protect your relationship while still naming the problem and offering something constructive.

Emotionally intelligent couples don't expect their partner to fix their feelings, but they also don't shut each other out. A partner's presence can help them stay regulated and connected, even in anger or frustration.

Pausing during conflict is one of the hardest skills. It's hardest when you're triggered and least able to access your tools. I often encourage couples to plan ahead with a "clean pause" script, like: "I need 20 minutes so I don't say something I'll regret. I'll come back." 

Follow-through matters as much as the pause. Couples can also use co-regulation — small ways to calm together: "Can we sit next to each other while we talk?" or, "Can I get a hug first, then we keep going?"

These strategies help partners stay connected while still taking responsibility for their own emotions.

When people feel threatened, the brain loves shortcuts. Emotionally intelligent couples slow this process down and become, in effect, investigators of each other's inner worlds.

Curiosity has been associated with greater closeness and intimacy in conversations, especially during moments of disagreement.

Part of why curiosity disappears whether it's one, 10, or 20 years in is because we start living off our assumptions. We tell ourselves we already know what our partner meant, what they felt, and why they did it because the person across from you is so familiar.

The problem is that once you think you already know the story, you stop learning about your partner's actual experience. Conflict then becomes two competing narratives instead of a shared inquiry into what's really happening, even when you disagree.

Instead of assuming the worst, the most emotionally intelligent couples will ask questions like:

The strongest, most emotionally intelligent couples genuinely see who their partner is becoming, not who they want them to be or who they once were.

Europe stands at a crossroads: compete meaningfully in the AI race or stick to its world-leading climate goals. 

"It's like a fork in the road moment for Europe," Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives told CNBC. The bloc can either "play in the future" or risk "missing a big part of this technology wave."

The dilemma is compounded by the region's mandates for green energy. 

Globally, energy is the biggest bottleneck for building out AI-related data center projects. While the U.S. fires up fossil-fuel plants to power its build-out, Europe requires developers to disclose energy and water efficiency measures, adding red tape that can slow project launches. 

The European Union is often celebrated for its suite of agenda-setting environmental policies and how it has made strides with new mechanisms, such as the forthcoming carbon border tax. However, some critics argue it gets in the way of business. The continent is seen as "anti-entrepreneur," Ives said, which pushes European technology names and startups to move to the U.S., Middle East, or Asia in pursuit of more favorable policies. 

As Europe attempts to catch up in the AI race, the need for power-hungry infrastructure increases, demand for electricity surges — and that friction has become harder to ignore. Additional renewable energy capacity was intended to replace more polluting sources, but there are now concerns that this will play out differently.

"You can see in the U.K. that we're already rowing back on some of our commitments," Paul Jackson, regional Global Market Strategist at Invesco, told CNBC – and Europe will likely follow suit. 

"This is a fairly regular process that when times are good, it's easy to persuade individuals, businesses, governments, to move in the right direction on things like climate change, and to take some of the cost associated with doing that," Jackson said. However, pushing the climate agenda down the priority list is one of the easiest things legislators can do when faced with tougher times and competing interests, he added. 

The U.K.'s energy grid is free of coal, which is significantly dirtier than gas — Europe's, however, is not. 

"I'm worried that, at a certain stage, coal power plant closures might get actually postponed," Jags Walia, head of global listed infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, told CNBC.

Taking fossil fuels offline as renewables come online works when energy demand is flat, but that's no longer the case, he said. Data centers also require constant connection, so the intermittency of wind and solar could prove tricky. 

"Electricity wise, we might not be able to afford to close down coal power plants, which is going to be a real headache for the energy transition and energy security as well," Walia said.

Over the course of the year, Europe has rolled back a number of environmental commitments. 

On Dec. 16, the EU watered down its effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035. On Dec. 9. it approved a one-year delay to the implementation of a fresh EU emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and small industries – though simultaneously committed to slashing emissions by 90% by 2040. 

Earlier this year, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDDD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSRD) directives were also narrowed and pushed back.

Some have welcomed the moves as much-needed pragmatism rather than a retreat. 

"We are always at the edge of navigating into a position where it becomes so unattractive to be present in Europe that it doesn't make sense anymore. And on the other hand, a lot of the regulation is direly needed," Nick de la Forge, a general partner at venture capital fund Planet A Ventures, which backs climate-related technology startups, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Dec. 11. 

"And luckily, what we are seeing is a pretty healthy revamp." 

The reshaping of directives, including the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which is currently undergoing review, is "quite pragmatic, and we think that's an improvement," De la Forge said. 

AI advocates tout the technology's ability to make energy systems more efficient and boost sustainability, positioning it as both a problem and solution to intensifying demands on the grid, and perhaps making it worth the investment. 

"As AI rapidly advances, its potential to strengthen Europe's energy resilience and accelerate the clean transition is becoming increasingly clear. At the same time, the growing electricity needs of AI technologies call for smart, forward-looking planning," a European Commission spokesperson told CNBC.

They added that the economic bloc "is fully prepared to seize these opportunities while safeguarding the stability and reliability of Europe's energy system."

The Commission did not specifically address questions asked by CNBC around a rollback of sustainability legislation as a result of its AI push, or how it plans to meet the new legally binding target. 

Instead, a spokesperson for the bloc referred to the region's preparations for a roadmap for the use of AI in the energy sector, in line with its broader Apply AI Strategy, which was designed to fast-track the deployment of the tech. 

If policymakers hold tight on sustainability requirements, AI infrastructure developers may instead offset their emissions with carbon credits or renewable energy certificates. One credit represents the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide, or the prevention of one metric ton from entering the atmosphere. 

AI hyperscalers "do still have their headline decarbonization target" but are turning to such measures to meet them, according to Jim Wright, manager of the Premier Miton Global Infrastructure Income Fund. "Because, in reality, they will use some gas, and they may even use some coal," he said, referring to variations in the makeup of energy grids. 

That reality was recognized in the EU's Dec. 9 deal, which included the use of carbon removal credits to reach the fresh reduction target. In all, it has created an era of energy addition rather than transition – a dynamic embraced by oil CEOs – as AI-driven demand for power outpaces supply from clean sources. 

It's also a question of energy security, not only abundance. The data center and AI race "puts a lot more strain on our energy infrastructure, and as we have seen in recent years, we're not terribly resilient when it comes to that," said Jackson. It means adding an almost base-level demand of energy to existing grids, which could make pricing more volatile and lead to energy rationing, he said.

Climate change is an infrastructure and business risk — which is not going away, experts have told CNBC. 

For Kokou Agbo Bloua, global head of research at Société Générale, it's "a massive elephant in the room" and one of his biggest worries looking forward. 

Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday, he said: "We're sort of toast … pun intended, actually, because we're on the path of two-and-a-half, three degrees [of warming above pre-industrial levels]. And if you look at green technologies, [they're] being used for data centers, as opposed to replacing fossil fuels."

But it could be some years before a formal scrapping of Europe's environmental targets. "Sometimes on sustainability goals, what countries do is, if they are going to walk away from a goal, they try to leave it till the last minute," Walia said.

"We see it as our responsibility."

A Spanish energy-tech company is testing a new way to pay for cleaner power, and it could transform how renewable projects get funded around the world. 

Turbo Energy has launched a pilot program, as reported by Cointelegraph, to tokenize financing for solar-plus-storage systems. Starting with an on-site installation at a supermarket, the project will use the Stellar Development Foundation's blockchain to raise capital. The goal is to make sustainable energy more accessible and easier to build. 

Along with Stellar, Turbo Energy is developing the pilot with digital-asset firm Taurus. Here's how it will work: Instead of relying on traditional lending or large institutional investors, blockchain tokens let many participants fund a project by purchasing fractional shares of the debt. Each token represents a contribution toward the installation — in this case, Turbo Energy's Sunbox solar-plus-battery system — which generates cleaner power under a long-term power purchase agreement.

If the model works, it could streamline financing for commercial and industrial solar projects. That matters because upfront cost is one of the biggest holdups for businesses that want to switch to clean energy. But this opens the door to a wider pool of investors.

The pilot is an example of energy as a service, which is now valued at more than $74 billion and expected to double by 2030, according to Grand View Research. With EAAS, customers don't have to buy or maintain equipment; instead, they simply pay for the clean electricity they use.

This is an interesting pivot within the crypto industry, which has been heavily criticized for its environmental footprint. While proof-of-work models like bitcoin use massive amounts of electricity — often tied to dirty energy sources — moves like this show some innovation toward eco-friendly strategies. 

We've seen similar efforts in the industry, such as Argo Blockchain mining crypto with hydropower and Soluna building data centers near renewable energy farms. In fact, the Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report found that bitcoin now uses 52.4% of its energy from sustainable sources, up from 37.6% in 2022.

Reactions from those involved in the project have been enthusiastic. "We are combining real-world solar storage infrastructure with blockchain technology to create a pathway for new revenue streams and wider access to sustainable investments," said Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, per Stellar.

"We see it as our responsibility to ensure that blockchain innovation benefits real economies and real communities," added Lamine Brahimi, co-founder and managing partner of Taurus.

The NFT market failed to deliver a year-end Santa rally in December, extending its downturn as valuations slid to their lowest point of 2025. Data shows the total NFT market cap dropped to $2.5 billion, marking a 72% decline from January's $9.2 billion peak. On the other hand, weekly sales volumes struggled to regain momentum throughout the month.Meanwhile, attention is shifting toward AI crypto coins, particularly AI crypto projects that offer real utility and scalable growth narratives. One standout is DeepSnitch AI, one of the top artificial intelligence cryptocurrencies gaining traction as its launch draws near, with early investors positioning for what many believe could be 100x upside potential.

The NFT sector continued its downward trajectory in December, closing out the year under mounting pressure as overall market values slipped to their weakest levels of 2025. Despite expectations of a seasonal bounce, the market showed little sign of recovery during the traditionally stronger year-end period.

Market data indicates that the total valuation of NFTs fell to roughly $2.5 billion in December, representing a steep decline of more than 70% compared to highs recorded at the start of the year. Trading activity also failed to regain momentum. Weekly NFT sales volumes remained muted throughout most of December, consistently staying below $70 million during the first three weeks of the month. 

DeepSnitch AI is an early-stage AI trading intelligence platform built to provide most traders with data and insights in real time. To fulfill this, the project deploys five specialized AI agents designed to monitor, analyze, and interpret on-chain activity, market sentiment, and abnormal trading behavior. Three of these agents are already live: SnitchFeed, SnitchScan, and SnitchGPT. All three report to a single, fully operational dashboard. 

That live utility and value is what separates DeepSnitch AI from most AI-powered tokens. While many projects promise future features, DeepSnitch AI is already delivering value in real time. SnitchFeed surfaces emerging narratives before they trend, SnitchScan tracks suspicious wallet movements and smart money behavior, and SnitchGPT helps traders interpret complex data without needing advanced technical knowledge. 

This is exactly why DeepSnitch AI is increasingly framed as one of the top AI crypto coins despite the market's volatile conditions. As NFTs stall and speculative capital dries up, traders are gravitating toward AI crypto projects that can actively improve decision-making rather than just ride hype cycles. 

As more investors search for the best AI crypto coins, projects with working products, low early-stage valuations, and real demand stand out. DeepSnitch AI checks all three boxes, making its current window one that many believe won't stay open for long.

Bittensor's native token TAO weakened this past week, slipping from $230.4 on December 19 to about $222.3 on December 25. This marks a 4% decline. According to recent market data, TAO has been navigating increased selling pressure after failing to consistently hold above key support levels, contributing to the subdued price action.  

Traders are still watching to see how TAO responds, especially after its halving event, which took place on December 4. While it was a structural change that was expected to support scarcity, it has so far coincided with the gentle bearish sentiment in the market.  

Near Protocol's native token NEAR experienced a modest downturn over the past week, dipping roughly 2% from about $1.52 on December 19 to $1.48 on December 25. The move mirrors ongoing uncertainty across crypto assets, where traders have remained cautious amid choppy conditions heading into the end of the year.

Technical data shows NEAR trading around key support levels, with some analysts noting that price compression patterns suggest the market is waiting for clearer direction before committing to new positions. Also, as the demand for AI crypto coins increases, NEAR could be on the verge of a breakout anytime soon.

While much of the crypto market closes out the year under pressure, AI crypto coins with real utility are gaining attention. DeepSnitch AI stands out in this environment by offering live tools when traders need them most, a low early-stage valuation, and a clear launch timeline at the end of January. 

As other investors continue to wait on the sidelines, DeepSnitch AI continues to reward early participation through presale pricing and limited-time bonuses. Investors using DSNTVIP50 receive a 50% bonus on purchases above $2,000, while DSNTVIP100 unlocks a 100% bonus for buys over $5,000, both expiring on January 1. For example, a $5,000 allocation today effectively doubles in token count before the launch even happens.

In a market where capital efficiency matters more than ever, this presents a unique opportunity that no one should miss.Check out the official website before the next price increase and visit X and Telegram for their latest community updates.

DeepSnitch AI is considered one of the best AI crypto coins because it already delivers live trading intelligence despite being in its early presale stages. 

AI crypto coins are likely to remain in high demand as traders and investors increasingly seek data-driven tools rather than speculation alone. DeepSnitch AI benefits directly from this trend by serving both active traders and long-term holders.

Yes, DeepSnitch AI is still in its presale phase, meaning early investors can access tokens before full launch and price discovery. While other tokens may post gradual gains, DeepSnitch AI's impressive features and bonus offers support its narrative as a potential 100x opportunity for those who enter before the next price jump.

Dogecoin edged down to $0.123 while Shiba Inu slipped to $0.000007165, with both tokens failing to sustain rebounds during U.S. hours as bitcoin's attempted bounce faded and ether stayed heavy — a setup that kept meme coins pinned to technical levels rather than narrative catalysts.

Meme coins continued to trade like high-beta proxies for broader risk appetite as large-cap crypto remained choppy into year-end. Bitcoin's rebound attempts haven't shown consistent follow-through during U.S. hours, and that lack of momentum has kept speculative corners of the market under pressure.

Ether's muted tape has also mattered. With ETH struggling to regain traction, flows have leaned toward caution in higher-risk sectors, and meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB have been among the first to get sold into strength. Thin liquidity and position cleanup into late December have amplified moves around obvious technical levels, even when headline news is limited.

DOGE remains in a tightening consolidation, but with a bearish bias after repeated failures above $0.1260–$0.1264. That zone is now the most visible near-term supply, reinforced by high-volume rejections, while the $0.1208–$0.1220 band is the demand shelf holding the structure together. A sustained break below $0.122 risks a deeper slide toward $0.1280 and then $0.1250, while a reset requires reclaiming $0.133 to unwind the short-term downtrend and force sellers to cover.

SHIB's structure is weaker. Price slipped through the $0.00000717–$0.00000718 floor, confirming a descending-channel bias and shifting focus to $0.000007145 as the next support marker. If that level fails, the next real demand pocket sits near $0.00000707, while rebounds are likely capped in the $0.00000722–$0.00000725 zone unless volume returns in a sustained way.

The straight read is that DOGE is still range-trading at the bottom of its band, while SHIB has already lost a key level and is trading like it's searching for the next floor. That divergence usually signals sector-wide fragility rather than selective accumulation.

DOGE slipped from $0.1258 to $0.1230 over 24 hours, with volume running 11.5% above its seven-day averageA high-volume rejection near $0.1264 reinforced that sellers remain active on reboundsSupport stayed active near $0.1208–$0.1220, keeping the market from unravelingSHIB slid to $0.000007165 after breaking the $0.00000717–$0.00000718 floorSelling accelerated during the drop from the $0.00000722–$0.00000725 resistance zone toward $0.00000707 support

This is still a technical market, not a headline market. DOGE is trading off clean levels, and $0.122 is the line that matters: hold it and the market can keep grinding sideways; lose it and downside opens quickly as stops trigger below the range. For DOGE, upside relief starts only if price can reclaim $0.1264, with $0.133 as the level that would actually change the bias.

SHIB is more vulnerable because the breakdown already happened. Bulls need to reclaim $0.00000717–$0.00000718 to neutralize the slide, otherwise $0.000007145 is the next “must hold,” and failure there likely draws price toward $0.00000707.

If bitcoin can't sustain rebounds and ether remains heavy, meme coins tend to keep bleeding — not in one straight flush, but in repeated failed bounces that invite more selling. The trade is simple: watch whether DOGE holds $0.122 and whether SHIB can regain its broken floor. Those two levels will tell you whether this is base-building or another leg down.

XRP slipped to $1.86 as traders continued to sell into rallies, even as spot ETF demand stayed steady and total ETF-held assets climbed to $1.25 billion — a gap that suggests the market is still digesting supply at key technical levels.

Institutional appetite for XRP exposure continued to build through exchange-traded funds, with investors adding $8.19 million in recent sessions. That pushed total ETF-held net assets to $1.25 billion, reinforcing the idea that professional investors are building positions through regulated vehicles rather than chasing spot momentum.

The flow trend fits a broader pattern in institutional crypto allocation: portfolio managers increasingly prefer structured products that reduce custody and compliance friction, especially when liquidity is deep and regulatory clarity is improving. XRP's depth across venues and the steady ETF bid has kept longer-term demand intact, even as short-term price action remains choppy.

In the wider market, bitcoin's attempted rebound lacked follow-through during U.S. hours, leaving majors stuck in a risk-off, range-bound tape where flows matter but technical levels still dictate the day-to-day trade.

XRP fell from $1.88 to $1.86, staying pinned inside a $1.85–$1.91 channel as sellers repeatedly defended the $1.9060–$1.9100 resistance area. Volume rose sharply during the session's most active window, with 75.3 million changing hands — about 76% above average — during the rejection, underscoring that this isn't a low-liquidity drift. It's a market meeting real offers overhead.

Price briefly pushed out of its $1.854–$1.858 consolidation pocket and tested $1.862 on a burst of activity that spiked roughly 8–9x versus typical intraday flow. But the move lacked persistence, and XRP rotated back toward $1.86 as supply returned.

The repeated defense of $1.90+ suggests sellers are still using that zone to distribute into strength. At the same time, bids near $1.86–$1.87 have shown up consistently enough to keep the market from unraveling — creating a tightening coil where the next break is likely to be decisive.

Two forces are competing, and that's the story: ETF flows keep leaning supportive in the background, but near-term traders are still treating $1.90–$1.91 as a sell zone.

The levels are clean:

For now, the tape reads like consolidation with distribution overhead — but with ETF flows acting as a stabilizer that could make downside moves more grinding than free-falling unless bitcoin breaks down sharply again.

Oops, something went wrong

While it may be surprising, but even in a country as financially advanced as Canada, hundreds of thousands of people still lack access to basic banking services.

According to a 2022 Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) study (1), roughly 600,000 Canadians are “unbanked,” meaning they have no chequing or savings account. Millions more are “underbanked,” relying on payday lenders, prepaid cards, or money-transfer services that charge steep fees.

For newcomers, low-income workers, and rural or indigenous communities, the barriers can be both financial and geographic. But as digital finance evolves, one question looms larger than ever: could a smartphone and a digital wallet fix that?

At its core, blockchain-based finance (or DeFi, short for decentralized finance) eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks. Using smart contracts — self-executing code on public blockchains — users can send, borrow, lend, or earn interest without ever stepping into a branch.

Crypto banks built on blockchain “offer borderless wealth mobility, programmable finance, and seamless entry into emerging products such as tokenized real estate and private credit,” explains Mike Foy, CFO of Amino Bank (2). Unlike traditional banks, crypto banks operate continuously — 24/7, 365 days a year — without waiting for business hours or borders to open.

This kind of “always-on” infrastructure could be transformative for people who struggle with access to traditional banking. A DeFi wallet doesn't care about your credit history, immigration status, or postal code. All it requires is an internet connection.

Dr. Niklas J.R.M. Schmidt, a contributor to The AI Crypto Boom report (3), described it as “a new economic reality where AI and digital systems can manage and move value independently.”

That same autonomy — without branches or back offices — could help democratize access to financial tools long reserved for those inside the system.

Canada's financial system is widely regarded as one of the world's most stable. But stability can also breed exclusion.

In rural and remote areas, physical bank branches are disappearing faster than ever. Between 2019 and 2024, major banks closed over 400 branches nationwide, leaving smaller towns and northern regions reliant on distant ATMs (automatic teller machines) or digital-only access. For those with unreliable broadband, that's no access at all.

Indigenous communities face even steeper hurdles. A 2023 Senate report on Indigenous economic participation found that many First Nations residents are “effectively cut off” from basic banking due to a lack of branches, ID verification barriers, and mistrust of institutions (4). For these Canadians, crypto-based solutions — such as digital wallets that can receive remittances or store savings — may offer a bridge.

Dominic Volek of Henley & Partners describes this trend (5): “Cryptocurrency democratizes capabilities once reserved for the ultra-wealthy. The same tools multinational corporations used to shift capital are now available to anyone with an internet connection.”

For rural or marginalized users, that could mean the first true opportunity to store, send, and grow their money—without needing to rely on the big five banks.

The potential isn't theoretical — it's already emerging in small but powerful ways. Examples of how crytocurrency is helping remove barriers include:

Lower-cost remittances: For newcomers to Canada sending money home, blockchain transfers can cut costs dramatically. Traditional remittance services can charge 7% to 10% in fees, while crypto remittances can complete transactions for under 1% — and often in minutes. The Crypto Wealth Report 2025 notes that over US$2 trillion in stablecoin activity each month is already handled by AI and automated systems, many facilitating global peer-to-peer payments.

Microloans via blockchain: Emerging fintech firms in Toronto and Vancouver are experimenting with blockchain microloan platforms that let users borrow small amounts against tokenized assets or proof-of-savings, without credit checks.

Crypto savings and investment apps: Several Canadian startups now offer hybrid models—allowing users to earn interest on stablecoins pegged to the Canadian or U.S. dollar. These mimic high-interest savings accounts but operate via blockchain protocols rather than bank-led products.

While none of these systems are regulated at the same level as banks, they demonstrate crypto's potential to serve segments the traditional system overlooks.

Still, realizing that potential will require more than code. As the Crypto Banking 2025 report emphasizes (6), custody and regulatory safeguards are “critical, particularly for those seeking security with blockchain-based innovations.”

In Canada, this means upgrading both policy and infrastructure. The Bank of Canada has already begun research into a central bank digital currency (CBDC), exploring how a “digital loonie” could improve inclusion and payment efficiency. But progress has been slow, in part due to privacy and governance concerns.

Meanwhile, other countries are moving quickly. The UAE's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) licensing regime, Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulation, and Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) framework are already integrating crypto into their mainstream banking systems. Canada, by comparison, still lacks clarity on whether certain DeFi activities — like staking rewards or yield farming — constitute income or capital gains.

As Dominic Weibel wrote in the Crypto Wealth Report 2025 (7), “The new laws of wealth are being written in code.” Canada will need to decide soon whether it wants to help draft those laws—or simply enforce them after the fact.

While DeFi offers freedom, it also carries serious hazards. Price volatility, fraud, and the absence of deposit insurance remain major concerns.

Crypto's open-access model makes it easier for scams to spread, and market swings can wipe out savings overnight. As Volek cautions in his report (8): poorly designed or overly punitive regulation could backfire, “accelerating the very disintermediation governments seek to prevent.”

The answer isn't restriction — it's education. Financial literacy needs to evolve to include digital asset safety, private-key management, and the realities of risk exposure. Without it, the most vulnerable Canadians could become the easiest targets in an unregulated marketplace.

For now, crypto remains a supplement, not a substitute, for traditional banking. But as blockchain systems mature, they could deliver the very things Canada's big banks have struggled to provide: affordability, accessibility and autonomy.

If properly integrated and regulated, DeFi could one day offer a parallel financial system — one where access isn't determined by income, location, or institutional trust, but by digital literacy and connectivity.

As observed by Volek (9): “We are at an inflection point in global wealth management. Just as private banking once distinguished wealth from mass banking, crypto banks are now defining the next frontier.”

For Canada's underserved citizens, that frontier might not be a distant concept. It might be as close as the next app download.

Crypto may never replace banks — but it can fill the gaps they leave behind. If Canada can align its regulation and infrastructure with innovation, blockchain could finally make banking what it should have been all along: borderless, affordable, and inclusive.

Moonie NFT USD (MNYUSD) is holding steady with no recent price movement, maintaining its position at $0.000002688. Despite a 0.0% change, its history shows a drastic decrease. With a lack of fluctuations, the crypto community is curious about what lies ahead for MNYUSD.

As of today, Moonie NFT USD (MNYUSD) is priced at $0.000002688, reflecting no change over recent trading sessions. The day's high and low mirror this price, and the market capitalization remains at $0. This stagnant phase draws attention, especially given its all-time high this year of $0.000003.

Looking at the history, MNYUSD has shown significant declines, with a year-to-date decrease of 10.40% and a staggering drop of 99.99624% over five years. Such steep declines prompt questions about its viability in the long term, emphasizing the importance of monitoring market trends closely.

Current technical indicators present a mixed picture. With an RSI of 0.00 and a MACD of 0.00, MNYUSD shows no immediate signs of momentum or directional movement. The Average True Range (ATR) also stands at 0.00, suggesting minimal volatility. Traders might view this as an asset in a resting phase.

Future predictions for MNYUSD suggest growth over long terms, with a potential price of $0.000548 in seven years. However, these forecasts depend on various factors. As always, expectations can shift due to macroeconomic changes, regulatory impacts, or unforeseen market events. It's wise to stay informed, possibly leveraging insights from platforms like Meyka AI.

Despite a current lack of movement, Moonie NFT USD remains a point of interest due to its past dramatic price changes and future potential. Keeping an eye on technical indicators and market conditions, along with using advanced tools, could provide crucial insights into its next phase.

MNYUSD's price of $0.000002688 hasn't changed recently due to a lack of trading activity and market interest at this time, maintaining its stability within the low range.

The highest price for MNYUSD this year was $0.000003, indicating some past activity but currently sitting lower at $0.000002688 due to market conditions.

Over five years, MNYUSD has lost 99.99624% of its value, reflecting significant downturns due to various market pressures and possibly declining interest.

Technical indicators show no current movement, with an RSI and MACD at 0.00, pointing to an equilibrium phase without clear bullish or bearish signals.

Long-term predictions suggest growth to $0.000548 in seven years, though these are speculative and depend on many external variables and market conditions.

Bitcoin slumped on Saturday following a flat week where the leading cryptocurrency was outshone by precious metals and the stock market. 

The biggest and oldest digital coin was trading for close to $87,404 per coin on Saturday morning New York time, down by nearly 2% over a 24-hour period. 

Over the past seven days, Bitcoin has dipped by close to 1%. And over the past month, the asset is down by 4%. 

Ethereum, meanwhile, was trading lower over the past week, having dropped by more than 2% to nearly $2,927. XRP dropped further over a seven-day period and was priced at $1.85. 

Both Ethereum and XRP were trading significantly below their all-time highs — by 41% and 49%, respectively. 

Perhaps more disappointing for investors, though, is that while Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have missed out on a “Santa rally,” gold, silver and US equities have touched new highs.

Bitcoin in October broke a new record when it touched $126,080. But investor fatigue and a brutal crash that wiped out a record $19 billion in liquidations has stunted the coin's rise since then. 

The virtual coin and other cryptocurrencies are now down year-to-date; Bitcoin was trading for close to $95,000 on January 1 and continued to surge that month following the inauguration of crypto-friendly president Donald Trump. 

Meanwhile, gold, silver and platinum have continued to notch new highs thanks to geopolitical headwinds and as the so-called debasement trade gains momentum. 

US stocks, too, have rocketed with both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending at record closing highs on Wednesday. On Friday, the indices were trading slightly lower. 

This was supposed to be Bitcoin's year: President Trump campaigned on a ticket to help the industry and signed landmark digital asset bills after taking office. But a lack of liquidity has not helped the coin. 

Still, some analysts are expecting crypto markets to rally in 2026, with expanding central bank balance sheets to fund deficits and provide liquidity to the market. 

Other industry observers have also said that Bitcoin's typical four-year cycle is now over and despite some traders selling on the fear that digital assets will drop in 2026, the asset class is likely to deliver returns next year.

The use case of stablecoins in Venezuela

Venezuela's economic collapse has given rise to an unlikely savior: cryptocurrency. Years of hyperinflation (prices jumped by over 1 million percent in 2018, escalating to IMF predictions of 10 million percent in 2019) and U.S. sanctions isolating Venezuela from global banking have driven many to digital currencies as a financial lifeline. Crypto is now used to preserve savings from inflation, move money across borders, and even conduct oil sales. Making Venezuela a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption.

As the bolívar's value evaporated, Venezuelans began rapidly converting bolívars into Bitcoin or dollar-pegged stablecoins to protect their earnings. Chainalysis ranked Venezuela third globally for grassroots crypto adoption in 2020, reflecting how pervasive crypto use became amid the crisis. Compared to the past adoption index for Latin America (LatAm), between July 2024 and June 2025, Venezuela raked in $44.6 billion in transaction volume, as the Chainalysis data below shows.

By one estimate, around 10% of Venezuelans now hold some form of cryptocurrency. Strict capital controls and high fees on bank transfers (up to 56% on remittances) also made crypto an attractive alternative for sending money. In 2023 about 9% of Venezuela's $5.4 billion in remittances flowed through cryptocurrencies instead of traditional channels.

Notably, in late 2020 the opposition led by Juan Guaidó even worked with a U.S. fintech to distribute pandemic aid via USDC stablecoins to Venezuelan healthcare workers, bypassing Maduro's banking controls.

9% of all the money sent home last year to Venezuela was bitcoin and crypto remittances on the blockchain, according to data from Chainalysis.

President Nicolás Maduro launched a state-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro, in 2018 to try to evade sanctions and stabilize the currency. The government even required Petro to make some payments, such as passport fees and taxes. However, the Petro never gained public trust or international backing. By 2020, it had essentially fizzled out, and by 2024, it was largely defunct.

The government then turned to established cryptocurrencies. State oil company PDVSA began asking buyers of Venezuelan crude to pay in Tether (USDT) initially in 2023, with requirements strengthening in 2024, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, as a sanctions workaround. By early 2024 some oil contracts required part of the payment in USDT. Selling oil for crypto was unprecedented, but it reduced the risk of proceeds being frozen in banks under U.S. sanctions.

On the ground, crypto has become part of daily life for many. Some shops and cafes accept payment in Bitcoin or Dash, and countless people use mobile apps to swap bolívars for USDT to store their day-to-day money. Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange networks flourished to meet this demand. For years, Venezuela was one of the biggest markets on LocalBitcoins, bolívar trades on the platform once led Latin America.

When LocalBitcoins later shut down, users migrated to other venues. Binance's P2P marketplace, for instance, saw Venezuelan bolívar trade volumes jump as people continued exchanging fiat for crypto. In effect, a parallel financial system has developed, allowing Venezuelans to transact and save in digital assets outside of the unstable local currency.

Cheap electricity also turned Venezuela into a hotspot for Bitcoin mining. By the late 2010s, miners were using nearly free power to generate crypto, earning more stable value than any local job could pay. The government initially tolerated mining. In 2020 it set up a licensing system under the crypto regulator (Sunacrip).

However, in 2023 a corruption scandal involving missing oil revenues sparked a broader crypto crackdown. Authorities alleged that billions in PDVSA funds were siphoned off via crypto wallets. Dozens of officials were arrested, including Sunacrip chief Joselit Ramírez, who had overseen the Petro. The government suspended Sunacrip and ordered police to shut down unregistered mining farms.

By 2024, Venezuela outright banned Bitcoin mining, blaming it for straining the electrical grid. Thousands of mining rigs were seized as the once-thriving mining community was put out of action. These enforcement moves have introduced uncertainty for crypto businesses, but they have not extinguished popular use.

Despite the government's crackdowns, cryptocurrency remains embedded in Venezuela's economy. When traditional money systems failed, Venezuelans improvised: street vendors hedge their daily sales in stablecoins, families rely on crypto remittances, and savers trust digital dollars over bolívars. The government's own crypto initiative may have flopped, but grassroots usage continues to grow.

As of writing time, Venezuela still ranks among the world's most active crypto markets, a testament to how necessity and ingenuity have made digital assets a vital lifeline in the country's ongoing economic storm.

Altcoin-backed loans are on the rise, especially as crypto investors look for liquidity solutions. But with that boom comes the wild volatility of altcoins, which can put both borrowers and lenders in precarious situations. So, how do we navigate this landscape? Let's dive into multi-collateral frameworks and dynamic risk management strategies that may help.

Altcoins can offer diversification and potentially impressive returns, but let's be honest, they're usually more volatile than Bitcoin and Ethereum. One minute they're up, the next they're crashing down because of low liquidity, protocol updates, or just a sudden change in market mood. In the world of single-collateral lending, that volatility can spell disaster. A sharp drop in the value of an altcoin could push a loan right under safe collateral levels, leading to margin calls or forced liquidations. The risk to lending platforms ramps up significantly, especially if multiple loans are tied to assets that are moving in tandem during a market downturn.

To help keep the madness at bay, platforms like Clapp are taking a different approach by using multi-collateral frameworks. These frameworks allow borrowers to secure loans using a broad range of assets, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but a variety of altcoins like SOL, BNB, and LINK, along with stablecoins. By assessing the combined value and composition of the collateral pool, lenders can take a bit of the sting out of those crazy price movements. If one altcoin dives, the other assets in the pool can help absorb the shock, keeping things more steady overall.

This method of risk management is somewhat akin to what we see in traditional finance, where exposure isn't just analyzed on an asset-by-asset basis but rather at the portfolio level. So, by diversifying the collateral, lenders can create a more stable environment for lending, which is ultimately a win-win for everyone involved.

Dynamic risk management is also a must in the world of altcoin lending. Platforms like Clapp let borrowers actively manage and rebalance their collateral positions in real-time. If an altcoin starts getting volatile, users can add more stable collateral, reduce exposure to that asset, or shift weight toward Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. This flexibility means borrowers can be more proactive and prevent their loans from hitting those dreaded liquidation thresholds. 

Unlike traditional fixed-loan models, Clapp's revolving credit line structure actually encourages more cautious borrowing. Unused credit has a 0% APR, and interest only accrues on the portion of funds actually withdrawn, which makes it less tempting to overborrow.

On top of that, regulatory compliance has to be part of the mix. Clapp operates under a VASP license in the Czech Republic, aligning its operations with European regulatory standards for crypto service providers. This compliance mandates that they comply with anti-money laundering (AML) obligations and operational transparency requirements.

While regulation won't magically eliminate market risk, it does significantly lower counterparty and operational risks, creating a safer environment for borrowers and lenders alike. As the regulatory scene continues to shift, platforms that prioritize compliance are likely to pull ahead.

Navigating the world of altcoin-backed crypto loans calls for more than just basic collateral ratios. It requires a holistic approach that incorporates portfolio-level thinking, flexible management, and disciplined borrowing structures. Clapp's strategies—melding multi-collateral design, dynamic rebalancing, and regulatory compliance—show how altcoin risk can be managed without stifling borrower flexibility.

For crypto holders seeking to unlock liquidity from diverse portfolios, this risk-aware structure may represent a significant evolution in crypto lending. The market is maturing, and adapting to these strategies could prove essential for managing the complexities of altcoin lending while maximizing investment potential.

Is 2026 setting up a surprise leader?

While many investors hope for a “Santa Claus Rally,” Ethereum ETFs have seen the opposite this December. 

Since 11 December, they've been stuck in a steady outflow cycle, losing $853.9 million in two weeks as per Farside Investors. Only on 22 December did ETH ETFs see positive inflows of $84.6 million.

Here, the biggest surprise was BlackRock's ETHA since it unexpectedly led the outflows – A sign that even the strongest institutional players pulled back as the holidays approached.

Even though Ethereum [ETH] and Bitcoin [BTC] prices rose slightly over the last 24 hours, institutions appear to be de-risking or locking in tax losses before the year ends. 

Ethereum was trading at around $2,964 at press time, but the pressure from huge ETF outflows may be keeping traders nervous.

The key level to watch is $2,500. 

If outflows continue at the same pace, this important support level could be tested.

 Interestingly, despite the outflows, ETH was holding on to $2,900 on the price charts – A sign that retail traders or large on-chain buyers may be absorbing the selling from ETFs.

On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs have also faced a tough month, on an even bigger scale than Ethereum. 

Since 11 December, they have recorded $1.538 billion in outflows, showing a clear and sustained pullback from institutional investors. 

Only two days broke this trend.

12 December saw a modest $49.1 million in inflows. 17 December too saw inflows of over $457.3 million. 

Despite these brief moments of strength, however, the overall picture suggested that major players have been steadily withdrawing capital throughout December.

In fact, thanks to this selling spree and other multiple factors, Bitcoin was down and trading at $88,514.79 at press time. .

Despite their insignificant price gains, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for both BTC and ETH was still below 50 at press time. 

This suggested that bearish momentum is still strong in the short term.

However, both the RSIs moving north could be early signs of a bullish divergence. To put it simply, a potential trend reversal might be incoming. 

Source: Santiment

As we approach 2026, Bitcoin and Ethereum are each following their own distinct paths. 

On the contrary, Ripple [XRP] has stood out as the most consistent performer in the ETF space, recording daily inflows and pushing net assets above $1.16 billion. 

The scale of this steady demand is evidence of strong institutional confidence in XRP's regulatory position and long-term outlook. As it stands, both ETH and BTC seem unable to reach that level of confidence.

Researchers at Stanford Medicine have identified the biological steps that explain how mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines can, in rare cases, lead to heart inflammation in some adolescent and young adult males. Their work also points to a potential strategy for lowering that risk.

By combining modern laboratory techniques with previously published data from vaccinated individuals, the team uncovered a two-stage immune response. In this process, the vaccine activates one type of immune cell, which then stimulates another. Together, these immune reactions drive inflammation that can damage heart muscle cells and set off additional inflammatory effects.

Vaccines Remain Highly Safe and Effective

The findings come despite the fact that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been given billions of times worldwide and continue to show an excellent safety record, said Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.

"The mRNA vaccines have done a tremendous job mitigating the COVID pandemic," said Wu, the Simon H. Stertzer, MD, Professor and a professor of medicine and of radiology. "Without these vaccines, more people would have gotten sick, more people would have had severe effects and more people would have died."

mRNA vaccines are considered a major advance because they can be developed quickly, adjusted as viruses change, and tailored to target very different pathogens. Still, as with any medical intervention, reactions are not identical for everyone.

Understanding Vaccine-Associated Myocarditis

One uncommon but documented side effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is myocarditis, which refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and heart palpitations. These symptoms occur without a viral infection and typically appear within one to three days after vaccination.

Most affected individuals show elevated levels of cardiac troponin in their blood, a widely used marker of heart muscle injury. (Cardiac troponin is normally found exclusively in the heart muscle. When found circulating in blood, it indicates damage to heart muscle cells.)

The condition occurs in roughly one out of every 140,000 people after a first vaccine dose and increases to about one in 32,000 after a second dose. Rates are highest among males age 30 and younger, where it affects about one in 16,750 vaccine recipients.

Outcomes Are Usually Mild and Temporary

Wu emphasized that the majority of myocarditis cases linked to vaccination resolve quickly, with heart function either fully preserved or restored.

"It's not a heart attack in the traditional sense," he said. "There's no blockage of blood vessels as found in most common heart attacks. When symptoms are mild and the inflammation hasn't caused structural damage to the heart, we just observe these patients to make sure they recover."

In rare instances, however, severe inflammation can cause serious injury, leading to hospitalization, intensive care treatment or death.

"But COVID's worse," Wu said. He noted that a COVID-19 infection is about 10 times more likely to cause myocarditis than an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the many other risks posed by the disease.

A Closer Look at the Immune Response

Wu is a senior author of the study, publisded Dec. 10 in Science Translational Medicine, along with Masataka Nishiga, MD, PhD, a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar now at The Ohio State University. The study's lead author is Xu Cao, PhD, also a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford.

"Medical scientists are quite aware that COVID itself can cause myocarditis," Wu said. "To a lesser extent, so can the mRNA vaccines. The question is, why?"

Suspects Identified

To answer that question, the team analyzed blood samples from vaccinated individuals, including some who developed myocarditis. When they compared these samples with those from people who did not develop heart inflammation, two proteins stood out.

"Two proteins, named CXCL10 and IFN-gamma, popped up. We think these two are the major drivers of myocarditis," Wu said.

Both CXCL10 and IFN-gamma are cytokines, signaling molecules that immune cells use to communicate and coordinate their activity.

How Immune Cells Interact After Vaccination

The researchers grew human immune cells called macrophages in laboratory dishes and exposed them to mRNA vaccines. Macrophages act as early responders in immune defense.

After exposure, the macrophages released multiple cytokines, with especially high levels of CXCL10. Their behavior closely matched immune responses previously documented in vaccinated people.

When T cells were added to the system, either directly or by exposing them to fluid from the macrophage cultures, the T cells began producing large amounts of IFN-gamma. In contrast, T cells exposed to the vaccine alone did not show this spike. These findings showed that macrophages primarily produce CXCL10, while T cells are the main source of IFN-gamma following vaccination.

How the Cytokines Affect the Heart

To determine whether these cytokines directly harm the heart, the team vaccinated young male mice and observed increased cardiac troponin levels, indicating heart muscle injury.

They also found that immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, had entered heart tissue. Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells that respond aggressively to threats and are a major component of pus. Similar immune cell infiltration is seen in people who develop myocarditis after vaccination.

Blocking CXCL10 and IFN-gamma reduced the number of these immune cells entering the heart and limited damage to healthy tissue.

The researchers also detected increased levels of adhesion molecules in heart blood vessels. These molecules help immune cells latch onto vessel walls, making it easier for them to move into heart tissue.

Together, these findings confirmed that CXCL10 and IFN-gamma directly contribute to heart injury. Blocking them preserved much of the immune response to vaccination while lowering signs of heart damage.

Testing Human Heart Tissue Models

Wu's lab specializes in converting human skin or blood cells into stem-like cells that can become heart muscle cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells. These cells can be assembled into small, beating clusters that mimic aspects of heart function.

When these cardiac spheroids were exposed to CXCL10 and IFN-gamma collected from vaccinated immune cells, markers of heart stress rose sharply. Using inhibitors to block the cytokines reduced this damage.

Measures of heart function, including contraction strength and beating rhythm, were impaired by the cytokines but improved once the signaling was blocked.

Saved by a Soybean

Wu suspected that a widely available dietary compound might help protect the heart. Since myocarditis is more common in males and estrogen has anti-inflammatory effects, he revisited genistein, a soy-derived compound his team had studied previously.

In a 2022 study published in Cell, the researchers showed that genistein has anti-inflammatory properties and can counter marijuana-related damage to blood vessels and heart tissue.

"Genistein is only weakly absorbed when taken orally," Wu said. "Nobody ever overdosed on tofu."

Testing Genistein's Protective Effects

The team repeated their experiments while pre-treating cells, cardiac spheroids and mice (the latter by oral administration of large quantities) with genistein. This treatment reduced much of the heart damage caused by either mRNA vaccination or the CXCL10 and IFN-gamma combination.

The form of genistein used in the study was more purified and concentrated than supplements commonly sold in stores.

"It's reasonable to believe that the mRNA-vaccine-induced inflammatory response may extend to other organs," Wu said. "We and others have seen some evidence of this in lung, liver and kidney. It's possible that genistein may also reverse these changes."

Broader Implications Beyond COVID Vaccines

Heightened cytokine signaling may be a broader feature of mRNA vaccines. IFN-gamma, in particular, plays a critical role in defending the body against foreign DNA and RNA, including viral genetic material.

"Your body needs these cytokines to ward off viruses. It's essential to immune response but can become toxic in large amounts," Wu said. Excessive IFN-gamma can lead to myocarditis-like symptoms and breakdown of heart muscle proteins.

This risk is not limited to COVID vaccines alone.

"Other vaccines can cause myocarditis and inflammatory problems, but the symptoms tend to be more diffuse," Wu said. "Plus, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines' risks have received intense public scrutiny and media coverage. If you get chest pains from a COVID vaccine you go to the hospital to get checked out, and if the serum troponin is positive, then you get diagnosed with myocarditis. If you get achy muscles or joints from a flu vaccine, you just blow it off."

Funding and Support

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01 HL113006, R01 HL141371, R01 HL141851, R01 HL163680 and R01 HL176822) and the Gootter-Jensen Foundation.

Are we going to see ads in ChatGPT's answers soon?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


OpenAI is allegedly still working on adding ads to ChatGPT, with sources saying staff are discussing ways to bake them into the chatbot's responses. According to The Information, the AI company is looking to create a new type of digital ad rather than simply copying what existing search and social media companies are running. This is possible because OpenAI can use historical chat data to serve ads that are highly relevant to users' interests.

“As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we're looking at way to continue offering more intelligence to everyone. As part of this, we're exploring what ads in our product could look like,” OpenAI told The Information. “People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust.”

Staff discussions on ad implementation have ranged from prioritizing sponsored content in the chatbot's answers to adding a sidebar that shows ads related to the user's query. They've also considered showing them only when the conversation moves toward shopping or similar activities, or as a secondary step where ads are displayed only when someone clicks a link in ChatGPT's results.

It's been reported that OpenAI is shifting its focus away from ads, especially after CEO Sam Altman declared a ‘Code Red' for the company following the latest version of Google's Gemini, which outpaced ChatGPT in several benchmarks. Altman said that OpenAI needed to improve the AI chatbot's personalization, speed, and reliability, and cover a broader range of topics, so the company is pausing work on all other projects to focus on these capabilities. However, it seems to be continuing progress on ChatGPT ads, despite the recent change in focus.

ChatGPT has three main revenue streams at the moment — subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Business, API access for developers, and enterprise solutions. Aside from that, OpenAI said it will start earning revenue from non-paying users by 2026, projecting $2 per user annually, which will grow to $15 by 2030. Despite that, OpenAI has yet to turn a profit since its founding in 2015. Even though its annualized revenue hit $10 billion earlier this year, it's still expected that the company's operating losses will hit $74 billion annually by 2028. Nevertheless, investors continue to pour money into the company, even as some are starting to ask how its long-term profitability will look.

For comparison, Google's ad business accounted for $237.8 billion in revenue in 2023, representing 77% of the company's total revenue. This amount is more than enough to cover OpenAI's estimated losses, and it seems it wants to follow the search giant's playbook by baking ads into its results as well. However, this also raises privacy concerns, especially since ChatGPT likely has much more information about its users than Google does. Furthermore, there's the question of how OpenAI will ensure its LLM gives the best answer to the user, especially if it stands to make money by showing ads instead of organic results.

Taking money away from billionaires is funny, and threatening to do it can be a nice political sugar rush for anyone with even a tiny amount of class consciousness (even though it would not get close to creating “socialism” in America according to socialists like Doug Henwood). The state of California is now very much threatening to do it, and the predictable result is happening according to the New York Times: tech billionaires like Peter Thiel and ex-Google CEO and co-founder Larry Page are having their obligatory tantrum and threatening to leave.

The political instrument involved here is not a technocratic and nuanced change to the tax code that happens to tax billionaires, but instead a one-off, 5% billionaire tax. This comes in the form of a proposed ballot measure backed by organized labor—specifically the Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West.

Anyone who lives in California as of January 1, 2026 would be subject to the proposed tax, and the math works like this: If you have $20 billion in assets, you owe $1 billion, and have five years to pay up. Estimates from the union say the state would pull in about $100 billion, basically by legally mugging the 200 most obnoxious people in the state.

If you've followed the similar drama in New York City during the rise of Zohran Mamdani, you already know this next part by heart. According to the Times, Peter Thiel is now weighing an out-of-state office for Thiel Capital, and figuring out how to spend less time in California. Larry Page, listed by Forbes as the second richest person in the world as of this writing, has begun moving three LLCs to Florida, the Times says.

David Lesperance, a tax advisor for billionaires, told the Times, “almost all of my clients are taking steps as quickly as possible both to sever California residence and to move assets outside of the state.” 

Billionaire tech and healthcare investor Chamath Palihapitiya also played the hits, with the following X post quoted by the Times: “The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state's most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states.” The post the Times is quoting here doesn't seem to exist anymore, perhaps because of Palihapitiya's bizarre, Opposite Day use of the term “regressive.”

Palihapitiya's X activity shows that he's been on a tear with this topic for days, however:

This idiotic attack, by an inept California politician, on a productive California resident caused him to leave. It should not be lost on anyone that this has already cost California $10's of billions in lost taxes from Elon and the plethora of well paid employees that followed… pic.twitter.com/2aADLB4WWH— Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) December 25, 2025

But do the American rich actually flee a state that has decided to tax them? Maybe, but it doesn't seem like it so far. The state of Massachusetts passed something a little different: a more widespread income surtax for people making more than $1 million, and after two years, more tax-eligible millionaires are reportedly in the state, not less.

So yes, Billionaires, we know that if this ends up on the ballot and actually gets voted into law, most of you are going to characterize Californians with less money than you as ungrateful and naive children, and some of you will even make good on your threat to leave. The question would be this: will a fun state with great weather that also happens to manufacture new billionaires all the time actually regret making you cough up some of your money in the long run? Who knows, but I kinda doubt it.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill this week that will require social media platforms to show warning labels to younger users before they're exposed to features such as autoplay and infinite scrolling.

State legislators passed the bill —  S4505/A5346 — back in June, with text calling for mental health warnings on “addictive social media platforms,” which are defined as platforms offering “an addictive feed, push notifications, autoplay, infinite scroll, and/or like counts as a significant part” of their services, though exception can be made if the attorney general determines those features are used for “a valid purpose unrelated to prolonging use of such platform.”

The announcement from Hochul's office said these platforms will have to display warnings “when a young user initially uses the predatory feature and periodically thereafter.” Those users would not be able to bypass the warnings.

The announcement compares the proposed warning labels to those that have been added to products such as tobacco, alcohol, and media with flashing lights. Then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that social media platforms should add warning labels. 

“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.

One of the bill's sponsors, Assemblymember Nily Rozic, made a similar point in a statement of his own:, “New York families deserve honesty about how social media platforms impact mental health. By requiring warning labels based on the latest medical research, this law puts public health first and finally gives us the tools we need to make informed decisions.”

California lawmakers have proposed a similar bill.

Last year, New York passed laws requiring that social media platforms obtain parental consent before showing children “addictive feeds” and before collecting or selling the personal data of users under 18.

This isn't Hochul's only end-of-year tech regulation; she also recently signed the AI safety-focused RAISE Act.

Eleven years after United Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno partnered with Blue Origin to create a new rocket engine, he's joining Jeff Bezos' space venture as the president of Blue Origin's newly created National Security Group.

The move could signal a major shift in the commercial space race as Kent, Wash.-based Blue Origin revs up its competition with SpaceX. Bezos welcomed Bruno to his company on social media, and Bruno told Bezos that “we are going to do important work together.”

NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman added his congratulations via the X social-media platform.

In Friday's announcement of the change, Blue Origin said Bruno would report to CEO Dave Limp. “We share a deep belief in supporting our nation with the best technology we can build,” Limp said in a post on X. “Tory brings unmatched experience, and I'm confident he'll accelerate our ability to deliver on that mission.”

Bruno, 64, led ULA for 11 years following a 30-year career at Lockheed Martin. Not long after taking the reins at ULA in 2014, Bruno sat beside Bezos to announce a close collaboration on the development of Blue Origin's BE-4 engine, which is used on ULA's Vulcan rocket as well as Blue Origin's orbital-class New Glenn rocket.

Since then, SpaceX has displaced United Launch Alliance as America's dominant launch company. In 2014, ULA executed 14 launches while SpaceX executed six. So far this year, SpaceX has registered 165 launches, while ULA has registered six.

Bruno is expected to lead Blue Origin's efforts to win more contracts for national security launches using the New Glenn rocket. In 2024, Blue Origin joined ULA and SpaceX on the list of approved providers for such launches, but New Glenn has flown only twice. Blue Origin needs to execute two more successful launches to complete the Space Systems Command's certification process.

United Launch Alliance is a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Last year, there were rumors that ULA was the subject of acquisition talks, perhaps involving Blue Origin or Sierra Space, but so far those rumors haven't panned out.

Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin's Robert Lightfoot and Boeing's Kay Sears announced that Bruno was leaving ULA “to pursue another opportunity” — and named John Elbon as the joint venture's interim CEO. Elbon previously served as ULA's chief operating officer. He joined ULA in 2018 after a 35-year career at Boeing.

GPU shortage V.2?

The ripple effect of the global memory shortage is steadily expanding and affecting industries beyond DRAM and NAND production. Nvidia is reportedly no longer supplying VRAM to its GPU board partners, and some Japanese PC retailers are starting to feel the pinch, according to ITmedia [machine translated]. Although the publication still hasn't seen massive hikes in GPU pricing (compared to memory and storage), one shop said that it is only a matter of time before we start seeing empty shelves in the graphics card section.

Tsukumo eX., one of Akihabara's most popular PC stores, is limiting buyers to just one GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB or higher, or a Radeon RX 9000 series or higher, per purchase. The store says, “Cards equipped with high-capacity memory have become very difficult to procure. We still have stock at the moment, but we're in a situation where we don't know when the next shipment will arrive — or if it will arrive at all.” Other shops have similar concerns, wherein GPUs with 8GB of VRAM or more are becoming harder to restock.

The entire world is in the midst of a memory crunch due to unprecedented demand from AI data centers, driving prices to historic highs. Furthermore, many analysts and industry leaders say we won't see relief in 2026, primarily because memory makers are hedging their bets against an AI bubble and aren't expanding production. RAM kits and SSDs were the first items to be struck by this crisis, with modules seeing price increases by more than 246% in 2025 alone. This has custom PC builders reeling, with Framework no longer selling standalone RAM and Japanese shops halting desktop PC orders until 2026.

It seems that other components, like GPUs, are also starting to be hit by the crisis. Graphics cards require VRAM, which differs from the memory modules we use in our computers. However, they're still based on the same DRAM-type semiconductor technology, so when the big three chipmakers slashed DRAM production, GDDR supply tightened as well, likely forcing the consumer graphics card divisions of AMD, Intel, and Nvidia to reduce their output.

With memory chip manufacturers focusing their output on the lucrative AI market, consumers have no choice but to hold on to their existing devices or shell out exorbitant prices for anything that requires memory modules. And even if memory makers decide to expand capacity and start building new production lines and fabs today, it will take a few years for these to go online, meaning we will have to wait longer before memory pricing and supply normalize once more.

As the industry plunges into a NAND flash and DRAM drought, rendering new custom builds overpriced, laptops have suddenly become a lot more enticing. Even without the production lines being taken over by the AI boom, laptops offer a great way to take your work on the go. With powerful hardware, you can even achieve parity with a desktop experience. As such, we've hunted down the perfect deal for you: MSI's Vector 16 with an RTX 5070 Ti for just $1,299 on Walmart right now, marked down $700 from its list price. This is as cheap as RTX 5070 Ti laptops get.

All-time low price 

With an RTX 5070 Ti and a Ryzen 9 8940HX at the helm, the Vector 16 is a solid performer that excels across gaming and productivity. It features a sleek design, with all great fundamentals like a 16-inch 240 Hz screen, along with a large battery that can keep up with its power. 

The Vector 16, as the name suggests, is a 16-inch gaming laptop with a 1440p 240 Hz screen, perfectly paired with the 140W RTX 5070 Ti to deliver high frame rates. Alongside the GPU sits AMD's flagship Ryzen 9 8940HX processor, carrying 16 cores and 32 threads, boosting up to 5.3 GHz. You get 16 GB of DDR5-5200 memory and a 1 TB PCIe 4.0 SSD for storage, which can be doubled thanks to a second, empty M.2 slot.

That entire combination makes the Vector 16 a competent performer across games and productivity workloads, such as editing. Backing up that grunt is a 90Wh battery that should easily last you all day with moderate tasks. The keyboard is backlit with 24-zone RGB and a Copilot key that we all definitely love. You get Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 for wireless connectivity, along with plenty of fast USB ports, HDMI, Ethernet, headphone jack, and even an SD Card reader.

The design is actually quite understated for a gaming laptop, maintaining a stealthy aesthetic that'll only scream when you want it to. It's a bit heavy at 5.95 lbs., but the large screen, battery, and internals justify that. You even get a physical webcam shutter for privacy, and the laptop comes with a one-year warranty for peace of mind. If you've been looking for a powerful yet affordable machine, the MSI Vector 16 at just $1,299 is a great deal, especially amid the component crisis.

Just before Christmas, Paramount announced it was moving The Legend of Aang, the first animated theatrical film for Avatar: The Last Airbender, from a theatrical release to Paramount+. The reactions to this news ranged from shock and dismay to anger at the proposition, and now fans of the 2005 kids' series are trying to do something about it.

Avatar fans recently launched an online petition for the studio to put Aang back on its theatrical slate, which at the time of writing has over 18,000 signatures. As the petition's author, Ananth, wrote, Paramount's decision was “a disappointment to the devoted fandom. A theatrical release [for Aang]…will amplify its reach, drawing in curious viewers who may not engage with streaming platforms, thus expanding its audience exponentially.”

Comments under the petition are filled with longtime Avatar fans voicing their support for Paramount to put the film back in theaters, with one in particular catching some attention online. That would be one from a user under the name “Steve Ahn”—the same name as the co-director for Legend of Aang—that voiced frustration with the studio. “Worked on this film, first leading one of the teams, and eventually directing. Very frustrated about studio higher-up's decisions,” the comment reads. Along with calling for a theatrical release, the comment claimed there were “a LOT of frustrating, unfair moves” made by Paramount.

However, Ahn himself has since said on Twitter he didn't make that “misleading comment” and wanted to make it clear in light of the mention about shedding information on the film's production. “I hope this official clarification prevents any further rumors or false speculation, and I sincerely hope the dedicated artists of this film are not unfairly criticized or put in a difficult position due to such unauthorized comments,” he added.

I am truly grateful for the passion shown in the Avatar petition. However, I must clarify that someone has impersonated me and left a misleading comment. I am not the author of that post, and I hope this official clarification prevents any further rumors or false speculation.

— Steve 인창 Ahn (@steveahn82) December 26, 2025



Even without the explicit support of Ahn behind them, the Avatar fandom clearly isn't enthused about Legend of Aang being shifted to streaming. Whatever reason one has for not liking it, it's exactly not great that a studio can suddenly upend how any film comes out. What's happening with The Legend of Aang isn't too dissimilar from when networks were cancelling shows they'd already renewed—and if anything, the move has become even more concerning as Paramount has designs on gobbling up other studios.

The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender will release sometime in 2026. Whether that also includes a theatrical window is entirely up to Paramount.

The problem isn't support for the ARM architecture in general, it's the support for this particular board.Other boards like the Raspberry Pi and many boards based on Rockchip SoCs have most of the necessary support mainlined, so the experience is quite painless. Many are starting to get support for UEFI as well.

For example I have an Orange Pi 5 Plus running the totally generic aarch64 image of Home Assistant OS [0]. Zero customization was needed, it just works with mainline everything.There's even UEFI [1].Granted this isn't the case for all boards but Rockchip at least seems to have great upstream support.[0]: https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases[1]: https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3588

At some point the "good" boards get enough support and the situation slowly improves.We reached the state where you dont need to spec-check the laptop if you want to run linux on it, the same will happen to arm sbc I hope.

I'm not a compiler expert... But it seems each ARM64 board needs its own custom kernel support, but once that is done, it can support anything compiled to ARM64 as a general target? Or will we still need to have separate builds for RPi, for this board, etc?

Often an outright mediocre software development culture generally, that sees software as a pure cost centre, in fact. The "product" is seem to be the chip, the software "just" a side show (or worse, a channel by which their IP could leak).The Rockchip stuff is better, but still has similar problems.These companies need to learn that their hardware will be adopted more aggressively for products if the experience of integrating with it isn't sub-par.

They are not in the same class, which is reflected in the power envelope.BTW what's up with people pushing N150 and N300 in every single ARM SBC thread? Y'all Intel shareholders or something? I run both but not to the exclusion of everything else. There is nothing I've failed to run successfully on my ARM ones and the only thing I haven't tried is gaming.

ARM actually has a spec in place called SystemReady that standardizes on UEFI, which should make bringup of ARM systems much less jank. But few have implemented it yet. I keep saying, the first cheap Chinese vendor that ships a SystemReady-compliant SBC is gonna make a killing.

2. The review says single core Geekbench performance is 1290, same as i5-10500 which is also similar to N150, which is 1235.3. You can still get N150s with 16gb ram in a case for $200 all in.

You're probably right about "most workloads", but as a single counter-example, I added several seasons of shows to my N305 Plex server last night, and it pinned all eight threads for quite a while doing its intro/credit detection.I actually went and checked if it would be at all practical to move my Plex server to a VM on my bigger home server where it could get 16 Skymont threads (at 4.6ghz vs 8 Gracemont threads at ~3ghz - so something like 3x the multithreaded potential on E-cores). Doesn't really seem workable to use Intel Quick Sync on Linux guests with a Hyper-V host though.

if you are talking about ancient hardware, yes, it's mostly driven by single core performance. But any console more recent than the 2000s will hugely benefit from multiple cores (because of the split between CPU and GPU, and the fact that more recent consoles also had multiple cores, too).

Likewise my VPS @ Hetzner is running Aarch64. No drama. Only pain is how brutal the Rust cross-compile is from my x86 machine.I mean, here's Geerling running a bunch of Steam games flawlessly on a Aarch64 NVIDIA GB10 machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRKvKC4ntw(Those things are expensive, but I just ordered one [the ASUS variant] for myself.)Meanwhile Apple is pushing the ARM64 architecture hard, and Windows is apparently actually quite viable now?Personally... it's totally irrational, but I have always had a grudge against x86 since it "won" in the early 90s and I had to switch from 68k. I want diversity in ISAs. RISC-V would be nice, but I'll settle for ARM for now.

Yet again, OrangePi crank out half-baked products and tech enthusiasts who quite understandably lack the deep knowledge to do more than follow others' instructions on how to compile stuff talk about it as if their specifications actually matter.Yet again the HN discourse will likely gather around stuff like "why not just use an N1x0" and side quests about how the Raspberry Pi Foundation has abandoned its principles / is just a cynical Broadcom psyop / is "lagging behind" in hardware.This stuff can be done better and the geek world should be done excusing OrangePi producing hardware abandonware time after time. Stop buying this crap and maybe they will finally start focussing on doing more than shipping support for one or two old kernels and last year's OS while kicking vague commitments about future support just far enough down the road that they can release another board first.Please stop falling for it :-/ETA: I think what grinds my gears the most is that OrangePi, BananaPi etc., are largely free-riding off the Linux community while producing products that only "beat" the market-defining manufacturers (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard) because they treat software support as an uncosted externality.This kind of "build it and they will use it" logic works well for microcontrollers, where a manufacturer can reasonably expect to produce a chip with a couple of tech demos, a spec sheet and a limited C SDK and people will find uses for it.But for "near-desktop class" SBCs it is not much better than misrepresentation. Consequently these things are e-waste in a way that even the global desk drawer population of the Raspberry Pi does not reach.And yet they are graded on a curve and never live up to their potential.

Mirari is expected to be ready for prime time in mid-2026, costing from around US$600.

Amiga fans have several projects to watch as we near the end of 2025. Today, we're looking at the intriguing Mirari, a new mainboard that is designed to “breathe new life into the next-gen Amiga platform.” The developers are several prototypes in and currently refining drivers to prepare the Micro-ATX form factor Mirari for a mid-2026 release. Amenities will include NVMe, USB3, PCIe slots, SATA (via card), and FPGA custom logic - all in a convenient Micro-ATX form factor. Expect to pay about $600 to $700 (€500 - €600) for this AmigaOS4 and MorphOS platform when it is ready.

Mirari is designed for those of you who still cradle a ‘next-gen Amiga dream,' rather than simply want a modern interface plus I/O remake of the classic Amigas of the 1980s and 90s. This motherboard isn't intended for casual retro fans who just want to play some old classic 16-bit games, use Workbench from v1.X to 3.x, or dabble in undemanding pixel painters like Deluxe Paint or PPaint. That's easy enough on old mass-produced hardware or in emulators.

Instead, Mirari tackles the Amiga computing niches where AmigaOS4 or MorphOS is desired, running on a true next-gen Amiga. This means Mirari departs from the 68K lineage and embraces PowerPC (echoing the Mac's architecture transition).

Moreover, Mirari is a PPC native platform standard for developers and the community. It continues the lineage established by the Phase5 PPC and AmigaONE X1000/X5000/A1222 systems, with up-to-date hardware that complements the PPC processor.

 




You can check here to chart the progress of Mirari's development. There, you will see the design phase began in May 2024. Mid-2025 saw the arrival of the second prototype mainboards. Since that time, work has continued apace, showing off the latest Mirari at shows and events, as well as the more serious work of getting drivers produced and wrinkles removed. Specific drives/updates have recently been produced for Intel HD Audio (Azalia) specification PCIe sound cards, the fan controller, the NVMe storage driver (now able to support booting), and the onboard NIC driver.

According to a hardware preview shared by December's WhatIFF magazine (head to the reviews/previews section), the latest specs include a T1042 quad‑core, 64‑bit PowerPC e5500 processor, DDR3L SO-DIMM support, three PCIe slots, 2x SATA 2.0 and 2x NVMe slots, USB3 ports, and an FPGA socket for additional functionality. This will run AmigaOS4, MorphOS, or some PPC Linux distros.

 




The Micro-ATX form factor Mirari should be ready for mid-2026. Expect to pay about $600 to $700 for a board. Not sure if that includes the RAM, but Amiga systems only need a few megabytes, not gigabytes!

Someone must've been on Santa's naughty list, as a user on Reddit has posted an ugly picture of a melted RTX 5090 power connector that occurred on Christmas. The connector is fried past recognition, to the point where its owner thinks it's safer not to even try to take it out right away.

This melting fate befell user u/nmp14fayl, who described their misfortune on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit."[I]ndeed it did not just melt, when I started smelling something weird, next thing I knew, it was fully on fire 🔥," they wrote.The plastic insulation of the 12V-2x6 cable has given way and exposed the bare copper wires underneath and the connector housing has melted into itself.

We see a blob of solder piled up on the GPU-side connector, which has likely solidified and is even making contact with the heatsink fins, along with some burnt cable debris. The fire also scorched part of the AIO tubes passing over the GPU, but everything else looks untouched. The point of connection is completely destroyed.

 




The Redditor has already said they'll take the entire apparatus, cable dangling and all, to Micro Center after the holidays. In the meantime, they've troubleshooted other components, including the ATX 3.1 power supply and they all seem to be fine. The motherboard is displaying an image over integrated graphics, and a secondary RTX 2070 Super is also working on the affected PCIe slot.

Whether the RTX 5090 itself is salvageable remains a question, but the power connector is a goner for sure and, sadly, it's just an addition to the long list of stories like this. While user error is often attributed to 12V-2x6 woes, the connector itself is notorious for being allegedly under-designed, often carrying close to 600W of power at very high amperage that it seems to mishandle.

 




On paper, the 12V-2x6 connector is already an improvement over the previous-gen 12VHPWR connector that killed many RTX 4090s, but the same underlying logic applies across both generations. If one pin stops making a connection due to stress or mechanical failure, the rest receive too much load, which overheats them and leads to melting, burning, or igniting in worst-case scenarios.

We've done a deep dive into the specifics of why these connectors melt, but it's clearly a persistent issue. If it were an isolated problem, companies like Thermal Grizzly wouldn't sell temp monitoring adapters, and DIY solutions to combat overloads would never materialize.

The issue is exacerbated by older power supplies that only support 8-pin PCIe cables, for which GPU manufacturers supply 8-pin-to-16-pin adapters, adding another factor into the equation. Funnily enough, this Redditor was using a native 12V-2x6 cable that came with their PowerSpec 1050 GFM power supply, so even that excuse is out the window. We're sending our holiday wishes to the poster, hoping the GPU is somehow salvageable.

This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News as part of its Planet China series and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The audience sat patiently through the presentations about the cluster of battery factories going up nearby. They listened to descriptions of the hazardous chemicals the plants will use, their huge water withdrawals and energy demands.

When it came time for questions, people began shifting in their chairs and standing up, making the cramped room feel even smaller.

What if the chemicals leak, one woman asked. What's in it for the politicians in their “velvet chairs,” another demanded. A third warned it would be just like the Soviet era, when iron and steel plants left a polluted legacy.

Then a woman began to tear up as she told the 50 or so people who had gathered in a community center on a cold, dark evening that the factories' smokestacks and hazardous materials were about a mile from her daughter's kindergarten.

“Please stand up for yourselves,” she said, urging the audience to spread the word.

The Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, is nearing completion on what could be one of Europe's largest electric vehicle battery factories. The industrial park where it is located, outside Debrecen, Hungary's second-largest city, also hosts several other manufacturers of battery parts and supplies. At least two of those are owned by Chinese companies, one by a South Korean firm. Another Chinese-owned battery factory is being built on the other side of the city.

The surge of construction is part of a nationwide frenzy, prompted by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's goal to make Hungary a leading battery manufacturer. To reach this target, Orbán has looked primarily to Beijing. Chinese companies have announced or built at least 18 EV and battery-related projects in Hungary so far, $17 billion in pledged investments, according to data compiled by the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University.

While the factories could position Hungary in the center of Europe's transition off fossil fuels, they have prompted a backlash from residents worried about their impacts on public health and the environment.

“Everyone will get their fair share of this stew,” said Éva Kozma, who leads the Mikepércs Mothers for the Environment Association, a citizen activist group that hosted the event. Kozma helped form the group after CATL announced its plans in 2022 and has since been highlighting the risks posed by battery development, identifying pollution events and scrutinizing the factories' permits.

Éva Kozma looks out over the industrial park that houses Debrecen's cluster of battery factories.

Across the globe, Chinese firms are embarking on an unprecedented effort to build the factories, mines and refineries needed to make EVs, batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy technologies. Since 2022, Chinese companies have pledged some $200 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments overseas, spread across every continent but Antarctica, according to the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab. Hungary has attracted more investment than any country except Indonesia and Morocco.

The spending is beginning to narrow the gap in funding needed to slash the world's climate pollution. Chinese exports cut global emissions outside China by 1 percent in 2024, according to one analysis.

But many of the projects are proceeding despite local opposition and evidence of significant environmental, social, and human rights impacts. Chinese-built mines, dams, and factories have threatened endangered species, polluted waterways and been accused of violating labor laws. In some cases, activists and journalists examining projects have faced surveillance and intimidation.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's U.S. embassy, rejected the notion that Chinese investments were violating people's rights. In an email, Liu said the country's Belt and Road Initiative, the umbrella for its overseas infrastructure investments, aims to support green economic growth.

“The founding purpose of the BRI is to advance China's cooperation with partner countries following the principle of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, to help them develop the economy and shake off poverty, which is a human right they need more than any other,” Liu said.

In Hungary, academics and environmentalists say, the investments have been accelerated by lax oversight and fast-tracked permitting. Orbán's government eliminated the country's environment ministry after coming to power in 2010 and has cracked down on protests and dissent more broadly.

After Kozma began speaking out about the battery factories, she became the target of smear campaigns on social media and state-backed news sites that said she was acting on behalf of foreign agents and against the interest of citizens.

She has not backed down, however. As the meeting in the community center last month came to a close, dance music booming through the door from a room down the hall, Kozma struck a defiant tone, looking to draw more people into her cause.

“What the authorities want is to make people believe that they are small, that you cannot do anything,” she said. “If you do care about it, you are an agent, a traitor. You want to defend yourself? You are just a little piece of dust,” Kozma added. “I will defend you.”

The next morning, Kozma drove her red Fiat down a dirt path that dead-ended at railroad tracks. She was joined by Tibor Nemes, the Mikepércs group's vice president, and they described how the tracks had carried a regional line until the authorities shuttered service because it cut through CATL's 546-acre lot.

The factory stretches across a series of giant, windowless warehouse-style buildings that already span half a mile. Next to those are muddy lots where more buildings are planned. The site is surrounded by other factories that make cathodes, aluminum cases, battery separator films, gases, all for the EV industry. Just a few years ago, this was farmland.

Kozma was bundled against the cold with a patterned hat and a hoodie peeking out of the collar of her blue parka. A thin layer of clouds cast a flat light across the landscape.

In the car, the pair agreed that the previous night had gone well.

“We filled the room,” Nemes said in Hungarian, speaking through a translator.

“People were interested, they asked questions,” Kozma added.

CATL, the Chinese battery giant, is building what could be one of Europe's largest electric vehicle battery plants outside Debrecen, Hungary.

Their group had received EU funding to hold meetings in surrounding villages about the battery factories and their impacts. While the industrial park is within Debrecen's city limits, it borders Kozma's village of Mikepércs.

The group helped file a lawsuit that is still pending against CATL's initial permit. Nemes said they'd already scored a victory after CATL revised its permit to use less water and lower its expected emissions of a hazardous chemical.

Meanwhile, the activists have been placing air monitors around the area to measure baselines before CATL begins production. Already, they have registered spikes in fine-particle pollution that they said have coincided with events at some of the other plants already operating.

In August, local authorities sanctioned SEMCORP, a Chinese-owned company that makes separator films for batteries, after the plant exceeded its permitted air emissions for nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds and dichloromethane, a possible carcinogen, according to a county government order. The fine totaled 1.5 million forints, equal to about $4,500. The order said a forensic expert determined the concentrations of the chemicals did not exceed health limit values.

SEMCORP did not reply to requests for comment.

SEMCORP's factory is one of at least four Chinese-owned electric vehicle battery-related factories operating or under construction outside Debrecen, Hungary.

Kozma stopped by a drainage ditch into which a different Chinese-owned factory had spilled wastewater, according to an inspection by county authorities last year.

Battery production requires significant amounts of energy and water. CATL's most recent permit says it would use about 523,000 gallons per day on average, two-thirds of which would be drinking water with the rest coming from processed wastewater. In the summer, however, the plant's peak water use could triple, the company said, with additional demand met “mainly” with processed wastewater.

Debrecen, meanwhile, has struggled with drought conditions in recent years.

In 2023, after CATL had announced its plans, the local water authority issued an expert opinion warning that given the city's growth and industrial expansions, groundwater sources could reach their limits within a couple of years.

Equally alarming for nearby residents are the hazardous chemicals used in the factories, including heavy metals and a compound called N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or NMP, which the EU has determined may harm fetal development.

Last year, Greenpeace Hungary found high levels of NMP in municipal wastewater that had pooled in a field outside Budapest near a battery plant owned by a South Korean company. Investigative reporting has also discovered spills and releases of NMP into the air by the plant.

“It shouldn't be in the wastewater at all,” said Gergely Simon, a toxics expert with Greenpeace Hungary.

Simon said that because Hungary does not have abundant water or energy, the only advantage it offers battery manufacturers over other countries is lax regulation and speedy permitting. Under these conditions, he said, the system is set up for frequent accidents and harmful releases.

“My experience is that when a facility relies heavily on hazardous chemicals, some of them will inevitably escape,” Simon said. “They reach the workers, and they are very likely to affect people living nearby as well.”

CATL had initially filed a permit that would allow it to release high levels of NMP into the air, but has since revised its plans to reduce its expected emissions significantly. Instead of processing the chemical on site, the company's latest permit application says, it will send it to a supplier elsewhere in the country.

Noémi Sidló, public relations and communications manager for CATL in Hungary, said the company has adopted a technology at the plant called adiabatic cooling to reduce water use. The factory, she said, would contribute to Europe's “green transition.”

The company also said it was government authorities, not CATL, that decided to close the regional rail line.

Jason Chen, general manager of CATL Europe Operations, speaks at a press conference in Debrecen, Hungary, on Nov. 20, 2024.

Balázs Szilágyi, a public affairs manager for the company, said the plant would have little to zero emissions of NMP. He said CATL is following the regulations set by the local government, which he noted was elected by residents.

“This debate should primarily be done between the governmental authorities and the public,” Szilágyi said.

The county Department of Environmental and Nature Protection and Waste Management, which issued CATL's permit, did not respond to requests for comment by email, phone or in person at its office. A spokesperson for Debrecen's mayor, László Papp, declined a request for an interview and did not reply to written questions.

László Mándi is a city council member in Debrecen, Hungary.

Most people in Debrecen first learned a giant battery plant was coming from an announcement by the central government in 2022. Even members of the City Council were not informed before the decision was made, said László Mándi, a council member from the opposition Momentum party.

Kozma and other residents had no meaningful opportunity to weigh in on the plan, but they did vent their anger and frustration at a series of public meetings and protests. In response, state-backed media and members of the ruling Fidesz party said they were fake residents who were being funded by foreign provocateurs.

One Facebook post superimposed an image of Kozma onto a bed, with a disembodied hand holding a $20 bill and images of Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros, the logo of Amnesty International and others. Below it was an obscene suggestion that Kozma's group was being paid. Another post features an image of her holding a stack of bills in one hand and a brain in the other, asking which she would choose and saying she wants to destroy the future of Debrecen.

Posts like these get picked up in state-backed media, Kozma said, “and that is what my parents see on the evening news.”

One scientist at the University of Debrecen was forbidden from giving a talk on campus about the chemical risks posed by the plants. He spoke instead at a local branch of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

The author of the water authority report that warned of shortages with the construction of the plants was reassigned. He declined to be interviewed for this article.

Some polls have shown that opposition to battery plants is widespread in Hungary. Yet the construction has shown no signs of slowing.

People march to protest against the expansion of the battery industry in Debrecen on Feb. 1.

Chinese exports have long flooded the world's consumer markets. In recent years those goods included solar panels, EVs, and batteries. Increasingly, however, Chinese firms are building overseas manufacturing capacity too.

The $200 billion in announced investments since 2022 in clean energy manufacturing would go toward 387 projects to make EVs, batteries, solar panels, and other technologies in every major region of the world, according to the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab.

“It is, in scale, staggering,” said Tim Sahay, the lab's codirector.

The exports are so large they're moving the needle on global emissions, some experts say. China's exports of clean energy goods—mostly solar panels but also batteries and other technology—cut out 220 million metric tons of climate pollution last year, roughly equal to Spain's emissions, according to an analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. If all the overseas clean energy manufacturing investments announced in 2023 and 2024 come to pass, that would mean an additional 130 million metric tons in annual emissions reductions, the analysis found.

With the help of these exports, some emerging economies, including Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Kenya, Morocco and Namibia, now generate a higher proportion of their electricity from wind and solar energy than the United States, according to Ember. Others, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Mexico, have electrified more of their final energy use. In some countries, the capacity of Chinese solar panel imports outstrips the centralized electricity system.

“It is a very good story,” said Mathias Larsen, a senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, who co-wrote the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab report.

For countries looking to wean themselves from fossil fuels, Larsen and other experts say, there is little doubt that Chinese companies are the best partners, especially at a time when the US government is focused on producing and exporting oil and gas.

But many civil society groups and human rights advocates say this expansion is having an enormous and often underreported impact on local communities, workers, and the environment. In Indonesia, Chinese-controlled nickel smelters that refine the metal for use in steel and batteries have spewed pollutants into the air and been accused of violating labor rights. In Zambia, a Chinese mining company spilled toxic tailings into waterways. Dam projects across Southeast Asia and Africa are threatening endangered species. And some journalists who have tried to highlight these problems have faced intimidation, surveillance and pressure from police.

Many Chinese companies' exports and overseas manufacturing, especially for solar panels, also remain tied to domestic supply chains linked to forced labor campaigns in the country's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

“It's a little bit like reading about manufacturing in China in the 1990s,” said Sophie Richardson, a senior China advisor at Climate Rights International. “Everybody was just so excited about the development of manufacturing and wasn't it great to get inexpensive goods. And very few people stopped to say, ‘Is this stuff cheap because there are no independent unions in China?' I feel like we're sort of doing that all over again but now it's everyone sort of waxing rhapsodic about the percentage of wind and solar power that's used without asking any of these questions that make for a much more complicated story.”

Liu, the Chinese embassy spokesperson, called the allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang “an outright lie” spread by people in the West to “suppress Chinese companies and industries.” He also rejected the notion that the Chinese government had played a role in pressuring journalists overseas, saying, “China protects the legitimate rights of journalists in accordance with the law and welcomes all journalists, including foreign journalists, to conduct reporting on China-related matters in accordance with laws and regulations.”

Belt and Road projects were bringing prosperity to developing nations and solar development across Africa, Liu said. “The Belt and Road Initiative is pro-development, but more specifically it is pro-green development. Under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, China pursues open, green and clean energy cooperation with relevant countries, and works towards high-standard, people-centered, and sustainable development.”

Myllyvirta, Larsen and others argue that China's clean energy exports are cheap because of its unique state-run economy and the massive investments Beijing made in the technologies, and that forced labor plays little role in lowering costs.

Sahay, of the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab, said countries that are hosting Chinese-backed manufacturing now have an opportunity to steer the developments in a way that will benefit their citizens.

“Whether or not these industrial megaprojects lead to any positive development outcomes depends upon domestic policy choices,” Sahay said. Host countries, he added, “must bargain hard with Chinese firms to actually achieve their own goals of sustainable development.”

Sahay pointed to Brazil as an example where a host government responded to alleged labor violations by a Chinese company to not only demand better practices but also secure deals to develop local supply chains and train workers. In other countries, however, host governments appear to have little interest in pressing Chinese firms to be more responsive to local concerns.

Soon after Orbán began his current reign in 2010, he announced his “Opening to the East.” Hungary was too dependent on Western countries, he argued, and needed to expand partnerships with illiberal powers like Russia and China.

Orbán began courting Chinese investment and seeking to strengthen diplomatic ties. Little came of this initially, beyond a high-speed rail project to Serbia that has faced delays and allegations of corruption. Then the battery investments started rolling in.

Last year Hungary was the top European destination for Chinese investment, according to a report by Rhodium Group and Mercator Institute for China Studies. Because it is an EU member, Hungary offered Chinese battery firms direct access to the European market. The EU had set a target to phase out sales of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2035. Orbán wanted Hungary, with China's help, to meet the demand for new EVs.

The central European country is about the size of Indiana with fewer than 10 million people, but already it is one of the world's top battery manufacturers, though China produces the vast majority.

Orbán has positioned Hungary as China's chief defender within the EU. His government has blocked efforts to condemn Chinese authorities for their crackdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong. Last year, Hungary's foreign minister opposed efforts that he said would make NATO an “anti-China bloc.”

Meanwhile, the government has struck deals with Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to develop 5G technology despite opposition from other European nations and the United States, who warn of security risks. Last year, the two countries signed a security agreement that allows Chinese police to patrol within Hungary, which many academics say could be used to pressure Chinese nationals living or working in the central European nation. In October, the Chinese embassy in Hungary said the countries had signed an extradition treaty that “will provide a solid legal basis for the two countries to jointly combat crime and is a milestone for deepening China-Hungary judicial and law enforcement cooperation.”

All this has come as Orbán has tightened his more than 15-year grip on power through means that many analysts say have turned the country into a quasi-democratic autocracy. Orbán has changed electoral laws and used state control of media to demonize opponents and suppress and split opposition.

“If you were at a protest then you will get a fine.”

This year Hungary's parliament passed laws prohibiting events by LGBTQ+ groups and allowing authorities to use facial recognition software to identify and fine participants of any gatherings. Orbán's opponents within Hungary worry it is a prelude to cracking down on an increasingly strong opposition before nationwide elections expected in April 2026.

“They don't need policemen,” said Anna Vindics, policy director for the opposition Momentum party. “They can just put cameras and recognize your face, and if you were at a protest then you will get a fine.”

Momentum's members have been targeted with criminal sanctions. Vindics took part in protests against the facial recognition and anti-LGBTQ+ laws, joining with colleagues to blockade a bridge and the entry to Parliament, for which she received multiple fines, she said.

Some academics say the government's authoritarian tactics have informed its regulation of battery factories, too. Andrea Éltető, a senior research fellow at the ELTE CERS Institute of World Economics in Budapest, has written that the government failed to conduct the strategic environmental assessment required for such large-scale investments. And unlike in other European democracies, “they designated the town or the village to where the given company should come,” Éltető said, “and then the local municipality could not have any say.” It is “the usual autocratic way of decisionmaking,” she said. “They make a decision and that's it.”

Éltető and other Hungarian academics argue that the battery investments, despite their size, will bring limited benefits to the nation compared to the problems they create.

At least initially, CATL says about one-third of its employees will come from China. The jobs that battery factories do create are relatively low-skill and low-paid, said Tamás Matura, an associate professor at Corvinus University of Budapest and an expert in China-Europe relations.

The Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency declined to comment, saying in an email that “after careful consideration,” it would “not be able to grant an interview on this topic.”

A spokesperson for Orbán did not respond to repeated inquiries by Inside Climate News.

Matura said the government has failed to articulate a clear rationale for why it would try to build such a large battery manufacturing industry.

With limited energy supplies and water and near-full employment levels, “we have practically nothing that would substantiate the idea that this is a good investment,” Matura said.

Back in Mikepércs, Kozma and others hope that elections in April will finally bring a new government. The leading opposition candidate has aligned himself with battery factory opponents.

Local authorities shuttered a regional rail line because it cut through an area where CATL, the Chinese battery giant, was building a factory. Éva Kozma and Tibor Nemes lead a citizen activist group that has raised awareness about the risks posed by the plant.

Despite being only a 15-minute drive from central Debrecen, Mikepércs feels like a small farm town. Its tiny central square, set off from a church, has a pair of benches and a folding bulletin board pasted with flyers. A decorative stand fashioned from a lacquered section of a tree trunk was bare in mid-November, soon to be covered in Christmas ornaments.

Kozma owns a small business that makes body scrubs and bath salts but has had no time for that work since she began devoting herself to the Mikepércs Mothers group. She has three children, ranging in age from 17 to 23, with the older two attending university in Debrecen. All three still live at home.

“Usually young people want to go abroad,” Kozma said, “but they love it here.”

Sitting in her car by the town square, Kozma said she would rather be living like she was before the battery factories came, and that she sometimes has disputes with her husband about all the time she has devoted to resisting them. Her children support her, though, she said.

“I'm doing it for them,” Kozma said, twisted sideways in the Fiat's driver's seat. “If we can't bring about change and we have to move from here, at least I can look them in the eye and say, ‘I tried to do everything I could.'”

A new study, published in Food Science & Nutrition, finds a correlation between the amount of takeout food a person consumes and their likelihood of developing chronic low-level inflammation, a key driver of cardiovascular pathology.

Deaths from cardiovascular disease and the consumption of takeout foods are both on the rise, and while that does not prove a causal relationship, the study explores whether there is a connection between the two.

The study tracked degrees of systemic inflammation according to the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), a scale that quantifies the risk of inflammation related to the intake of specific dietary substances.

The authors analyzed a decade of cross-sectional data from 8,556 participants in the 2009 to 2018 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Participants in the survey were interviewed in their homes, and also visited a mobile examination center, where they recalled their food intake, received cardiometabolic health assessments, and had blood collected.

This analysis sought to identify relationships between participants' consumption of takeout food, their DII scores, and their assessed cardiometabolic risk.

There were three major takeaways from the analysis:

Takeout food varies widely in quality. Dinner carried out from a high-quality restaurant is likely to be nutritionally more sound than a meal grabbed from a fast-food emporium. 

That having been said, much takeout food contains ingredients that are not necessarily heart-healthy, as Jayne Morgan, MD, cardiologist and Vice President of Medical Affairs for Hello Heart, who was not involved in the study, explained:

“Takeout food raises the cardiovascular risk not because of one ingredient, but because of a predictable combination of nutrients, additives, and preparation methods that adversely affect blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and endothelial function.”

“This includes,” she continued, “excess sodium that increases blood volume and arterial stiffness, and unhealthy fats usually saturated fats or trans fats, that increase dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.”

Even full-service eateries may be problematic, Morgan said. “Restaurants often reuse oils leading to oxidized fats that directly damage arteries and accelerate plaque formation,” along with refined carbohydrates and added sugars leading to insulin resistance.

“In this study,” she noted, “women had a greater glucose and insulin resistance response to takeout food as compared to men.”

“Spikes in glucose lead to insulin resistance, which then in turn triggers high triglycerides, low HDL, and increased visceral fat and inflammatory markers. Then, finally,” Morgan listed, “ultra-processed ingredients that also lead to chronic inflammation. Emulsifiers, preservatives, artificial flavor enhancers, disruption of the gut microbiome, and low-fiber content.”

Takeout food also frequently involves oversized portion sizes that contribute to weight gain and blood pressure increases.

“Technology is the single biggest driver of the Dietary Inflammatory Index,” said Morgan.

With people connected and expected to be interacting at any waking moment, “It is that very reliance and expectation of progress and speed — as well as the simplification of many activities that previously required physical labor and time — that has created a need to cut corners in other areas,” she said.

“Preparing and cooking food takes time and includes the shopping process for the appropriate ingredients,” Morgan pointed out.

“The limit of the time factor,” she asserted, “is a primary driver of the proliferation of dependence and normalization of food delivery services and readily available food without much discernment.”

“This is contributing to a generation that is heavier than previous generations, and also contributes to chronic inflammation, elevated cholesterol profiles, and elevated blood pressures. All are significant drivers of heart disease,” Morgan reported.

Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, Preventive Cardiology Dietitian at Entirely Nourished, also not involved in this study, noted:

“It is also important to recognize that frequent takeout use often reflects broader lifestyle pressures such as demanding schedules, limited access to cooking resources, irregular meals, and disrupted sleep, all of which can quietly compound cardiovascular risk.”

When a schedule offers no other practical choice than resorting to takeout food, said Routhenstein, there are still things one can do to minimize the cardiovascular risk.

“The focus can be on making small, manageable adjustments rather than complete avoidance,” she suggested.

“Choosing grilled instead of fried items, adding vegetables or salads instead of fries, opting for smaller portions of refined starch, and swapping sugary drinks for water or unsweetened beverages can help reduce some of the metabolic strain,” Routhenstein recommended.

Takeout meals can also be augmented, she said, with “more anti-inflammatory, heart healthy foods such as leafy greens, colorful fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and omega-3 rich fish [that] can further support cardiovascular health.”

“Even small changes can make a meaningful difference, and progress is more important than perfection,” said Routhenstein.

“Well-studied cardioprotective approaches such as the Mediterranean, DASH, and plant-forward portfolio-style patterns can help people move away from a takeout-heavy menu without requiring a complete lifestyle overhaul,” said Routhenstein.

“These approaches focus on adding more vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats in a flexible, sustainable way,” she explained.

“Although the DASH diet is widely recommended, my preference is for the Mediterranean diet,” noted Morgan.

“Home-cooked meals generally have more unsaturated fats, more whole grain carbohydrates, with higher fiber content and improved portion control,” she added.”

Furthermore, Morgan said, “home cooked meals generally contain only about 25% of the salt content of take-out foods and a greater percentage of potassium. In fact, this sodium-potassium imbalance in takeout foods is one of the strongest drivers of blood pressure variability.”

“Importantly,” Routhenstein concluded, “[home-cooked menus] can be adapted to real life by simplifying meals, using convenient staples like frozen produce or canned beans and fish, and even balancing takeout choices more thoughtfully rather than eliminating them.”

New research from Fujita Health University reveals that talking can subtly delay the eyes' ability to detect and stabilize on visual information. In experiments comparing talking, listening, and control conditions, only talking caused slower reaction, movement, and fixation times during rapid eye-movement tasks. Because driving depends heavily on fast gaze shifts, these delays may impair hazard detection and slow physical responses. The findings highlight the hidden risks of engaging in conversation while driving.

Talking while driving is widely recognized as a major source of distraction, but the specific ways conversation interferes with the earliest stages of visual processing have remained largely unclear. While previous research has shown that cognitive distraction can slow braking or reduce situational awareness, the question of whether talking disrupts the foundational gaze processes that precede physical reactions has remained unanswered.

Now, researchers from Fujita Health University have demonstrated that talking imposes cognitive load strong enough to delay essential eye-movement responses, potentially affecting the fast visual assessments required for safe driving. A study led by Associate Professor Shintaro Uehara and the team, including Mr. Takuya Suzuki and Professor Takaji Suzuki, published online on October 6, 2025, in PLOS ONE, examined how talking alters the temporal dynamics of gaze behavior.

Gaze behavior is especially significant because approximately 90% of the information used for driving is acquired visually. Any delay in initiating or completing eye movements can cascade into slower recognition of hazards, reduced accuracy of visual scanning, and delayed motor responses. "We investigated whether the impact of talking-related cognitive load on gaze behavior varies depending on the direction of eye movement," explains Dr. Uehara.

To investigate this, the researchers asked 30 healthy adults to perform rapid center-out eye-movement tasks under three different conditions: talking, listening, and a no-task control. Participants were instructed to look as quickly and accurately as possible toward a peripheral visual target presented in one of eight directions. In the talking condition, participants answered general knowledge and episodic questions adapted from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and additional custom prompts. In the listening condition, participants listened to passages from the Japanese novel I Am a Cat. The order of conditions was randomized across three separate days. Across all participants, talking produced clear and consistent delays in three key temporal components of gaze behavior: the time needed to initiate the eye movement after target appearance (reaction time), the time needed to reach the target (movement time), and the time needed to stabilize gaze on the target (adjusting time). None of these effects were observed during listening or control conditions, suggesting that the act of talking and the cognitive effort required to search for and produce verbal answers create meaningful interference with gaze control mechanisms.

These delays appear small in isolation, but during driving, they may accumulate into slower detection of hazards and delayed initiation of physical responses. Even hands-free conversations may introduce a cognitive load strong enough to interfere with the neural processes that initiate and guide eye movements. Because drivers often need to look downward toward pedestrians, debris, or objects on the road, these delays highlight the broad risks of conversation during visually demanding driving scenarios.

The authors note that their findings do not imply that talking is the sole or dominant cause of slowed physical reactions behind the wheel. Driving performance is influenced by multiple cognitive and perceptual factors, including inattentional blindness, divided attention, and the broader interference that occurs when the brain is forced to manage two demanding tasks at once. Even so, the study demonstrates that talking introduces delays at the earliest stage of visual processing before recognition, decision-making, or physical action, which means it may quietly undermine driving performance in ways that are not immediately obvious to drivers themselves. "These results indicate that the cognitive demands associated with talking interfere with the neural mechanisms responsible for initiating and controlling eye movements, which represent the critical first stage of visuomotor processing during driving," concludes Dr. Uehara.

These insights carry meaningful implications for public safety. By understanding that the cognitive effort involved in conversation can degrade gaze accuracy and timing, drivers may become more mindful about when and how they choose to talk while driving. Over time, this knowledge could support safer driving behaviors, inform driver-training frameworks, inspire improvements in vehicle interface design, and guide policymakers in shaping future recommendations around cognitive distraction.

Calcium (Ca2+) drives many cellular functions, though the way it controls quality of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a cellular organelle that synthesizes and transports proteins, is widely unknown. This control system of protein quality, known as proteostasis, was put under a microscope by researchers to find a more thorough understanding of the process, potentially revealing clues about how to prevent Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The team consisted of researchers across multiple disciplines, lead by Distinguished Associate Professor Masaki Okumura of the Tohoku University Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences (FRIS) and Graduate School of Life Sciences, in an international collaborative study involving 17 research teams from Japan, Korea, and the UK. Results were published in Nature Cell Biology on November 11, 2025.

With the goal of elucidating Ca2+ driven proteostasis in the ER in mind, they found that Ca2+ can induce a phase separation in PDIA6, a gene that codes for a specific, ER-localized protein responsible for protein folding and function. Therefore, if this protein loses its function, misfolding can occur. The consequences for improperly folded proteins can be dire - such as diabetes.

However, not all is lost if there are mistakes in protein folding. They found that a process called calcium-driven phase separation in the ER essentially creates liquid-like droplets through condensation that can make corrections to proinsulin. Proinsulin is the insulin precursor, and too much of it can indicate a risk for Type 2 diabetes.

To keep everything running smoothly, we need these condensation-like droplets to ensure proinsulin is properly folded - as opposed to forming large, aggregate clumps that can disrupt the normal pathways and cause negative health outcomes." 

Masaki Okumura, Distinguished Associate Professor, Tohoku University

This knowledge meaningfully contributes to our understanding of other calcium-driven processes within cells. In addition, this research could potentially be used in drug development for difficult-to-cure diseases like ALS, Alzheimer's and Type 2 diabetes.

A new study published today in Science Translational Medicine by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center details a therapeutic vulnerability in patients with an aggressive subtype of triple-negative breast cancer.

Led by Khandan Keyomarsi, Ph.D., professor of Experimental Radiation Oncology, the study shows that simultaneous inhibition of ATR and PKMYT1 triggers a type of cell death in Rb1deficient breast cancer models.

Using genomic profiling, proteomics and patient-derived xenografts, the researchers found that loss of Rb1 – a gene important for normal cell division – disrupts DNA repair processes and forces tumor cells to rely on ATR and PKMYT1 dependent pathways for survival, creating a vulnerability that can be selectively targeted.

This is a breakthrough discovery. Rb1-deficient tumors do not respond to CDK4/6 inhibitors because they depend on Rb1 to regulate cell division. But that same deficiency makes them vulnerable to ATR and PKMYT1 inhibition. We can now identify patients who may benefit from an entirely different therapeutic strategy."

What is the major finding of this study on ATR and PKMYT1 co-inhibition?

 The study demonstrates that simultaneously inhibiting ATR and PKMYT1 – two proteins required for maintaining genomic stability during cell division – induces cell death in Rb1-deficient breast cancers. By blocking both repair pathways, the treatment overwhelms the cancer cell's ability to correct DNA errors, leading to catastrophic DNA damage, apoptosis, tumor shrinkage and improved survival in preclinical models.

How does Rb1 deficiency create a vulnerability if it also indicates resistance?

 Rb1 normally prevents uncontrolled cell division and helps maintain genomic integrity. When Rb1 is lost, cells accumulate DNA errors more rapidly and become prone to malignant transformation. These tumors also resist CDK4/6 inhibitors because the therapy depends on an intact Rb1 pathway to halt the cell cycle.

The same mechanism that allows mutations to more easily occur also creates the vulnerability. While DNA mutations can lead to cancer development, cancer cells also need to replicate, and if they build too many mutations as they replicate, they can no longer function. Using an inhibitor to intentionally cause this to happen is what's known as synthetic lethality.

By inhibiting ATR and PKMYT1 – two proteins that are also important for repairing mutations in DNA – this strategy causes and overload of mutations, leading to cell death and ultimately tumor shrinkage. In this study, targeting these pathways led to tumor shrinkage and increased overall survival in preclinical models.

What are the next steps for bringing this discovery to the clinic?

One of the most noteworthy aspects of this study is its near-term clinical relevancy. Several ATR and PKMYT1 inhibitors already are in clinical trials and have received fast-track designation from the FDA.

The Phase I MYTHIC Trial, which is also being led by MD Anderson researchers, is one example of a trial already testing the combination for certain mutations in solid tumors. The current findings could directly inform the development of Rb1-based biomarker strategies to identify patients most likely to benefit from dual ATR/PKMYT1 inhibition.

"Beyond this combination strategy, our study also shows that Rb1 deficiency predicts sensitivity to other DNA-damaging therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation," Keyomarsi said. "Incorporating Rb1 status into clinical decision-making could help tailor more effective, personalized treatment plans for these patients."

Prescription stimulants, such as Ritalin and Adderall, are widely used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including in children. In the U.S., about 3.5 million kids ages 3 to 17 take an ADHD medication, a number that has increased as more children have been diagnosed with the neurodevelopmental disorder.

Stimulant medications have long been thought to treat ADHD by acting upon regions of the brain that control attention, but a new study by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis casts doubt on that thinking. Led by Benjamin Kay, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology, and Nico U. Dosenbach, MD, PhD, the David M. & Tracy S. Holtzman Professor of Neurology, it shows for the first time that these drugs act primarily on the brain's reward and wakefulness centers, rather than on its attention circuitry.

The findings, published Dec. 24 in Cell, suggest that prescription stimulants enhance performance by making individuals with ADHD more alert and interested in tasks, rather than directly improving their ability to focus. The researchers also found that stimulant medications produced patterns of brain activity that mimicked the effect of good sleep, negating the effects of sleep deprivation on brain activity.

"I prescribe a lot of stimulants as a child neurologist, and I've always been taught that they facilitate attention systems to give people more voluntary control over what they pay attention to," said Kay, who treats patients at St. Louis Children's Hospital. "But we've shown that's not the case. Rather, the improvement we observe in attention is a secondary effect of a child being more alert and finding a task more rewarding, which naturally helps them pay more attention to it."

Kay said the findings point to the importance of addressing inadequate sleep in addition to considering stimulant medication for children being evaluated for ADHD.

To understand how stimulant medications affect the brain, the research team examined resting-state functional MRI, or fMRI, data - a type of neuroimaging that indicates a person's brain activity when they are not engaged in any specific task - from 5,795 children ages 8 to 11 who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The ABCD study is a long-term, multisite study that is tracking the neurodevelopment of more than 11,000 children from across the U.S., including a site based at WashU Medicine.

The researchers analyzed fMRI scans and compared brain connectivity patterns between children who took prescription stimulants and children who did not on the day of their scan. Compared with kids not taking stimulants, children who took stimulants the day of the scan showed increased activity in regions of the brain related to arousal or wakefulness and regions predicting how rewarding an activity will be. Their scans did not show significantly increased activity in regions classically associated with attention.

The researchers validated their observation in an experiment on five healthy adults without ADHD who normally did not take stimulant medication. The participants were scanned using resting-state fMRI before and after taking a dose of stimulant medication, allowing for precise measurement of changes in brain connectivity. The researchers again found that arousal and reward centers in the brain, not attention centers, were activated by the medications.

Essentially, we found that stimulants pre-reward our brains and allow us to keep working at things that wouldn't normally hold our interest - like our least favorite class in school, for example."

Nico U. Dosenbach, MD, PhD, the David M. & Tracy S. Holtzman Professor of Neurology

In other words, the study findings suggest that rather than "lighting up" the attention centers of a child with ADHD, stimulant drugs work by helping make activities that the child normally struggles to focus on feel relatively more rewarding, he noted. That extra motivation helps kids continue challenging activities as well as tedious tasks.

"These results also provide a potential explanation for how stimulants treat hyperactivity, which previously seemed paradoxical," Dosenbach added. "Whatever kids can't focus on - those tasks that make them fidgety - are tasks that they find unrewarding. On a stimulant, they can sit still better because they're not getting up to find something better to do."

Compared with children with ADHD who did not take a stimulant, children with ADHD who took a stimulant medication had better grades in school (as reported by their parents) and performed better on cognitive tests given as part of the ABCD study. Children with more severe ADHD showed the greatest gains in cognitive outcomes associated with taking prescription stimulants.

Despite their significant effects on brain activity, the researchers found that stimulant medications were not associated with cognitive gains in all children taking them. Children who got less than the recommended nine or more hours of sleep per night and took a stimulant received better grades in school than did kids who got insufficient sleep and did not take a stimulant. However, stimulants did not correspond with improved performance for neurotypical kids who got sufficient sleep. (It is not clear why these kids were taking stimulant medications.) That is, stimulants were linked with improved cognitive performance only for participants with ADHD or those who got insuﬃcient sleep.

"We saw that if a participant didn't sleep enough, but they took a stimulant, the brain signature of insufficient sleep was erased, as were the associated behavioral and cognitive decrements," Dosenbach said.

The authors noted that this boost in performance despite a lack of sleep might carry long-term costs.

"Not getting enough sleep is always bad for you, and it's especially bad for kids," Kay said. He noted that children who are overtired may exhibit classic symptoms of ADHD, such as difficulty paying attention in class or declining grades, leading to a misdiagnosis in some cases when the real culprit is sleep deprivation. The stimulant medication may then appear to help by mimicking some of the effects of a good night's sleep, while still leaving the child vulnerable to long-term effects of sleep deprivation. Kay urged clinicians to consider sleep deprivation as a factor in ADHD diagnoses and to explore strategies or treatments to boost kids' sleep.

Dosenbach and Kay's results point to the need for future studies on the potential long-term effects of stimulants on brain function. The researchers noted that these medications could have a restorative effect by activating the brain's waste clearing system during wakefulness, but it's equally likely they might cause lasting damage if used to cover up chronic sleep deficits.

Real Madrid are preparing for all eventualities as contract negotiations with Vinícius Junior continue to stall, with reports suggesting a contingency plan has already been mapped out. The Brazilian forward remains locked in talks over improved terms, holding firm on his financial demands while the club have so far refused to move beyond their most recent offer. 

Vinícius has repeatedly underlined his commitment to life at the Santiago Bernabeu, and that stance has been echoed from the top. Club president Florentino Perez is understood to be keen on retaining one of the team's most influential figures, with Madrid's default position being to keep the winger at almost any cost. The message from the Spanish capital is consistent: Vinicius is central to the sporting project. Only a complete breakdown in negotiations would push the club towards a sale, and even then, it would be on Madrid's terms. Discussions are expected to resume next summer, but the lack of progress has forced Madrid's hierarchy to quietly consider alternatives should an agreement ultimately prove impossible. While both parties insist there is no desire for a split, the uncertainty has prompted strategic planning behind the scenes.

According to Cadena SER, that fallback plan would see Madrid pivot towards Vitinha, the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder who has long been admired by scouts at Valdebebas. In this scenario, Madrid would consider selling Vinícius for a fee no lower than €100 million (£87m), before redirecting that money into an aggressive pursuit of the Portuguese playmaker. Interest in Vitinha is not new. Within the club, he is viewed as a midfielder capable of transforming the tempo and structure of Madrid's engine room, a profile they believe has been missing in recent seasons. The discussion around Vitinha inevitably ties into a broader debate about succession planning. The departures and advancing years of legends such as Toni Kroos and Luka Modrić have left a creative void in the middle of the pitch, one Madrid have struggled to fill decisively. As journalist Jorge C. Picon has explained, the club hierarchy recognised the problem but found few suitable replacements who were both convincing and financially viable. Rather than overspend, Madrid opted to explore internal solutions.

That gamble centred on the idea that one, or both, of Jude Bellingham and Arda Guler could evolve into deeper midfield roles. While both possess exceptional talent, neither experiment has fully delivered the control and rhythm traditionally associated with Madrid's elite playmakers. As a result, the search for a true midfield organiser has quietly resumed, with Vitinha increasingly viewed as a near-ideal candidate.

Even with funds generated from a hypothetical Vinicius sale, taking Vitinha away from Paris Saint-Germain would be enormously challenging. The Portugal international is under contract until 2029 and is considered a cornerstone of PSG's midfield.  Relations between the two European heavyweights are hardly warm, and PSG would be particularly reluctant to strengthen a historic rival. Any move would almost certainly require Vitinha himself to push for the transfer, and even then, precedent suggests the Paris outfit would not buckle easily. Indeed, they fought Mbappe tooth and nail in court over unpaid wages, a fight they eventually lost. Vitinha remains a highly attractive but realistically difficult option, one that would test both Madrid's negotiating power and the player's willingness to force the issue.

For now, Madrid remain confident that an agreement with Vinícius can still be reached, preserving a partnership that has defined their attacking identity in recent years. Yet the existence of a Vitinha contingency plan underlines the club's determination to stay ahead of any eventuality. Madrid return to action on 4 January against Real Betis in La Liga, before a Supercopa derby against Atlético Madrid five days later in Jeddah. Xabi Alonso's future hangs by a thread, and another defeat to their eternal rivals might seal his fate at the Spanish capital.

Endrick is already breaking records for Lyon without kicking a ball since leaving Real Madrid on loan. The 19-year-old will spend the second half of the season with the French giants as he bids to get his fledgling career back on track after struggling for game time at Los Blancos. While he won't be able to play for Lyon for a couple of weeks, he is producing record-breaking numbers on social media.

Last week, Lyon reached an agreement with Madrid to sign Endrick on loan for the rest of the campaign. After the summer departures of forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Georges Mikautadze, the Ligue 1 team have been in need of some attacking reinforcements and now that has come in the form of the young Brazilian. When his switch was announced, the teenager - who will wear the number nine shirt - exclaimed in a Lyon social media post, "Christmas has come early!" The Brazil international, who made just four appearances in all competitions for Xabi Alonso's side this season, will hope to hit the ground running at Lyon, where there is plenty of excitement about his arrival.

According to RMC Sport, Lyon's Instagram post announcing Endrick's arrival has been viewed more than 17 million times - the club's most widely seen to date. For context, the previous record was linked to a video by Tyler Morton when he joined from Liverpool this summer, a post that was viewed under three million times. If he stars for the French top-flight team, more records could tumble in the coming weeks and months.

When his loan move was confirmed, Lyon wrote on the club website: "At just 19 years of age, Endrick joins OL with already solid experience at the very highest level and a maturity forged in demanding competitive environments. His attacking profile, his impact in decisive areas, and his energy are major assets as the team heads into the second half of the season, with many objectives still to be achieved."

Lyon also described him as "one of the most promising talents of his generation" and thanked Madrid for making this move possible.

They added: "Olympique Lyonnais is delighted to welcome Endrick, who will join the professional squad from 29 December, and would like to thank Real Madrid for the quality of the discussions and cooperation that made his arrival possible."

While Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior wished his compatriot well at Lyon, club icon Sidney Govou has his question marks over the deal. 

The former wrote on Instagram: "My brother Bob, good luck. We're waiting for you big time here." 

Govou, however, thought there must be something wrong if a player, such as Endrick, is garnering so little game time.

He said: "Nobody knows enough about Endrick to know what he's capable of, even if he's undoubtedly a good player. However, be careful, a substitute who never plays often indicates a problem. Endrick will have individual goals that might not align with the team's collective objectives, and that's what bothers me."

As Lyon confirmed, Endrick will link up with their first-team squad for training on Monday but he will have to wait a bit longer for his club debut. That is because he was not registered in time for their next clash on 3 January against AS Monaco. He could, however, get his first minutes for the French team in the Coupe de France last-16 clash against Lille eight days later. Incidentally, Lyon sit fifth in Ligue 1, 10 points behind surprise league leaders Lens and nine adrift of Champions League holders and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain after 16 matches. A win over Monaco in their next game could see them close to the five-point gap to fourth-positioned Lille if results go their way.

Scott McTominay's career has taken an unexpected yet glittering turn since leaving Manchester United, but speculation is now mounting that the Scotland midfielder could yet find his way back to the Premier League. Reports suggest the door to an Old Trafford reunion has not been firmly shut, with McTominay said to be weighing his long-term future after a remarkable spell in Italy.

The 29-year-old left Manchester United in the summer of 2024, completing a £26 million ($35m) move that brought an end to a lifelong association with the club. A product of United's academy, McTominay made 255 senior appearances for the Red Devils, often operating as a reliable if understated presence in midfield before deciding it was time to test himself beyond familiar surroundings. That leap of faith has been emphatically rewarded. McTominay's debut campaign with Napoli proved to be the most productive of his career, as he struck 13 goals across all competitions and played a central role in delivering the Serie A title. His performances earned him MVP honours, underlining a transformation that few predicted when he departed England. The accolades did not stop there. McTominay joined elite company by emulating figures such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović in being named Serie A Player of the Year. In doing so, he became the first Scot ever to claim the award, a historic milestone indeed.

Yet for all the success, not everything has been straightforward. Napoli currently sit third in Serie A, and according to reports from The Sun, internal tensions have begun to emerge amid the intense scrutiny that comes with stardom in Naples.

One source claimed: "Scott loves elements of Italian life and had a wonderful first season. But the passion of the fans can be a blessing but also make things difficult. He is treated as a god over there but it means he finds it difficult to do simple things when he's not training. The attention can be suffocating."

Against that backdrop, rumours have linked the midfielder with a host of clubs back in England, including Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, while Barcelona have also been mentioned as admirers. The possibility of a Premier League return has inevitably reignited discussion of a United homecoming, particularly given McTominay's deep-rooted connection to the club.

Despite the swirling speculation, McTominay has consistently spoken warmly about his life in Italy, comments that appear to cool the notion of an imminent exit. 

In October, he told Sky Sports Italia: "I'm really happy in Naples."

He expanded on that sentiment in a BBC interview, and said: "The people in Naples are incredible, they're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation and that inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care. It's different, a totally different way of life over there - the way you eat, the way you live and all that. It gives you more mental strength. I've always lived very close to my mum, so I could go whenever I wanted.

"Whereas now I live 1,500 miles away so I can't just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different, but in life you sometimes have to take yourself out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that. I would never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go away anywhere and establish myself and do well, why not? Who's to stop me doing that?"

On the field, Napoli remain firmly in the hunt to defend their Serie A crown. After 15 rounds, they sit just two points behind leaders Inter, keeping the title race finely balanced. Before Christmas, McTominay added another piece of silverware to his collection as Napoli defeated Bologna in the Supercoppa final, reinforcing his growing medal haul. Napoli return to league action on Sunday against Cremonese, with McTominay expected to once again play a key role as they chase domestic ambitions.

From the 2026 World Cup to the 2028 Olympics, major events, star players and big investments are transforming the U.S. into a sports hub.

The United States is on track to become the new center of global sports. And this is not just about 2026, when it will host the biggest FIFA World Cup in history, expanded to 48 teams. The process began in 2024 with the Copa América, which ended with Argentina crowned champions, and continued in the middle of this year with the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, widely considered a success and backed by a key figure of influence: President Donald Trump. Trump even took part in the final, not only during the trophy presentation ceremony but also joking and even dancing with Chelsea's victorious players.

In addition to the 2026 World Cup, the United States is preparing to host what is widely regarded as the largest sporting event of all time, the 2028 Olympic Games, which will be held in Los Angeles and promise to be among the most technologically advanced in history. 

This week, The Athletic also reported that the 2028 Copa América could be staged in the United States. According to the outlet, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF are already in talks, with the only obstacle being the fact that the Olympics would take place in the same year. For this to happen, the organizations would need to reschedule dates so the events do not overlap.

A report jointly produced by FIFA and the World Trade Organization estimates that spending associated with the 2026 World Cup will generate a $17.2 billion impact on U.S. GDP and $40.9 billion globally. The tournament is also expected to create 185,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the United States and 824,000 worldwide.

The big remaining question is whether the United States will truly become the new global hub of sports in the coming years and whether it will manage to popularize soccer in the country, where the sport still lags well behind others in terms of popularity. Competition will come from the Middle East, and Qatar and Saudi Arabia in particular.

“Previously known in the sports world mainly for the NBA and the NFL, the United States is now experiencing a growing move toward soccer, partly driven by large-scale events. This agenda not only attracts international attention but also catalyzes investment in infrastructure, media, and advertising, while creating a range of business opportunities for the market, such as hospitality and premium services for fans,” explains Joaquim Lo Prete, national manager at Absolut Sport.

“The U.S. market has become the epicenter of a globalized audience. By hosting the world's most important soccer tournaments, the United States is establishing itself as a destination for global sports tourism, offering a massive showcase for the sport that connects fans from every continent in a single place,” says Thales Rangel Mafia, marketing manager at Multimarcas Consórcios.

Amid all of this, major NBA and NFL games will continue to take place, further energizing daily life in these cities and, as a result, bringing enjoyment to the tourists who will be in the area during these events.

“To give a sense of this expansion, FIFA moved its operations to Miami in 2023, taking into account the investments made by the country's top league, Major League Soccer, especially after the arrival of stars such as Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez at Inter Miami. In addition, more than 100 employees from world soccer's governing body have relocated from its headquarters in Switzerland to Coral Gables, which will house the organization's legal, audit, compliance, and risk management departments. The United States has begun to explore global events, investing heavily in soccer and once again hosting major competitions. On the other hand, when it comes to American football, the most popular sport among Americans, there has been a process of internationalization of brands. In Brazil, we have followed NFL games in recent years, but now we will also host college football events, which attract a more engaged audience. We expect to welcome 20,000 American tourists for the game in Rio de Janeiro,” says Bruno Guilherme, CEO of Sports Business, the company responsible for organizing the game between the Virginia Cavaliers and the NC State Wolfpack, which will be played at Nilton Santos Stadium in Rio de Janeiro in August 2026. 

The rise of the United States as a global sports hub is creating a domino effect: clubs, leagues, and stadiums in other countries are adopting more advanced technologies to avoid losing relevance. Event operations in the U.S. are already based on automation, data intelligence, and integrated systems, setting a new standard of excellence that tends to be replicated internationally, says Tironi Paz Ortiz, CEO and founder of Imply Tecnologia.

“I believe brands can benefit enormously from the visibility and opportunities offered by major sporting events in the United States in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup. By adopting an integrated and creative approach, leveraging sponsorships, strategic partnerships, engagement campaigns, and interactive consumer experiences, brands can increase visibility, build loyalty, and align with positive values, ensuring a lasting and meaningful impact,” says Wagner Leitzke, digital director at the agency End to End.

“After several historical attempts to popularize soccer, the growing influence of Latino culture, combined with the hosting of major events and the presence of top-tier stars in the domestic league, has proven to be a winning formula for elevating the importance of the sport in the most competitive market in the world. Competing for attention with the other four well-established major leagues is a major challenge, but soccer has everything it needs to solidify its presence this time,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM.

According to Heraldo Evans, commercial and marketing manager at Recoma, the United States is no longer just a major consumer market and is positioning itself as a global hub for the sports industry. “The country has invested heavily in infrastructure, content, and experiences, expanding interest in sports that historically were not part of the local imagination and attracting major global events to the country. This movement creates new business opportunities, draws an international audience, and redefines standards for production and management in sports. For companies in the sector, such as Recoma, this scenario represents opportunities to integrate into an increasingly sophisticated ecosystem that values innovation, sustainable operating models, and projects capable of interacting simultaneously with different sports cultures. It is an environment that expands boundaries and requires all of us to think about sports in a more global way.”

The Recoma executive emphasizes that the United States' approach follows a logic similar to China's in 2008. “Identify the sports with the greatest medal potential and direct investments toward them. At the same time, the country is taking advantage of the renewal of the Olympic program, which has incorporated younger sports such as skateboarding, surfing, climbing, and breakdancing, bringing the Games closer to a new audience. By strengthening these sports and attracting sponsors who previously did not invest in the Olympic environment, the United States aims to reclaim its historic prominence precisely in the edition it will host in Los Angeles.”

From soccer to football

Donald Trump's interviews are often surrounded by controversy or reveal new information. During the draw ceremony for the 2026 World Cup, the U.S. president once again mentioned, in a critical tone, a possible name change from “soccer,” typically used in the United States, to “football,” which is commonly referred to as “American football”, outside the U.S. “It makes no sense. We have to think of another name,” he said briefly.

The statement came as no surprise. After the FIFA Club World Cup final earlier this year between PSG and Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Trump gave an interview to DAZN, the network that holds the competition's broadcasting rights, and said he was considering signing an executive order to require that the term “soccer” be called “football” in the United States. “I think we can do it. I think I could do it,” he said.

Trump was one of the guests of honor of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, and the relationship between the two leaders has grown increasingly close. So much so that the U.S. president was one of the central figures in the award ceremony and trophy presentation to Club the World Cup finalists, and FIFA itself maintains an office in Trump Tower in New York in the run-up to the tournament.

Soccer, or in the future “football,” as Trump suggests, does not even rank among the five most popular sports in the United States. It still trails American football (NFL), basketball (NBA), baseball (MLB), boxing, ice hockey (NHL), and even college football. Soccer may emerge later through Major League Soccer, which has seen a surge in popularity over the past two years following multimillion-dollar investments in world-class players such as Lionel Messi, now with Inter Miami.

Trump has said he wants to see soccer grow in the United States, hoping it can soon match the country's other global positions. But could changing the name have any effect?

“I think it would be a historic change that would reveal a global truth: the United States resisted for years a sport invented by the English, not by Americans. More traditional fans will not like it. Fans of Latino heritage, who already make up nearly 20% of the population, will like it, and its popularization will come in future generations, who will learn to call ‘fútbol' the sport played with the feet,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM.

“There could be a kind of antagonism, intentional or accidental, between soccer and American football. If it is a form of social engineering, it could even be part of a proposal for cultural division. But it could also have a geopolitical agenda, linking the ‘money' that is so strong in modern soccer with American football, involving Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Emirates,” explains Alexandre Vasconcellos, regional manager at Flashscore.

“I think it helps to ‘popularize' the sport in the U.S., even if it is through the force of controversy and antagonism. Even if it is legally complex or practically unfeasible, at least in terms of everyday language, it can be quite effective at drawing attention and provoking divisions, for example between a more ‘traditional' local population and another with a more cosmopolitan or internationalist outlook,” the executive adds.

“Italians have ‘Calcio' in the name of their federation instead of ‘football,' and that is not a problem. What matters is the willingness of the most powerful president in the world to help the sport grow in his country like nowhere else. The name is secondary if everyone knows what it refers to,” says Thiago Freitas, chief operating officer at Roc Nation Sports. “Women's soccer is a success. The national team is even one of the global powerhouses. Men's soccer has not taken off yet and is in a phase of slow, gradual growth. In my view, changing ‘soccer' to ‘football' could cause unnecessary confusion, especially because I do not believe that would be the trigger for a breakthrough. I prefer the formula of planning, strategy, investment, and time,” adds Fábio Wolff of Wolff Sports and Marketing. 

“I think it would be interesting, but without major changes in the sport's evolution. Still, it is another positive point for the Club World Cup. The president clearly understood firsthand the power of soccer,” says Renê Salviano, CEO of Heatmap and a sports marketing specialist who manages brand contracts involving professional athletes.

“At a time when the United States is hosting the World Cup, aligning the name of the sport with international vocabulary has a strategic effect. It makes global marketing easier, improves connections with new fans, and strengthens synergy with brands and sports properties,” concludes Wagner Leitzke, club director at End to End.

Even weather-related stoppages during World Cup matches can turn into opportunities for fan engagement and sponsor sales.

Climate change has been altering the global sports calendar, creating impacts that go far beyond the sport itself. At the Club World Cup, six of the 59 matches played were affected by stoppages due to “severe weather alerts.” Despite the logistical challenges, these moments also create opportunities for strategic actions by brands and sponsors looking to connect with fans in creative ways and boost in-stadium consumption. Even at the Club World Cup, cooling breaks were sponsored.

“Organizers of the World Cup must be prepared for situations caused by climate change. These require attention to public transportation and safe shelters for fans, but they can also be used to connect with supporters and generate value for sponsors,” says Anderson Rubinatto, CEO of Goolaço, a company specializing in sports events.

During these pauses, the mobile phone becomes the fan's main ally. Statistics and live score apps see spikes in usage while matches are suspended. This window, once viewed only as a problem, is now being seen as an opportunity for real-time digital activations.

Creativity is a key differentiating factor in this scenario. With the support of technology, tools such as QR codes on stadium screens can direct fans to challenges, giveaways, or exclusive content during forced stoppages. Joaquim Lo Prete, national director of Absolut Sport in Brazil, believes the key lies in offering something unique and time-limited.

“It is possible to launch contests, giveaways, or challenges with instant prizes, such as products, discounts, or VIP experiences, accessed through QR codes displayed on stadium screens or during broadcasts. The action must be exclusive to the moment of the interruption. With planning and strong execution, this strategy keeps fans engaged and also stimulates consumption,” he explains.

In the United States, leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and MLS have been dealing with these types of situations for years. While there is no specific federal legislation governing weather-related stoppages, each league follows its own protocols and carries insurance that covers financial losses caused by delays or cancellations.

So-called event cancellation insurance is common and guarantees coverage in the event of unforeseen weather conditions. In addition, policies such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Reauthorization Act help improve weather forecasting and risk monitoring for large-scale events.

From the 2026 World Cup to the 2028 Olympics, major events, star players and big investments are transforming the U.S. into a sports hub.

The United States is on track to become the new center of global sports. And this is not just about 2026, when it will host the biggest FIFA World Cup in history, expanded to 48 teams. The process began in 2024 with the Copa América, which ended with Argentina crowned champions, and continued in the middle of this year with the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, widely considered a success and backed by a key figure of influence: President Donald Trump. Trump even took part in the final, not only during the trophy presentation ceremony but also joking and even dancing with Chelsea's victorious players.

In addition to the 2026 World Cup, the United States is preparing to host what is widely regarded as the largest sporting event of all time, the 2028 Olympic Games, which will be held in Los Angeles and promise to be among the most technologically advanced in history. 

This week, The Athletic also reported that the 2028 Copa América could be staged in the United States. According to the outlet, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF are already in talks, with the only obstacle being the fact that the Olympics would take place in the same year. For this to happen, the organizations would need to reschedule dates so the events do not overlap.

A report jointly produced by FIFA and the World Trade Organization estimates that spending associated with the 2026 World Cup will generate a $17.2 billion impact on U.S. GDP and $40.9 billion globally. The tournament is also expected to create 185,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the United States and 824,000 worldwide.

The big remaining question is whether the United States will truly become the new global hub of sports in the coming years and whether it will manage to popularize soccer in the country, where the sport still lags well behind others in terms of popularity. Competition will come from the Middle East, and Qatar and Saudi Arabia in particular.

“Previously known in the sports world mainly for the NBA and the NFL, the United States is now experiencing a growing move toward soccer, partly driven by large-scale events. This agenda not only attracts international attention but also catalyzes investment in infrastructure, media, and advertising, while creating a range of business opportunities for the market, such as hospitality and premium services for fans,” explains Joaquim Lo Prete, national manager at Absolut Sport.

“The U.S. market has become the epicenter of a globalized audience. By hosting the world's most important soccer tournaments, the United States is establishing itself as a destination for global sports tourism, offering a massive showcase for the sport that connects fans from every continent in a single place,” says Thales Rangel Mafia, marketing manager at Multimarcas Consórcios.

Amid all of this, major NBA and NFL games will continue to take place, further energizing daily life in these cities and, as a result, bringing enjoyment to the tourists who will be in the area during these events.

“To give a sense of this expansion, FIFA moved its operations to Miami in 2023, taking into account the investments made by the country's top league, Major League Soccer, especially after the arrival of stars such as Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez at Inter Miami. In addition, more than 100 employees from world soccer's governing body have relocated from its headquarters in Switzerland to Coral Gables, which will house the organization's legal, audit, compliance, and risk management departments. The United States has begun to explore global events, investing heavily in soccer and once again hosting major competitions. On the other hand, when it comes to American football, the most popular sport among Americans, there has been a process of internationalization of brands. In Brazil, we have followed NFL games in recent years, but now we will also host college football events, which attract a more engaged audience. We expect to welcome 20,000 American tourists for the game in Rio de Janeiro,” says Bruno Guilherme, CEO of Sports Business, the company responsible for organizing the game between the Virginia Cavaliers and the NC State Wolfpack, which will be played at Nilton Santos Stadium in Rio de Janeiro in August 2026. 

The rise of the United States as a global sports hub is creating a domino effect: clubs, leagues, and stadiums in other countries are adopting more advanced technologies to avoid losing relevance. Event operations in the U.S. are already based on automation, data intelligence, and integrated systems, setting a new standard of excellence that tends to be replicated internationally, says Tironi Paz Ortiz, CEO and founder of Imply Tecnologia.

“I believe brands can benefit enormously from the visibility and opportunities offered by major sporting events in the United States in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup. By adopting an integrated and creative approach, leveraging sponsorships, strategic partnerships, engagement campaigns, and interactive consumer experiences, brands can increase visibility, build loyalty, and align with positive values, ensuring a lasting and meaningful impact,” says Wagner Leitzke, digital director at the agency End to End.

“After several historical attempts to popularize soccer, the growing influence of Latino culture, combined with the hosting of major events and the presence of top-tier stars in the domestic league, has proven to be a winning formula for elevating the importance of the sport in the most competitive market in the world. Competing for attention with the other four well-established major leagues is a major challenge, but soccer has everything it needs to solidify its presence this time,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM.

According to Heraldo Evans, commercial and marketing manager at Recoma, the United States is no longer just a major consumer market and is positioning itself as a global hub for the sports industry. “The country has invested heavily in infrastructure, content, and experiences, expanding interest in sports that historically were not part of the local imagination and attracting major global events to the country. This movement creates new business opportunities, draws an international audience, and redefines standards for production and management in sports. For companies in the sector, such as Recoma, this scenario represents opportunities to integrate into an increasingly sophisticated ecosystem that values innovation, sustainable operating models, and projects capable of interacting simultaneously with different sports cultures. It is an environment that expands boundaries and requires all of us to think about sports in a more global way.”

The Recoma executive emphasizes that the United States' approach follows a logic similar to China's in 2008. “Identify the sports with the greatest medal potential and direct investments toward them. At the same time, the country is taking advantage of the renewal of the Olympic program, which has incorporated younger sports such as skateboarding, surfing, climbing, and breakdancing, bringing the Games closer to a new audience. By strengthening these sports and attracting sponsors who previously did not invest in the Olympic environment, the United States aims to reclaim its historic prominence precisely in the edition it will host in Los Angeles.”

From soccer to football

Donald Trump's interviews are often surrounded by controversy or reveal new information. During the draw ceremony for the 2026 World Cup, the U.S. president once again mentioned, in a critical tone, a possible name change from “soccer,” typically used in the United States, to “football,” which is commonly referred to as “American football”, outside the U.S. “It makes no sense. We have to think of another name,” he said briefly.

The statement came as no surprise. After the FIFA Club World Cup final earlier this year between PSG and Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Trump gave an interview to DAZN, the network that holds the competition's broadcasting rights, and said he was considering signing an executive order to require that the term “soccer” be called “football” in the United States. “I think we can do it. I think I could do it,” he said.

Trump was one of the guests of honor of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, and the relationship between the two leaders has grown increasingly close. So much so that the U.S. president was one of the central figures in the award ceremony and trophy presentation to Club the World Cup finalists, and FIFA itself maintains an office in Trump Tower in New York in the run-up to the tournament.

Soccer, or in the future “football,” as Trump suggests, does not even rank among the five most popular sports in the United States. It still trails American football (NFL), basketball (NBA), baseball (MLB), boxing, ice hockey (NHL), and even college football. Soccer may emerge later through Major League Soccer, which has seen a surge in popularity over the past two years following multimillion-dollar investments in world-class players such as Lionel Messi, now with Inter Miami.

Trump has said he wants to see soccer grow in the United States, hoping it can soon match the country's other global positions. But could changing the name have any effect?

“I think it would be a historic change that would reveal a global truth: the United States resisted for years a sport invented by the English, not by Americans. More traditional fans will not like it. Fans of Latino heritage, who already make up nearly 20% of the population, will like it, and its popularization will come in future generations, who will learn to call ‘fútbol' the sport played with the feet,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM.

“There could be a kind of antagonism, intentional or accidental, between soccer and American football. If it is a form of social engineering, it could even be part of a proposal for cultural division. But it could also have a geopolitical agenda, linking the ‘money' that is so strong in modern soccer with American football, involving Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Emirates,” explains Alexandre Vasconcellos, regional manager at Flashscore.

“I think it helps to ‘popularize' the sport in the U.S., even if it is through the force of controversy and antagonism. Even if it is legally complex or practically unfeasible, at least in terms of everyday language, it can be quite effective at drawing attention and provoking divisions, for example between a more ‘traditional' local population and another with a more cosmopolitan or internationalist outlook,” the executive adds.

“Italians have ‘Calcio' in the name of their federation instead of ‘football,' and that is not a problem. What matters is the willingness of the most powerful president in the world to help the sport grow in his country like nowhere else. The name is secondary if everyone knows what it refers to,” says Thiago Freitas, chief operating officer at Roc Nation Sports. “Women's soccer is a success. The national team is even one of the global powerhouses. Men's soccer has not taken off yet and is in a phase of slow, gradual growth. In my view, changing ‘soccer' to ‘football' could cause unnecessary confusion, especially because I do not believe that would be the trigger for a breakthrough. I prefer the formula of planning, strategy, investment, and time,” adds Fábio Wolff of Wolff Sports and Marketing. 

“I think it would be interesting, but without major changes in the sport's evolution. Still, it is another positive point for the Club World Cup. The president clearly understood firsthand the power of soccer,” says Renê Salviano, CEO of Heatmap and a sports marketing specialist who manages brand contracts involving professional athletes.

“At a time when the United States is hosting the World Cup, aligning the name of the sport with international vocabulary has a strategic effect. It makes global marketing easier, improves connections with new fans, and strengthens synergy with brands and sports properties,” concludes Wagner Leitzke, club director at End to End.

Even weather-related stoppages during World Cup matches can turn into opportunities for fan engagement and sponsor sales.

Climate change has been altering the global sports calendar, creating impacts that go far beyond the sport itself. At the Club World Cup, six of the 59 matches played were affected by stoppages due to “severe weather alerts.” Despite the logistical challenges, these moments also create opportunities for strategic actions by brands and sponsors looking to connect with fans in creative ways and boost in-stadium consumption. Even at the Club World Cup, cooling breaks were sponsored.

“Organizers of the World Cup must be prepared for situations caused by climate change. These require attention to public transportation and safe shelters for fans, but they can also be used to connect with supporters and generate value for sponsors,” says Anderson Rubinatto, CEO of Goolaço, a company specializing in sports events.

During these pauses, the mobile phone becomes the fan's main ally. Statistics and live score apps see spikes in usage while matches are suspended. This window, once viewed only as a problem, is now being seen as an opportunity for real-time digital activations.

Creativity is a key differentiating factor in this scenario. With the support of technology, tools such as QR codes on stadium screens can direct fans to challenges, giveaways, or exclusive content during forced stoppages. Joaquim Lo Prete, national director of Absolut Sport in Brazil, believes the key lies in offering something unique and time-limited.

“It is possible to launch contests, giveaways, or challenges with instant prizes, such as products, discounts, or VIP experiences, accessed through QR codes displayed on stadium screens or during broadcasts. The action must be exclusive to the moment of the interruption. With planning and strong execution, this strategy keeps fans engaged and also stimulates consumption,” he explains.

In the United States, leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and MLS have been dealing with these types of situations for years. While there is no specific federal legislation governing weather-related stoppages, each league follows its own protocols and carries insurance that covers financial losses caused by delays or cancellations.

So-called event cancellation insurance is common and guarantees coverage in the event of unforeseen weather conditions. In addition, policies such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Reauthorization Act help improve weather forecasting and risk monitoring for large-scale events.

Still looking for FIFA tickets? Here's what you need to know

When tickets went on sale for the six FIFA World Cup games being hosted in Toronto next year, Aidan D'Souza and his family were lucky enough to snag a few, but he says it wasn't easy.

They got an email a week before the official ticket draw opened on Nov. 30, he says, asking if they wanted to secure “hospitality tickets.” They accepted, but D'Souza says that was just the beginning.

“We needed to act really quick when getting the tickets because FIFA was actually increasing the price as the day [went] on,” D'Souza said.  “We had 15 minutes once we secured the tickets in our cart. So it was a really intense moment entering all the details in, but I'm just so happy we've secured those three tickets.”

Tickets in Toronto — one of 16 North American host cities for next summer's FIFA World Cup — have sold out about as quickly as they've been released. For most other people looking to check out the action, the resale market is the only option. 

Anyone who's tried to get resale tickets to a major event in recent years will know the pain, frustration and, most of all, cost of the secondary market.

World Cup 2026 ticket presale fiercely competitive for fans

Tickets on StubHub, a popular third-party reseller, have gone for as much as $80,000, and are currently going for over $2,000 a pop at minimum. It's not a new problem — ask any Swiftie about the Eras Tour's Toronto stop and there was the Blue Jays' run to the World Series — and it's made worse by Ontario's resale laws.

In 2019, Doug Ford's government scrapped part of a law that capped ticket resales at 50 per cent above the original price, allowing sites like Ticketmaster, StubHub and SeatGeek to set whatever price they think people will pay.

That's a big issue, leaving low- and middle-income fans on the outside looking in, says Vass Bednar, managing director of the Canadian SHIELD Institute, a policy institute focused on Canada's economy.

Some people, Bednar says, might argue events are commodities and customers should be able to pay thousands for a ticket if that's the value they place on the experience.

Take D'Souza and his World Cup tickets. He says he paid $2,500 each, even though he felt it was steep.

“But honestly, you're paying for the experience, right? Something that might not happen again in Toronto in our lifetime,” D'Souza said.

But Bednar says there's a loud contingent of customers complaining that philosophy “creates a fundamentally inaccessible experience for fans.”

“And it's changing society, right?” he said. “If we're viewing major cultural events, major sporting events, as a luxury good that is only available to the highest bidder, then I think that really says something.” 

It's an issue Ford, backpedalling from 2019, said this year he would like to review. The change of heart came after World Series tickets in Toronto sold out almost immediately, only for resale tickets to pop up for sale shortly after, well above face value.

“My personal opinion … they're gouging the people,” Ford said in October. “We have one player in the market that controls the tickets, that's not right for the people.”

Both Ontario's NDP and Liberals have urged Ford's government to take action. 

Ontario NDP propose ban on ticket resales above face value

The province could look elsewhere for possible solutions. In Quebec, the government has proposed new legislation to protect consumers. Under the bill, resale prices there could not exceed the official seller's original price unless explicitly authorized by the event's producer. 

The United Kingdom has also proposed a ban on reselling tickets above face value.

A spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of Public and Business Services said in a statement the province is looking at “potential issues regarding ticket sales.”

“[I]f the scope of that issue can only be solved by legislation, we will explore what our options are at that time,” said spokesperson Joey Wu in an email, adding anyone concerned Ontario's Consumer Protection Act is being broken should file a complaint with the ministry.

So how does one get World Cup tickets? It's a bit complicated.

Fans can register with FIFA online for the chance to buy hospitality tickets, like D'Souza did, which include food and drink. There's also FIFA's random selection draw, which fans can register for before Jan. 13. Those selected will be notified in February, and their credit cards will automatically be charged. 

After that, FIFA will sell whatever's left, first-come, first-serve.

FIFA recently slashed the cost of a select number of tickets to each game after soccer fans around the world cried foul about exorbitant prices. But those are limited and will be given out by national soccer federations.

FIFA also has its own resale and exchange marketplace, but charges a 15 per cent fee on those transactions.

After a short-lived stint with Diana Shnaider, former world No. 1 Dinara Safina is getting back into the coaching game next season. World No. 104 Polina Kudermetova, the younger sister of former Top 10 singles player and reigning WTA Finals doubles champion Veronika, has reportedly hired the three-time Grand Slam finalist to her coaching team.Safina previously entered into the WTA coaching ranks this past spring for a brief period with Shnaider, who was on the fringes of the Top 10 at the time. The 21-year-old Shnaider hired Safina in April, but they split by May—with Shnaider only saying in Rome that Safina "needed" to return home to Barcelona.But in 2026, she'll be packing her bags to travel with the 22-year-old Kudermetova, who already made headlines this offseason as the latest of nearly a half-dozen Russian players to change nationalities.

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

As Yuki Tsunoda prepares to become a test and reserve driver for Red Bull in 2026, Laurent Mekies has backed the Japanese driver to return to the grid in the future.

Laurent Mekies has opened up on the “very difficult” decision to demote Yuki Tsunoda, with the Red Bull Team Principal voicing his confidence that the Japanese driver could return to the grid in the future.

After Sergio Perez's exit from the squad at the end of 2024, Liam Lawson was promoted to join Max Verstappen at Red Bull – but after two tough opening rounds, the New Zealander returned to Racing Bulls as part of a seat swap with Tsunoda.

It would subsequently prove to be a challenging campaign for Tsunoda, who ended the season in 17th place of the Drivers' Championship with his best finish being a P6 in Azerbaijan.

Ahead of the finale in Abu Dhabi, it was confirmed that Tsunoda will be replaced by Isack Hadjar on the race team in 2026, meaning that the 25-year-old will instead become a test and reserve driver for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls.

Reflecting on the line-up call, Mekies – who previously worked with Tsunoda during his former role as Team Principal of Racing Bulls – admitted that it had not been an easy one to make.

“It has been a very difficult decision to take,” the Frenchman explained. “The second seat in Oracle Red Bull Racing is not an easy one. We have a tough car to drive. And of course, we have tried everything we could to support Yuki.

“At some stage, we had to make the difficult call between where we were seeing that going for the following years. I hope, and I think, that Yuki will get another chance. He will be reserve driver with us next year.”

Mekies went on to explain why he believes that Tsunoda has the qualities required to find his way back to a full-time F1 seat in the future.

“You never know what's going to happen,” the team boss continued. “We have been quite famous in making fairly swift driver decisions in the past.

“I recall one moment – at the end of the 2024 season, Yuki was driving very well. It was very difficult for him to digest. Liam was getting the promotion in Red Bull Racing.

“He went into the winter thinking, was he going to get the chance one day or not? He came back, and we set ourselves with the team at the time the objective to maximise everything – to shoot for the stars. Three races after, he was driving in that Oracle Red Bull Racing team.

“So you never know what the future holds. I'm sure everyone in this room and beyond has experienced setbacks – sometimes hard setbacks. That's a setback for him. But I am confident that he has a lot in him that will allow him to have another opportunity.”

Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has threatened legal action against jazz musician Chuck Redd after Redd canceled his scheduled Christmas eve concert over President Donald Trump's appointed board's decision to rename the venue after himself.


	In a letter obtained by The Associated Press on Friday, Grenell likened Redd's decision to “the sad bullying tactics” by some on the left.


	“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment — explicitly in response to the Center's recent renaming, which honors President Trump's extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure — is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” Grenell wrote. “Regrettably, your action surrenders to the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left, who have sought to intimidate artists into boycotting performances at our national cultural center.”


	Grenell said that the letter served as “official notice” that “we will seek $1 million in damages,” from Redd, calling his nixing of the concert a “political stunt.”

	Redd did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.


	For more than two decades, the Kennedy Center — known formally as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts before all the recent changes — has hosted the Christmas eve Jazz Jam. Redd has led the event since 2006.


	A week prior to the scheduled Christmas eve performance, the center's board of trustees, who were handpicked by Trump, voted unanimously to rename the once venerable institution the Trump Kennedy Center, a controversial (and possibly illegal) decision.

	











	“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd told the AP on Dec. 24.


	Since Trump's self-appointment as Kennedy Center chairman in early February, at least 26 performances have been canceled, including 15 by the scheduled acts themselves. Issa Rae canceled her Feb. 14 show, citing “an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums.” On Feb. 13, Low Cut Connie, the Philadelphia rock and soul band fronted by Adam Weiner, canceled their March 19 concert.

	That following month, Guster protested the changes at the Kennedy Center — which included the cancellation of performances of the LGBTQ+ musical Finn — by having the Finn cast join the band onstage during their concert at the venue.


	The fallout from the changes at the once venerable institution has also affected the schedule for next year. Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jefferey Seller were planning to bring Hamilton to the Kennedy Center in 2026, but canceled the run, saying, “The Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit, and we're not going to be a part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center. We're just not going to be part of it.”

Kris Jenner shared her support of Timothée Chalamet for the release of his new movie. 

Kris posted a photo via Instagram Story Friday of a red and white “Marty Supreme” jacket — the new movie Kylie's boyfriend stars in. 

“Greatest movie ever!!!” the momager captioned the snap, as she tagged Chalamet in the sweet post.

Kris, 70, also posted a photo on Christmas — the day of the film's release — wearing a black and blue “Marty Supreme” jacket. 

Fans turned to social media to discuss the shoutout, as the family has been more open about Kylie, 28, and Chalamet's private relationship. 

“I think we'll be seeing them and Timmy have more interactions,” one fan said.

Another wrote, “He's probably the favorite to win the Oscar this year. Will be interesting to see him and Kylie during awards season this year.”

The support comes as Chalamet was publicly included in the family's Christmas celebrations for the first time since they started dating in 2023. 

The “Marty Supreme” actor's name was iced onto the Kardashian-Jenner's gingerbread house, which has the monikers of all the family members. 

Chalamet's name appeared above his girlfriend's on the roof of the edible home, along with her children, Stormi, 7, and Aire, 3, with ex Travis Scott. 

The tiny detail proves just how solid their relationship is, as the Daily Mail reported in November that the A-list actor had “broken up with Kylie.”

“This has happened before — but she talked him into getting back together,” the insider claimed. “She is crazy about him so that could well happen again.”

A second source at the time claimed that their relationship isn't “completely over.”

“He is filming quite a bit, and she feels that she has to chase him. She is putting in the work more than him,” the insider alleged.

The split speculation continued when Chalamet, 30, skipped out on Kris' 70th birthday party in November. 

Sources shut down breakup rumors to People, claiming the actor was out of the country filming “Dune: Part Three.” 

Kylie proved they are still going strong herself when she accompanied him to the Los Angeles premiere of “Marty Supreme” earlier this month. 

The couple packed on the PDA on the red carpet and matched in coordinating orange looks for the movie premiere.

Wydra breaks down Zosia's final look to Rhea Seehorn's Carol in that cliffhanger season-ender.


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


[This story contains major spoilers from Pluribus's season one finale, “La Chica o El Mundo.”]


Pluribus star Karolina Wydra has a surprisingly glass-half-full take on the ominous ending of season one. Her character, Zosia, may have had to honor Carol Sturka's (Rhea Seehorn) request for an atom bomb, but based on their parting glance, Wydra still senses some indecision from Carol about this manner of escalation. It's a big swerve when you factor how resistant Carol was to Manousos' (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) violent approach to undoing the Joining.

					'Pluribus' Star Rhea Seehorn Breaks Down Carol's Escalation in the Season Finale		
			









	“What [the parting glance] was for me is that maybe there's somehow still a chance [to reconsider]. It's not goodbye forever; it's just, ‘Are you sure about whatever it is that you're doing? Are you sure about the atom bomb? Are you sure about whatever is the next chapter?'” Wydra tells The Hollywood Reporter.


	Zosia and Carol's globe-trotting romance took a dark turn in Big Sky, Montana, when Carol learned that Zosia and the rest of the Joined were nearing completion on another method to turn her into one of them. The revelation recontextualizes the penultimate episode which saw Zosia and Carol consummate their relationship after Zosia and the hive mind rebuilt her once-favorite local diner. Prior to Zosia initiating their first kiss, Carol accused her of manipulation by recreating the beloved haunt that was lost to a fire. She felt they were trying to divert her attention away from restoring the human race. And Seehorn — per her own finale postmortem with THR — now believes that the Joined's scheme to use Carol's frozen eggs to belatedly “join” her confirms that episode eight was all an elaborate seduction, even if there were some lovely qualities to it.

	











	For Wydra, she still takes her character at her word when she says that everything the Joined do is out of love and a desire to make Carol happy.


	“Vince and I talked about how they're not manipulative and Zosia is not sinister,” Wydra says. “So it was just about making sure that she's coming from a place of true honesty and just doing things to be of service to Carol.”


	In episode four, Carol tried to persuade Zosia into revealing how to reverse the Joining, and despite having the inability to lie, Zosia stated, “We can't answer questions like that.” Thus, it's possible that the Joined's programming also won't let them entertain the notion that they're manipulating someone, something Gilligan acknowledged in another finale postmortem with THR. “Can you think of examples in real life where people are manipulating without knowing it? I think the answer is yes,” Gilligan says. “I don't know that the Others are any simpler than human beings in real life.”


	Below, during a conversation with THR, Wydra also discusses the morsels of backstory that Zosia reveals about her pre-Joining self, as well as how the character was rewritten to be Polish like her.


***


In episode three, Zosia fetched Carol a hand grenade, and in the finale, she ups the ante by fetching her an atomic bomb. What was your first reaction to Carol's escalation? 


	Well, what was funny about the grenade is that “we” misunderstood [her sarcasm]. But we didn't want to risk insulting her, so we wanted to make sure that we provided her with what she wanted just in case. But then we realize, “Oh wait, you're messing with us.” With the atom bomb, it's another one of those moments where we will give her whatever she needs and whatever she wants to make sure that she's happy. So when I read it, I said, “Oh! Where are we going to go with this?” (Laughs.) It was fun. 

	











Do you now have some idea of where it's going? 


	No, I don't. I wish. I love that Vince is going to write the [second] season before we'll get to know something. Even with season one, I discovered it as it went along with each episode. We didn't get all of them all at once, so it's really fun that way. What's also great is it doesn't color your performance. What happens in 109, I wonder if knowing that information would've somehow seeped into my subconscious and made Zosia be more, “Ooh, I have a secret.” Vince and I talked about how they're not manipulative and Zosia is not sinister. So it was just about making sure that she's coming from a place of true honesty and just doing things to make Carol happy and be of service to Carol.


The parting glance that Carol and Zosia exchanged as Carol exited the helicopter, were they both basically saying that things are never going to be the same again? 


	That's a great interpretation. What it was for me is that maybe there's somehow still a chance [to reconsider]. “I don't want to say bye at this moment.” It's not goodbye forever; it's just, “Are you sure about whatever it is that you're doing? Are you sure about the atom bomb? Are you sure about whatever is the next chapter?” I think that's what it is, and it's not wanting to let her go because [the Joined] can't be around Manousos. If she goes back home, they have to separate themselves from her. Zosia and Carol were able to go on this epic journey [around the globe] because they were away from Manousos.

	











When you tested with Rhea during casting, you had already received the first couple episodes. But did Vince at least tell you ahead of time that romance was in the cards?


	I don't know if we had that conversation when we tested. He didn't reveal to me where the season was going to go, so I don't think I knew that. And I don't know when I found out, to be honest with you. I wonder if I found out when I got the script [for 108], and we had the conversation about their first kiss and what it means. We had a lot of discussions about that episode. Jonny Gomez, who wrote it, had a version of it. Melissa Bernstein. who directed, had a version of it. Rhea and I both had a version of it, and then Vince had a version of it. So it was really interesting to come together and find what that moment means.


	I don't want to say what it means because I want the audience to have their own interpretation of what [108] is and who Zosia is in that episode and what that kiss means. Is that kiss because Zosia is separating a little bit from the collective? Is she finding a little bit of her personality and individuality within the collective? Or is Zosia just really trying to make Carol happy? Is that kiss something that Zosia thinks Carol needs in that moment?


Prior to the kiss, Carol had just called Zosia out for her diner theatrics because she felt like Zosia was trying to manipulate her. So I think Zosia kissed her as a last-ditch effort to distract Carol from not only her quest to save the world, but also from finding out about Zosia's own scheme to use Carol's frozen eggs to turn her. So my interpretation of episode eight has evolved now that we know about the collective's secret plan to “join” Carol.












	See, I love that that is your interpretation. That's exactly why I can't wait to see the audience reaction to that. If it is that, then Zosia and her world are manipulative and calculated. But are they manipulative? Are they trying to distract Carol? Or is Carol actually trying to distract them from what she's trying to do? Carol is on her own mission.


They're both scheming!


	(Laughs.)


Carol was conscious of her own plotting, but I don't think the Joined's programming allows them to know when they're manipulating someone. When Zosia volunteers some information about the original Zosia being from Gdańsk, Poland, and loving mango ice cream, I now think that was part of an [unconscious] effort to soften Carol and lull her into this false sense of security.


	That's interesting. Again, I love that that's your interpretation of it. I love that we got to see a glimpse of who Zosia was in her past life. She came from poverty. She grew up during a time of scarcity, and this guy [with a cart] took pity on [the neighborhood kids] by giving them leftover ice cream. I thought that was such a sweet moment of connection with Carol. There's a moment where Zosia pauses to think [about her favorite food], and we talked about that moment of pause as Zosia having to separate herself from the collective and go to the memory lane of who Zosia was prior to the Joining. So she has to separate herself from the collective mind to find what that answer is, and then she comes back with that information. I haven't seen the episode yet, but when we were shooting it, there was a moment of excitement, like, “Oh yeah! I like mango!” So, for me, it came from a pure place of connection and sharing of oneself, but I love that you thought it was very manipulative [in hindsight].

	











Did Vince and co. rewrite her to be Polish after they cast you?


	They did a vast casting across the world. Whoever Vince found, the character would've been named after [whatever their background is]. The fake sides had a woman named Anna, and when I got the [first two] scripts, her name was Yara. Then they changed it to Zosia when I got cast. They decided to give her a Polish name, which I thought was pretty cool. I felt very honored. 


Lastly, I want to go back to the end of episode four when Zosia goes into cardiac arrest. It's an especially harrowing moment when you consider that Rhea and a lot of the same crew also experienced a real-life version of that when Bob Odenkirk had to be revived on the Better Call Saul set. The performer who brought Zosia back to life was Rosa Estrada, Saul's healthy and safety supervisor who saved Bob. So could you feel a heaviness on set that day?


	Yeah, for sure. There was melancholy in the air. But was it because the scene brought up their feelings from having gone through that with Bob? I don't know. I think the melancholy and the heaviness also came from having all these extras chanting, “Please, Carol. Please, Carol.” The world was crying. People were in tears everywhere, creating this very eerie feeling. And then pretending to revive me, as Zosia, had a very particular feeling in the air. So I don't know if people were experiencing feelings from the past or the scene itself, but I also think they were extremely exhausted from the summer heat.

	Americans have Black Friday, but in most other parts of the world, Boxing Day (a.k.a. Dec. 26) is the biggest shopping day of the year. And hundreds of retailers are marking the occasion with new sales and discounts, along with end-of-year closeouts.


	Here's what to know about Boxing Day — now stretching into Boxing Week — and how to shop the best deals this year.


	Once reserved as a day for packing Christmas boxes to deliver to people in need, Boxing Day soon became a day where people would open boxes (I.e. their holiday presents) as well. That eventually led to Boxing Day becoming a big shopping day, and it's still common to see lineups for Boxing Day doorbuster deals or limited-time offers.

	In many countries around the world, Boxing Day is a national holiday, with many referring to it as the second day of Christmas.


	Despite the growing popularity of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Boxing Day continues to be big business for retailers in Canada, along with Australia, New Zealand, the UK and other countries in Europe and the Caribbean. New data shows more and more U.S. stores getting in on the Boxing Day buzz this year as well, with retailers using the day to clear excess inventory and off-load goods before new products and pricing come in for 2026. 




	Boxing Day 2025 offers a chance to save big, with some analysts noting that “discounts during Boxing Day are often deeper than regular seasonal sales,” thanks to “extreme markdowns, especially online.” Even better: while it used to just be on Dec. 26, Boxing Day sales have now expanded into Boxing Week sales, offering even more days to save.




Last year's statistics revealed the biggest Boxing Day deals on electronics, clothing, housewares and beauty products, with discounts up to 70% off. Sites like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Nordstrom were among the retailers offering the largest selection of products on sale for Boxing Day.




Other sources say to expect the best deals on women's clothing and “practical categories,” like everyday household items and essentials. Where to find the biggest discounts: look for “overstocked items, discontinued models, or seasonal products that cannot carry over into the next retail cycle.”


	From Amazon to Zappos, here's a look at some of the best Boxing Day deals to shop online this year.

Rob Reiner and his daughter, Romy, shared a special bond that remained strong until his tragic death.

Their time together was horrifically cut short when Romy found the filmmaker and her mother, Michele Singer Reiner, stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14. 

Days later, her troubled brother Nick was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. 

On Saturday, Romy is sadly ringing in her 28th birthday without the legendary director by her side.

Romy described Rob as her “best friend” in a sweet tribute posted on the “All In The Family” alum's birthday in 2022.

“Happy birthday to my other best friend,” she wrote on Instagram at the time, along with several photos capturing their sweet memories. 

On Father's Day last year, Romy expressed how she loves hanging out with the “When Harry Met Sally” writer for hours on end. 

“Happy Father's Day to the man who I could talk to forever and also the man who I can sit in silence with and be perfectly content,” she wrote in the June 2021 post. 

“Love you forever,” she added.

Just weeks before his death, Romy was seen enjoying a family vacation with her dad. 

She shared a slideshow of images and videos on Nov. 29, which captured her with Rob as they went swimming in a tropical location. Romy notably had a big smile as she splashed around with the late Hollywood icon. 

Romy's social media feed isn't just a highlight reel of her family vacations — her Instagram is also filled with candid, funny, and deeply personal exchanges between her and her father. 

Last October, Romy posted an Instagram video in which she was seen cutting her dad's hair while asking him for career advice.

“Since the nepo thing isn't working out, I'm asking my dad for some help in another arena… what do you think?” she captioned the adorable post.

“My career hasn't even remotely taken off,” she said in the clip before jokingly asking if he would be willing to pay for her to get a “Brazilian Butt Lift” surgery to make people take her more seriously.

“I think they'll say, ‘wow, look at her craft,'” she said, to which he replied, “Her craft and her crack.”

The video ended with Rob offering some sage advice, deadpanning, “I would say don't do it, but my feeling is — it's your ass.”

This past May, Romy also recorded a video in which she asks the political activist to discuss “The 3 Rules of Getting Older.” 

He shares his wisdom, telling her, “never pass up a bathroom,” “don't waste a hard-on,” and “never trust a fart.”

Romy and Rob have a hilarious back-and-forth in which they both decide not to further discuss his second rule.

“I don't wanna know about the middle one,” Romy said, to which he replied, “No, I don't think you want to hear about that…This is a father-daughter thing… How much do you need to know about your father's prostate?”

She quickly cuts him off, saying, “No, we're done.”

Romy wasn't just best friends with her dad — they were also neighbors, as she lived right across the street from her parents' home.

Romy and her older brother Jake addressed their gruesome deaths in a heartbreaking statement — without making any mention of their brother Nick.

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” Romy and Jake said in a statement to Page Six on Dec. 17.

“The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience.”

The siblings described Rob and Michele as being more than just parents, calling them their “best friends.”

“We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life,” they wrote. “We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”

A source shared that Romy and Jake are leaning on Michele's sisters as they cope with their “unimaginable loss.” Suzanne and Martine have reportedly “stepped in” to “support” Romy and Jake, an insider told Us Weekly.

“The community has really come together for the family as well, because Rob and Michele had such a huge network of close friends,” the source added. “Everyone just wants to help in any way that they can.”

Romy has also been leaning on Jake, with a source sharing that they are both “numb right now.” 

She and Jake will honor their mom and dad with a memorial service at a later date, their spokesperson told People on Dec. 22.

“Jake and Romy Reiner remain grateful for the outpouring of love and support they have received,” their rep told the outlet.

The beloved couple, who tied the knot in 1989, were cremated, and their remains were returned to their eldest son.

Dolly Parton was lonely when, at age 18, she moved to Nashville as an aspiring singer/songwriter. She missed her parents and 11 siblings. She was also desperately poor — so much so that she sometimes resorted to cruising hotel hallways at night, searching for half-eaten room-service trays waiting to be picked up.

“Even a basically honest person,” she has said, “can do desperate things when hunger begins gnawing at them.”

But there was one bright spot during her early days in the country music capital: Parton had met a local boy at the laundromat.

Carl Dean's good looks struck Parton, as author Martha Ackmann notes in her upcoming biography of the singer, “Ain't Nobody's Fool.” Parton liked that “he seemed more interested in who she was than what she looked like.”

Still, the relationship grew quickly “on his part and slowly on her.” Parton was “smitten” — but when Dean announced that he planned on marrying her, she was “caught off guard.

“She liked Carl more than anyone she had ever dated, but she was intent on getting her career started,” Ackmann writes. “In addition, Dolly had seen the price women paid for marrying early and having a bunch of kids.”

Having helped raise so many of her siblings, she wasn't inclined toward having children of her own. She also didn't see herself as a typical housewife.

Luckily, quiet, well-mannered Dean could cook and sew — and was willing to do the housework.

“They just flipped over each other,” Parton's longtime pal Judy Ogle, who she grew up with in Sevier County, Tennessee, says in the book. “If Clint Eastwood and the Marlboro Man had a kid, it would be Carl.”

There was one big thing Dean and Parton did not have in common. He had absolutely no interest in show business.

Once, he visited his sweetheart in the studio while she was recording 1966's “Dumb Blonde” but quickly left.

“Who wants to listen to the same song being sung over and over?” he reportedly asked.

One of Parton's most iconic songs, “Jolene,” meanwhile, came about after she noticed that a redheaded bank teller appeared to have a crush on Dean and began teasing him about it. (The name, however, came from a little girl who asked Parton for an autograph.)

Both Dean, who owned a paving company, and Parton had conditions for each other: He would never attend a movie premiere or awards show with her. And the singer— fiercely committed to her career — she wouldn't be around to cook and clean.

“She liked his independence and said she needed freedom both in her marriage and as fuel  to her creativity,” Ackmann writes.

They got married in 1966, when she was 20 and he was 23.

While he would sometimes drive her to appearances at the Grand Ole Opry, Ackmann writes, “Carl told Dolly he had no stomach for glitz or a tuxedo. Attention was annoying and intrusive when all he wanted was a private life. Fans ambushed him at the auto parts store, pestered him at ball games, tried to snag an autograph when he ate at the Ponderosa Steakhouse.

“Once when he and Dolly sat down [at a restaurant], fans approached and Carl grumbled. ‘Oh hush, Carl,' Dolly told him. ‘They're after me.'”

Dolly's friend Fred Foster lived near them and told Ackmann that the couple went on camping trips out West and had getaway vacations to Florida. But Dean hated to fly and one “of the couple's favorite pastimes was driving to small towns in the South.”

Foster says “their marriage may seem strange to a lot of people, but they seem[ed] to get along with their style.”

Dean would also secretly visit Dollywood, Parton's theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, near where she grew up. 

“He bought his own ticket — stood in line and got his ticket. He didn't want somebody giving him a ticket ‘cause he was Dolly's husband,” Parton told the Knoxville News-Sentinel.

Parton, meanwhile, proved herself to be a savvy businesswoman who knew her worth.

When Elvis Presley's manager, the infamous Colonel Tom Parker, called to say Presley wanted to record “I Will Always Love You,” Parton — a longtime fan — was overjoyed. Then she found out that Presley only recorded songs for which he owned all or half of the publishing rights.

“As enticing as the offer was,” Ackmann writes, “Dolly understood that maintaining financial control of her property was critical, both as an artist and as a member of a large family” to whom she intended to leave her estate.

It was a gutsy move from a 28-year-old woman going up against the most famous singer in the world.

By the mid-70s, Parton was touring incessantly but not making much money after expenses. Frustrated by the disparity, she flew to New York to meet with label executives.

“When you son-of-a-bitches learn how to sell a female Elton John with long hair and big boobs that dresses like a freak,” she reportedly said, “then we'll make some money.”

As Parton's fame — and wealth — skyrocketed, Dean, who died in March at age 82, remained uninterested he was in her glitzy world. Whenever he was hounded for interviews or a comment on his wife, he stood firm.

“I'll go somewhere, drink some beer, and shoot the bull with you,” he told reporters. “But I am absolutely and positively not going to discuss Dolly.”

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	A vivid $77 million sexual assault and sexual battery lawsuit against Tyler Perry filed by the same lawyer behind a similar action earlier this year is just more of the same in search of a payout, claims the “betrayed” Madea star's high-profile attorney.


	“Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,” Alex Spiro said today of the big-bucks jury-trial-seeking claims from Mario Rodriguez against Perry and “Boo! A Madea Halloween distributor Lionsgate.

					'Pluribus': Vince Gilligan Explains Why John Cena Had To Cameo & Deliver That Big Reveal To Carol		
			








	Spiro, who has successfully repped Alec Baldwin, Jay-Z and many an A-lister over the years with a slugger's approach, is certainly putting forth the narrative of how he wants the Jonathan Delshad-represented Rodriguez's Los Angeles Superior Court case to go down in flames.




			Watch on Deadline		







	There is no denying Rodriguez's suit is similar in tone and format to the ongoing $260 million sexual harassment and assault suit initially filed in June in LASC by Delshad for his client, The Oval actor Derek Dixon, against Perry. At the same time, there is no denying that Rodriguez's 23-page complaint filed December 25 is full of potentially damning text message screen grabs, remarks about oral sex and other suggestive conversation from an allegedly predatory Perry. There are also apparent cringey proclamations by the filmmaker like, “You know Mario, I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner.”

	











	Focusing on the making of Boo! and a number of subsequent meet-ups — such as a November 14, 2018 Beverly Hills dinner at Mastro's Steakhouse to discuss more potential roles for model Rodriguez that saw a cameo of sorts from John Cena — the complaint is also full of graphic and specific details. “Mr. Perry reached into Mr. Rodriguez's underwear and grabbed his penis,” the filing exclaims of an alleged assault eight years ago. “Mr. Perry was making sexual moaning noises and saying, ‘Stay here, stay here,' while he pressed his body against Mr. Rodriguez and continued to grab his penis.”


	Capping off that alleged incident, the filing claims Perry “stuffed $5,000.00 in Mr. Rodriguez's pocket” as the slightly inebriated Rodriguez was waiting for an Uber to take him home from Perry's house. Other alleged attempts by Perry to offer Rodriguez financial security and on-screen roles for what the plaintiff understands to be sex followed up to 2024.


	Claiming “PTSD … psychological, emotional and economic injuries” from Perry's alleged actions towards him, Rodriguez (who did play a “very good looking college student” in 2016's Boo!) and lawyer Delshad have hauled Lionsgate into all this.


	Their argument is disarmingly simple, though with an odd misspelling of the studio's name. “Lions Gate should have known of Perry's misconduct as Perry has had many such allegations made against him in the past,” the complaint states. “But for Lions Gate's failure to act and enforce their morality clauses and other safeguards, the sexual assaults would not have occurred as Perry would not have been in a position of power.”


	Lionsgate, as it is actually spelled, did not respond tonight to Deadline's request for comment on the lawsuit and its place in it.


	In terms of someone who did respond, Spiro may be swinging in defense of his client, but the NYC-based Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan partner is not altogether off the mark with his strong statement. Rodriguez decided to take action with his claims after a Sean “Diddy” Combs-referencing friend texted him on June 18 with news of Dixon's case.


	“Mr. Rodriguez realized that Mr. Perry was continuing to use his power and influence to sexually assault hopeful actors, and, with the voice of others, decided it was time to tell his story, obtain justice, and finally stop Mr. Perry,” this week's filing says. “When Perry became aware that Rodriguez was going to file this action, Perry once again reached out to Rodriguez by text, telling Rodriguez that Perry did so much to help Rodriguez and was that (sic) Perry was feeling betrayed by Rodriguez,” the document adds. 


	Interestingly, with all the text exchanges displayed in Rodriguez's filing, this possibly explosive one is not there to see. 


	Now, to Spiro's slamming of Rodriguez via Delshad and the Dixon matter, it is more nuanced in reality. For instance, the case hasn't actually “failed,” as Spiro claims.


	Delshad's case against Perry for Dixon hasn't exactly nosedived, but it has had an unconventional path through the legal system so far. Filed in LASC in June, the matter was pulled from state court in California and moved to federal court in the Golden State earlier this year. Then Dixon filed to have his case remanded back to LASC. On December 12, a federal judge ruled that Dixon had not proved he had residence in the state and denied the return to state court. A consequence of Judge John Walker's decision was that Dixon's case was then shifted to federal court in Georgia, Perry's home base.

	











	Sitting with Judge Sarah E. Geraghty in the Peach State the past two weeks of this holiday season, Dixon's case hasn't seen much more movement. Which means, once Lady Justice picks up the pace and assuming there is no settlement, 2026 could very likely see Tyler Perry fighting pricey sexual assault cases on two sides of the country.

Discovery!!!!

There's an old saying where I come from that holds true more often than not: “Where there's smoke, there's fire”.

I hope Mr. Perry is innocent, but if not, I hope justice prevails.

The entertainment industry behind the scenes must be really down bad right now for them to keep trying to set up successful  new entrant Tyler Perry up. Classic smear campaign.

Tyler is innocent. Leave him alone. I don't understand why people keep doing this to him. He's done so many wonderful things for the world

No probably not.

Maybe they are doing this to him because he is guilty of what they are accusing him of.

Whether he's innocent or guilty can't be determined by News reports or competing lawyer statements. And his creative work, as strong as it is, is irrelevant to the matter. 

Why would you suggest that his success is conclusive as to non guilt? That lack of intelligent thinking is growing in the world, and it worries me.

“Law & Order” and “FBI” actor Bret Shuford offered a quiet, heartfelt update as he continues treatment following his cancer diagnosis. The 46-year-old shared an Instagram photo on Christmas Day, smiling from his hospital bed beside his husband, Stephen. 

Shuford looked calm and hopeful in a gray Looney Tunes T-shirt and a white Mickey Mouse ear hat, with a nasal cannula visible as he faced the camera. Stephen wore a matching hat and leaned in close, turning the photograph into an emotional holiday moment for the couple. 

“Merry Christmas to all of you! We are so grateful for your love and support! Looking forward to a new year and hope to see you all soon. Sending love!” the caption read.

Support quickly poured in from fans and friends in the comments section. The couple, widely known as Broadway Husbands through their joint account, received an outpouring of encouragement.

“So many hugs and blessings for you guys. Keep the memories of the day in your hearts where they shall remain forever,” one follower wrote.

“We love you and are pulling for you every day!” another added.

Another well-wisher added: “Happy Holidays! Brett, we are thinking of and cheering you on to beat this thing. ❤️”

“Sending love through these tough days,” a third commented.

Earlier this year, Shuford revealed he had been diagnosed with HLH and T-Cell Lymphoma, described as “a rare and life-threatening immune condition, according to his GoFundMe page.

According to a GoFundMe page created by a close family friend, the diagnosis forced Shuford to step away from his graduate studies at the University of Central Florida. 

The health setback arrived as he and Stephen were settling into a new home in Orlando with their young son, Maverick.

“What should have been a season of new beginnings has instead turned into an unexpected battle for health and stability,” the fundraiser states.

As of the writing of this story, the campaign had raised more than 94 percent, totaling $281,576 toward its $300,000 goal.

Last month, Shuford and Stephen looked back on a joyful memory from the previous Christmas, when they celebrated their first holiday season as a family of three. The video showed Shuford holding their son as he and Stephen danced in front of a decorated tree, all three wearing Santa hats.

“Flashback to our first Christmas dance as a family! Excited to all be together again for more holiday fun!” the caption read.

Shuford's television credits include a 2018 appearance on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and a 2023 role on “FBI: Most Wanted.” 

He also stepped behind the camera in 2023, directing an episode of the Emmy-winning Hulu series “Only Murders in the Building,” according to IMDb.

His additional work includes “Disney Royals,” “Disney Animazent Trio IRL,” and “In Rehearsal with… Stranger Things the Musical.”

Shuford and Stephen, who works at Walt Disney World, got married in April 2011.

Get your mind out of the gutter! The sex is hot, but it's the swoony romantic highs and tender insights into queer first love and self-acceptance that make HBO's breakout hit special.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


[This story references plot points from the entire first season of Heated Rivalry, including the finale.]


	Much has been written, including by my THR colleague Seth Abramovitch, about the phenomenal numbers of women devouring Canadian streamer Crave and HBO's sizzling gay hockey series, Heated Rivalry.




	Female viewers appear drawn by the romance and the toned bodies, of course, but also by the entirely consensual nature of the vigorous raunch, the desire for mutual pleasure between partners and the relative absence of macho toxicity. It's not just sex but sensitivity that sells, evidently.

	Episode three perhaps encapsulates that appeal in a few simple words. “Can I fuck you?” asks Scott Hunter (François Arnaud), captain of the New York Admirals. “Absolutely,” replies his new boyfriend, smoothie barista and grad student Kip (Robbie G.K.), with gusto. Later in the episode, as the relationship accelerates, Kip makes the same request of Scott with a smile; the hockey star lights up as he responds with the exact same affirmative and they dive onto the bed.


	I'm thrilled that the ladies are getting a kick out of Jacob Tierney's addictive series based on the novels by Rachel Reid, I really am. There's no territoriality here.


	Sure, I've been known to scowl when the Provincetown ferry dumps packs of Boston bachelorettes onto the wharf and they flood Commercial Street in their crooked tiaras, drunkenly squealing, “Omigod, the gays are so much fun!” Or when they stagger up to male couples and slur, “You guys are so cute! Can we get a selfie with you?”

	











	I believe I speak for many queer men when I say we were not put here for your amusement. But there's a world of difference between cultural intrusion and cultural appreciation. So if women want to experience the sexual and emotional frisson of a show about gay hockey players rattling the closet doors while fucking like bunnies, I say “All are welcome” — to quote fabulous gay icon Tangina from Poltergeist.


	But so much attention to female fandom — “wine moms,” as Tierney affectionately calls them — risks overshadowing what a bountiful gift Heated Rivalry is to the gays. That becomes increasingly apparent as each successive episode taps into richer veins of queer experience concerning the fight between desire and self-denial.


	Whether you're a gay teenager nervously inching toward self-acceptance, a voracious twink trawling the hookup apps or a comfortably coupled LGBTQ elder casting a wistful backward glance at that intoxicating time of liberating discovery, this emotionally nuanced, endearingly big-hearted — and yes, sexy AF — show will strike chords.


	The sexual candor, hot bodies and steamy action are the main attraction. Duh. But what sneaks up on you is the sweetness with which Heated Rivalry captures a transitional time in gay men's lives, a time that can be terrifying or freeing, isolating or joyfully communal — or sometimes all those things at once.


	The principal narrative thread follows Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams), star player of the Montreal Metros; and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), a Russian hockey rink dynamo recruited to lead the Boston Raiders. (All the teams are fictional, though modeled on self-evident real-world NHL counterparts.)

	











	The attraction between them — and the sexual chemistry of the actors — is obvious from the start in lingering glances, locked eyes and a sweaty post-workout interlude in a hotel gym, one of the sexiest scenes in recent memory even if nothing more intimate happens than fingers brushing as a squeeze bottle is shared.


	It's months in narrative time though minutes in screen time until they first get naked and go at it together — following a horny shower scene that launched a double-butt meme for the ages. Their clandestine encounters, evolving over years in secrecy whenever they find themselves in the same city as their fame continues to rise, grow more physically urgent but also more anxiety-inducing. When lust makes way for deeper feelings, things get more complicated than just coordinating hotel rendezvous.


	The hyper-masculine world of professional sports is its own thing, and for countless athletes past and present, a uniquely intimidating arena in which to navigate coming out — or staying in hiding. But most of us can relate to varying degrees.


	The closet is a place of fear and loneliness, in which surging hormones collide with the terror of stigmatization, of rejection by family, friends, colleagues. For those of us who go back far enough to recall a time of minimal cultural representation and legislative rights, the memory will always be raw.


Heated Rivalry captures that limbo state with compassion and tenderness. Since sex is the language through which Shane and Ilya get to know each other, the series forgoes the usual “will they or won't they?” coyness to build tension around more delicate questions: Will their relationship progress to the next level or will it hit a wall? Who's going to say “I love you” first? Will they ever use each other's first names? Are they going to be exposed?

	











	Tierney deftly amplifies that suspense by stoking their reputations as fierce competitors on the ice and even in private. Playful teasing initially allows them to keep their guards up.


	Ilya, whose chilly family life in Moscow, with a stern, impossible-to-please father and a leech of a brother, has contributed to his sharp-edged manner, hides behind his cocky swagger, repeatedly reminding Shane that he's “boring.” Mixed-race Shane — more openly vulnerable and socially awkward, his career micro-managed by his loving but laser-focused Japanese Canadian mother (Christina Chang) — informs Ilya more than once that he's “an asshole.”


	There's a wrenching private moment in an elevator after Adorable Baby Keanu, sorry, I mean Shane, pulls away and we see how much his romantic yearning is hurting him. The brief scene hits acute notes of impossible love and inevitable heartbreak. (We've all been there.) But ultimately, it's smoldering tough guy Ilya who cracks first, confessing his feelings during a phone call — in Russian — that represents a major breakthrough in emotional transparency for the character, even if Shane doesn't understand a word of it.


	After reeling us in with two opening episodes entirely centered on the Shane-Ilya connection, Tierney turns the tables in episode three by abruptly shifting to Scott, a character previously observed only in passing, and Kip, the only one of the four principals who is out and at ease with who he is.

	











	The strategy behind that plot detour becomes clear at the end of episode five, when the Admirals win the NHL cup. Scott has endured the crushing loss of Kip, for whom being kept in hiding was suffocating. But as his teammates' loved ones pile onto the rink to share in the victory, Scott beckons a confused Kip down from the stands, locking him in a passionate kiss in front of the crowds and TV cameras in an ESPN money shot.


	That wordless declaration is a soaring moment that's almost corny in its romantic rapture. It's a scene familiar from the emotional climaxes of innumerable movies and TV shows as obstacles crumble and exultant love reigns, though it's seldom afforded to queer couples. And damned if it's not a ravishing thrill, given an extra kick by the shock and confusion on the unsuspecting faces of Shane and Ilya, watching the championship game on TV in different parts of North America.


	Scott's bold move galvanizes them both, prompting Ilya to accept Shane's invitation to join the Montreal player at his secluded lakeside cottage. The two-week summer interlude provides a gorgeous payoff for the series as awkwardness transitions into the kind of relaxed physical intimacy, domesticity and rewarding companionship — with lots of hot sex — that the two men have probably never even allowed themselves to imagine.


	Potential problems arise, such as how they sustain their relationship without jeopardizing their hockey careers, or what happens when Shane's father stops by and catches them mid-smooch. Sure, there will be challenges ahead, but the simple fact that they tackle these questions together makes nothing seem insurmountable.

	











	Plenty of other TV shows have charted the rocky paths of love between gay men — Queer as Folk, Looking and Heartstopper, to name three prominent examples. But the combination of sex-positivity and swoony romantic wish-fulfillment makes Heated Rivalry hugely satisfying, taking it far beyond the notion of “Canadian gay hockey smut,” as it's been reductively called.


	Perhaps it was inevitable that female viewers would respond to a series not only rejoicing in man-on-man love but also expressing gratitude for the precious lifeline of friendships between women and gay men, in which the absence of sexual tension can make way for a unique kind of intimate understanding.


	With disarming generosity of spirit, Tierney and Reid give their characters fortitude through female besties who intuit their desires, often before they themselves can take ownership of them.


	Bisexual Ilya's occasional fuck buddy Svetlana (Ksenia Daniela Kharmalova) knows everything there is to know about hockey and everything there is to know about her friend's heart. Movie star Rose Landry (Sophie Nélisse), with whom Shane falls into a romance that sparks more excitement on the gossip sites than it does in him, cements what seems destined to remain a beautiful friendship when she gently informs him that as a couple, they are trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. In a glorious moment of what can only be described as Bottom Pride, Shane confesses, “The thing is, I kinda prefer being the hole rather than the peg.”

	











	Kip has not one but two bosom buddies. His colleague at the smoothie shop, Maria (Bianca Nugara), can cram a full hilarious spectrum of approval into the word “Girl!” every time Scott stops by for his regular blueberry and banana blend. And Kip's closest pal Elena (Nadine Bhabha) is like a glam guardian angel, looking out for his emotional safety — and even Scott's — with the protectiveness of a devoted big sister.


	In those relationships as much as the slow-burn romances, Heated Rivalry is speaking directly to women. But let's not understate what a tonic the show is for queer audiences.


	Only one gay friend out of many who have been watching has expressed reservations, complaining that the hockey scenes are unconvincing. I rolled my eyes and gave the only suitable response: “Bitch, no one is watching that show for the hockey.”

Toby Morton, a 'South Park' alum, has been cleverly buying up domains of mostly right-wing politicians, then satirizing their motivations, policies and the way power repackages itself.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	A former South Park voice-over actor and writer turned online activist who has been purchasing the web domain names of mostly Republican politicians and action groups, is sharing news about his latest project after he made a prescient move in snatching up two Trump Kennedy Center domains months ahead of the president's naming overhaul of the national arts institution. 


	Toby Morton's career in satirical comedy started when he loaned his voice to the long-running hit series back in the early aughts as Eric Cartman's red-headed foil, Scott Tenorman; as Morton tells The Hollywood Reporter, this led to some consulting work with the series and he then moved between a range of projects, script rewrites, punch-ups, and development work across different productions. He also found a more politically motivated way to spend his time around 2019, when he began buying political domains as a means of pre-meddling in the politics of the right. The first ones he bought were tied to Devin Nunes and Lauren Boebert, he recalls; the latter made the biggest legal threat, so far, but nothing much can come in a battle against settled “fair use.”

	“It began as a kind of absurdist experiment: What happens if you take the branding of powerful or loud political figures and simply tell the truth through it?” he posited. [The intent] is to use humor and discomfort to comment on how easily institutions and names can be co-opted for spectacle.”

	Earlier this year, it became crystal clear to Morton what was about to happen when President Trump began eyeing the 


	“As soon asTrump began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year, I thought, ‘Yep, that name's going on the building,'” Morton told The Washington Post, which was first to report on Morton's domain game earlier this week. “The rest followed on schedule.”


	On Dec. 18, Trump's handpicked Kennedy Center board voted to change the name of the Washington arts institution to the Trump-Kennedy Center. It came out after the fact that Rep. Joyce Beatty, who serves in ex officio capacity on the Kennedy Center board, had her phone line muted during the meeting. The following day, Trump's name was added to the building's facade, the latest in the president's efforts to make a permanent or at least long-lasting mark on the nation's capital and its institutions. But if Morton has his way, this won't come as easily online. 


	Morton's Substack bio presents what he's up to precisely, as he lists that he's into “buying up fascists' domain names and building anti-fascist websites.” He makes his intentions clear here, too, stating that he's the “founder of the First Church of Petty Digital Revenge.” Clearly, he knows how to weaponize satire for political purposes. He's also been at this for six years, and in that time has not only had fun satirizing politicians but also initiated real political change. 

	











	“The one that had the biggest real-world impact was MomsForLiberties.com,” he tells THR. That site absolutely broke through the noise. It didn't just get attention; it helped shift public awareness during the 2023 school board races and, in many places, contributed to keeping extremist candidates out of local power. That's when it became clear this wasn't just satire anymore; it was actually doing something.”


	Moms for Liberty, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is a “far-right organization” that engages in “anti-student inclusion activities” that self-identifies as part of the modern parental rights movement. The group grew out of opposition to public health regulations for COVID-19, opposes LGBTQ+ and racially inclusive school curriculum, and has advocated for book bans, the SPLC indicates. 


	On Morton's website, the homepage introduction reads: “We are an extremist organization that prides itself on making sure that freedom of speech and choice only applies to those who believe gays are demonic, Hitler actually wasn't that bad so Jews should stop overreacting, any transgender are considered trash and need to be disposed of, current teachers in this society should be under the control of fascists who know better, and that any teachers who disobey deserve to be handled by any means necessary and this includes physical control.”


	So what does the Trump-Kennedy Center have in store for the two websites, which Morton has parked with GoDaddy? Morton says it will be part of an ongoing satirical project “examining political branding and the way power repackages itself.” Trump and the GOP should not take these moves personally and exercise caution before labeling Morton another leftist activist who has gotten in their way; he says his politics is neither on the left or the right —  just like the reaction so far to his “fair use” moves to capture these domains and bend the names to his will, has been “loud, fast, and split right down the middle.”

	











	“I'm not really on any side,” Morton says. “I don't trust politicians as a class, and I don't think any party has a monopoly on truth or integrity. My views have evolved into a kind of healthy skepticism; if you're in power, you're fair game. That's why I don't see what I do as partisan so much as corrective. Everyone's ripe for a website.”

	While Avatar: Fire and Ash is already halfway to $1B worldwide in its first week, James Cameron has a contingency plan in place for his massive franchise.


	The 3x Oscar winner teased his plans for Avatar 4 and 5 after the third installment's premiere, noting that he will “hold a press conference” if he decides not to continue the movie franchise, which began in 2009.


	“I don't know if the saga goes beyond this point. I hope it does,” he told Entertainment Weekly. “But, you know, we prove that business case every time we go out.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Cameron added, “Here's what it is. If we don't get to make 4 and 5, for whatever reason, I'll hold a press conference and I'll tell you what we were gonna do. How's that?”

	











	The writer/director also noted that, despite there being “no business model for it anymore,” Cameron also wants to novelize the films, noting “it might be good to have the canonical record of what it was all supposed to be.”


	Following Fire and Ash‘s Dec. 19 premiere, the third entry in the Avatar franchise has grossed $153.6M domestically over the holiday week, already breaking multiple box office records.


	Despite already filming some scenes for Avatar 4, Cameron previously said on Deadline's Behind the Lens of the possibility of another film, “I always say ‘if,' but will it be profitable enough, and only we will know that.”

I don't wish people failure but I JUST want to understand the Avatar series and I can't seem to. I've studied film and worked in television my whole life at this point. I understand his whole filmography and revere the man. I The actors are great, the story is epic, but I just don't understand Avatar. I feel like I have a gap in my understanding of film and it makes me sad.

Man I sure hope so. He said everything unique about this world in the first Avatar and should move onto something new.

So Avatar 1 cost $220m, Avatar Way Of Water €350m. What's the official line on how much Avatar 3 has cost, without advertising?

He will hold a press conference anyway, declaring Avatar 3 a massive success and one of the highest grossing films of his career, and that Avatar 4 and 5 are now in active development.

	The legal battle involving Jane's Addiction and frontman Perry Farrell has come to an end. According to court documents obtained by People Friday, bandmates Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, and Stephen Perkins settled their lawsuit against Farrell following their infamous onstage fight in 2024.


	The Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, dismissed the lawsuit, originally filed in July, on Monday, Dec. 22.


	The dismissal also arrives about a week after Farrell issued a public apology to his bandmates over the incident, accepting that he “didn't handle myself the way I should have.”


	“Jane's Addiction has been at the center of my life for decades. The band, the songs, the patrons, and the impact that we've had on music and culture mean more to me than any words I could ever possibly write down,” Farrell wrote at the time. “My aim has always been to give our audience the best possible show, something real, honest and positive. In Boston, we fell short of that, and I'm truly sorry to everyone who was impacted.”

	Jane's Addiction also shared a statement of their own, saying that the band “unilaterally determined it would be best to not continue the tour,” adding that they “made inaccurate statements about Perry's mental health, which we regret.”


	The band wrapped its note by confirming the end of the group: “Jane's Addiction will forever live in our hearts. We are proud of the music we created together.”

	Navarro, Avery, and Perkins originally accused Farrell of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The suit alleged that the group lost over $10 million as a result of the tour's cancellation and cessation of all band activities.

	











	Reps for Farrell and the band did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is expanding both her family and her place in history.

The 28-year-old political figure revealed via Instagram on Dec. 25 that she and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, 60, are expecting their second child—a baby girl due in May 2026. The couple are already parents to 17-month-old son Niko, born in July 2024.

“The greatest Christmas gift we could ever ask for — a baby girl coming in May 2026,” Leavitt wrote in the heartwarming post. “My husband and I are thrilled to grow our family and can't wait to watch our son become a big brother. My heart is overflowing with gratitude to God for the blessing of motherhood, which I truly believe is the closest thing to Heaven on Earth.”

Leavitt shared the announcement alongside festive photos of herself posing in front of a Christmas tree in a white sweater dress, gently cradling her baby bump.

Followers quickly took to the comments to share congratulations and well wishes with one writing, “OMG!!! Merry Christmas and congrats!!!! What a blessing” and another adding, “Congratulations! Exciting for you and your family. Know that you'll be missed during your mat leave.”

Leavitt's sister-in-law Kara Leavitt also expressed her excitement, commenting, “Another beautiful baby blessing our family 🩷🩷 can't believe we will have a little girl to spoil !! 🙏🏼”

According to a senior White House official who spoke with Fox News Digital, Leavitt will continue serving in her high-profile role throughout her pregnancy. The move makes her the first sitting White House press secretary to remain in the position while expecting.

In a statement to Fox, Leavitt also thanked her colleagues for fostering what she described as a “pro-family environment” inside the administration.

“Nearly all of my West Wing colleagues have babies and young children, so we really support one another as we tackle raising our families while working,” she said.

According to People, Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, got engaged during the 2023 holiday season after three years of dating. The couple welcomed their first child the following summer, with Leavitt returning to the campaign trail for Trump's 2024 presidential shortly after giving birth.

The couple recently celebrated their son's first birthday in July 2025, with Leavitt posting a heartfelt tribute on Instagram. 

“Today my sweet, happy, sensitive, funny, and handsome baby turned one. What a year it has been. There are no words to describe how much I love this little boy,” she captioned the post, adding, “I thank God every day for making me his mommy. Happy 1st Birthday, my beautiful son. Mama and Dada love you so much.”

Maxton Hall and The Culpables have set streaming alight, smashing viewing records and bringing in a prized younger demo. As the influence of BookTok and the social chatter around key titles grows, a raft of young adult and Wattpad titles are set for the film and TV treatment in 2026.


	We run the rule over what's cooking for 2026 and dish up a tip sheet for the year ahead. It's safe to say, love is in the air. So is horror and the paranormal.


Whose House? Ron's House


	Mercedes Ron is a Wattpad star writer, so much so that Prime Video has created a ‘House Of Ron' brand for all of the upcoming film and series interpretations of her novels. Ron's Culpables series has defined the modern era of Wattpad adaptations, and in Culpa Mia (My Fault), Culpa Tuya (Your Fault) and Culpa Nuestra (Our Fault) have delivered Prime a hit franchise.

Ivory & Ebony Wrapped


			Watch on Deadline		







	Two Enfrentados movies are coming, based on Ron's two-book series. Marfíl (Ivory) and Ébano (Ebony) are made by Pokeepsie Films, which produced the Culpables trilogy and they tell us they are taking things up a level with the new movies. Ester Expósito (Élite) plays Marfil, the daughter of a Spanish tycoon whose NYC lifestyle is shaken after she is kidnapped and then released. Hugo Diego García (The Substance) is Sebastian, who is recruited as her bodyguard. The two movies were filmed back-to-back and shooting took place in Spain and New York.


Boulevard Of Forbidden Romance












	The first three of Flor M. Salvador's ‘Boulevard' series have racked up over 140M reads on Wattpad, and a fourth instalment is on the way. Hopes are high for the movie adaptations, with Sony Pictures and Webtoon making the features. The first movie, Boulevard, is in production in Spain with a screenplay from the pen of YA author Javier Ruescas. The books trace the forbidden romance between high school students Halsey Weigel and Luke Howland. She knows she should stay away from Luke, but is inexplicably drawn to him, seeing beyond the damaged exterior that everyone else is quick to judge.


Running Hot: Chasing Red


Chasing Red is filming in AlUla, Saudi Arabia, and is another much-anticipated Wattpad movie adaptation. Based on Isabelle Ronin's novel, the plot turns on a straight-A student, Veronica, who refuses to be college heartthrob Caleb's latest conquest…despite the undeniable chemistry between them. Circumstances see Veronica end up under Caleb's roof, and secrets unravel in the slow-burn romance. Madelaine Petsch (The Strangers) and Gavin Casalegno (The Summer I Turned Pretty) have signed on as the leads. Mackenzie Munro directs from Lauren Schacher's screenplay. Stampede Ventures produces alongside Wattpad Webtoon Studios.


Three's A Charm: Third Shift Society


	Flipping the script from webnovel to webcomic, and romance to paranormal, is Third Shift Society. Another one from Wattpad Webtoon Studios, Rehab Entertainment and the Jim Henson Company are also on board the adaptation of Meredith Moriarty's title. It is being worked up as a supernatural series with Ray Utarnachitt (DC's Legends of Tomorrow) on writing detail. The story follows Ellie whose world is upended when she meets paranormal detective Ichabod, who may hold answers to her psychic powers. The pair investigate paranormal mysteries involving ghosts, vampires, witches, demons, and more.


Something's Wrong In Stagtown


	Another webcomic adaptation in the works is Stagtown, with Benjamin Brewer, Lead VFX Artist on Everything Everywhere All at Once, writing and directing, and Margot Robbie's Lucky Chap Entertainment and Wattpad Webtoon Studios producing. Comic artist Punko created ‘Stagtown', and Brewer will bring it to life as a live-action movie. The webcomic follows Frankie, Jeremy, and Felix as they discover something is terribly wrong in the town of Stagtown and attempt to escape the horrors that the residents ignore.


From The Heart: Love Me Love Me


	June White moves to Italy for a fresh start after her brother's death. At her new elite school, she is drawn to James, a dangerous bully involved in clandestine MMA fights, but then begins dating his best friend, Will. That's the set-up for Love Me Love Me, an Italian YA movie, based on the first novel in the four-book series from Stefania S, and which has notched 23M-plus views. Prime Video has talked up the global appeal of the picture, which starts streaming in early 2026.


Drive Get Into Gear


	Tamara Lush has been one of Wattpad's most popular writers for some time and has finally landed her first feature adaptation with her 2022 Wattpad original, Drive. The story follows a young female race-car mechanic who pretends to be engaged to the most scandalous racing star in the scene – officially for his reputation, but secretly to get her own chance behind the wheel. Soon the lie threatens to destroy everything, including what has long since become more than just a game. Amazon has teamed with Bavaria Fiction to adapt the webnovel, which Karsten Guenther is producing, Chris Silber and Malina Nwabuonwor wrote the screenplay, and Sergej Moya is directing. The film is set for a 2026 release.

	











Bad Boy's Girl On The Starting Grid


	Spanish filmmaker Marçal Forés began shooting his latest feature, Bad Boy's Girl, in early December. The film is adapted from the hugely popular Wattpad novel series of the same name, written by Blair Holde. The movie is a co-production between Italy and Spain with Lotus Production and Diamond Films España on board. The story follows Tessa O'Connell, who has only two goals for senior year: to keep her head down, and to get over the heartbreak of seeing her longtime crush date her ex-best friend.

The research is mounting up that we might not be alone in this big wide world

Whether it's giant war-mongering spaceships, green humanoid Martians, or creepy beings slithering across uncharted planets, science fiction has painted a very particular image when it comes to aliens.

But while you might think it takes a tin-foil-wearing conspiracy theorist to believe in such life outside of Earth, many highly distinguished scientists are believers too.

In fact, when surveyed, 86.6 per cent of astrobiologists recently said they either agreed or strongly agreed that extraterrestrial life likely exists somewhere else in the Universe. 

When asked the same question but for complex or intelligent life, the agreeing percentage only drops to 58.2 per cent. More believe than don't.

So, what do these scientists know that we don't know? And why are they so sure we're not alone in this Universe?

There is nothing special or remotely unique about Earth or humanity. That's not our opinion – that's the overarching idea of the Copernican principle. This is the belief that, while we often see Earth as superior, it is no more special than any other planet.

But what does that have to do with aliens? Well, many who study extraterrestrial life believe that Earth's habitable state, combined with the development of diverse intelligent life, is a sign that the same is possible elsewhere. And given the sheer scale of the cosmos, some scientists argue the question isn't if aliens exist, but where.

For instance, our galaxy contains somewhere between 100 and 400 billion stars. Astronomers have already confirmed around 4,000 planets orbiting other stars – and that's in our galaxy alone. The Milky Way itself is just a tiny fraction of the observable Universe, about one millionth of it.

Scale that up, and you're looking at roughly 100 sextillion stars (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) – each potentially hosting planets.

That's an incomprehensibly large number. For instance, it's not that there's likely more planets in the Universe than grains of sand on Earth, but 13.33 billion times more. With odds like that, it feels almost inevitable that at least one of them has given rise to intelligent alien life.

“We now know that most stars have a planetary system. That means there are loads of places where life can arise. Besides, simple life arose so quickly on Earth. To me, that's a key sign that it must be happening elsewhere,” says Mike Garrett, chair of astrophysics at the University of Manchester.

And it's not just the sheer number of planets that makes alien life seem plausible – it's what they're made of. The basic ingredients for life are more common than you might think. 

Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen – the elements that make up living things on Earth – have all been detected on comets, asteroids and distant worlds. Astronomers have also identified many planets where water, another key ingredient, is present.

Take KOI-5715.01 – an exoplanet around 3,000 light-years from us. The name might not sound catchy, but this world is one of the most Earth-like we've found so far.

It's a similar size to our planet, sits in a habitable temperature range, and shows signs of water – making it a prime candidate in the hunt for alien life.

We can also turn to Earth as a sign that life can thrive in places once thought impossible. From acidic hot springs to deep-sea vents and the frozen Antarctic, a host of recently discovered 'extremophiles' show that living organisms can adapt to far harsher conditions than a mild, Earth-like planet.

Giant tube worms, for example, thrive in the pitch-black depths of the ocean, clustered around hydrothermal vents that spew out scalding, mineral-rich water at temperatures of up to 350 °C.

Despite the intense heat, crushing pressure and complete absence of sunlight, these worms form vast colonies, relying on symbiotic bacteria to turn the vent's chemicals into energy.

Even more extreme is Deinococcus radiodurans, a microbe whose name roughly translates to “terrible radiation-surviving berry”. 

This bacterium can endure radiation levels thousands of times higher than what would kill a human, shrugging off conditions that would sterilise most known life.

It has been found surviving not only in radioactive waste sites but also in the vacuum of space during experiments on the International Space Station.

"When the Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, at first its surface was hellishly hot. Flowing oceans of magma covered the Earth's surface, creating an inhospitable environment for life. And yet, life arose as soon as the terrain cooled," says Douglas Vakoch, author and founder of METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), an organisation researching communication with alien life.

"Once life arose on Earth, it spread everywhere. The same evolutionary principles that allow life to adapt on Earth should operate throughout the Universe, creating exotic alien lifeforms unlike anything that we can imagine."

Even if alien life is out there, part of the challenge is finding it. For example, if you dedicated each member of the human race to search for aliens, every person would have to explore 13,000 planets.

While that has remained challenging for years, scientists believe that it is becoming easier to find the signs that would show an alien world is inhabited.

“We're in a much better position to discover it now than we were five years ago. Everything is going in the right direction for detection. Especially for the detection of techno-signatures (a measurable signature that shows evidence of past or present technology on a planet),” says Garrett.

“Advancements in computing, digitisation, and artificial intelligence mean that we are moving very rapidly towards alien detection because the technology improves so fast now.”

Vakoch agrees. "In the next 20 years, we'll have telescopes that can scan the atmospheres of planets that orbit stars as we search for signs of life," he says.

"When the European Space Agency's ARIEL mission (a plan to observe and study 1000 exoplanets) launches in 2029, we'll have much greater capabilities to discover life through the chemical byproducts that life inevitably gives off."

So if aliens likely exist out there, why haven't we discovered them yet? And why have we never received any extraterrestrial visitors? Welcome to the Fermi Paradox.

Over lunch way back in 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi threw out an intriguing question to his colleagues about extraterrestrials: “Where are they?” If intelligent life is common in the galaxy, Fermi argued, then Earth should already have been visited many times over.

It was a question that cut straight to the heart of the matter – and one scientists are still wrestling with today. Entire libraries of theories have been written to explain it, but some think the real answer could be surprisingly simple: a Universe big enough to host life is also big enough to hide it.

"Life on Earth – especially the rise of macroscopic, complex life – required a series of extremely unlikely coincidences regarding the composition and nature of Earth and its surface," says Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. 

“After all of that, Earth then required a series of extremely unlikely evolutionary innovations to occur. Those odds are already pretty small, but then you throw in the fact that the nearest aliens could be very far away.”

In other words, if life did exist elsewhere, we might just never be able to find it. Humans have inhabited Earth for a couple of hundred thousand years, which, in the grand scheme of the Universe, is short. We've only been around for 0.000002 per cent of its entire history.

Other intelligent civilisations could have come and gone, or are in the early stages of development. For us to discover life outside of Earth, many events need to occur at the same time.

“Science is inherently sceptical. We want proof – and so far, there's no direct proof of life beyond Earth,” says Vakoch. “But a few decades ago, the same was true for planets orbiting other stars. We thought they might exist, but we couldn't see them.”

That changed in the 1990s, when the first exoplanets were confirmed. Today, astronomers have discovered thousands, proving that other worlds are not only possible but abundant. “To find them, astronomers first had to believe they were out there,” Vakoch adds. “Then they did the hard work of uncovering them.”

For many researchers, alien life feels like it's at the same stage exoplanets once were: strongly suspected, but still unseen. The tools to detect it are improving, but the breakthrough could take decades – or longer.

But who knows, maybe somewhere billions of light-years away, on an incredibly distant planet, an intelligent lifeform is sitting contemplating the thought: "Are we alone in the Universe?"

Home»News»Sister Midnight ending explained: Is Radhika Apte's Uma a supernatural vampire or a psychological 'misfit'?»

Sister Midnight follows Uma's transformation from a repressed bride into a feral monster. By killing her husband and rejecting social norms, she reclaims her power and defies the patriarchy.

Last Updated: 07.40 PM, Dec 27, 2025

Sister Midnight defies genre conventions as it examines home confinement, feminine wrath, and the concretisation of "misfit," directed by Karan Kandhari and starring Radhika Apte. The film, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and saw its theatrical release in 2025, examines a woman's mental collapse as she is pushed to the periphery of urban society via the lens of a dark comedy-horror.

Dive into the versatile filmography of Radhika Apte by streaming the suspenseful Ahalya, the impactful Pad Man, and the intense Sister Midnight—all available now with a single subscription on OTTplay Premium.

Arranged marriage foundation

A woman named Uma (Apte) from a small town is married to a man named Gopal (Ashok Pathak) from a crowded Mumbai "kholi" (shack) in an arranged marriage. Many people wonder about Uma's transformation and whether the events in the film are real or imagined, particularly after the ending.

In Sister Midnight, the first act sets forth the oppressive reality of Uma's new existence. Unskilled in the kitchen and surrounded by critical neighbours, she struggles to keep herself and her family fed and hydrated due to her husband's inebriation and frequent absences. She experiences deep seclusion until a crucial event at her cousin's wedding. The unfortunate Uma gets bitten by a mosquito—or "vampire fly"—as she vents her frustration at a bug zapper.

The Metamorphosis

After this happens, Uma becomes even more savage and unfriendly. She goes from eating little birds to biting a goat on the street as her intolerance to sunlight and appetite for raw meat escalate. This change embodies her fierce defiance of the "docile housewife" stereotype. Instead of allowing the city to overwhelm her, Uma begins to absorb all the life surrounding her.

During an unexpectedly intimate moment between Uma and Gopal, the storyline takes a dramatic turn. They try to have sex after months of uncomfortable silences and pent-up stress. Uma bit Gopal to death while performing because her wild side takes control.

Severing of social ties

Uma enters a time of surreal grieving instead of escaping or disposing of the body immediately. While Gopal's body decays, she tries to keep up the home illusion by decorating it with marigolds and fairy lights. This scene emphasises Uma's inner struggle: she feels she has no place in human society, yet she holds on to the one person who represents humanity. Uma completes the process of cutting off all ties to social "normalcy" by killing a nosy neighbour who finds the body.

Uma begs a band of trans women (hijras) for assistance in the last act, and they help her cremate Gopal outside the city. Thereafter, she takes momentary solace in a Buddhist temple. This part is essential since it provides a counterpoint to the Mumbai shantytowns. The women have likewise "opted out" of conventional domesticity, but they've done it via spiritual tranquillity rather than savage aggression; Uma is welcomed without criticism in the monastery.

Reclaiming the "monster" identity

Nevertheless, upon her return to her hometown, Uma's history finds her. With the help of a priest and a police officer, she discovers a group of her neighbours plotting to torch her house and label her a "daayan" (witch). Uma chooses to believe the story they've made up about her instead of battling or begging for her life. She frightens the audience into submission as she emerges before them, her smeared black lipstick adding to her terrible, gaunt presence. Adopting the moniker "monster" grants her the authority that "humanity" had previously denied her.

At the end of the film, Uma boards on a train and heads towards the Himalayas. On the train, she assumes the role of the titular Sister Midnight by donning all-black attire and black spectacles.

Final imagery

The final shot, depicting hallucinations of vampire lambs behind the train, suggests multiple interpretations. Uma is no longer striving to embody the roles of a housewife or a neighbour. She has transformed into her "undiluted" self-image. The lambs stand for her "children" or the victims from her past, such as the birds and goats. The spectres of her wild deeds stick with her even as she starts over. The lambs' cyclical nature has led some to speculate that they represent either a dormant feral pregnancy or the persistence of her "pack" in a different setting.

Sister Midnight employs the "vampire" stereotype as a commentary on the marginalisation of the marginalised, not solely for classic horror purposes. People who live in the shadows of the city, like Uma, are like the transgender community and the homeless. The film implies that Uma's situation calls for a woman to transform into a "monster" to gain genuine control over her life. She instead opts to "rot loudly" rather than fade into oblivion as a subservient widow.

Legend is born

A reference to an Iggy Pop song in the title further suggests a defiant, nighttime personality. By the conclusion, Uma has transformed from an arranged marriage victim into a legendary figure who torments the patriarchy that sought to control her.

Sister Midnight is streaming now on JioHotstar (OTTplay Premium) and Prime Video.

A viral video showing an official making a suspicious motion just before the Detroit Lions committed a false start in their loss to the Minnesota Vikings has sparked conspiracy theories — but has a logical explanation.

Video emerged from the Christmas Day game between the teams that showed a league official making what appeared to be the false start sign, just seconds before the Lions were flagged for that penalty. That prompted some fans to suggest that the game was rigged or that the Lions were following orders from the league.

One NFL analyst offered the true explanation, which is much less nefarious than what some fans suggested.

Video of the official's motion spread on social media in the hours after Thursday's game, which saw the Lions eliminated from playoff contention with a 23-10 loss. Some suggested

Reporter Mike Payton of AtoZ Sports explained that the official seen making that motion is actually a replay official who was conveying to the on-field officials that play would resume and the previous play would not be reviewed.

Payton added that other officials can be seen making the same motion at previous Lions games.

“He is not making a false start signal that says to the players on the field that the NFL wants them to do a false start,” Payton wrote. “He is signaling to the officials that the game can continue on and that the previous play will not be reviewed, and a TV timeout won't be taken. If you watch the Lions on Week 18 against the Bears, you will see a guy in teal do this multiple times per game.”

Payton also raised a more obvious question — what would the NFL have to gain by ordering the Lions to commit a false start penalty. The real explanation is that it was just a case of bad timing that the official happened to be caught on the broadcast making the signal just before the Lions committed a false start.

The loss to the Vikings ended Detroit's hopes of sneaking back into the playoffs. After a promising start to the season, the Lions have gone 4-7 since October. The team had a streak of three years without losing back-to-back games, but the loss to Minnesota was their third in a row.

After Thursday's game, head coach Dan Campbell said he would be doing a deep evaluation of the team to see what needed to change.

“I'm gonna be looking at a lot of things, because I do not like being home for the playoffs, and I know our guys don't either,” Campbell told reporters after the game.

Campbell added that he would also look at what he needed to change, saying he feels like he let the players down.

“Whenever you lose, it takes a village; everybody's involved. Including myself, so I'm always gonna look at myself first,” Campbell said. “I'm always gonna wish I'd given Goff more, those players more.”

Too many easter eggs to ignore!

BuzzFeed Contributor

This Disney theory is among the wilder fan theories, but it's filled with easter eggs and evidence that'll make you think twice. Fans speculate that Boo experimented with magical properties and landed herself in 10th-century Scotland. Since Boo was obsessed with the Monster World and could teleport through doors (maybe being able to time-travel then too) in Monsters Inc., she could easily have evolved into the elder witch from Brave. Despite the craziness of this theory, there is a carving of Sully himself in the witch's workshop from Brave.

Fans strongly suggest that Carl's journey in Up takes place in the afterlife and that Russell was an angel protecting him until he reached heaven. The floating house and balloons heavily suggest ideas of "ascension," — a heavenly reference also supported by the majestic Paradise Falls they travel to. People theorize that Carl never survived the initial heartbreak of his love, Ellie, and actually passed away the night before embarking on his journey.

It's been widely confirmed (and seen) that Rapunzel and Eugene attended Elsa's coronation in Frozen, and many suspect it's because they're actually distant cousins of Elsa and Anna. While Tangled is set in Germany, it's not far-fetched to think Rapunzel could've traveled to Arendelle for the ceremony (as it takes place in Norway). This not-so-subtle coincidence also leads into our next theory...

Frozen takes place three years after the sunken ship that killed Elsa and Anna's parents (The King and Queen). It's no coincidence that Frozen was released three years after Tangled, revealing that the timeframe matches up almost to the day. Fans have also suggested that the Queen in Tangled appears to look very similar to the King in Frozen. So, fans speculating their familial relationship doesn't seem too far off. 

Disney fans have quickly noticed that the shipwreck Ariel explores in The Little Mermaid is surprisingly similar to the one in Frozen, where the King and Queen die. It has been confirmed that the shipwreck Ariel explores in The Little Mermaid is in the seas of Denmark, a midpoint between Norway and Germany. This connection would make sense since Disney loves to drop little easter eggs in all their movies.

This theory transpired from the beloved character, Genie, from Aladdin. Many fans claim that his various 90s pop-culture references, such as his impressions of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jack Nicholson, in the movie prove that Aladdin took place in a futuristic time. In addition, since the Genie was revealed to have been trapped in the magic lamp for nearly 10,000 years, fans have determined Aladdin represents a post-apocalyptic future where society has reverted to older ways. 

Disney fans quickly pointed out the similarities between Tarzan's Jane and Beauty and the Beast's Belle appearances. In one of the scenes in Tarzan, Terk is drumming on a set of pots strikingly close to Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast. One of the pots also has a chip in it, which furthers the idea that the movies and their characters are related. The teapot set is suggested to be an heirloom passed on for generations. In addition, fans have noticed the character's love for yellow, but that could be a simple coincidence. However, with the love interests of Tarzan and the Beast being more "wild-like" men, people think there's some hope that Jane could actually be a distant great-great-great-grandmother to Belle.

This theory hasn't been confirmed, but many fans speculate that there is a connection to these two Disney movies. In Peter Pan, we see a bunch of mermaids in Mermaid Lagoon, most notably a mermaid with striking red hair. People speculate that she is actually Ariel's mother. In The Little Mermaid, we learn that Ariel's mother, Athena, was killed by pirates — possibly Captain Hook himself. While this mermaid isn't specifically named in Peter Pan, fans believe there's a strong correlation that this relationship is highly plausible. 

Over the years, many fans have been puzzled by Peter Pan being recalled as a protagonist or "hero" of his story, despite his villainous behavior. However, many fans have pointed out how his intentions seem much darker than what lies on the surface. Essentially, Peter "kidnaps" the kids (the Darling family) and brings them to Neverland, where he doesn't want to let them return. This is also true for the origin story of the Lost Boys of Neverland. While hidden under the innocent youth of not wanting to grow up, people speculate that there are more unsettling reasons for Peter's actions and his "kidnapping ring." In other variations of the story, Captain Hook is actually a lost boy who escaped from Peter and is the only one brave enough to fight against him.

This is one of the more eerie Disney fan theories, but people strongly believe that Eeyore is a donkey that escaped from the not-so-innocent Pleasure Island from Pinocchio. Pleasure Island is a place where "delinquent" boys were turned into donkeys and then sold for labor. Fans theorize that Eeyore's clear melancholic and sorrowful behavior could be a result of the trauma faced on Pleasure Island and escaping its trap. 

Many fans have theorized that Nemo didn't actually survive the initial barracuda attack that killed Coral and the rest of his family. They believe that Marlon imagined a fake son as a way to cope with his immense grief. However, this theory is definitely less plausible than some others, as we see Nemo interact with various other sea creatures throughout the movie.
