                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are preparing for all eventualities as contract negotiations with Vinícius Junior continue to stall, with reports suggesting a contingency plan has already been mapped out. The Brazilian forward remains locked in talks over improved terms, holding firm on his financial demands while the club have so far refused to move beyond their most recent offer. Club president Florentino Perez is understood to be keen on retaining one of the team's most influential figures, with Madrid's default position being to keep the winger at almost any cost. Discussions are expected to resume next summer, but the lack of progress has forced Madrid's hierarchy to quietly consider alternatives should an agreement ultimately prove impossible. According to Cadena SER, that fallback plan would see Madrid pivot towards Vitinha, the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder who has long been admired by scouts at Valdebebas. In this scenario, Madrid would consider selling Vinícius for a fee no lower than €100 million (£87m), before redirecting that money into an aggressive pursuit of the Portuguese playmaker. Within the club, he is viewed as a midfielder capable of transforming the tempo and structure of Madrid's engine room, a profile they believe has been missing in recent seasons. The discussion around Vitinha inevitably ties into a broader debate about succession planning. As journalist Jorge C. Picon has explained, the club hierarchy recognised the problem but found few suitable replacements who were both convincing and financially viable. While both possess exceptional talent, neither experiment has fully delivered the control and rhythm traditionally associated with Madrid's elite playmakers. Relations between the two European heavyweights are hardly warm, and PSG would be particularly reluctant to strengthen a historic rival. Any move would almost certainly require Vitinha himself to push for the transfer, and even then, precedent suggests the Paris outfit would not buckle easily. Vitinha remains a highly attractive but realistically difficult option, one that would test both Madrid's negotiating power and the player's willingness to force the issue. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting For now, Madrid remain confident that an agreement with Vinícius can still be reached, preserving a partnership that has defined their attacking identity in recent years. Madrid return to action on 4 January against Real Betis in La Liga, before a Supercopa derby against Atlético Madrid five days later in Jeddah. Xabi Alonso's future hangs by a thread, and another defeat to their eternal rivals might seal his fate at the Spanish capital.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Endrick is already breaking records for Lyon without kicking a ball since leaving Real Madrid on loan. While he won't be able to play for Lyon for a couple of weeks, he is producing record-breaking numbers on social media. When his switch was announced, the teenager - who will wear the number nine shirt - exclaimed in a Lyon social media post, "Christmas has come early!" The Brazil international, who made just four appearances in all competitions for Xabi Alonso's side this season, will hope to hit the ground running at Lyon, where there is plenty of excitement about his arrival. According to RMC Sport, Lyon's Instagram post announcing Endrick's arrival has been viewed more than 17 million times - the club's most widely seen to date. For context, the previous record was linked to a video by Tyler Morton when he joined from Liverpool this summer, a post that was viewed under three million times. When his loan move was confirmed, Lyon wrote on the club website: "At just 19 years of age, Endrick joins OL with already solid experience at the very highest level and a maturity forged in demanding competitive environments. They added: "Olympique Lyonnais is delighted to welcome Endrick, who will join the professional squad from 29 December, and would like to thank Real Madrid for the quality of the discussions and cooperation that made his arrival possible." While Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior wished his compatriot well at Lyon, club icon Sidney Govou has his question marks over the deal. The former wrote on Instagram: "My brother Bob, good luck. Govou, however, thought there must be something wrong if a player, such as Endrick, is garnering so little game time. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting As Lyon confirmed, Endrick will link up with their first-team squad for training on Monday but he will have to wait a bit longer for his club debut. That is because he was not registered in time for their next clash on 3 January against AS Monaco. Incidentally, Lyon sit fifth in Ligue 1, 10 points behind surprise league leaders Lens and nine adrift of Champions League holders and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain after 16 matches. A win over Monaco in their next game could see them close to the five-point gap to fourth-positioned Lille if results go their way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scott McTominay's career has taken an unexpected yet glittering turn since leaving Manchester United, but speculation is now mounting that the Scotland midfielder could yet find his way back to the Premier League. Reports suggest the door to an Old Trafford reunion has not been firmly shut, with McTominay said to be weighing his long-term future after a remarkable spell in Italy. A product of United's academy, McTominay made 255 senior appearances for the Red Devils, often operating as a reliable if understated presence in midfield before deciding it was time to test himself beyond familiar surroundings. That leap of faith has been emphatically rewarded. McTominay's debut campaign with Napoli proved to be the most productive of his career, as he struck 13 goals across all competitions and played a central role in delivering the Serie A title. His performances earned him MVP honours, underlining a transformation that few predicted when he departed England. McTominay joined elite company by emulating figures such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović in being named Serie A Player of the Year. Yet for all the success, not everything has been straightforward. Napoli currently sit third in Serie A, and according to reports from The Sun, internal tensions have begun to emerge amid the intense scrutiny that comes with stardom in Naples. One source claimed: "Scott loves elements of Italian life and had a wonderful first season. Against that backdrop, rumours have linked the midfielder with a host of clubs back in England, including Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, while Barcelona have also been mentioned as admirers. The possibility of a Premier League return has inevitably reignited discussion of a United homecoming, particularly given McTominay's deep-rooted connection to the club. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Despite the swirling speculation, McTominay has consistently spoken warmly about his life in Italy, comments that appear to cool the notion of an imminent exit. He expanded on that sentiment in a BBC interview, and said: "The people in Naples are incredible, they're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation and that inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care. "Whereas now I live 1,500 miles away so I can't just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different, but in life you sometimes have to take yourself out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that.

Before Christmas, McTominay added another piece of silverware to his collection as Napoli defeated Bologna in the Supercoppa final, reinforcing his growing medal haul. Napoli return to league action on Sunday against Cremonese, with McTominay expected to once again play a key role as they chase domestic ambitions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And this is not just about 2026, when it will host the biggest FIFA World Cup in history, expanded to 48 teams. The process began in 2024 with the Copa América, which ended with Argentina crowned champions, and continued in the middle of this year with the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, widely considered a success and backed by a key figure of influence: President Donald Trump. Trump even took part in the final, not only during the trophy presentation ceremony but also joking and even dancing with Chelsea's victorious players. A report jointly produced by FIFA and the World Trade Organization estimates that spending associated with the 2026 World Cup will generate a $17.2 billion impact on U.S. GDP and $40.9 billion globally. This agenda not only attracts international attention but also catalyzes investment in infrastructure, media, and advertising, while creating a range of business opportunities for the market, such as hospitality and premium services for fans,” explains Joaquim Lo Prete, national manager at Absolut Sport. By hosting the world's most important soccer tournaments, the United States is establishing itself as a destination for global sports tourism, offering a massive showcase for the sport that connects fans from every continent in a single place,” says Thales Rangel Mafia, marketing manager at Multimarcas Consórcios. Amid all of this, major NBA and NFL games will continue to take place, further energizing daily life in these cities and, as a result, bringing enjoyment to the tourists who will be in the area during these events. “To give a sense of this expansion, FIFA moved its operations to Miami in 2023, taking into account the investments made by the country's top league, Major League Soccer, especially after the arrival of stars such as Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez at Inter Miami. In addition, more than 100 employees from world soccer's governing body have relocated from its headquarters in Switzerland to Coral Gables, which will house the organization's legal, audit, compliance, and risk management departments. The United States has begun to explore global events, investing heavily in soccer and once again hosting major competitions. On the other hand, when it comes to American football, the most popular sport among Americans, there has been a process of internationalization of brands. In Brazil, we have followed NFL games in recent years, but now we will also host college football events, which attract a more engaged audience. The rise of the United States as a global sports hub is creating a domino effect: clubs, leagues, and stadiums in other countries are adopting more advanced technologies to avoid losing relevance. Event operations in the U.S. are already based on automation, data intelligence, and integrated systems, setting a new standard of excellence that tends to be replicated internationally, says Tironi Paz Ortiz, CEO and founder of Imply Tecnologia. By adopting an integrated and creative approach, leveraging sponsorships, strategic partnerships, engagement campaigns, and interactive consumer experiences, brands can increase visibility, build loyalty, and align with positive values, ensuring a lasting and meaningful impact,” says Wagner Leitzke, digital director at the agency End to End. Competing for attention with the other four well-established major leagues is a major challenge, but soccer has everything it needs to solidify its presence this time,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM. According to Heraldo Evans, commercial and marketing manager at Recoma, the United States is no longer just a major consumer market and is positioning itself as a global hub for the sports industry. “The country has invested heavily in infrastructure, content, and experiences, expanding interest in sports that historically were not part of the local imagination and attracting major global events to the country. This movement creates new business opportunities, draws an international audience, and redefines standards for production and management in sports. For companies in the sector, such as Recoma, this scenario represents opportunities to integrate into an increasingly sophisticated ecosystem that values innovation, sustainable operating models, and projects capable of interacting simultaneously with different sports cultures. It is an environment that expands boundaries and requires all of us to think about sports in a more global way.” By strengthening these sports and attracting sponsors who previously did not invest in the Olympic environment, the United States aims to reclaim its historic prominence precisely in the edition it will host in Los Angeles.” Donald Trump's interviews are often surrounded by controversy or reveal new information. We have to think of another name,” he said briefly. After the FIFA Club World Cup final earlier this year between PSG and Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Trump gave an interview to DAZN, the network that holds the competition's broadcasting rights, and said he was considering signing an executive order to require that the term “soccer” be called “football” in the United States. Soccer may emerge later through Major League Soccer, which has seen a surge in popularity over the past two years following multimillion-dollar investments in world-class players such as Lionel Messi, now with Inter Miami. Trump has said he wants to see soccer grow in the United States, hoping it can soon match the country's other global positions. But could changing the name have any effect? “I think it would be a historic change that would reveal a global truth: the United States resisted for years a sport invented by the English, not by Americans. Fans of Latino heritage, who already make up nearly 20% of the population, will like it, and its popularization will come in future generations, who will learn to call ‘fútbol' the sport played with the feet,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM. “There could be a kind of antagonism, intentional or accidental, between soccer and American football. If it is a form of social engineering, it could even be part of a proposal for cultural division. But it could also have a geopolitical agenda, linking the ‘money' that is so strong in modern soccer with American football, involving Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Emirates,” explains Alexandre Vasconcellos, regional manager at Flashscore. Even if it is legally complex or practically unfeasible, at least in terms of everyday language, it can be quite effective at drawing attention and provoking divisions, for example between a more ‘traditional' local population and another with a more cosmopolitan or internationalist outlook,” the executive adds. The name is secondary if everyone knows what it refers to,” says Thiago Freitas, chief operating officer at Roc Nation Sports. Men's soccer has not taken off yet and is in a phase of slow, gradual growth. In my view, changing ‘soccer' to ‘football' could cause unnecessary confusion, especially because I do not believe that would be the trigger for a breakthrough. I prefer the formula of planning, strategy, investment, and time,” adds Fábio Wolff of Wolff Sports and Marketing. “I think it would be interesting, but without major changes in the sport's evolution. Still, it is another positive point for the Club World Cup. The president clearly understood firsthand the power of soccer,” says Renê Salviano, CEO of Heatmap and a sports marketing specialist who manages brand contracts involving professional athletes. It makes global marketing easier, improves connections with new fans, and strengthens synergy with brands and sports properties,” concludes Wagner Leitzke, club director at End to End. Even weather-related stoppages during World Cup matches can turn into opportunities for fan engagement and sponsor sales. At the Club World Cup, six of the 59 matches played were affected by stoppages due to “severe weather alerts.” Despite the logistical challenges, these moments also create opportunities for strategic actions by brands and sponsors looking to connect with fans in creative ways and boost in-stadium consumption. Even at the Club World Cup, cooling breaks were sponsored. “Organizers of the World Cup must be prepared for situations caused by climate change. These require attention to public transportation and safe shelters for fans, but they can also be used to connect with supporters and generate value for sponsors,” says Anderson Rubinatto, CEO of Goolaço, a company specializing in sports events. Statistics and live score apps see spikes in usage while matches are suspended. This window, once viewed only as a problem, is now being seen as an opportunity for real-time digital activations. Creativity is a key differentiating factor in this scenario. With the support of technology, tools such as QR codes on stadium screens can direct fans to challenges, giveaways, or exclusive content during forced stoppages. Joaquim Lo Prete, national director of Absolut Sport in Brazil, believes the key lies in offering something unique and time-limited. In the United States, leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and MLS have been dealing with these types of situations for years. While there is no specific federal legislation governing weather-related stoppages, each league follows its own protocols and carries insurance that covers financial losses caused by delays or cancellations. In addition, policies such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Reauthorization Act help improve weather forecasting and risk monitoring for large-scale events.

It is an environment that expands boundaries and requires all of us to think about sports in a more global way.” By strengthening these sports and attracting sponsors who previously did not invest in the Olympic environment, the United States aims to reclaim its historic prominence precisely in the edition it will host in Los Angeles.” Donald Trump's interviews are often surrounded by controversy or reveal new information. We have to think of another name,” he said briefly. After the FIFA Club World Cup final earlier this year between PSG and Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Trump gave an interview to DAZN, the network that holds the competition's broadcasting rights, and said he was considering signing an executive order to require that the term “soccer” be called “football” in the United States. Soccer may emerge later through Major League Soccer, which has seen a surge in popularity over the past two years following multimillion-dollar investments in world-class players such as Lionel Messi, now with Inter Miami. Trump has said he wants to see soccer grow in the United States, hoping it can soon match the country's other global positions. But could changing the name have any effect? “I think it would be a historic change that would reveal a global truth: the United States resisted for years a sport invented by the English, not by Americans. Fans of Latino heritage, who already make up nearly 20% of the population, will like it, and its popularization will come in future generations, who will learn to call ‘fútbol' the sport played with the feet,” analyzes Ivan Martinho, a professor of sports marketing at ESPM. “There could be a kind of antagonism, intentional or accidental, between soccer and American football. If it is a form of social engineering, it could even be part of a proposal for cultural division. But it could also have a geopolitical agenda, linking the ‘money' that is so strong in modern soccer with American football, involving Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Emirates,” explains Alexandre Vasconcellos, regional manager at Flashscore. Even if it is legally complex or practically unfeasible, at least in terms of everyday language, it can be quite effective at drawing attention and provoking divisions, for example between a more ‘traditional' local population and another with a more cosmopolitan or internationalist outlook,” the executive adds. The name is secondary if everyone knows what it refers to,” says Thiago Freitas, chief operating officer at Roc Nation Sports. Men's soccer has not taken off yet and is in a phase of slow, gradual growth. In my view, changing ‘soccer' to ‘football' could cause unnecessary confusion, especially because I do not believe that would be the trigger for a breakthrough. I prefer the formula of planning, strategy, investment, and time,” adds Fábio Wolff of Wolff Sports and Marketing. “I think it would be interesting, but without major changes in the sport's evolution. Still, it is another positive point for the Club World Cup. The president clearly understood firsthand the power of soccer,” says Renê Salviano, CEO of Heatmap and a sports marketing specialist who manages brand contracts involving professional athletes. It makes global marketing easier, improves connections with new fans, and strengthens synergy with brands and sports properties,” concludes Wagner Leitzke, club director at End to End. Even weather-related stoppages during World Cup matches can turn into opportunities for fan engagement and sponsor sales. At the Club World Cup, six of the 59 matches played were affected by stoppages due to “severe weather alerts.” Despite the logistical challenges, these moments also create opportunities for strategic actions by brands and sponsors looking to connect with fans in creative ways and boost in-stadium consumption. Even at the Club World Cup, cooling breaks were sponsored. “Organizers of the World Cup must be prepared for situations caused by climate change. These require attention to public transportation and safe shelters for fans, but they can also be used to connect with supporters and generate value for sponsors,” says Anderson Rubinatto, CEO of Goolaço, a company specializing in sports events. Statistics and live score apps see spikes in usage while matches are suspended. This window, once viewed only as a problem, is now being seen as an opportunity for real-time digital activations. Creativity is a key differentiating factor in this scenario. With the support of technology, tools such as QR codes on stadium screens can direct fans to challenges, giveaways, or exclusive content during forced stoppages. Joaquim Lo Prete, national director of Absolut Sport in Brazil, believes the key lies in offering something unique and time-limited. In the United States, leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and MLS have been dealing with these types of situations for years. While there is no specific federal legislation governing weather-related stoppages, each league follows its own protocols and carries insurance that covers financial losses caused by delays or cancellations. In addition, policies such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Reauthorization Act help improve weather forecasting and risk monitoring for large-scale events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When tickets went on sale for the six FIFA World Cup games being hosted in Toronto next year, Aidan D'Souza and his family were lucky enough to snag a few, but he says it wasn't easy. Tickets in Toronto — one of 16 North American host cities for next summer's FIFA World Cup — have sold out about as quickly as they've been released. Anyone who's tried to get resale tickets to a major event in recent years will know the pain, frustration and, most of all, cost of the secondary market. Tickets on StubHub, a popular third-party reseller, have gone for as much as $80,000, and are currently going for over $2,000 a pop at minimum. In 2019, Doug Ford's government scrapped part of a law that capped ticket resales at 50 per cent above the original price, allowing sites like Ticketmaster, StubHub and SeatGeek to set whatever price they think people will pay. That's a big issue, leaving low- and middle-income fans on the outside looking in, says Vass Bednar, managing director of the Canadian SHIELD Institute, a policy institute focused on Canada's economy. Some people, Bednar says, might argue events are commodities and customers should be able to pay thousands for a ticket if that's the value they place on the experience. “If we're viewing major cultural events, major sporting events, as a luxury good that is only available to the highest bidder, then I think that really says something.” It's an issue Ford, backpedalling from 2019, said this year he would like to review. The change of heart came after World Series tickets in Toronto sold out almost immediately, only for resale tickets to pop up for sale shortly after, well above face value. “My personal opinion … they're gouging the people,” Ford said in October. Both Ontario's NDP and Liberals have urged Ford's government to take action. Ontario NDP propose ban on ticket resales above face value In Quebec, the government has proposed new legislation to protect consumers. The United Kingdom has also proposed a ban on reselling tickets above face value. A spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of Public and Business Services said in a statement the province is looking at “potential issues regarding ticket sales.” “[I]f the scope of that issue can only be solved by legislation, we will explore what our options are at that time,” said spokesperson Joey Wu in an email, adding anyone concerned Ontario's Consumer Protection Act is being broken should file a complaint with the ministry. Fans can register with FIFA online for the chance to buy hospitality tickets, like D'Souza did, which include food and drink. There's also FIFA's random selection draw, which fans can register for before Jan. 13. FIFA recently slashed the cost of a select number of tickets to each game after soccer fans around the world cried foul about exorbitant prices. But those are limited and will be given out by national soccer federations. FIFA also has its own resale and exchange marketplace, but charges a 15 per cent fee on those transactions. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.</p>
