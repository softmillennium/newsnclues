                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Stanford Medicine have identified the biological steps that explain how mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines can, in rare cases, lead to heart inflammation in some adolescent and young adult males. Their work also points to a potential strategy for lowering that risk. By combining modern laboratory techniques with previously published data from vaccinated individuals, the team uncovered a two-stage immune response. In this process, the vaccine activates one type of immune cell, which then stimulates another. Together, these immune reactions drive inflammation that can damage heart muscle cells and set off additional inflammatory effects. mRNA vaccines are considered a major advance because they can be developed quickly, adjusted as viruses change, and tailored to target very different pathogens. Still, as with any medical intervention, reactions are not identical for everyone. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and heart palpitations. These symptoms occur without a viral infection and typically appear within one to three days after vaccination. (Cardiac troponin is normally found exclusively in the heart muscle. When found circulating in blood, it indicates damage to heart muscle cells.) The condition occurs in roughly one out of every 140,000 people after a first vaccine dose and increases to about one in 32,000 after a second dose. Rates are highest among males age 30 and younger, where it affects about one in 16,750 vaccine recipients. Wu emphasized that the majority of myocarditis cases linked to vaccination resolve quickly, with heart function either fully preserved or restored. "It's not a heart attack in the traditional sense," he said. "There's no blockage of blood vessels as found in most common heart attacks. When symptoms are mild and the inflammation hasn't caused structural damage to the heart, we just observe these patients to make sure they recover." In rare instances, however, severe inflammation can cause serious injury, leading to hospitalization, intensive care treatment or death. He noted that a COVID-19 infection is about 10 times more likely to cause myocarditis than an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the many other risks posed by the disease. Wu is a senior author of the study, publisded Dec. 10 in Science Translational Medicine, along with Masataka Nishiga, MD, PhD, a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar now at The Ohio State University. The study's lead author is Xu Cao, PhD, also a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford. "Medical scientists are quite aware that COVID itself can cause myocarditis," Wu said. To answer that question, the team analyzed blood samples from vaccinated individuals, including some who developed myocarditis. When they compared these samples with those from people who did not develop heart inflammation, two proteins stood out. We think these two are the major drivers of myocarditis," Wu said. The researchers grew human immune cells called macrophages in laboratory dishes and exposed them to mRNA vaccines. After exposure, the macrophages released multiple cytokines, with especially high levels of CXCL10. Their behavior closely matched immune responses previously documented in vaccinated people. In contrast, T cells exposed to the vaccine alone did not show this spike. These findings showed that macrophages primarily produce CXCL10, while T cells are the main source of IFN-gamma following vaccination. To determine whether these cytokines directly harm the heart, the team vaccinated young male mice and observed increased cardiac troponin levels, indicating heart muscle injury. They also found that immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, had entered heart tissue. Similar immune cell infiltration is seen in people who develop myocarditis after vaccination. The researchers also detected increased levels of adhesion molecules in heart blood vessels. These molecules help immune cells latch onto vessel walls, making it easier for them to move into heart tissue. Together, these findings confirmed that CXCL10 and IFN-gamma directly contribute to heart injury. These cells can be assembled into small, beating clusters that mimic aspects of heart function. When these cardiac spheroids were exposed to CXCL10 and IFN-gamma collected from vaccinated immune cells, markers of heart stress rose sharply. Wu suspected that a widely available dietary compound might help protect the heart. Since myocarditis is more common in males and estrogen has anti-inflammatory effects, he revisited genistein, a soy-derived compound his team had studied previously. In a 2022 study published in Cell, the researchers showed that genistein has anti-inflammatory properties and can counter marijuana-related damage to blood vessels and heart tissue. "Genistein is only weakly absorbed when taken orally," Wu said. Heightened cytokine signaling may be a broader feature of mRNA vaccines. It's essential to immune response but can become toxic in large amounts," Wu said. Excessive IFN-gamma can lead to myocarditis-like symptoms and breakdown of heart muscle proteins. "Other vaccines can cause myocarditis and inflammatory problems, but the symptoms tend to be more diffuse," Wu said. "Plus, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines' risks have received intense public scrutiny and media coverage. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.
