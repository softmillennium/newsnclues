                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag. In your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry. What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. The emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload. Being drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. In your mind, this might sound like, "If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough," or, "If they chase me, it means they love me enough." Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, "If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt." It might just mean there isn't anxiety. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass. Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyle Dijamco is a proud member of Palantir Technologies' fast-growing retail investor base. The Los Angeles-based marketer has bet big on the defense tech stock, even increasing his exposure after a drawdown earlier this year. "It's an exciting stock to own," Dijamco told CNBC. Its monster gains over recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom has made the stock an indisputable star of the retail investing world, in spite of Wall Street's reservations about valuation. Individual investors were on track to buy nearly $8 billion in Palantir stock on balance in 2025, per Vanda data as of Dec. 8. That is a gain of more than 80% over the prior year, and it reflects an increase of over 400% from 2023. The stock sits behind only megacap names like Tesla and Nvidia and popular exchange-traded funds such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which tracks the entire U.S. market benchmark. "It's been great," said Viraj Patel, deputy head of research at Vanda, which tracks retail trader flows. Palantir has won the hearts of retail investors amid its takeoff as a stock. Its shares have surged more than 150% so far in 2025, placing the name on track for its third straight year with triple-digit gains. Since its 2020 market debut, Palantir has been considered a mysterious enterprise given its business with both public and private entities. On the surface level, Palantir helps both governments and major corporations organize their data. Beyond being viewed as a beneficiary of the push to adopt AI, it's seen as a winner under the Trump administration's priorities of increasing federal government efficiency and bolstering national defense. "The joke for a while has always been like, 'What does Palantir even do?'" said Paxton Earl, an investment banker with a focus on software who began reading regulatory reports to better understand the company. After learning more, he remembers thinking: "This is actually an insane business. Earl discovered through research that the company's revenue was more diversified beyond military work than he initially predicted. In addition, the 23-year-old found Palantir worked with consumer-facing brands he knew like Ferrari and Wendy's. The San Diego resident said he picked up more shares following the company's third-quarter earnings report in early November. Palantir tanked 16% that month as investors dumped their AI plays on valuation fears, and the stock posted its worst monthly performance in more than two years. Palantir has gone out of its way to court individual traders like Earl. While other well-known companies typically reserve the question-and-answer portions of earnings calls for Wall Street analysts or journalists, Palantir also takes inquiries from retail investors. In an annual video shared from a ski trail late last year, CEO Alex Karp specifically shouted out these small shareholders. "Exceedingly grateful to all of you individual investors who took the time and opportunity, and had the courage to look past conventional, rusty, crusty platitudes," Karp said, while was wearing reflective goggles and gripping ski poles. On several days in 2025, it was the most mentioned stock on the discussion board, according to meme stock tracking firm Breakout Point. Palantir "has been a long-standing WallStreetBets romance," said Ivan Ćosović, managing director at Breakout Point. To be sure, not all of the social media chatter has been positive. Some investing content creators have questioned if they can ethically hold Palantir's stock given the business' connection to wartime technology and its partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The company's valuation has made its stock a "non-starter" for institutional clients, according to Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Palantir has a multiple of around 450 times trailing earnings, running circles around the S&P 500's average of close to 28. On the other hand, Luria said retail investors are likely impressed by Palantir's "ambitious" mission to play a role in defending the U.S. These everyday investors are likely also enticed by Karp, who Luria said is similar to Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his ability to sell a business vision. However, Luria said Karp hasn't attracted the same amount of controversy. Luria said Palantir also draws parallels to Tesla's stock 10 years ago, when the carmaker was presenting an electric vehicle-focused future. The question, Luria said, is if the retail crowd who backed Tesla a decade ago are right once again about Palantir. "Even us most jaded, old, stodgy Wall Street analysts were taken aback by the level of success," Luria said. Karp told CNBC that Burry's move was "bats--- crazy." Retail investors are undeterred by the wariness among their institutional counterparts. Palantir has had its fair share of choppiness this year, falling more than 10% on multiple single trading days. But for stakeholders like Dijamco, the California-based marketer, these fluctuations provide cheaper entry points to buy into a name that they believe in. "You kind of become a little bit desensitized to the price swings," said Dijamco, who plans to purchase thousands of dollars' worth of additional shares on the next big downturn.

Rocsys, co-founded in 2019, aims to turn every charging port into a robocharger by essentially adding a robotic arm and software on top of the existing infrastructure. The goal, Bouman said, is to replace humans in a process he views as wholly inefficient and unprepared for the mass adoption of robotaxis. This interview was lightly edited for length and clarity. I previously founded a company called Epyon, which made fast chargers for electric cars. That company was acquired by ABB, and I spent six years there as the head of the product line for electric-vehicle charging. In my final year at ABB, we had an experience that was somewhat unusual: There was a customer from San Francisco who bought a lot of fast chargers, but they did not want to tell us what they were doing with them. It turned out to be Cruise, the self-driving company. The vehicle would drive for about two hours and then park itself; a person would then walk over and plug it in. If you want autonomous vehicles to scale, there needs to be a company that fixes the interface to the built world — such as charging, entering a parking garage, or going into a car wash. All the infrastructure is built for human drivers. We first began focusing more on ports and logistics yards because, five years ago, there were few autonomous vehicles beyond those used in logistics operations and port terminals. Then, last year, robotaxis became mainstream in the US and China. We won our first very large customer contract in robotaxis — I can't talk about it publicly — and we are about to sign the second one. How does automated charging solve those three problems? We've been in robotaxi depots in the US and China, using stopwatches to determine how much time each task takes. With charging, you walk to the vehicle, plug it in, and then half an hour later, you walk back and unplug. The reality is, it's not really a career. These tech-savvy companies building autonomous vehicles need to establish a comprehensive parallel infrastructure of gig workers — including HR, facilities, and OSHA requirements — everything. It breaks the scale and is very costly to operate. Our product means you don't need to build that whole parallel organization, which is a complete distraction from their core business. Plugging in, inspecting the vehicle, performing a quick interior clean, and then walking back to unplug lasts between 300 and 400 seconds. There are a lot of interruptions in between because charging is so important for the throughput of the depot that it gets priority. So, if someone is cleaning a vehicle, they have to stop when a new one arrives, walk over, plug it in, and then walk back. Then you can optimize the other tasks so they're more sequential instead of in an ad-hoc manner. If the ratio for current depot operations is one human per 12 robotaxis, then what does the ratio look like with automated chargers? If cleaning and inspection are still manual processes, then you will more than double the number of vehicles served per person. We also have a road map to automate those other processes. We're currently focused on charging because that's the primary customer request, but we have developed a proof of concept for automated inspection and have already built a working system for automated interior cleaning. A couple years ago, there was some buzz around Tesla's robot charger. What's to stop Tesla from reviving that idea and doing automated charging themselves? Elon Musk will do everything himself, so they might. It would make a ton of sense for them. The whole pitch for Tesla is that it can upgrade the entire fleet to robo­taxis, and those vehicles need to be charged. But before we even talk about robotaxis scaling, doesn't the US still have issues with its EV charging infrastructure that need to be solved first? I think for the robotaxi use-case, it's sort of a parallel world because the charging stations are very dedicated to a fleet. So, robotaxi operators build out their fleets, but in parallel, they also develop the charging infrastructure with partners or independently. It's sort of bespoke to the robotaxi operation. Currently, the hubs are dedicated to one operator — Waymo has its own hubs, while Zoox has its own. These differ from public charging infrastructure, so I'd say they are parallel worlds. There's no reason to solve one problem before the other. Are robo­taxis scaling fast enough today for Rocsys to build a real business on automated charging? Over the next five years, we can expect a substantial market for us. Robotaxis are a limited fleet, but usage is extremely intense. The vehicles are running 24/7, three to four times per day. The ratio of vehicles to charging bays — the parking spots where a vehicle can be charged — is about one to six. Public information suggests that there are somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 robotaxis on US roads, if you add up Waymo, Zoox, and others. That means the current market is a few thousand bays to serve, which is already a very nice starting market. What we're seeing now already feels like a land-grab dynamic. Tesla — let's see how far they actually are. Wayve from the UK, which is also pretty impressive. It really feels like a land grab in the next two years. Are you approaching Uber, Lyft, and all the other players? You can be sure that we talk to every one of them. When will you be able to announce your first big robotaxi customer? We don't have a date yet, but I'm fairly certain it'll be sometime next year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un observed construction of a submarine with his daughter, a potential heir, and oversaw the test-firing of long-range surface-to-air missiles, state media reported on Thursday. Wednesday's missile test near the east coast, aimed at assessing the nuclear-armed country's strategic technology for developing a new type of high-altitude missile, destroyed targets in the air from 200 km (120 miles) away, KCNA said. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the missile test occurred at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), Yonhap News Agency reported. The South Korean military had been aware of launch preparations and was ready for it, Yonhap said, citing a Joint Chiefs official. Kim observed construction at another site on an 8,700-ton nuclear-powered submarine capable of launching surface-to-air missiles, KCNA said. It did not identify the location or date of his visit. A KCNA photo showed Kim at a submarine construction site with his daughter, Ju Ae. Surrounded by other officials, he smiles as the teenager, considered by some analysts as the frontrunner to succeed her father, stands next to him in an indoor facility housing a red vessel. Kim said North Korea is building multiple attack destroyers and nuclear submarines and working to rapidly accelerate construction so that vessels can be equipped with various weapons, according to KCNA. The design of the submarine's hull indicates it has been equipped with a nuclear reactor, and the vessel is almost ready to sail, Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification, wrote in a report on Thursday. Kim was quoted as saying the all-out development of nuclear capabilities and modernisation of the navy are essential and inevitable, while "the present world is by no means peaceful". He said South Korea's plan to develop a nuclear-powered submarine, agreed with Washington, would further inflame tensions on the Korean Peninsula and poses a risk to national security that requires him to take action. North Korean state media also criticised the recent entry of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine into a South Korean port, calling it "an act of escalating military tensions" on the Korean Peninsula and in the region. North Korea said this week that Japan was showing its intention to possess nuclear weapons, encouraged by South Korea's moves to develop a nuclear submarine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq. Groq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal. Groq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round. Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion. Neither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement. Ross and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders. For instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.</p>
