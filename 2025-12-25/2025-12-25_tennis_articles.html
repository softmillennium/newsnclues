                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>👉 This week, we're putting the spotlight on our sport's unsung heroes. Consistency has been the name of the game for Francisco Cerundolo, South America's longtime standard bearer—a player who quietly climbed to a career-high ranking of No. That spotlight has largely belonged to Brazil's 19-year-old phenom Joao Fonseca, who defeated Cerundolo in the final of his home tournament in Buenos Aires and used the moment as a springboard to wider attention.While he didn't make a deep run at a Grand Slam this season, many of Cerundolo's biggest milestones came on the Masters 1000 stage. The Argentine reached back-to-back quarterfinals at Indian Wells and Miami, then advanced to the semifinals in Madrid—the second time he has reached that stage, dating back to his breakout Miami semifinal run in 2022.A former South Carolina college standout, Cerundolo has long thrived in team environments like the Laver Cup and Davis Cup. But after spending three years hovering around the ATP's Top 30, he now appears ready to step out of a supporting role and into a more central one.

But after spending three years hovering around the ATP's Top 30, he now appears ready to step out of a supporting role and into a more central one. After coaching him at the Laver Cup, Andre Agassi told Tennis Channel: “Everybody is scared to death when he gets set to unload on his forehand.”Cerundolo is also one of the tour's most effective returners, ranking No. That skill has helped him remain a consistent threat against the elite, with two wins over world No. 2 Alexander Zverev and victories over Top 20 opponents including Alex de Minaur, Casper Ruud, Holger Rune and Tommy Paul.In February, he added Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas to his coaching team, signaling a willingness to try new approaches and build on incremental improvements rather than chase quick fixes.“I actually didn't set specific ranking goals this year, like saying I want to be Top 10 or whatever,” Cerundolo told press earlier this year. So my main goal is to be more consistent, and I think I'm already doing better than last year.” After coaching him at the Laver Cup, Andre Agassi told Tennis Channel: “Everybody is scared to death when he gets set to unload on his forehand.”Cerundolo is also one of the tour's most effective returners, ranking No. That skill has helped him remain a consistent threat against the elite, with two wins over world No. 2 Alexander Zverev and victories over Top 20 opponents including Alex de Minaur, Casper Ruud, Holger Rune and Tommy Paul.In February, he added Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas to his coaching team, signaling a willingness to try new approaches and build on incremental improvements rather than chase quick fixes.“I actually didn't set specific ranking goals this year, like saying I want to be Top 10 or whatever,” Cerundolo told press earlier this year.
