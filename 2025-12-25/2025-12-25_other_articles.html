                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the world of streaming, nothing is permanent. The constantly shifting landscape of content licensing and platform changes means that many streaming titles have an expiration date, and that holds true for Netflix. Ahead of its Season 3 premiere next month, a sleeper hit supernatural teen drama is leaving Netflix, and subscribers only have a few more days to stream it. School Spirits, sibling creators Megan Trinrud and Nate Trinrud's YA show about a teen stuck in afterlife limbo at her high school as she investigates her own mysterious disappearance, is scheduled to leave Netflix on December 31st. Season 2, which debuted in January of this year, never made it to the platform and never will with the show's upcoming departure. The series, which holds an average 91% critic score and 93% audience rating across its two seasons on Rotten Tomatoes, feels like a mix of teen mystery dramas like Pretty Little Liars and Veronica Mars, but with the supernatural twist of shows like Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Lockwood & Co. A ghost-led whodunit in a high school setting that brings all of the teen angst and supernatural elements of some of the best in their respective genres, School Spirits is insanely fun, surprisingly deep, and easy to binge-watch. The show has been consistently good, raising its critic score from an 83% in Season 1 to a perfect 100% in Season 2. The second season was described by critics as “an engrossing spectacle” and “an edgy and gripping second season that'll have you putting on your detective hat to figure everything out.” The entire show is criminally underrated, delivering more depth and heart than typical teen shows and a complex plot to keep viewers hooked. Netflix subscribers unfortunately won't get to see School Spirits Season 2 join the platform and are now left with only a few more days to binge-watch Season 1. New episodes will then drop weekly through the season finale in March. Get access to exclusive stories on new releases, movies, shows, comics, anime, games and more!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yesterday Vallee was interviewed and many people thought he didnt say much. But in the last 25 minutes or so, he did say some rather fascinating stuff. At some points it looks like even George Knapp is stunned. Vallee: "[...] he said that was a control system. But it could be open or closed depending on the conditions. He said I think UFOs may be the same thing. There is a longer section about the control system prior to this quote, but its too long to put here. Vallee: "There are cases that I know, where... this happened in government facilities, but nobody's talking about that. So I cannot be completely sure" Not entirely sure if he is talking about "controllers" of the craft, or of the control system. Vallee: "But what they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. Those are not the entities that are described at Trinity [...], they are not the entities that were caught in Brazil, you know in that documentary. They may be the higher level entity" And its a higher level being (interesting choice of words). Anyone have a clue what the entity looks like then? Vallee: "If that's true, then there is a process ongoing where we may be able to acquire information at a very sophisticated level. And that would be, that could be a reason for stalling quote "disclosure" until there can be a rational way that we're not confronted with something... so overpowering, that it would destroy our culture and our society" What I cannot tell is whether that the entity that was presented was a simulation of a real entity or whether it was the real entity. The people I spoke to couldn't probe it to see if it was made of flesh or, in metal, or something else" Vallee: "It was presented to them in a secure facility that I've never heard of anywhere else, where there was structured interaction with it on a continuing basis by specialists from different areas. Vallee also describes what the Trinity craft looked like: Vallee: when he [witness] was inside [the crashed trinity craft] there was essentially nothing except a very crude thing that [... he describes normal gadget left behind by soldiers]. The craft itself, we had very good description of it. If there was a an engine, it would have been under the floor. That's where you could put an engine" See this post about how they may originate from beyond the physical universe Create your account and connect with a world of communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicki Minaj didn't plan to dominate the news cycle when she stepped onto the stage at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in Phoenix on 21 December 2025. But one word uttered in front of a woman whose husband was assassinated just months earlier was enough to send political corners of the internet into a frenzy. Minaj, appearing alongside Erika Kirk, the widow of late Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, was midway through offering advice to young men when she praised 'our handsome, dashing president' before adding another name. What followed was a moment that instantly went viral. 'You have amazing role models like the assassin JD Vance, our vice president,' Minaj said. AmericaFest was TPUSA's first major gathering since Charlie Kirk was assassinated on 3 September 2025, during a live debate at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The FBI has maintained the killing was carried out by a lone gunman with no clear motive, a conclusion Erika Kirk has publicly supported while urging an end to speculation. That backdrop made Minaj's use of the word 'assassin', especially while sitting beside Kirk's widow, feel jarring. Body language analysts later pointed to Minaj's rigid posture and prolonged pause as signs of genuine shock rather than rehearsed theatrics. While some viewers chalked it up to an unfortunate slip, possibly slang meant to convey toughness or dominance, others were far less charitable. Netizens and political commentators began framing the moment as a 'Freudian slip,' suggesting Minaj might have let something spill that wasn't meant for public ears. spread rapidly, with some users tying the comment to long-circulating rumours involving JD Vance and Erika Kirk. Earlier in December, podcaster Nick Fuentes claimed without evidence that Kirk and Vance had a personal relationship, citing an affectionate hug at a TPUSA event and Kirk's early praise of Vance as a future presidential contender. Fuentes also pointed to Kirk later distancing herself from Vance amid political backlash as 'suspicious.' Still, Minaj's wording poured gasoline on an already smouldering fire. After briefly thanking Kirk onstage, she went largely silent on social media, fueling headlines suggesting she was laying low amid the backlash. He, in fact, has only praise for the rapper. 'Nicki Minaj said something at Amfest that was really profound. I'm paraphrasing, but she said, 'just because I want little black girls to think they're beautiful doesn't mean I need to put down little girls with blonde hair and blue eyes,' he wrote on X (formerly Twitter)</p>

She admitted the incident caused her depression and health issues. She also clarified false rumors regarding money laundering. Previously, Mor Plai predicted a major conflict at the Thai-Cambodia border. She claimed “big unrest” would happen within days. Reporters recently interviewed her at the “Hor Taew Tak” movie premiere. Admitted the drama affected her mental health significantly. She suffered from panic attacks and depression. She also sought hospital treatment for her existing SLE (Lupus) condition. Mor Plai formally apologized with a “Wai” gesture. She asked the public to accept her back. She admitted her confidence in making predictions dropped. “I apologize for speaking words that hurt feelings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first forms of life on Earth were microbial, preceding the evolution of multicellular life by more than two billion years. Based on our current understanding of the origin of life, it is likely that the first life forms on any extraterrestrial world would also be microbial. Due to the extreme temperatures, radiation or aridity on most planetary surfaces, such extraterrestrial microbes would most likely dwell in subsurface environments. Earth's subsurface features a wide range of environments, including deep marine sediments, crustal aquifers, rock fracture fluids, hydrocarbon reservoirs, caves and permafrost soils. These environments are known to host an immense diversity of life forms, predominantly microbes that survive or even thrive under extreme conditions and energy scarcity. Life's ability to endure and possibly evolve in Earth's subsurface lends credence to the possible existence of life beyond our planet and provides a blueprint for the extraterrestrial life forms and biosignatures we might expect. The exploration of space via extraterrestrial samples analysed on Earth, in situ extraterrestrial analyses, and remote sensing continue to advance our search for and understanding of potential biosignatures on other planetary bodies. In this opinion article, we discuss the latest highlights in subsurface research and technology, how Earth's subsurface environments serve as models for potential environments on other planetary bodies, why insights into subsurface microbiomes inform the search for life elsewhere, and which technologies and developments will advance the field in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Conan O'Brien got screwed out of his NBC deal in 2010, I've distanced myself from late-night programming because it's always the same format. There's a monologue about the president, celebrity and musical guests, and rehearsed interviews that become increasingly ridiculous once you notice stars doing their press rounds, reciting the same jokes and stories verbatim from show to show. Late Night with the Devil has so much going for it, and I'm honestly mad I only just watched it for the first time this week. Across all three modes, the film thrives at generating unease, and it's a blast watching everything unravel as the story is told from multiple vantage points. Returning to poor ratings after time away to cope with his wife Madeleine's (Georgina Haig) death, Jack knows he needs a big win during Sweeps Week if his comeback is going to mean anything. His solution is a Halloween-themed episode centered on the occult, stacking the desk with guests who promise a lively, media-friendly discussion. Spoiler alert: nothing about this ends up being media friendly. Jack's first guest is Christou (Fayssal Bazzi), a psychic who claims he can communicate with the dead. At first, his act feels like a John Edwards-style cold-reading parlor trick, but everything shifts when he reveals a premonition about Jack's late wife that was never publicly disclosed. Moments later, Christou becomes violently ill and is rushed off the set, never to be seen again. The next segment brings out Carmichael Haig (Ian Bliss), a professional magician and outspoken skeptic who insists there must be a logical explanation for what just happened. Carmichael ups the ante by offering a substantial cash reward to anyone who can definitively prove the existence of supernatural phenomena, positioning himself as the voice of reason in a studio that's already starting to feel unsteady. While Carmichael assumes the entire thing is an elaborate ratings stunt, Jack and his producers scramble behind the scenes because they genuinely have no idea what's happening. Making matters worse, Jack begins to suspect that he may be more connected to the demonic presence than he ever realized. Unlike many found footage films that rely on shaky cameras and questionable edits that break immersion, Late Night with the Devil succeeds because of its setting. A television studio is the perfect environment for this approach. Color footage represents what actually aired, while black-and-white sequences capture what happens during commercial breaks as the crew desperately tries to regain control after each increasingly bizarre incident. That contrast grounds the premise and keeps everything feeling authentic. Even better is watching Jack and his guests tense up as a producer counts down to the moment they're live again, only for everyone to snap back into polished, performative mode the second the cameras roll. It feels like a real late-night show that went catastrophically off the rails, was quietly pulled from syndication, and then rediscovered years later. If you've felt like late-night programming hasn't been the same since Coco took his hit in 2010, Late Night with the Devil is exactly the kind of chaotic breath of fresh air you've been waiting for, and it's streaming on Hulu as of this writing.</p>

B&M (Burnham and Morrill) baked beans of Portland still bakes beans in huge iron pots in brick ovens before they can them for distribution around the country.
