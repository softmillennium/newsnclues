                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Christmas Eve jazz concert held annually for two decades at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was canceled by its host this year in protest of the addition of Donald Trump‘s name to the Washington, D.C., building. Chuck Redd, a jazz drummer and vibraphonist who has hosted the annual holiday “Jazz Jams“ at the Kennedy Center since 2006 (he took over for previous host Keter Betts, a jazz bassist who died in 2005), told the Associated Press last night that he decided to drop this year's event after Trump's name was added to the venue by its Trump-appointed board. Donald Trump Says Stephen Colbert Should Be "Put To Sleep" In Pre-Christmas Late-Night Tirade & Another Call For Broadcast License Terminations Democratic Congresswoman Sues To Remove Donald Trump From Kennedy Center's Name The concert would have included performances from seven jazz musicians. The addition of Trump's name to the venue appears to be in violation of a 1964 law that prohibits the addition of names or memorials to anyone other than John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in 1963. “Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center's name requires an act of Congress,” Beatty's lawsuit stated. “But on December 18 and 19, 2025—in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic—the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. Congress intended the Center to be a living memorial to President Kennedy—and a crown jewel of the arts for all Americans, irrespective of party. Unless and until this Court intervenes, Defendants will continue to defy Congress and thwart the law for improper ends.” And the previous Administration renaming military bases.” she said in a statement. (The renaming of the military bases that had Confederate names was authorized by an act of Congress in 2021.) Earlier this week, the American College Theatre Festival suspended its 60-year partnership with the Kennedy Center, with Festival officials saying the affiliation is “no longer viable” due to “circumstances and decisions that do not align with our organization's values.” Among the artists who have canceled Kennedy Center appearances post-Trump takeover are Issa Rae, Peter Wolf and a planned production of Hamilton, among others.

Brooklyn's rep did not immediately respond to Page Six's request comment. “Is this for your blocked parents?” one asked, while another joked that Brooklyn was “saying that to his parents.” A third wondered whether Brooklyn was “busy or blocked.” Fans urged Brooklyn to “keep drowning out the noise” as many predicted his mom, Victoria Beckham, was “watching and screaming.” The drama began earlier this month when Victoria, 51, reportedly “liked” one of her eldest son's posts about roasting a chicken. The “like” prompted a flurry of comments begging Brooklyn to make amends with his family, which reportedly prompted Brooklyn to block them. When reports surfaced that Victoria and David Beckham had unfollowed Brooklyn, Cruz came to their parents' defense. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son,” he wrote. A source recently told The Sun that David, 50, and Victoria are “heartbroken by what's gone on here.” Brooklyn's relationship with his family appeared to sour when he married Nicola Peltz in 2022. Earlier this year, Brooklyn and his wife opted not to attend David's splashy 50th birthday celebrations in London.</p>

Kendall stunned in an all-white vintage Mugler ensemble, while Kylie Jenner sported a black John Galliano number.

Kris' “James Bond”-themed party, notably, took place in November, with the star-studded guest list including Meghan Markle, Oprah Winfrey and Justin Bieber. “We all equally split the cost of the party because it's a family [thing],” she shared on a Dec. 17 episode of her “Khloé in Wonderland” podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On this week's Great Moments in Pop Star History episode of the Greatest Pop Star podcast, we discuss a low-key moment in Grande's career that ended up foreshadowing a lot of her future. In late 2015, Ariana Grande‘s seemingly frictionless ascendance to all-consuming pop superstardom had finally hit a tiny bit of turbulence. It was nothing she couldn't and wouldn't bounce back from, but in the meantime, she dropped a surprise release to celebrate the holiday season, and give both her sound and her career a little bit of a reset: the six-song EP Christmas & Chill. Sabrina Carpenter Gifts 'Man's Best Friend' Bonus Track Edition & Lyric Video on Christmas Eve Nicki Minaj Deactivates Instagram After Appearing With Erika Kirk at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest On this week's Great Moments in Pop Star History episode of the Greatest Pop Stars podcast, host Andrew Unterberger is joined by Billboard staff writer and longtime Arianator Kyle Denis to look back at 10 years of Christmas & Chill. We remember the Ariana Grande holiday releases that preceded it — including a song that's already well on its way to being an all-time seasonal standard — and then dive into why Chill has come to hold a particularly special place in the hearts of fans and of Grande herself, as well as how it ended up predicting a lot of the places she would go in her later secular releases. While doing so, we address all the most pressing questions around Grande's Christmas & Chill — how did an EP with no self-consciously big songs on it end up playing such a big part in her career? And perhaps most importantly: Is there a world in which Grande eventually ends up being Mariah Carey's successor as the Queen of Christmas?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The score soundtrack for Marty Supreme has arrived alongside the film's release today, Dec. 25. The project is composer Daniel “Oneohtrix Point Never” Lopatin's latest collaboration with filmmaker Josh Safdie and spans 23 tracks, drawing from “neoclassical orchestration, widescreen synth ecstasy, and tactile 80s hardware,” per a press release. The soundtrack also includes performances from Laraaji and vocal layers from Weyes Blood. “The music came from an obsession with rhythm, buoyancy, and motion—compiling hundreds of mallet and bell sounds to mirror Marty's mercurial, fast, and kinetic nature, which is like a table tennis ball itself,” said Lopatin in a statement. “I wanted the score to live between tradition and invention, with neoclassical elements grounding the world around him as he finds it with rules, limits, and pressure. The electronic textures lean into the future he imagines, even as those forces begin to contend with each other.” Earlier this week, Tiesto delivered “I Love You, Tokyo” from the soundtrack during his performance in front of the Pyramids of Giza. In addition to Safdie, Lopatin has worked with a host of boundary-pushing artists throughout his career including David Byrne, FKA Twigs, Anohni, and DJ Earl. Popular on Rolling Stone Marty Supreme, now in theaters, stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet, who has led a wild marketing campaign for the film — appearing atop the Las Vegas Sphere, which had been transformed into a giant ping pong ball, days before the movie's release.

Kathy Hochul — who didn't flee during the prolonged tech glitch. A pic showed the pair happily chomping on popcorn. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani previously attended the film's NYC premiere. Catsimatidis, 77, has a cameo in the movie, an awards front-runner. And so I got a new career at my age.” (Buzz is that he's actually quite good in his acting debut.) In fact, Cats has now gotten the Hollywood bug. Said a source of his cameo, “John loved it so much, he's looking to buy a movie studio. But don't expect any dark horse bids for Warner Bros. “He's thinking about doing something,” they said, adding Cats was talking at the event to NYC's film and TV commish.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following James Ransone‘s shocking death at age 46 last week, tributes to the late actor continue to pour out from fans and peers in Hollywood. On Tuesday, Channing Tatum remembered Ransone as “one of the realest” in a statement on his Instagram Story, after the pair starred together in writer/director Dito Montiel's 2011 crime thriller The Son of No One. “But you my friend… was one of the realest. I remember being in every conversation with you and just always being like I wonder what he's gonna say!!??? Chloë Sevigny, Spike Lee, Sean Baker and more have also paid tribute to Ransone following his death. Ransone was found dead by hanging on Friday in Los Angeles, having apparently died by suicide, according to the county medical examiner's report. He is survived by wife Jamie McPhee and their son. If you or someone you know is struggling with difficult life circumstances or uncomfortable thoughts and emotions call or text 988 to reach the national Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly a decade after his career as a child actor was jumpstarted by Stranger Things, Noah Schnapp wants to see more mental health resources available for his industry peers. The actor recently revealed that after thinking he didn't need it as a “happy-go-lucky kid,” he's since gone to therapy, which he agrees with Ariana Grande that it should be mandatory for children in their line of work. “It's hard to grow up in the public eye,” he told USA Today. Schnapp continued, “I was constantly saying the wrong things or being embarrassed by not taking certain things seriously that I should've, and then that lives on forever. Debuting its series finale on New Year's Eve, Schnapp was 11 when filming Season 1 of Netflix's Stranger Things, which kicked off its five-season run in 2016. “Through the years, it becomes like, ‘No, this is an abnormal life and you need some type of support system outside of your parents,'” said Schnapp. “Growing up, I never understood why people were depressed or turned to drugs or had eating disorders. With the first four episodes of Stranger Things, Season 5 now available to stream on Netflix, the next three roll out on Christmas, with the two-hour finale dropping on Dec. 31.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Brady and his eldest son, Jack, spent a relaxing day golfing on Christmas Eve together. The former NFL quarterback, 48, shared snaps of him and his 18-year-old son — whom he shares with ex Bridget Moynahan — golfing together via Instagram Stories on Wednesday. The father-son duo had no issue showing off their fit physiques. “Merry Xmas eve,” he wrote alongside a Christmas tree emoji. The holiday outing comes just weeks after Brady's ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, secretly married Joaquim Valente last month. A source familiar with Valente, 38, told us that he and the supermodel, 45, tied the knot surrounded by a small group of friends and family at home. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The intimate nuptials came after they welcomed a baby boy together in February. Brady shared a cryptic selfie after the news broke, in which he wore a white hoodie sweatshirt that read, “Forever young.” Despite fans speculating about the Super Bowl winner's reaction, Brady is “happy” for his ex-wife's new marriage, a source told the Daily Mail. “If he was upset, that would mean he still has feelings for her and that it would be unfair to the kids if he didn't want to see their mom happy and move on.” Brady and Bündchen were married for 13 years before they split in 2022. They share two children together: son Benjamin, 16, and daughter Vivian, 13.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 40 years, Melora Hardin doesn't need a time machine to remember how it felt being fired from Back to the Future. Following Micheal J. Fox‘s account of her dismissal from the role of his romantic lead Jennifer Parker, the actress admitted she “burst into tears” when she was cut from the 1985 movie for being taller than Fox's Marty McFly. “Back to the Future was a huge disappointment,” she told Entertainment Weekly. There were quite a few of those that I remember, you know, things that never really got made. I think people don't realize that when they look at it from the outside — you have to really be somebody who's comfortable with failure, and with putting yourself on the line all the time. That failure doesn't mean anything about you. In his recent memoir Future Boy, Fox explained that when he replaced leading man Eric Stoltz as the time-traveling teen, some felt co-star Hardin was suddenly too tall to play the character's girlfriend in the franchise's first installment. Noting that his height “worked in my favor when I was a teenage actor playing a younger kid,” Fox wrote that being short “turned against me as an adult, when I went up for romantic leads opposite taller actresses.” Fox continued, “I regret that this prejudice inadvertently affected another cast member in Back to the Future – Melora Hardin, the talented actress who had played Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, opposite the perfectly tall Eric Stoltz. “Melora, several inches taller than me, was replaced in the movie after I took over as Marty,” he added. “No one asked for my opinion, but I would have risen to Melora's defense,” added Fox. After Claudia Wells stepped in to play Jennifer in Robert Zemeckis' 1985 time-travel comedy, Elisabeth Shue took over the role in Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Part III (1990).
