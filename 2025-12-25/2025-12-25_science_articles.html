                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The object is a razor thin chain of galaxies embedded within a vast cosmic filament located about 140 million light years from Earth. These filaments also act as pathways that funnel matter and angular momentum into galaxies. Nearby filaments where many galaxies spin in the same direction, and where the entire structure itself appears to rotate, are especially valuable for studying how galaxies acquired their spin and gas. This thin structure lies within a much larger cosmic filament that stretches about 50 million light years and contains more than 280 additional galaxies. This finding challenges existing models and suggests that large scale cosmic structures may shape galaxy rotation more strongly or over longer periods than previously believed. This pattern indicates that the entire filament is rotating as a single structure. Co lead author Dr. Lyla Jung (Department of Physics, University of Oxford) explained why the discovery stands out: "What makes this structure exceptional is not just its size, but the combination of spin alignment and rotational motion. You can liken it to the teacups ride at a theme park. This dual motion gives us rare insight into how galaxies gain their spin from the larger structures they live in." The filament appears to be relatively young and largely undisturbed. Its abundance of gas rich galaxies and its low internal motion, described as a so called "dynamically cold" state, suggest it is still in an early stage of development. Because hydrogen is the key ingredient for forming new stars, galaxies with large hydrogen reserves are actively collecting or holding onto the fuel needed for star formation. Studying these systems offers a valuable view into early or ongoing phases of galaxy evolution. Hydrogen rich galaxies also serve as effective tracers of how gas moves along cosmic filaments. Atomic hydrogen is easily influenced by motion, making it especially useful for revealing how gas flows through filaments and into galaxies. The discovery may also help refine models of intrinsic galaxy alignments, which can interfere with measurements in upcoming weak lensing surveys. It helps us piece together how galaxies acquire their spin and grow over time." The radio data were combined with optical observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), revealing a cosmic filament that shows both coordinated galaxy spin and large scale rotation. Professor Jarvis said: "This really demonstrates the power of combining data from different observatories to obtain greater insights into how large structures and galaxies form in the Universe. Such studies can only be achieved by large groups with diverse skillsets, and in this case, it was really made possible by winning an ERC Advanced Grant/UKIR Frontiers Research Grant, which funded the co-lead authors."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research examines the theory that this biblical phenomenon was actually a comet, and subjects it to mathematical calculations regarding its potential trajectory. But what was the Star of Bethlehem, really? Naturally, one secular answer would be to suggest that the Star of Bethlehem never existed at all—that it was merely an invention by the author of Matthew to have Jesus of Nazareth fulfill another Messianic prophecy. The Gospel of Matthew is full of narrative elements that align with various Old Testament prophecies, from the virgin birth prophesied in Isaiah 7:14 to the thirty pieces of silver from Zechariah 11:13. But any attempt to dismiss the Star of Bethlehem as a mere literary flourish has to contend with the fact that there are real astronomical phenomena—and, in some cases, even documented events—that could explain the appearance of that famed “star of royal beauty bright, westward leading.” A new study has even put one cosmic candidate to the test. As reported in Scientific American, while some have posited that the Star of Bethlehem was a conjunction between Saturn and Jupiter, new research written by planetary scientist Mark Matney and published in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association puts considerable weight behind an alternative theory: that the star of Bethlehem was actually a comet. Scientific American summarizes that this Chinese treatise appears to suggest that “the strange star remained in the same constellation for 70 days—far too long for a comet.” That's because, even though our contemporary dating system of B.C.E. is rooted in what's called the Anno Domini dating system, meant to chart all history based on whether or not it occurred “Before Christ,” it turns out one of the things that came into existence in that “Before Christ” period was likely... Christ. Most scholars now agree that Jesus was likely born during the B.C./B.C.E. The famed monarch died in 4 B.C.E., so Jesus' birth needs to have occurred before then. Matney's research cites Dr. Clark's and builds on it, calculating which possible comet orbits this particular “broom star” could have taken. Matney also posits that the comet could have experienced a “temporary geosynchronous motion” wherein it would “temporarily match and counter Earth's rotation rate,” causing it to appear to stop in place in the sky. In doing so, he determined that “one particular June day, this comet could have moved in such a way as to appear to ‘go before' someone traveling from Jerusalem to Bethlehem and then ‘stop' nearly overhead for about two hours.” Michale Natale is a News Editor for the Hearst Enthusiast Group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bizarre Ecosystem Discovered More Than Two Miles beneath Arctic Ocean Deep down in the Arctic Ocean, life becomes bizarre. Off the coast of Greenland, the deep seafloor is littered with towering mounds made of crystallized methane and other gases. Known as the Freya hydrate mounds, these structures act like a “frozen reef,” a haven for creatures that have evolved to live in environments unlike any other on Earth. In a new paper published in Nature Communications, scientists document the deepest ever found of these mounds, at 3,640 meters—or some 2.26 miles—below the surface.

Incredibly, the mounds, which are also known as gas hydrate cold seeps, release methane gas flares some 3,300 meters up into the water—the tallest such flares ever recorded. “They are living geological features, responding to tectonics, deep heat flow, and environmental change.” Gathered at the mounds are chemosynthetic creatures—life that has evolved to depend not on sun-powered photosynthesis for food but on chemical reactions instead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at Rice University, working with international collaborators, has created the first environmentally friendly technology that can quickly trap and break down toxic "forever chemicals" (PFAS) in water. The project was led by Youngkun Chung, a postdoctoral fellow mentored by Michael S. Wong, a professor at Rice's George R. Brown School of Engineering and Computing. The effort also included Seoktae Kang, a professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and Keon-Ham Kim, a professor at Pukyung National University in South Korea. PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are man-made chemicals that date back to the 1940s. They have been used in many everyday products, including Teflon pans, waterproof clothing, and some food packaging. Research has linked exposure to liver damage, reproductive disorders, immune system disruption, and certain cancers. Many standard approaches rely on adsorption, meaning the chemicals stick to materials such as activated carbon or ion-exchange resins. These methods are common, but they have major limitations, including low efficiency, slow operation, limited capacity, and the buildup of additional contaminated waste that still has to be handled. "Our new approach offers a sustainable and highly effective alternative." The new approach is built around a layered double hydroxide (LDH) material made from copper and aluminum. Kim first identified this type of material while he was a graduate student at KAIST in 2021. As the team explored these compounds further, Chung found that a specific version containing nitrate could adsorb PFAS with unusually high performance. "To my astonishment, this LDH compound captured PFAS more than 1,000 times better than other materials," said Chung, a lead author of the study and now a fellow at Rice's WaTER (Water Technologies, Entrepreneurship and Research) Institute and Sustainability Institute. "It also worked incredibly fast, removing large amounts of PFAS within minutes, about 100 times faster than commercial carbon filters." Its ordered copper-aluminum layers, along with small charge imbalances, create a highly favorable surface where PFAS molecules can attach quickly and strongly. It also performed well in both static tests and continuous-flow setups, pointing to possible use in municipal water treatment systems and industrial cleanup. Working with Rice professors Pedro Alvarez and James Tour, Chung developed a process to thermally decompose PFAS after they are captured on the LDH material. Early testing showed the material could go through at least six complete cycles of capture, destruction, and renewal. "We are excited by the potential of this one-of-a-kind LDH-based technology to transform how PFAS-contaminated water sources are treated in the near future," Wong said. A list of all the researchers involved in this study and their institutional affiliations can be found here. This work was also funded by Saudi Aramco-KAIST CO2 Management, Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water Treatment (NEWT), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Engineering Research and Development Center grant (W912HZ-21-2-0050), Rice Sustainability Institute and Rice WaTER Institute.
