With tournament prize money, FIFA traditionally awards the national soccer federation, instead of payments directly to players. From there, federations determine how to split the money among players, staff and the federation; however, U.S. Soccer and several other nations now split winnings with the women's national teams as well. After a tense legal battle, the USWNT and USWNT signed a collective bargaining agreement in 2022 that lasts through 2028. The CBA required the U.S. men's and women's teams to pool and share equally 80% of prize money won by each at the 2026 and 2027 World Cups. For example, if the USMNT advanced to the Round of 16, they would earn at least $15 million in prize money. After allotting 20% of that to the U.S. Soccer for federation use, the players and staff of the men's and women's national teams would then split at least $6 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyiv Post looks back on what 2025 brought for Ukraine's national football team Kyiv Post looks back at the national team's performance over the past year: a journey of fantastic triumphs and painful defeats. For Serhiy Rebrov's men, the year began with high-stakes Nations League playoffs for a spot in the elite division. Their opponent was a star-studded and aggressive Belgian side. The first leg took place on March 20 in Murcia, Spain – a true football spectacle. Both teams played on the front foot, constantly seeking openings. However, the intensity took its toll, forcing Ukraine into three injury substitutions: Yukhym Konoplya, Oleksiy Sych, and Ivan Kalyuzhnyi. Fuelled by momentum, Vladyslav Vanat and Illia Zabarnyi added two more goals in a blistering five-minute spell. Ukraine held on for a spectacular victory, sparking widespread talk of guaranteed promotion. Three days later in Genk, the script flipped. The first half was a gritty affair dominated by fouls and yellow cards. Needing only to avoid a heavy defeat, Ukraine played defensively, but the strategy failed to pay off. The ticket to the elite division was decided in a nightmare 16-minute window, during which Belgium struck three times. The first window of 2025 ended in an emotional swing from triumph to collapse. In June, Ukraine participated in a new international friendly tournament: the Canadian Shield (Tournament of Four), alongside Canada, Côte d'Ivoire, and New Zealand. Against a strong Canadian side, Rebrov fielded his best 11 players. However, they were overwhelmed early on, trailing 4-0 by halftime. Late goals from Zabarnyi and Oleksandr Zinchenko made the 4-2 scoreline more respectable, but the performance left much to be desired. A rotated squad faced New Zealand (ranked 86th). Ukraine finished the tournament in second place behind hosts Canada. On Sept. 5, Ukraine began its World Cup 2026 qualifying campaign against the group's heavyweight, France. Despite a brave effort and several chances, Ukraine fell 2-0. There was no time to mourn; on Sept. 9, Ukraine faced Azerbaijan in Baku. It remains a mystery how the “Blue and Yellows” managed only one goal against Shahruddin Magomedaliyev. Azerbaijan equalized through a controversial penalty, and Ukraine dropped two vital points in a match they were expected to win comfortably. By October, every match was “do or die.” The third game, in Reykjavik, turned out to be one of Ukraine's best in years. The return match against Azerbaijan in Krakow was equally nerve-racking. A disallowed Nazar Voloshyn goal in stoppage time added to the drama, but Ukraine held on for a crucial 2-1 win. Heading into November, the coaching staff made a tactical gamble: they fielded a semi-reserve squad against France (losing 4-0) to keep the starters fresh for the decisive clash against Iceland three days later. Anatoliy Trubin produced arguably his best performance in a national shirt, making several key saves. 2025 was a year of “classic” Ukrainian football: difficult, unpredictable, and deeply emotional. As someone too young to remember Ukraine's legendary 2006 World Cup run, I am eagerly waiting for the day our flag flies at a global tournament again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our betting expert expects Newcastle to turn their fortunes around away from home and take advantage of United's depleted squad. However, inconsistencies continue to plague the red half of Manchester. This period could prove pivotal in shaping the remainder of their campaign. Key players are missing, with top scorer Bryan Mbeumo and influential Amad Diallo away on international duty. Kobbie Mainoo is also struggling with a calf issue. This leaves United severely weakened against a team just three points behind in the Premier League table. As a result, Eddie Howe's men find themselves down in 11th. Improvements are definitely needed if the Toon hope to push for a European spot this season. Manchester United expected lineup: Lammens, Martinez, Heaven, Shaw, Dalot, Ugarte, Mainoo, Dorgu, Cunha, Mount, Sesko Newcastle expected lineup: Ramsdale, Miley, Thiaw, Schar, Hall, Guimaraes, Tonali, Ramsey, Murphy, Woltemade, Gordon A worrying stat for Man United is that they've won only two of their last eight matches, despite some good performances. Two draws and a defeat in that run are enough to offer hope for the visitors. They've won only one of their eight away league matches this term. The Magpies have won one of their last four matches across all competitions, but they should take something away on Boxing Day. This historical dominance is a key statistic that the best betting sites use to justify shorter odds on the visitors than their current form might suggest. The Red Devils have struggled to protect their goal this season. Only Nottingham Forest (13), West Ham (20), and Wolves (23) have conceded more goals on home turf than Man United's 12. Amorim's charges have failed to keep a clean sheet in 16 of their 17 league matches this term. Newcastle's front line will be encouraged by those numbers ahead of their trip to Old Trafford. However, Howe's troops have also been shaky at the back. They've failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 10 league matches. Meanwhile, that figure rises to 62% for Man United's league matches at Old Trafford. As a result, Boxing Day could deliver goals at both ends. Nick Woltemade, brought in as Alexander Isak's replacement, has done a splendid job since his move to the Toon. The German has scored seven goals in 14 league matches, averaging a goal every two games. Nevertheless, the forward's skill in front of goal ensures he'll be one to watch when Newcastle visit Old Trafford.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born in Spain but a Uruguayan international dreaming of playing in the World Cup, and already one of the key players at SC Braga, Rodrigo Zalazar spoke exclusively with Flashscore about adapting to Portuguese football and the growth of Carlos Vicens' team throughout the current season. In what follows, Zalazar also talks about taking advantage of the Christmas season to hand out a few gifts to his teammates and to the club president, Antonio Salvador. Flashscore: You arrived in Braga with the reputation of a star and have shown that on the pitch, after spells in Spain, Germany, and Poland. You joined in 2023, and a lot has happened since then: a coaching change, injuries, a call-up to the national team, and then missing out on the squad. From 2023 until now, what have been the main challenges in adapting to Portuguese football and becoming the important player you are for SC Braga today? They made it easy for me to settle in quickly, but whenever you change teams, there are always challenges, and I think German and Portuguese football are quite different. "At first, it was a bit tough to understand the way football is played in Portugal, but thanks to the club and everyone who helped me, I improved, and I think I've raised my level season after season. You've had several coaches and are currently in great form. Do you feel like a freer Zalazar on the pitch, with a different dynamic under Carlos Vicens? Do you feel more useful and comfortable in the system the Spanish coach has brought to Braga? "I've learned a lot from all my coaches. But it's true that this year, Carlos Vicens' style of play really suits me as a player. "This season, I'm playing closer to the box, and our style involves a lot of movement, which I really enjoy. The team is doing well, and individual stats are always linked to the team's work. Of course, someone has to score the goals, and this year I've been lucky to get more goals myself." We've seen you play on the right, the left, in more attacking and more defensive roles. Where do you feel most comfortable on the pitch? This Braga side are now playing great football, but the start of the season was shaky. What was that moment, and when did you feel, in the dressing room, that it was time to react? We knew it was a completely different style from previous years, but I remember talking to him and saying that, in the end, what's needed is time for the team to get the ideas clear. "Once we started to understand how we wanted to play, you could see it on the pitch, in the recent results - the team feels good, comfortable, and is always causing problems for opponents, which is important, and scoring goals." But it was almost from one game to the next that we started to see a different Braga. We knew we had to step up because what we were doing wasn't enough, especially with the level of Liga Portugal, which gets better every year. We had a team talk in the dressing room and said we had to take responsibility, especially the more experienced players. Is the team already at its peak? "There's always room for improvement, but I think we're in a good place. You're under contract until 2028, and in a good mood in the dressing room, you showed off tattoos of Braga's name on your back and chest. Is it still a long way off before we see you declare Braga as the club of his heart? Since I arrived, everyone- from the fans to the staff - has treated me really well and shown me a lot of love. In the end, with my work, I also earned their trust, and these are things I do to create content here (laughs). "I'm very happy here, it's a club that will always have a special place in my career, where I've had some of my best years. But obviously, I also come from clubs that made me very happy, like Schalke 04, which, for me, gave me everything as a person and a player - it's a club that will always be in my heart. But I think Braga can share that space with Schalke. Both clubs are close to my heart." But do you see yourself staying at Braga for more years? Or are you looking for new challenges in other leagues? Where does your ambition for the future lie? Of course, in football, there are always opportunities to leave, to try something new, but I haven't really thought about that. I'm happy here, focused on playing, and whatever happens in the future will happen. I'm content here, fully focused, and I want to keep winning and stay in good form." Your future could depend on a national team call-up. In 2024, due to some injuries, you were out for a while. Now you're being called up more regularly. Do you see the 2026 World Cup as a goal? Are you working towards that, knowing the competition for places in Uruguay's midfield is fierce? "Playing in a World Cup is every player's dream. It depends a lot on how things go for me at Braga. Do you think that Bielsa might give preference to players in European leagues or competitions over others? "No, I think it depends more on how the player is doing physically and football-wise, not whether they're playing in European competitions. Would this be your golden opportunity as a player? "Yes, of course it would be tough, but that's football, and I'm not the one who makes that decision. If it were up to me, about 200 Uruguayan players would go to the World Cup (laughs). "It's a dream everyone has, and having already been part of the national team and shared moments with my teammates, it would be a disappointment. But you have to keep working - you never know when another chance might come, so I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and keep working hard." Have you started studying Spain, Cape Verde, and Saudi Arabia, who are in Uruguay's group? "There's no need - everyone knows the players in those teams, and they'll be great games." On a more personal note, who is Zalazar? "Above all, I'm a very happy person. I have a very peaceful life, a family that means everything to me, but outside of football, I'm also someone who always tries to make others happy. I have some hidden talents I haven't shown yet, but the club's Golden Gala this year might be a good time for that." To Bright Arrey-Mbi, another of your teammates?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As global football closes a relentless year and accelerates toward a supersized 2026 World Cup, the sport's governors are doubling down on expansion, convinced that the appetite for football is limitless – even as concerns over quality, fatigue and balance grow louder. FIFA points to the past 12 months as proof of concept. Its expanded 32-team Club World Cup in the United States drew 2.4 million fans, culminating in an 81,000-strong crowd for the final as Chelsea swept aside Paris Saint-Germain. The gulf between elite and aspirant was impossible to ignore. Such mismatches, once rare, are expected to multiply when a record 48 nations gather across the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer. The expanded World Cup will stretch to 104 matches – a marathon that promises spectacle but threatens exhaustion. Player welfare has become a flashpoint, with FIFPro warning that injury rates and burnout are climbing amid an ever-crowded calendar that shows no sign of easing. Yet history suggests that when the tournament reaches its sharp end, familiarity will prevail. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the defining players of the 21st century – have never faced each other at a World Cup. Neither has shown any appetite for fading quietly. With both icons operating far from Europe's center of gravity, space has opened for a new standard-bearer. No player seized that space more emphatically than Ousmane Dembele. The Ballon d'Or and FIFA Player of the Year winner produced the season of his life, scoring 33 goals in 49 appearances as Paris Saint-Germain finally fulfilled their ambition – storming to a historic treble capped by a ruthless 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan in the Champions League final. Dembele edged elite company for the game's top honors. Barcelona's teenage phenomenon Lamine Yamal inspired a 28th La Liga title. Mohamed Salah delivered a staggering 47 goal involvements to drive Liverpool to the Premier League crown in Arne Slot's dream debut season. Harry Kane, Bundesliga top scorer again as Bayern reclaimed the title, finished a distant 13th – a reflection of how crowded the summit has become. Barcelona and Spain star Aitana Bonmati claimed a third straight Ballon d'Or Feminin, though Euro 2025 ended in heartbreak as England edged Spain on penalties in the final. Record crowds followed throughout the tournament, prompting FIFA to confirm an expanded Women's Club World Cup from 2027. UEFA's revamped 36-team Champions League silenced early skeptics, with 27 clubs still in contention heading into the final matchday. While the format added drama, it also favored financial heavyweights – none more so than PSG, who stumbled early before catching fire when it mattered most. Six English clubs qualified for the 2025-26 Champions League, underlining domestic dominance fueled by a staggering 3 billion pounds ($4.05 billion) spent in a single summer window – more than the rest of Europe's top leagues combined. FIFA introduced faster semi-automated offside decisions, and next year's World Cup will be the most technologically advanced ever, featuring the AI-embedded Trionda match ball designed to assist officials in real time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ousmane Dembele emerged from a career plagued with inconsistencies to win the Golden Ball in 2025, and he was among a crowded field of contenders as the 2026 race got going. Dembele largely secured the award off the back of his performances in helping Paris Saint-Germain win their first European Cup, and the Champions League is yet again likely to have a big say on the Ballon d'Or battle this time around. However, it's also a World Cup year, so there is a chance that the eventual winner doesn't emerge until the summer in North America. Don't forget, too, that the Africa Cup of Nations is running from late December and into January, meaning there could be some players who don't only shine for their clubs but also impress at two major tournaments over the course of the campaign. The Ballon d'Or race is a marathon not a sprint, and it's worth bearing in mind that Dembele didn't emerge as a potential victor until midway through the 2024-25 campaign. However, with the European season reaching its halfway mark, GOAL's Ballon d'Or Power Rankings are well up and running as we track the likeliest winners of the Golden Ball over the coming weeks and months: Widely regarded as the best right-back in the world, Hakimi placed sixth in the 2025 Ballon d'Or voting after a season in which he contributed as much to the PSG attack as he did to ensure they remained solid at the back. Hakimi had made a decent start to the season before suffering an ankle injury in late October, and what places him so high in our rankings is the potential for him to shine on the international stage. Messi proved to be a class apart on his way to winning a second-straight MLS MVP award as he provided six goals and seven assists in Miami's six play-off matches alone, and certainly that success at club level would be taken into account if he can help Argentina defend their global crown in North America in 2026. For all the talent around him, Messi remains at the heart of the Albiceleste's line up, and thus any triumph in his new homeland will likely be attributed largely to him once more. Liverpool fans might be forgiven for wondering whether their season might not be in such turmoil had Luis Diaz not been sold over the summer. The versatile forward played an important role in the Reds' title triumph of 2024-25, but his desire for a new challenge led to the Anfield outfit accepting a €75 million (£65.5m/$88m) bid from Bayern Munich for the Colombia international. Diaz hasn't looked back since, having struck up a fine understanding with Harry Kane and the rest of his Bayern team-mates. Some of his strikes in the Bundesliga have been stunning, while his double to beat PSG in the Champions League was the kind of match-winning display that catches Ballon d'Or voters' eyes, even if his subsequent red card means he won't be seen again in the competition until January at the earliest. Factor in Diaz will be playing at his first World Cup this summer, and he has all the makings of a Golden Ball contender. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Anyone who predicted that Michael Olise would struggle to make the step up from Crystal Palace to Bayern Munich has been sorely mistaken, with the wideman having strung together a year or so of fantastic performances for the Bundesliga champions. Equally capable of scoring as he is creating goals for others, the 24-year-old has grown into one of the most fearsome forward players in the German top flight while also making his mark on the Champions League. Olise's club performances have also helped him lock down a starting spot in the France line-up despite intense competition for places. Vitinha came a long way since his underwhelming loan spell at Wolves five years ago to finish on the Ballon d'Or podium in 2025, and the PSG dictator-in-chief is now regarded by many as the best midfielder on the planet. Certainly, he has played in such a fashion to begin the new season, and even looks to be adding more goal and assist output to his game, as highlighted by his hat-trick to beat Tottenham in the Champions League in November. He will also form part of a Portugal squad next summer that, after winning the Nations League, has a genuine belief that they can triumph at the World Cup. Should they do so, then Vitinha will likely have played a massive part. Declan Rice announced himself as one of the world's elite midfielders with his performances against Real Madrid in last season's Champions League, and the Arsenal man has gone from strength to strength since. Rice is now one of the Gunners' most important players as they go in search of not just the Premier League title but also a first-ever Champions League triumph, after making a perfect start to their European campaign. Rice's driving runs, defensive contributions and set-piece deliveries mean games rarely pass him by, while he is also a certain starter for a Thomas Tuchel-led England side that is looking more than capable of ending 60 years of hurt by winning the 2026 World Cup. There are those who still believe he needs to produce more decisive moments in the biggest games, while there are concerns that the number of matches Yamal has played at such a young age are leading to an increase in injury problems. Barca, meanwhile, look well short of being Champions League contenders right now due to their defensive deficiencies, meaning Yamal might need to lean heavily on his displays for Spain at the World Cup if he is to take home the Ballon d'Or. Almost from the moment he emerged as a teenager at Monaco, the forward has been anointed a future Golden Ball winner. But having just celebrated his 27th birthday, Mbappe is still waiting for his opportunity to stand atop the podium in Paris. So far, he could have done little more to give himself the best chance possible to end that wait, with Mbappe having carried a struggling Real Madrid this term with a number of match-winning goals. He has also saved the best international performances of his career for World Cups, and so expect the France captain to go the distance in this race. After an underwhelming season by his own lofty standards, Erling Haaland has gone into 'Terminator mode' this time around, becoming a one-man battering ram for Manchester City as they aim to re-establish themselves as challengers for both the Premier League and Champions League. Already well on his way to a third Golden Boot in four seasons, defences have been powerless to stop the 25-year-old thus far. Haaland's stunning start would have put him in the Ballon d'Or conversation anyway, but his chances this time are boosted by Norway's first qualification for the World Cup since 1998, giving their star striker the chance to appear at a major tournament for the first time. The Scandinavians are merely dark horses to triumph in North America, but Haaland could yet use the global stage to put a bow on his Golden Ball bid if all goes well at club level. There will always be those who don't fully appreciate Harry Kane, but now that he has got the trophy monkey off his back that so many used to question him over the years, the Bayern Munich striker looks like a man on a mission, utterly determined to show that he is also worthy of individual recognition after starting the campaign at a record-breaking pace. As well as scoring mountains of goals, Kane has showcased his all-round game to devastating effect for the Bundesliga champions, and if he can maintain this form, then further silverware will be coming his way at the end of the season. England fans, meanwhile, are praying that their captain doesn't again run out of steam before the summer, with Kane key to the Three Lions' hopes of ending their agonising wait for a major honour at international level.</p>
