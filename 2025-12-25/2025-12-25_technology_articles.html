"Pieper emphasized that current over-the-counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer." As someone who's seen both cancer and Alzheimer's up close, that would be a very easy choice. We have no idea whether this would work at all or how it would work at all in humans. We have one experiment in mice, which as you say can't have Alzheimer's.This is a nice step, like developments in fusion energy. This is a nice step, like developments in fusion energy. there are studies about this compound from a decade ago, kinda doubt it's going to be a breakthrough at this point I thought it was pretty common for elderly pets Does this mean that people are having to trade Alzheimer in exchange for high risk of cancer? In terms of risk-benefit analysis, if this stuff actually cures Alzheimer's, then even a 10x increased risk of cancer (all types) is acceptable, as Alzheimer's is frequently a fate worse than death whereas cancer can be managed whilst keeping your personality and sanity intact. In reality, the increased risk of cancer from something like NMN is perhaps 1.005x. To all appearances, totally negligible.The problem, for Pieper, is that NMN/NR/NADH are ubiquitous and cost pennies per dose.

The same is true of many diagnoses like pneumonia, cancer, alopecia, essential tremor: there's multiple different groups that would benefit from different things, and if we had better ways to identify the groups, we'd give them what works for them instead of wasting their time with the wrong treatment. As an example, antibiotics won't work for viral pneumonia and in addition to wasting the patient's time, actually harm your microbiome. If you had a perfect way to know which is which, you'd always get the right treatment.Precision medicine takes this even further. When enough words, framing, and unstated important premises are omitted, it crosses over from the realm of incomplete or misleading into plain outright lying in my worldview.They claim "Reverses advanced AD in mice." What they did is reverse symptoms in genetic models.They claim to "Restore NAD+ homeostasis," ignoring that NAD might not even be causally related to Alzheimer's, just a side effect. It's the Tau thing all over again.The claim: "Conservative molecular signatures" when in reality, 5xFAD mice are poor predictors of human clinical success to such a degree that it's statistically more common for mice studies to NOT transfer to human biology than to do so.They also make unsupported claims like "Safer than NAD+ precursors (supplements)," when this is a pre-clinical assumption. No human toxicity trials are mentioned in this context, and there are always MASSIVE differences when switching to real human studies. It might be correct, but there's no basis to say that based on this study.Also, the senior author owns the company. Is low NAD+ the fire, or just the ashes?Why should we believe this works in humans when the last 500 'cures' in 5xFAD mice failed?Are you regrowing a brain, or just cleaning up a dirty one?How does one molecule fix five unconnected problems simultaneously?

A failure of wishful thinking over rational evaluation. The article is suspect at best and this doesn't even in the slightest align with my experience with LLMs at work (it's created more work for me).The layoff always smelled like it was because of the economy. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/aft...It isn't regret, they are trying to sell their Agentforce product.

At the time, it was such a big deal to a lot of us because it was a signal what could eventually happen to the rest of us white collar workers.Of course, it could still happen, as maybe AI systems just need another few years to mature before trying to fully replace jobs like this...... although, one thing I agree with you is that there isn't much info online on these quotes from Salesforce executives, so could be made up.

I can't imagine delegating if real money/customers were on the line without even more scrutiny. one example - I've been vibe coding some stuff, and even though a pretty comprehensive set of tests are passing, I still end up reading all of the code. if I'm being honest some of the decisions the AI makes are a bit opaque to me so I end up spending a bunch of time asking it why (of course there's no real ego there, but bare with me...), re-reading the code, thinking about whether that actually makes sense.

In reality, even an ASI won't know your intent unless you communicate it clearly and unambiguously. I recently came to this realization as well, and it now seems so obvious. I feel dumb for not realizing it sooner. Is there any good writing or podcast on this topic? If anything I've noticed the bar being lowered by the pro-AI set, except for humans, because the prevailing belief is that LLMs must already be AGI but any limitations are dismissed as also being human limitations, and therefore evidence that LLMs are already human equivalent in any way that matters.And instead of the singularity we have Roko's Basilisk.

Though I'm a bit surprised they have that much support staff. If your pay is 400 times average employee salary because of your unique strategic vision, surely firing 4000 people based on faulty assumptions should come with proportional consequences?Or does the high risk, high reward, philosophy only apply to the reward part? The root problem is they /estimated/.> “We assumed the technology was further along than it actually was,” one executive said privately... and /assumed/. No, someone just wanted their bonus for being forward-thinking, paradigm-shifting, opex cutters. Also probably a part of their go-to-market strategy. Unless people wise up to the fact what's destroying jobs here isn't "Artificial Intelligence".It is simply natural stupidity. I imagine AI house of cards will collapse soon and he'll be remembered as the person who enshittified Windows after the board fires him.

Texas-based HGP Intelligent Energy sent a proposal to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to repurpose two retired U.S. Navy nuclear reactors for use in an AI data center project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, under President Donald Trump's Genesis Mission. The USS Nimitz, which entered service in 1975, is already on its last deployment before entering retirement, while nearly a third of Los Angeles-class SSNs, which first started patrols in 1976, have already been decommissioned and withdrawn from service. If granted, this will be the first time a military reactor has been repurposed for civilian use. This move is expected to cost between $1 million to $4 million per megawatt — although this might seem steep, this is still a fraction of the cost of building an entirely new nuclear power plant or the various small modular reactors being proposed by tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia. Aside from being more affordable than a completely new build, it would also give a second life to these retired reactors, which would otherwise be just disposed of at DOE's Hanford Site. Once operational, HGP Intelligent Energy says it will have a revenue-sharing program with the government and establish a decommissioning fund. The latter is especially crucial as dealing with retired nuclear materials is insanely expensive, with the dismantling of the U.S.'s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier costing over ten times more compared to its last conventional super carrier. “We already know how to do this safely and at scale,” says HGP chief executive Gregory Forero.

An enterprising Russian enthusiast has taken to building his own memory amid the extreme price increases driven by a global shortage. As the world suffers from dried-up memory inventories, some people are wondering when things will go back to normal, while others are looking toward exotic alternatives like SODIMM-to-UDIMM adapters. Now, a bunch of modders in Russia have taken matters into their own hands and are proposing a radically inventive solution: making your own RAM by assembling the relevant parts yourself. The idea comes from Russian YouTuber PRO Hi-Tech's Telegram channel, where a local enthusiast known as "Vik-on" already performs VRAM upgrades for GPUs, so this is a relatively safe operation for him. Still, you can find SK Hynix and Samsung chips across Chinese marketplaces if you search for the correct part number, as shown in the attached screenshots. Moreover, the Telegram thread says it would cost roughly 12,000 Russian Rubles ($152) to build a 16 GB stick with "average" specs, which is about the same as a retail 16 GB kit. There's also a ZenTimings snapshot showing CL28 timings, claiming that even relatively high-end DDR5 RAM can be built using this method, but it won't be cost-effective. Therefore, it doesn't make too much sense just yet to get the BGA rework station out and assemble your own DDR5. We were able to spot DDR5 ICs on AliExpress ourselves, and GDDR6(X) was even more common, so there's certainly a market for it. On the contrary, used kits can be used to salvage memory chips cheaply, or laptop memory can come in handy since it uses the same ICs. We've actually seen something similar with DDR4 memory before, and at one point, China's crackdown on smuggling had caused reballed DRAM prices to drop further, but we're far from that now. Competition breeds innovation, goes the saying, but desperation can often drive similar motivations, as is evident in this latest development in the ongoing memory crisis.

Take, for instance, this iBuyPower Slate Mesh gaming desktop PC that pairs 32GB of DDR5 memory with an AMD CPU and GPU, available at a discounted price of $999.99 on Best Buy. With a listed retail price of $1,249.99, you save $250 and avoid the inflated cost of purchasing memory separately. The system is powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X, a reliable gaming CPU with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a maximum boost clock of 5.5 GHz. The CPU is cooled using a single tower cooler, which should be adequate unless the CPU is pushed to its limits. There's also 32GB of DDR5 memory, and while it is slightly slower at 5200 MT/s, there's nothing really to complain about, especially considering the ongoing RAM crisis. Graphics duties are handled by the Radeon RX 9060 XT, AMD's latest budget-driven GPU offering, though it is the 8GB VRAM variant. This may become a limitation if you plan on playing modern AAA titles at 1440p or higher with high-resolution textures. The included power supply unit is rated at 600W, which is sufficient for this configuration, but if you plan to upgrade in the future, you will need a more powerful unit. The $999 prebuilt gaming PC also includes a full-size RGB backlit keyboard and a gaming mouse from iBuypower. Kunal Khullar is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

Groq is an American AI startup developing Language Processing Units (LPUs) that it positions as significantly more efficient and cost-effective than standard GPUs. Groq's LPUs are ASICs, which are seeing growing interest from many firms due to their custom design, which is better suited to certain AI tasks, such as large-scale inference. Groq has accused Nvidia in the past of predatory tactics over exclusivity, claiming that potential customers remain fearful of Nvidia's inventory allotment if they're found talking to competitors, such as Groq, historically. “We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads... While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.” — Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO (as per CNBC). Earlier this year, Groq built its first data center in Europe to counter Nvidia's AI dominance, shaping up to be an underdog story that challenged a behemoth on cost-to-scale. Now, Groq's own LPUs will be deployed in Nvidia's AI factories, as the license covers "inference technology," according to SiliconANGLE. As part of this transaction, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra will be hired by Nvidia, along with other employees. Ross previously worked at Google, where he helped develop the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Simon Edwards, Groq's current finance chief, will step up as the new CEO under this refreshed structure. Acquiring a company's think tank like this is referred to as an acquihire. Meta's AI hiring sprees also fall under this category, along with Nvidia's recent recruitment of Enfabrica's CEO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prominent Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac says he was wrongly branded a convicted sex offender by Google's AI Overview feature, leading concert organizers to cancel a gig last week. Before we continue, I'll need you to watch the music video for “Sleepy Maggie” by Ashley MacIsaac (with Scottish Gaelic vocals by Mary Jane Lamond). For best results, light up a clove cigarette before pushing play: Anyway, according to an article in The Globe and Mail on Tuesday, the guy in that video with the fiddle, Ashley MacIsaac, was preparing to perform at the Sipekne'katik First Nation community in central Nova Scotia when organizers suddenly backed out, apparently having read that MacIsaac had ghastly sounding convictions on his record for sexual assault and “internet luring.” You probably remember the controversy over the Google AI Overviews feature from back in 2024, when it debuted, and quickly became a joke after telling people to put glue on pizza and such. For my part, I gave the feature six months to improve before reviewing it, and found a number of bizarre error types it was still prone to making in what I believed were plausible simulations of real world use cases. There's a choice quote in the Globe and Mail from Clifton van der Linden, an assistant professor at McMaster University who has researched AI misinformation. “We're seeing a transition in search engines from information navigators to narrators,” he told the newspaper. AI Overviews are original snippets of text, sort of like chatbot answers made fresh to order when a term gets searched on Google, and they're derived from whatever Google can find online that seems to relate to the subject you're searching. When issues arise – like if our features misinterpret web content or miss some context – we use those examples to improve our systems, and may take action under our policies.” That newspaper also says Google “amended search results for the musician.” Also, a representative from the Sipekne'katik First Nation community told MacIsaac they “We deeply regret the harm this error caused to your reputation, your livelihood, and your sense of personal safety,” and told him he was welcome to perform there in the future, he says. The Globe and Mail didn't hear back from Sipekne'katik First Nation when they requested a comment. The McDonald's Christmas AI monstrosity has left people desperate for something to like. In 2025, if you wanted to do layoffs, AI was a great option for pinning the blame. The deal should help Google develop more data centers that no one wants. A chatbot never forgets (unless you opt out of memories).</p>
