                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Theta Labs, a cryptocurrency startup based in California, is currently embroiled in legal trouble following accusations of market manipulation and fraudulent business practices. The company, which focuses on digital collectibles and NFTs, is being sued by two former executives. Jerry Kowal and Andrea Berry, who both previously held leadership roles at Theta Labs, claim that CEO Mitch Liu orchestrated a scheme to artificially inflate the value of the company's digital products, particularly NFTs tied to celebrity partnerships. The lawsuits, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in December 2025, accuse Liu of using insider information and deceptive methods to benefit financially at the expense of employees, investors, and consumers. Can you believe that @Theta_Network paid @katyperry 8.5 Million to license her images for the shittiest NFT scam ever? The suits allege that Liu engaged in “pump-and-dump” schemes, where the value of Theta's THETA token was artificially inflated before being sold off, causing significant financial losses. Kowal and Berry allege that Liu even manipulated bids on NFTs, including those related to pop star Katy Perry, to mislead consumers into overpaying. Theta Labs initially gained attention in 2021 after it secured a partnership with pop star Katy Perry to release NFTs linked to her Las Vegas residency. However, Kowal's lawsuit alleges that Theta used fake bids on Perry's NFTs to inflate demand and drive up prices artificially. Katy Perry herself is not accused of any wrongdoing in the lawsuits, and her representatives have not yet commented on the matter. Beyond the manipulation of Perry NFTs, the lawsuits also highlight other instances where Theta allegedly misrepresented its relationships with high-profile brands and celebrities. While Theta did purchase Google Cloud products, the company misrepresented the nature of its relationship with Google as a partnership rather than a customer agreement. These misleading claims, if true, further reinforce the accusations that Theta Labs was using deceptive practices to create an illusion of success and market legitimacy. Such actions, according to the whistleblowers, were aimed at manipulating stock prices and making the company appear more influential than it truly was. This sharp decline mirrors the accusations of market manipulation and fraud against Theta Labs. The lawsuits also highlight how Liu allegedly profited from insider knowledge by buying and selling tokens during key announcements, which caused the token's value to spike temporarily before it crashed. Theta Labs, like many other crypto firms, now faces the consequences of its alleged actions, with former executives seeking to hold the company accountable for its alleged market manipulation and fraudulent behavior.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a major move for Kyrgyzstan's crypto ambitions, President Sadyr Japarov announced that the country's newly launched stablecoin, KGST, has been listed on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Japarov emphasized that the stablecoin's introduction and its listing on Binance would provide a more efficient method for international transactions. “This initiative will contribute to the development of cross-border payments,” Japarov said. He mentioned that many more nation-backed stablecoins would be coming to the platform soon. Since April, Binance has provided technical expertise to the Kyrgyz government. This partnership has helped the country craft favorable legislation and enhance its crypto infrastructure. More nation-backed stablecoins are expected to follow, signaling a growing trend of state-supported digital currencies in global markets. Kyrgyzstan has demonstrated increasing support for digital assets over the past year. This is evidenced by the country's recent passage of crypto-related legislation aimed at creating a state crypto reserve. It also reflects a broader trend among countries seeking to create stablecoins backed by local currencies. These efforts are becoming increasingly common as nations explore ways to integrate digital currencies with traditional financial systems. The listing of KGST on Binance also aligns with a broader global trend in which countries are exploring or launching their own stablecoins tied to national currencies. For instance, Japan launched its first yen-pegged stablecoin, JPYC, in October. This stablecoin is designed to trade at parity with the yen, backed by bank deposits and Japanese government bonds. Similarly, the European Union is working towards launching a euro-pegged stablecoin, expected by 2026. Additionally, the UAE has started considering a dirham-pegged stablecoin to facilitate consumer payments. These efforts suggest that countries around the world are increasingly interested in creating stablecoins as part of their national digital finance strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the final week of December, Pudgy Penguins made a bold leap from digital collectibles into physical spectacle by lighting up the Las Vegas Sphere with custom holiday animations. The Sphere isn't just advertising space – it's cultural real estate. The Sphere campaign is part of a longer arc for Pudgy Penguins. Over the past two years, the project has quietly transformed itself from a speculative NFT collection into a consumer-facing brand with real-world touchpoints. Rather than selling NFTs or pushing token mechanics, the visuals focused on character recognition, emotional appeal, and holiday warmth – signals designed for everyday consumers, not just crypto-native users. The Las Vegas Sphere isn't just another advertising surface. Its scale, exclusivity, and cost instantly separate it from conventional digital placements. Brands that appear on the Sphere aren't simply buying impressions – they're staking a claim in mainstream cultural space. The Sphere activation worked on several levels simultaneously for Pudgy Penguins. This strategy is quite different from previous waves of cryptocurrency marketing, which mostly relied on exchange sponsorships, logo saturation, and fleeting buzz. Pudgy Penguins used the Sphere to reposition itself as a consumer-facing property that can thrive much beyond Web3's typical bounds rather than chasing attention. More News: Hyperliquid Responds to HYPE Shorting Concerns Amid Growing Market Dominance The holiday takeover reflects a broader shift in how leading crypto projects think about growth. Instead of chasing floor prices or short-term engagement, Pudgy Penguins is investing in brand memory – the kind that survives market cycles. Cultural presence, especially in iconic public spaces, compounds differently than onchain metrics. Pudgy Penguins' Sphere takeover wasn't about NFTs, tokens, or trading volume.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HoneyBadger BFT (HBBFT) consensus, which has been successfully pioneered and deployed by DMD Diamond in its v4 mainnet, provides a mathematically elegant solution to common blockchain limitations. This is achieved by fundamentally changing the negotiation paradigm between nodes. This strategic focus has clearly established DMD Diamond in a niche where its unique consensus engine can make it the preferred Layer 1 for projects requiring maximum decentralization. This means that for the network to function, nodes must have consistent clocks or wait for a message within a certain timeout. One node proposes a block, and the others vote. HBBFT is the first practical asynchronous BFT consensus algorithm, and DMD Diamond is the first blockchain to combine this cooperative consensus with EVM compatibility. HBBFT makes no assumptions about message delivery times. The DMD Diamond network continues to function even if messages between nodes are delayed indefinitely. In DMD's HBBFT implementation, there is no single leader. It uses a combination of three complex cryptographic primitives, which DMD Diamond utilizes to deliver industry-first features. This leads to MEV (Miner Extractable Value)—frontrunning and censorship. In DMD Diamond, transactions are encrypted by the user. Validators blindly agree on the order of transactions. Decryption occurs only after the order is fixed and cannot be changed. Instead of each node broadcasting a full block of data to all others (which clogs the communication channel), HBBFT splits the data into N fragments. To recover the original data, it is sufficient to collect any N-f fragments (where f is the number of possible dishonest nodes). This is a mechanism that allows all nodes to agree on which encrypted data packets will be included in the next block without electing a leader. DMD Diamond's implementation of HBBFT solves the scalability and decentralization problem not by overclocking hardware, but by eliminating the bottleneck—time synchronization and dependence on a leader. By allowing nodes to operate at different speeds and process data in parallel, DMD Diamond creates a network that is: This can make DMD Diamond an ideal candidate for the next generation of DeFi applications and enterprise blockchains, where reliability and fairness are more important than hype.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In today's fast-paced world, managing medical records securely and efficiently is a massive challenge. Traditional systems rely on centralized databases that are prone to hacks, data loss, and privacy breaches. This powerful combo promises unbreakable security, real-time data tracking, and seamless access for authorized users only. Remote patient monitoring is a lifeline, especially in countries with vast geographies and limited healthcare access like India. With rising cases of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart conditions, RPM lets doctors track patients' vitals from afar – reducing hospital visits, cutting costs, and even curbing infection risks as seen during COVID-19. Imagine elderly patients or those in rural areas getting continuous care without leaving home. IoT devices like wearable sensors make this possible by collecting heart rate, blood oxygen, and body temperature in real-time. But here's the catch: all this sensitive data needs ironclad protection. Instead of one vulnerable point, data spreads across a network of nodes – making it nearly impossible for hackers to tamper with records. Regulations like India's Personal Data Protection Bill or the US's HIPAA demand this level of security. Blockchain delivers, pseudonymizing data and using smart contracts for automated permissions. This RPM unit gathers vitals every minute and sends them as JSON packets to a Node.js app, which forwards them to the blockchain. But medical reports (PDFs, X-rays, MRIs) are too bulky for direct blockchain storage – they'd bloat the network and spike costs. Reports go to IPFS, generating a unique hash stored on the blockchain with patient details. It's permissioned, uses efficient RAFT consensus (no energy-guzzling mining), and handles high throughput – perfect for healthcare unlike slower public chains like Ethereum. Real RPM unit over 8 hours sent 480 transactions – all recorded perfectly. Reads are even faster: up to 160 TPS with 0.01s latency. Comparisons show it outperforms in throughput while adding IPFS for scalability. This blockchain and IoT convergence paves the way for smarter healthcare. Add ECG/EEG sensors, measure energy use, or scale to thousands of patients. With government pushes like Ayushman Bharat, adoption is imminent. Patients gain control, doctors get real-time insights, and systems stay hack-proof. Decentralized medical records aren't just possible – they're here.

Amalgamation of blockchain technology and Internet of Things is vital as one of them offers to connect patients remotely and other provides a higher level of privacy, secure decentralized system and immutable data storage. This research is offering a technique to store both medical reports and patient vitals on the blockchain ledger. To prevent overwhelming the blockchain network, a node.js application is developed which store the medical reports on the IPFS server and retrieve their corresponding hash values. Thereafter, these hash values along with the patient details and vitals are then transmitted to blockchain ledger. This study makes use of MAX30100 and DS18B20 sensors to monitor heart rate, blood oxygen and body temperature. ESP32 microcontroller is used to integrate these sensors and fetch their data periodically. Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework is used for maintaining the ledger and Hyperledger caliper tool is used to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed system. The performance is computed on three key parameters: reliability, throughput and latency. Reliability is evaluated in two phases, one with caliper tool and another with real RPM (Remote Patient Monitoring) unit. In the first phase, caliper tool transmitted 1500 transactions which are then verified by reading the ledger. In the second phase, RPM unit transmitted 480 transactions to blockchain ledger within 8 h. This study confirms that all transmitted transactions are successfully recorded on the blockchain ledger without any loss or failure. Medical reports submitted on IPFS server are also cross verified and found to be intact. The second experiment is carried out using two, four and eight workers attempting to execute 1000 transactions cumulatively at 40, 80 and 160 TPS (Transactions Per Second) respectively. It is noteworthy that when caliper tool is configured to execute transactions at 40 and 80 TPS, the achieved TPS remain unchanged. In contrast to this, when caliper tool is configured to send transactions at 160 TPS it could only achieve the transaction rate of 94 TPS. The peak of average latency is recorded as 0.45 s when transactions are executed at 94 TPS. The lowest latency is observed as 0.24 s at 40 TPS. As far as the throughput is concerned, the highest throughput is observed as 91.4 TPS when the caliper tool is attempting to execute transactions at 94 TPS. The system could achieve throughput of 39.8 and 79.4 TPS when caliper attempts to send transactions at 40 and 80 TPS respectively. The unique contribution of this study is to converge Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Internet of Things health sensors to develop a comprehensive solution for storing and retrieving the medical histories of remote patients, effectively managing both patient vitals and complex medical reports without compromising reliability and overall throughput. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) facilities are vital for countries having a large geographical areas and dense population. RPM facilities are even more crucial for nations with limited medical personnel. In the past few years, RPM facilities in India has gained significant growth due to growing healthcare needs, large demographic area and growing elderly population. Another reason contributing to significant attention in remote patient monitoring is due to large volume of population lives in rural areas where healthcare facilities are often inadequate. Such geographical barriers can be easily overcome by use of RPM which allows doctors to monitor patients in rural and remote locations without travelling1. Thus, RPM reduces both time and cost and brings virtual presence of a doctor to remote areas2. In India large volume of patients are suffering from hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. RPM can help such patients through continuous monitoring and prevent complications and restrict the disease for progressing. In nations having dense population, hospitals are overcrowded and introducing RPM facilities can reduce unnecessary hospital visits to ease the pressure on medical staff and healthcare facilities. Remote patient monitoring is blissful for remote patients as they can manage their health conditions from home, reducing out-of-pocket expenses for travel and hospitalization3. As stated earlier, RPM is even more blissful for elderly patients as they can receive continuous health monitoring at home. Thus, RPM also resolves the issue of limited mobility4. The technological advancements such as smartphone penetration, digital health technologies, high speed Internet are also contributing into the growth of RPM. During COVID-19 healthcare professionals highlighted the need of RPM as it offers limited physical contact and provides an environment where patient monitoring is possible in quarantine or isolation5. Government initiatives like the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and telemedicine guidelines have set the stage for widespread adoption of digital health and RPM solutions in India. These policies are encouraging the integration of digital tools to bridge healthcare gaps. Due to RPM the collection of continuous patient health data is made possible. Such data is significant as it can provide insights into population health trends when analyzed properly6. This approach of data analyses leads to predictive health management and policy making. Another key benefit of RPM is it ensures monitoring in a real time and thus leading to timely intervention. RPM can help reduce complications and improve patient health particularly for patients having chronic disease which demands constant care. The most critical thing in RPM is maintaining privacy because sensitive health information is continuously collected and stored electronically6. Ensuring privacy is essential due to legal, ethical and security considerations. Revealing such data to unauthorized person can lead to identity theft, discrimination, or stigmatization of patients. Thus, privacy preservation is crucial to protect them from any harm and preserves their dignity. If patients are not confident that their data is handled securely and privately, they may be reluctant to participate in RPM programs, limiting the effectiveness of the technology. Several countries, including India, the patients health data is protected by laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these regulations can lead to legal penalties and damage the reputation of healthcare organizations. Moreover, RPM systems are highly dependent on cloud storage and mobile applications and thus making them susceptible to cyberattacks such as hacking, phishing, or ransomware. So, it is crucial to maintain patient data by introducing highly secure encryption techniques. Compromising such data can lead to stress and anxiety among the patients. Thus, privacy is essential to prevent stigmatization or emotional distress. Blockchain technology can significantly enhance the privacy and security of patient data in remote patient monitoring (RPM) by providing decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof systems6,8. It is seen that traditional digital healthcare systems were relying on centralized servers which makes the whole system vulnerable to breaches or attacks. The blockchain technology works on decentralized system where data is distributed across multiple nodes and thus avoids single point of failure. Due to this decentralized behavior it even more difficult for hackers to compromise patient data. Maintaining patient data on blockchain is highly secure as data is not kept in plain text. In fact, data is encrypted using advanced cryptographic methods9. Only authorized parties with the correct cryptographic keys can access and decrypt this data, ensuring that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable. Blockchain offers an immutable ledger which means once data is recorded it cannot be altered or deleted without consensus. This immutability guarantees that patient records are tamper-proof, preventing unauthorized changes that could compromise data integrity or privacy. Apart from the privacy, the blockchain system may allow patient centric environment where patient can decide who can have access to data. In such environment, patient can grant and revoke access to healthcare providers, researchers, or insurance companies. This ensures that only authorized individuals can view or modify their medical data. Blockchain maintains log of every action and thus can provide a complete detail of who accessed the data, when, and for what purpose. This ensures accountability and reduces the risk of unauthorized data access. Blockchain technology offers a mechanism for anonymizing or pseudonymizing patient data. pseudonymous identities ensure to preserve sensitive information securely and allows data sharing with third parties without revealing the identity of the patient. To automate privacy policies and permissions, smart contracts can be deployed on the blockchain11. For example, a smart contract can be programmed to automatically grant access to a specific healthcare provider when certain conditions are met and then revoke that access once it's no longer needed. Blockchain based healthcare systems are highly resistant to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt traditional non blockchain based healthcare data systems. Since RPM systems rely on the continuous flow of data, blockchain's security ensures uninterrupted service while protecting patient data from malicious disruptions. Most of the studies dealing with blockchain and remote patient monitoring do not deal with patient medical reports6,12,13. There are several reasons why blockchain and remote patient monitoring (RPM) studies typically do not focus on storing complete medical reports directly on the blockchain. While blockchain offers excellent privacy, security, and transparency, there are technical and practical limitations that make it less suitable for directly storing large volumes of sensitive medical data, such as detailed medical reports. Most blockchains have limited storage capacity because they are designed to handle small-sized, transactional data, such as logs of actions, timestamps, and metadata. Medical reports, imaging files (e.g., X-rays, MRI scans), and large datasets associated with remote patient monitoring can be quite large, making blockchain an inefficient and expensive option for storing this data13. Medical reports often contain highly sensitive information that patients might not want to be exposed or made accessible, even indirectly. Blockchain's transparency, which is one of its strengths, could also be a potential drawback in healthcare if not properly managed. Although encryption can safeguard data, storing the data on-chain increases the complexity of ensuring that only authorized individuals can decrypt and access it. Storing data on blockchain is expensive, especially in public blockchain networks where fees are tied to data size. As medical reports often include detailed documents, images, and multimedia content, the cost of directly storing these on a blockchain could be prohibitive, particularly when dealing with large patient populations. The major contribution of this work can be summarized as follows: First, we disclose the present state of the art with context to blockchain in healthcare sector. Second, we demonstrate the technique to store both medical reports and patient health parameters coming from IoT (Internet of Things) sensors on the blockchain network in such a way which do not slow down the network performance. Third, we demonstrate how to evaluate overall performance in terms of throughput and latency of such systems at different transaction rates. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) can significantly improve the quality of life for elderly and disabled individuals by offering continuous, convenient, and proactive healthcare management. RPM allows for continuous tracking of vital signs (like heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels) and other health metrics3. This real-time monitoring ensures early detection of potential health issues, allowing for prompt medical intervention, which is especially important for the elderly and disabled, who may have chronic conditions requiring constant attention. Many elderly people suffer from chronic illnesses like hypertension, or respiratory disorders. RPM systems help them manage these conditions better by providing continuous feedback on their health status and ensuring that medications or treatments are adjusted as needed. For many elderly and disabled individuals, frequent trips to the doctor or hospital can be physically challenging or even impossible. RPM allows them to receive care in the comfort of their home, eliminating the need for constant travel and enabling them to live more independently4,5. RPM can alleviate the burden on family members or professional caregivers by providing real-time health updates and alerts. Caregivers can monitor health remotely and focus their in-person efforts on critical tasks, freeing up time and reducing burnout. Elderly patients suffering from cognitive impairments such as dementia, RPM can help monitor behavioral patterns, sleep cycles, and physiological data to detect any declines in cognitive health. This can aid in providing early interventions and more effective management of these conditions. Several efforts have been made in the past to offer blockchain based healthcare systems but each one of them have pros and cons. Table 1 summarize the present state of art and illustrates how our proposed solution is significantly different from others. It is clear from Table 1 that several attempts have been made in the past to propose and implement blockchain based solutions to store patient health records but a complete health record is incomplete without patient health reports such as X-Rays, MRI and other sensitive reports. This attempt was made by some researchers, but such studies were either non-blockchain based or not designed for remote patient monitoring environment. The authors in the study14 aimed to resolve several challenges of remote healthcare solutions such as privacy of patients, data security and system responsiveness. This study designed a blockchain framework which could even work in a resource constrained IoT environment. This study claimed to achieve significant data integrity and security without imposing computational overhead and thus offering an environment which is suitable to integrate and work with devices having limited processing capabilities. The only limitation of this study was not to integrate medical images with EHR, which is crucial while managing medical histories. Some authors15 designed and implemented a blockchain based framework that is capable to interact with Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enhance personalized healthcare monitoring systems.​ The proposed system periodically collects data from IoT devices and then stores it on a distributed ledger using blockchain technology. The paper outlines a system architecture that includes patient interfaces, healthcare provider modules, and data analytics components, all interconnected through a secure blockchain network.​ This study did not attempt to deal with medical reports and performance evaluation in terms of system throughput and latency was not computed. Another study16 introduced a secure architecture for smart health monitoring systems leveraging blockchain technology.​ The authors propose the BSSHM system, which integrates various health data monitoring sensors such as temperature and heartbeat sensors to collect real-time patient data. By integrating real-time data collection with secure transmission and storage mechanisms, and by validating the system's security and performance through formal verification and testbed implementation, the study contributes significantly to the field of secure healthcare systems.​This study too ignored the medical reports and restricted to deal with vital sensors data only. The study17 presented a robust IoT-based architecture that enhances the remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients by integrating wearable sensor technology with established early warning systems. The inclusion of a blockchain-based consent mechanism addresses data privacy concerns, while the system's adaptability ensures its applicability in diverse healthcare settings. By facilitating continuous monitoring and early detection of health deterioration, the proposed framework aims to improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource utilization during pandemic situations.​ The study did not propose any solution for maintaining medical histories that is enriched with keeping medical reports. In6 authors presented a comprehensive approach to integrating IoT technologies into remote patient monitoring systems, with a strong emphasis on security and privacy. The lightweight nature of the proposed framework ensures its applicability in various healthcare settings, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery.​ Although this study proposed a decentralized approach by using blockchain technology but did not compute the performance evaluation on various essential parameters. The study claimed to resolve critical healthcare environment issues such as interoperability, privacy and security. This study does not offer essential details of managing health records. In the study13, authors presented a solution by amalgamation of IoMT, blockchain and federated learning. They offered a very comprehensive electronic health record system. This amalgamation offered an innovative approach to addresses key challenges in such environment such as data security, model accuracy and a scalable and efficient solution18. The system proposed in19 combined a blockchain technology with federated learning to address privacy and security concerns on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). This integration ensures that patient data remains decentralized and secure, while still allowing for effective machine learning model training.​ There is a strong need to maintain medical reports on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) because they offer several critical benefits such as improved diagnosis and faster emergency response. In the study20, authors presented a comprehensive ecosystem for real time monitoring of diabetic patients by utilizing blockchain technology. The authors offered a solution by integrating Blockchain, Machine Learning, and IoT together. The proposed system was designed to improve patient care by timely interventions. The authors in21 proposed a framework capable to deal with chronic diseases through the integration of Internet of Things, blockchain technology, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).​ There was no provision to keep complex medical reports on electronic health records. Likewise in the study14, authors presented a more advanced solution for EHR environment that works in a robust and highly secure fashion by leveraging blockchain technology. The framework offered in22 offered a solution for remote patient environment that offers high security and ensures that medical histories remain unaltered during transmission and storage. The system proposed in23 combined the IoT sensors for RPM environment by using blockchain technology for secure data transmission and storage. This integration aimed to provide a reliable and tamper-proof method for managing sensitive medical information without dealing with medical reports. In another study24, authors demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric offers a viable blockchain-based solution for secure and efficient healthcare data management. Similarly, the study proposed in24 makes use of minifabric to implement a healthcare system but lacking in preserving medical reports and performance evaluation. The related literature clearly depicts that an enhanced distributed electronic healthcare system is required that can work efficiently in remote patient monitoring environment and can deal with both vital data of patients such as heart rate, blood saturation, body temperature and several other necessary vitals and also provides a way to maintain complex medical reports and integrate it with blockchain technology for seamless read/write operations for authorized users such as medical staff. Implementing RPM using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework ensure secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving data exchange between healthcare providers, patients, and other relevant stakeholders. Although several blockchain framework are available such as Ethereum, Corda and Quorum but this study is deliberately using Hyperledger fabric due to performance concerns. Hyperledger fabric is recommended for healthcare applications due to its modular architecture, optimized consensus algorithms and permissioned network which ensures high throughput and privacy. Hyperledger fabric use RAFT consensus algorithm which is much faster and energy efficient than Proof of Work and Proof of Stake algorithms. Hyperledger framework offers high throughput and low latency as compared to others. Moreover, corda framework is primarily used for financial transactions only whereas Hyperledger fabric is a general-purpose framework and suitable for healthcare applications. As far as the Ethereum is concerned, it is public in nature and very slow in committing transactions. It can commit 15 to 30 transactions per second depending on the network. On the other hand, Hyperledger fabric can commit hundreds of transactions per second. Ethereum is slower due to its public nature and proof of stake consensus mechanism. Hyperledger fabric is much faster due to its modern consensus mechanism supported by RAFT that works without mining. 1 depicts that there are four major components to develop the proposed system. The complete proposed model is explained in Fig. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) needs to be installed first which would maintain heavy stuff like medical reports in different data formats such as portable document format (PDF), Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). In this study IPFS is installed as a local node for experimentation purpose. Local node always run on specific IP address and a port number. Combination of IP address and port number makes a socket which can be used by client application programming interface (API) to store the reports. Fabric client SDK is an API that is used to interact with the Hyperledger fabric smart contract. This study is using an ipfs-http-client API to store the data. This API stores the data to IPFS and gets a content identifier (CID) in return which is then stored on the blockchain ledger using fabric-network API. Blokchain network allows fabric-network API to interact with the network if the client requesting to store a transaction is valid and already registered on the network. Smart contract is a set of modules that define the business logic of the application. This study is using a Node.js programming language to write the smart contracts. Node.js supports event-driven asynchronous programming environment which is perfect for making Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API). Smart contract always resides on blockchain network. Fabric-network API submit hash of medical report to blockchain smart contract which then stores it on blockchain ledger along with patient ID. Smart contracts are intelligent programs and known as chaincode. A smart contract includes a logic to verify the identity, role and permission before performing any read and write operations. These smart contracts are powered with membership service providers (MSPs) which restrict actions based on identity and role. Hyperledger fabric always grant a unique IDs to patients and doctors as every single entity must be registered first on the network before interacting with the ledger. Access control is managed through these ID's. Data auditability is also supported as all transactions processed by smart contracts are immutably recorder on the ledger with timestamp and transaction ID. This study is also using an RPM unit to send patient vitals to blockchain ledger. This RPM unit is making use of ESP32 microcontroller to collect and transmit data to blockchain ledger. One sensor is used to fetch heart rate and blood saturation, and another sensor is used to fetch body temperature. As RPM unit cannot directly execute smart contract, a small node.js application is developed in between RPM unit and blockchain network. This application receives a transaction from the RPM unit and then using fabric-network API stores it on the blockchain ledger. This study is first implementing the proposed model and then evaluating the overall performance of the proposed system with context to throughput and latency. This study employs Hyperledger Caliper scripts specifically developed to fulfill its objectives, and these scripts are publicly accessible at36. The proposed model is illustrated in Fig. The proposed model has several entities which work together to perform a read and write operations. The patient is equipped with an RPM unit which keeps sending vital parameters to the blockchain network. It is not recommended to store heavy stuff such as medical reports directly on blockchain as doing this would slow down the network and heavy cost in terms of energy, space and time will incur. In fact, on uploading medical reports on IPFS, the IPFS server will return a hash of the uploaded document which can then be stored on the blockchain network along with patient ID. So, physical reports are always kept on IPFS server and its hash on the blockchain ledger. The entire task of receiving hash, authenticating end user and storing transaction on the ledger is accomplished by the smart contract which is also known as chaincode. The chaincode remains available on blockchain network channel and peers. In the proposed model, blockchain network is using a single channel and two organizations. These peers are also known as endorsing peers which mutually decides to store the transaction on the ledger. The whole system offers a fault tolerance environment as same blockchain ledger is available on both the organizations. The chaincode functions gets executed whenever an end user make a request for read or write operations. To fetch a medical report, patient or a doctor needs to retrieve the hash of the medical report by sending a query to blockchain network which demands patient ID and some metadata. The RPM unit keep monitoring patient health vitals and then prepares a transaction periodically and sends it in a (JavaScript Object Notation) JSON format. RPM unit can never execute smart contract directly due to security concerns. The transactions are sent to Node.js API as illustrated in Fig. Only this API knows the network details such as channel name, chaincode name and details of organizations and peers. End users do not have any idea of network details. Node.js API checks the transaction and then execute the necessary chaincode function such as write operation or read operation. The complete environment setup is disclosed in Table 2. Docker is a utility which keeps hyperledger fabric components such as peers, channel, chaincode and orderer on a separate space. This way all these components are isolated from each other and avoid conflicts. Although these components are isolated but still, they communicate with each other. the cURL utility is used for issuing GET/POST requests and is a very handy utility for testing, debugging and issuing HTTP requests. Ubuntu is the underlying operating system which supports all modern Docker versions and operations. Node package manager (NPM) and it helps to maintain versioning and maintains correct folder structure to deploy chanincode. MAX30100 sensor detects the heart-beat and checks how much oxygen is carried in blood. This sensor uses infrared light on the skin and then calculates how much light is absorbed. Depending on absorption at different wavelength it calculates the pulse rate and blood saturation (SpO2). The proposed model is implemented on Ubuntu operating system with Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework. All components of fabric blockchain network are illustrated in the Fig. This is an important factor which ensures that all transactions are safe and available on the ledger. Large number of transactions failing to commit on a ledger can lead to unreliable network and may cause serious consequences. The proposed model is tested by sending large number of transactions and then verifying the ledger. Thereafter these transactions are read from the ledger to verify how many transactions are successfully committed on the ledger. Such heavy traffic can be generated by Hyperledger caliper tool. This tool can be programmed to throw massive transactions on the ledger. This tool must be configured with blockchain network information such a channel name, chaincode name and peer details. The caliper tool demands three configuration files. Details of these configuration files are illustrated in Table 4. Once the caliper is configured it knows where to throw the transactions and which operation to perform (read/write). The caliper tool is also configured with 4 workers which means four end users are making transactions parallelly. This means that each worker is attempting to commit 375 transactions on the blockchain ledger. The caliper tool was configured in such a way so that each worker can transmit transactions at 25 transactions per second (TPS). As four workers were working in parallel, the blockchain network was handling a cumulative load of 100 TPS. This indicates that the proposed blockchain network is fully reliable. As caliper results proved that the system is reliable, another experiment was conducted to test the network on real RPM unit. RPM unit initiate communication by sending packets at regular intervals. RPM unit collects patient vital data for 60 s, during this period it takes 12 readings after every 5 s. Then the mean of pulse rate, blood saturation and body temperature are calculated from these reading. Thereafter, a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) packet is created with patient ID and forwarded towards the Node.js API as illustrated in the Fig. The complete pseudocode for collecting and forwarding transaction is illustrated below. It is clear from previous discussion that only a single packet is transferred every minute which is a favorable scenario for blockchain network as blockchain should not be used for committing frequent transactions. The RPM unit is tested for eight hours and during this period 480 transactions were forwarded to the blockchain network. Thereafter, the ledger was checked and found that all transactions were committed without any failure. Reading vitals and forwarding to blockchain network(RPM Unit logic) To make the system more reliable, RPM unit is supported with battery which can last up to 8 to 10 h. The system is also programmed to buffer transactions in the absence of Internet connectivity and deliver pending transactions first when the connectivity is resume. The caliper tool is not capable to store medical reports on IPFS repository programmatically. To verify availability of such reports on IPFS repository, a separate node.js application is designed. This application receives patient information along with medical report. Then this application prepares a transaction having content identifier and patient details and send it towards the blockchain network. Transactions are stored using this application and later IPFS repository is verified to check the availability of these reports. This study is using an ECG (Electrocardiogram) image data set offered by British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre available on the Kaggle public repository platform37. This data set is merely used for uploading ECG reports on IPFS server and storing their hash on blockchain network. This data set is not used for any automated interpretations or analysis. This study confirms that all reports are successfully stored and accessible on the IPFS repository without any failures. These are the most vital parameters that must be computed for such environments. Computing throughput and latency gives a fair estimate that how the proposed system will behave when heavy traffic is imposed on it. Assume a scenario where multiple such RPM units are transmitting in parallel and in such conditions, it is essential to measure the overall throughput and latency. In such scenario, throughput refers to how many transactions are committed on the blockchain network. This is measured in transactions per second (TPS). In parallel it is also important to track number of transactions failed in that time frame. In this experiment the Hyperledger caliper tool is used again to mimic the environment where multiple RPM units are transmitting in parallel. In the first scenario caliper used two workers where each worker is transmitting at 20 transactions per second. As both workers are transmitting in parallel, the cumulative load becomes 40 TPS. Likewise, when four and eight workers are used the cumulative load becomes 80 and 160 TPS respectively. It is clear from the Table 5 that three cumulative data transfer rates were used 40, 80 and 160 TPS respectively with 2, 4 and 8 workers. Four rounds were used for every data transfer rate. For example, 1000 transactions were committed at 40 TPS four times and then their average results are reported. The same logic is applied for other data transfer rates. JSON (JavaScript Object Notations) structure is used for storing the data and source of this synthetic data generation was Hyperledger caliper tool. The maximum size of a single JSON transaction is observed as 4 KB. The use of the Hyperledger Caliper tool for generating large-scale synthetic data in this study is motivated by two primary considerations. First, the proposed research aims to emulate a realistic RPM environment where multiple RPM devices communicate parallelly. Without Hyperledger Caliper tool this experiment needs multiple physical RPM units which is a costly affair. Secondly, caliper tool helps to transfer data at different rates by configuring TPS (transaction per second) to monitor system reliability and throughput for a realistic environment. The Hyperledger caliper is a smart tool which computes throughput and latency in the background and then generates a report. As discussed in Table 5, all workers are configured to transmit transactions at 20 TPS. In fact, caliper demands overall TPS and then it is divided into total workers. 7 which is reporting achieved rate, average latency, throughput and completion time for the write operation. Throughput and latency for read operation is illustrated in Fig. The equations internally used by the Caliper tool to compute read latency, read throughput, write latency, write throughput, and send rate are explained after Fig. Results generated from caliper are compiled into an excel sheet with the name Hyperledger_Caliper_Output.xlsx and made publicly accessible. N = Total successfully read transactions, Tread_submit , i = Timestamp when the i-th read transaction was sent, Tread_responses , i = Timestamp when the i-th read transaction received a response M: Number of successful write transactions, Twrite_submit , i: Timestamp when the i-th write transaction was submitted, Twrite_confirmed , i: Timestamp when the i-th write transaction was committed Two experiments are designed and conducted in this study. Sending massive transactions manually is a tedious task. So, this study utilizes Hyperledger caliper tool which can easily be configured with Hyperledger fabric blockchain network. A total of 1500 transactions were sent by using four parallel workers. These workers can be treated as different end users. This means every single worker is assigned the workload of 375 transactions. As transactions speed is also divided among the workers, every worker is supposed to send traffic at 25 TPS. Doing so has no impact on the overall TPS. When all four workers send transactions simultaneously, the total network traffic reaches 100 TPS within a single second. Once all transactions are sent to the blockchain network, the blockchain ledger needs to be verified. This operation could be performed either by verifying the ledger manually or by reading the same set of transactions by using the caliper tool. This study makes use of caliper tool. It is important to understand that every transaction must have a unique identity value such as patient enrollment number. While using the caliper tool, this enrollment number was generated programmatically in a sequence. 4 indicates that the proposed system is reliable and capable to handle massive traffic. The same goal is then achieved by using the RPM unit integrated with MAX30100 and DS18B20 sensors. These sensors monitor heart rate, blood oxygen and body temperature. In an actual environment, these RPM units keep sending patient vitals in the form of transactions to the blockchain network. Thus, it is also vital to ensure reliability by using this RPM unit. RPM unit initiate communication by sending packets at regular intervals. RPM unit collects patient vital data for 60 s, during this period it takes 12 readings after every 5 s. Then the mean of pulse rate, blood saturation and body temperature are calculated from these reading. Thereafter, this newly prepared transaction is sent to the blockchain network. The RPM unit is tested over an eight-hour period and during this period 480 transactions are sent to the network. Thereafter, the caliper tool is used to read the same set of transactions to ensure that all transactions send during the testing remain intact and accessible. Second experiment is designed to measure the performance of the network with context to throughput and latency. This experiment is carried out using two, four and eight workers attempting to execute 1000 transactions cumulatively at 40, 80 and 160 TPS respectively. 6 that when caliper tool is configured to execute transactions at 40 and 80 TPS, the achieved TPS remain unchanged. In contrast to this, when caliper tool is configured to send transactions at 160 TPS it could only achieve the transaction rate of 94 TPS. This behavior suggest that caliper tool is very dynamic and reconfigure itself based on the network feedback. It also indicates that 160 TPS is a significantly high load for the network to manage. The peak of average latency is recorded as 0.45 s when transactions are executed at 94 TPS. The lowest latency is observed as 0.24 s at 40 TPS. As far as the throughput is concerned, the highest throughput is observed as 91.4 TPS when the caliper tool is attempting to execute transactions at 94 TPS. The system achieve throughput of 39.8 and 79.4 TPS when caliper attempts to send transactions at 40 and 80 TPS respectively. 7 that throughput is always close to the achieved rate. 8 that performance improves during the reading operation as reading blockchain ledger is a less complex operations as compared to writing operation. During the read operation, peak of throughput reaches to 160.2 TPS and latency remains constant at 0.01 s regardless of transaction rate. As far as the IPFS is concerned, the medical reports corresponding to content identifier available within every transaction is checked manually. This study also aims to identify and analyze similar research for comparison with our own work and has identified few such studies. In39, the researchers attempted to design and develop an electronic health record system using a dual-channel and Hyperledger fabric framework. Although this study has incorporated the EHR with privacy and security features, but this study did not attempt to deal with patient vitals such a retrieving and storing heart rate, body temperature and blood saturation. It is also worth noting that their proposed solution does not address the storage of medical reports on the ledger. The study reported a peak throughput of 78.6 TPS at the data transmission rate of 100 TPS which is significantly lower than the throughput proposed by our solution. In our study, the peak of throughput is reported at 91.4 TPS. This study reported a maximum throughput of 55.78 TPS and 2.78 s as an average latency at the data transmission rate of 100 TPS. The study did not include reliability testing, and it overlooked a key component of a comprehensive electronic health record—namely, the storage of medical reports. Our study achieved a peak throughput of 91.4 TPS, significantly surpassing the throughput reported in40 and incorporate dealing with medical reports. Likewise, in another comparison the authors of the research work41 claimed the highest throughput as 95.9 TPS which is marginally better than our study, but it is noteworthy that study41 stored only textual and numeric data in the ledger, without incorporating IoT for capturing patient vitals in an RPM environment and offered no provisions for handling medical reports. In fact, the study41 computed the performance of Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework in a different environment. In another comparison, the researchers in42 proposed a solution for remote patient monitoring environment for keeping patient details and vitals on the Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework. This study utilizes IoT sensors to collect patient vitals from remote locations and securely store them on a blockchain ledger. This study also includes a performance evaluation, in which the authors identified the network's maximum capacity for handling transactions without any loss. In contrast, our study reports a slightly higher throughput of 91.4 TPS at a data transfer rate of 94 TPS. However, the study42 reported a peak of throughput as 104.9 at 125 TPS this study did not specify the number of workers employed. Another limitation of study42 is its lack of handling patient medical reports, without which an EHR cannot be considered complete. In43 the authors reported a higher throughput but could not achieve 100% reliability as their proposed system could only store 946 and 727 transactions out of 1000 when KAFKA and RAFT consensus is used respectively. Amalgamation of blockchain technology and Internet of Things is vital as one of them offers to connect patients remotely and other provides a higher level of privacy, secure decentralized system and immutable data storage. Such safer environment gives higher confidence to patients and encourage them to embrace remote patient monitoring technology. The model proposed in this study is offers a solution to store both medical reports and patient vitals on the blockchain ledger. This study is not only providing a solution to store both patient vitals and medical reports on the blockchain ledger but also offers a solution to evaluate the overall network performance. This study demonstrates how Hyperledger caliper tool can be configured to simulate heavy traffic on the blockchain network. To mimic the real scenario where multiple RPM units may be transferring data to blockchain ledger, the caliper tool is configured with multiple workers. These workers transmit transactions parallelly and cumulatively generate the overall TPS. Both phases confirms that the system is reliable. During the write operation the system could manage to write transactions at 91.4 TPS whereas during the read operations it manages to read transactions at 160.2 TPS. These results confirm that achieved throughput is adequate for industrial applications. In fact, in real scenario RPM units are typically designed to transmit 1 or 2 transactions per minute due to several complexities and to avoid overwhelming the blockchain network. In future, performance of such studies can be evaluated using other parameters such as memory usage, energy consumption and scalability. Another research area can be to integrate more complex sensors such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) and EEG (Electroencephalogram).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Revolutionary Shift: Russia's Top Stock Exchanges Poised to Launch Crypto Trading Get ready for a seismic shift in the global financial landscape. In a groundbreaking move, Russia's two premier financial hubs—the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and the Saint Petersburg Exchange (SPB)—have reportedly completed all technical preparations to launch crypto trading. This isn't just speculation; it's a concrete step awaiting the final green light from regulators. According to a report from Wu Blockchain, the exchanges are fully prepared. This development follows earlier signals from the government, including a Bloomberg report, that legislation was being advanced to allow public cryptocurrency investment. The proposed regulatory model creates a clear path for two main groups of investors. This structured approach aims to open the market while managing risk. This isn't just another crypto exchange opening its doors. Their involvement brings unparalleled trust, security, and regulatory oversight to crypto trading for millions. Global sanctions and financial isolation also pose complex questions about how these regulated crypto trading services will interact with the international financial system. Furthermore, the success of this initiative will depend heavily on public adoption and whether investors trust these new, regulated channels over existing, less formal options. The preparation of Russia's top exchanges marks a pivotal moment. It represents a strategic move to formalize and control the cryptocurrency market within its borders. For global observers, it's a clear indicator of digital assets' irreversible march into the mainstream financial infrastructure. While questions remain, the readiness of MOEX and SPB for crypto trading is a definitive step toward a future where traditional and digital finance are seamlessly integrated. Q: When will crypto trading actually start on these exchanges? The exchanges are technically ready but waiting for this legal green light. Q: Can foreigners invest in crypto through the Moscow or Saint Petersburg exchanges? A: Specific lists haven't been released, but reports indicate that “privacy coins” (e.g., Monero, Zcash) will be excluded. Major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most likely to be offered initially. Q: How does this differ from using a regular crypto exchange like Binance? A: Trading on MOEX or SPB would occur under strict Russian regulatory oversight, potentially offering greater investor protection, integration with traditional banking, and a familiar interface for local stock traders.

By 2030, the global cross-border payment volume is projected to reach USD 290 trillion, with the RMB accounting for 10%-20% and digital currency penetration ranging from 20%-40%, corresponding to a market size of CNY 40.6-162.4 trillion. The Digital Economy team at Northeast Securities believes that the digital RMB has evolved from a payment tool into a strategic carrier integrating 'finance, technology, and data.' The essence of developing the digital RMB lies in transforming trade efficiency into a strategic advantage through blockchain technology, with its development pace closely tied to the core national interests in global competition. According to the Cailian Press thematic database, among related listed companies: Cuiwei Co., Ltd.'s annual report shows that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Haikou Rongtong, has actively participated in signing cooperation agreements with designated operating banks of the People's Bank of China's Digital Currency Research Institute, conducting system integration, and advancing the construction of systems to accept digital RMB. Chu Tian Long has established technical and business collaborations with the People's Bank of China Digital Currency Research Institute, digital RMB operators, numerous commercial banks, and industry application entities, actively promoting the development of the digital RMB ecosystem.</p>
