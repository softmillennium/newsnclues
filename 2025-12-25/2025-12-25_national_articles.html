Day 25 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 25 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: Dusty Pillars. This is the James Webb Space Telescope's mid-infrared view of the Pillars of Creation, trunks of interstellar gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula, about 7,000 light-years away. The mid-infrared view allows scientists to focus on the dense dust in the star-forming regions within these massive pillars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro points to his electronic ankle monitor that the Supreme Court ordered him to wear, at Congress in Brasilia, Brazil, July 21, 2025. SAO PAULO (AP) — Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro underwent double hernia surgery on Thursday at a hospital in the country's capital, his family said. The procedure in Brasilia lasted about 3½ hours and was completed without complications, according to his family. Bolsonaro, who has been hospitalized since Wednesday, has been serving a 27-year prison sentence since November for an attempted coup. He was granted court permission to leave prison after federal police doctors confirmed that he needed the procedure. Doctors say Bolsonaro's double hernia causes him pain. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's coup trial and sentenced him to prison, authorized the procedure, but denied the former president's request for house arrest after he leaves the hospital. Bolsonaro doesn't have any contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia, where he is held and where his 12-square-meter (around 130-square-foot) room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a television and a desk, according to authorities. He has free access to his doctors and lawyers, but other visitors must receive approval from the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, de Moraes authorized Bolsonaro's sons to visit him while he's hospitalized. Early Thursday, his eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, told reporters before the surgery that his father had written a letter confirming he had appointed him as his political party's presidential candidate in next year's election. Flávio Bolsonaro announced on Dec. 5 that he will challenge President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term, as the candidate of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party. The former president and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democratic system following his 2022 election defeat. The plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023. Bolsonaro was also convicted on charges that include leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year is not a particularly white Christmas. From Santa's reindeer and the Hanukkah armadillo to some very festive sea worms, our changing world is changing life for creatures great and small. And while some of these animals are struggling, a few may be key to helping us adapt to the future. You'd think a species that already survived some of history's most intense and rapid Arctic warming events would have the wherewithal to weather modern, human-driven climate change. In Greenland, temperatures shot up by as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit in a matter of decades, pushing other Arctic megafauna to extinction. Those scientists found that reindeer survived previous changes in the climate because they had spread into lots of different ecological niches. They could thrive in a small, cooler refuge and repopulate broader areas when things got cold again. Today, however, the warming is global; the reindeers' range isn't as large; and it's harder to find a cool place to hunker down. Incorporating these findings about the past into models of the future, the researchers found that global populations of reindeer could shrink by as much as 58% between now and 2100 — with places like North America losing even more. Unfortunately, new research shows that fewer reindeer could actually make climate change worse. Researchers from Finland and Alaska found that, in far northern forests where snow isn't falling like it used to, soils release more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere rather than storing it. Conical, feathery and brilliantly colored in blues, pinks, plum and orange, these tiny worms attach to coral reefs as larvae and then hang out, immobile, for the rest of their lives. Christmas tree worms have a symbiotic relationship with the coral they live on. And baby coral polyps find shelter under the Christmas tree's branches, where they can hide from predators like the sea star. For example, a 2022 study by students at the University of California Berkeley found a correlation between healthy coral and higher numbers of Christmas tree worms. It's possible that, in the future, these worms could become an early warning signal — showing scientists where corals are under stress from warming seas before the situation becomes dire. Back in 2000, when Ross from “Friends” dressed up as an armadillo to teach his son about the true meaning of Hanukkah, the real-life animal was still thought of as a creature of the Southwest. A survey in 2014 found that the animals were able to establish a footing anywhere the average low in January remained above about 18 degrees Fahrenheit. Turns out, that describes a lot of the United States. But in 2025, researchers from the US Geological Survey used public wildlife reporting apps, live tracker cams and other data sources to document more than 250 recent armadillo sightings in Iowa. The data is teaching us about what makes good armadillo country — warm, but not too dry, and forested seems to be best — and where they're most likely to expand next — Ohio, Virginia and Michigan are all good candidates. In 2007, a young researcher reached out to the curator of the Rosenborg Castle museum in Denmark with a weird request. She wanted to drill into the king's throne. Garde's research focuses on the history and future sustainability of narwhals, a species of Arctic toothed whale famously beloved by both small children and Buddy the Elf. But narwhals, as a group, aren't very genetically diverse — a fact that could prove dangerous for them as it will likely limit their ability to adapt to a warming Arctic. Garde wanted to know what the narwhals' ancestors were like. And DNA samples drilled out of a 350-year-old throne was the perfect place to start. Maybe, if Mr. Narwhal could find his dad like Buddy did, then humans could better understand how to keep that species healthy into the future. Since then, her team has learned a lot about these creatures. In fact, her research has helped establish that narwhals have been living comfortably with a low genetic diversity for thousands of years — something that is a bit of a surprise. The genetic data suggests that this species might be stable with the lowest amount of diversity possible right now. If a hotter Arctic reduces that further, the narwhal could be in trouble. Red-legged partridges have been a favorite game bird in Europe for millennia; its bones even show up in Paleolithic settlements. But its long association with humans has put the red-legged partridge in the path of several different negative impacts. It has been over-hunted; squashed by tractors and other modern farming equipment; sickened and killed as a side-effect of agricultural pesticides; cut off from care by former farmers abandoning the countryside for city jobs; and outcompeted by other species of partridge bred specifically for hunting. Between 2010 and 2020, red-legged partridge populations have likely declined by as much as 40-45%, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the organization that determines whether a species is endangered. None of that has to do with climate change, specifically. In 2021, a team led by scientists from Sweden and Italy sequenced the red-legged partridge genome and learned a few key things. First, this bird didn't do well during a warming event 140,000 years ago. And unlike the narwhal, which grew in population and remained stable with a low genetic diversity, partridges have had no such luck. Las Posadas is a Central and South American Christmas tradition where people recreate the story of Mary and Joseph searching for an inn. Given their prominent role in Biblical transportation, donkeys are a big part of the festivities. In northern Kenya and southern Somalia, for example, they're used to carry water and food over long distances during droughts. Other animals could do that job in good times, but donkeys are particularly adept at helping people survive climate disasters, wrote a team of researchers from University College London in a recent book on animal human interactions under climate change. Donkeys' digestive systems function like internal saddle bags — absorbing extra water when it's available and holding onto that moisture when water is scarce. Because of that, they're able to keep carrying water and food to humans even in situations where other animals can't. Other grazing animals easily strip sensitive soils bare, leaving them prone erosion. But donkeys eat a wider variety of plants, so they're less likely to over-indulge on grasses. And one recent report from researchers in Tunisia found that donkeys in the Mediterranean preferred to eat the invasive plants, which helps diverse species thrive. There's even a possibility that donkeys could help protect us against insects and the diseases they carry. Ticks and tick-borne illness are increasing their range thanks to warming weather. But a new study from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst found that donkeys' skin secretes a chemical that ticks avoid.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This undated photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Ghislaine Maxwell. This undated photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, during a news conference in New York on July 2, 2020. NEW YORK (AP) — Days after Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars. The disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department's ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an FBI agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein's decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women. Maxwell, a British socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in New York City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail. Two weeks ago, as the Justice Department prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial. Maxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. This week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities. Epstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell's crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts.” “I've heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said. Bensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. The transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure. The Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday's congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. On Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials. Some of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. An FBI agent's grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said. The agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother. The agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room. Maxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. At trial, Jane said Maxwell also participated in group sessions between multiple females and Epstein that usually began with Epstein or Maxwell leading them all into a bedroom or a massage room at the Palm Beach residence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korea on Thursday released new images of what it claims is its first nuclear-powered submarine, a massive vessel equal in size to some of the United States Navy's attack subs. The pictures released by state media showed leader Kim Jong Un inspecting the guided-missile submarine at an indoor construction facility, indicating it has not yet been launched. Building a nuclear-powered submarine has been a long-held goal for Kim, who first discussed it at a ruling party congress in 2021, but the fact its rival, South Korea, has recently being given the blessing of the Trump administration to pursue its own nuclear-powered subs appears to have added urgency to Kim's plans. State media said the vessel had a displacement of 8,700 tons, making it an equal to most of the nuclear-powered Virginia-class attack subs in the US fleet. On Thursday, Kim again stressed its importance of the vessels to Pyongyang's defense policy, which he said was “literally… based on the strongest offensive power,” according to a Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) report. Noting the US support, Kim said South Korea building a nuclear-powered submarine was an action that violated North Korean security and was a threat that needed to be countered, the report said. But Pyongyang itself is responsible for heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. Kim “is probably right that a buildup of nuclear-powered submarines will increase instability around the Korean Peninsula, but he has himself to blame for the arms race,” Easley said. “It is Pyongyang that disavows diplomacy with Seoul, threatens its neighbors with nuclear weapons, and deepens the suffering of its own people by devoting massive resources to military dictatorship rather than economic development,” he said. Kim has been overseeing a large buildup in his country's military capabilities as part of that five-year plan unveiled in 2021. Those include a range of missiles, including ballistic missiles that can reach the US mainland, hypersonic glide vehicles that could be difficult to defend against, and, at sea, two new guided-missile destroyers. The second of those made headlines earlier this year when it capsized on launch. The warship was subsequently refloated and apparently repaired. But, even so, Easley notes North Korea's fleet remains inferior to the South's, which boasts some of the world's best guided-missile destroyers and new conventionally powered submarines. US submarines are outnumbered in the Pacific. South Korea has a plan to help North Korea's one advantage may be having nuclear-powered submarines sooner. South Korea has wanted them for decades, but a decades-old nuclear agreement with the US had prevented it from building them, until October, when President Trump appeared to clear the path. But getting them designed and built could take a decade. “North Korea could conduct missile tests [with the submarine] after launching it within the next two years,” Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, told CNN. Based on the images, Hong analyzed that the submarine could be already loaded with a nuclear reactor, which leaves only a few more stages before it is ready to be launched. Pictures of the event show Kim was accompanied by his daughter, believed to be Kim Ju Ae, who has made a number of public appearances recently, prompting speculation he is preparing a future successor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A traffic stop outside of Baltimore Wednesday ended with an undocumented man shot and another injured after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents allege the driver of a van drove directly at officers, prompting them to open fire. It is the second incident publicized this week where ICE agents shot at an undocumented person during an operation after the person allegedly attempted to hurt agents, although that person wasn't hit by gunfire. After a year of violent encounters between DHS and the public, the confrontation provides another example of how car crashes and rammings are taking center stage in encounters with federal agents as immigration enforcement has ramped up across the country. ICE officers were in Glen Burnie, Maryland, Wednesday conducting “a targeted immigration enforcement operation” when they attempted to stop the two men, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. The undocumented migrants were identified as Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins, a Portuguese man who was driving the van, and Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquivel, a man from El Salvador who was a passenger, McLaughlin said. He started ramming ICE vehicles and “then drove his van directly at ICE officers” as “it appeared he was trying to run them over,” McLaughlin said. “Fearing for their lives and public safety, (officers) defensively fired their service weapons, striking the driver,” she said. Sousa-Martins then wrecked his car between two buildings, McLaughlin said, although photos shared by the agency on X show a white van crashed into a tree. CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification. Officers immediately gave medical care to the two men and took them to the hospital, McLaughlin said, adding no ICE agents were injured. Sousa-Martins came to the US from Portugal in December 2008, but didn't leave the country when his visa expired in February 2009, DHS said. The agency didn't provide additional information on Serrano-Esquivel's immigration history. It is not immediately clear if the two men obtained legal representation. As images of dramatic immigration operations have risen across the country over the last year, incidents involving cars has become a common occurrence. “Aggressors are now purposefully running into officers, boxing in law enforcement vehicles, running ICE law enforcement off the roads, and ramming their cars into law enforcement vehicles,” Emily Covington, ICE Assistant Director of Public Affairs, told CNN in October. But the agency has been criticized for using the tactic itself, including controversial “precision immobilization technique” or “PIT” maneuvers, which force a car to spin out and stop. Experts have told CNN the maneuver is considered a use of deadly force. In October, Marimar Martinez was shot by a Customs and Border Patrol agent after the agency alleged she purposefully rammed into an agent's car. Other incidents in Chicago, including a man that was fatally shot during a traffic stop, have infuriated the community and caused widespread condemnation as agents under the DHS umbrella have been accused of lying in court and presenting different scenarios in public statements versus court documents.</p>
