                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Spies working for the AAA during its collaboration with the FBI went undercover at activism meetings, obtaining photographs, audio recordings, and other strategic material. The group's ties with law enforcement were leveraged to help shield industry actors from public scrutiny, to press for investigations into its most powerful critics, and to reframe the purpose and efforts of animal rights protesters as a singular national security threat. The records further show that state authorities have cited protests as a reason to conceal information about disease outbreaks at factory farms from the public. Zoe Rosenberg, a UC Berkeley student and animal cruelty investigator at DxE, says she's hardly surprised that powerful private-sector groups are working to surveil the organization, but she finds their work with the police paradoxical. “If anyone should have the ear of law enforcement, it's animal cruelty investigators exposing rampant violations of the law leading to real animals suffering and dying horrific deaths,” she tells WIRED. Profiled by WIRED in 2019, DxE is a grassroots animal rights organization dedicated to nonviolent direct actions, including covert operations that often involve rescuing animals and documenting practices at factory farms that the group considers inhumane. In addition to minor charges such as trespassing, she was also hit with a felony count of conspiracy to commit those misdemeanors—a discretionary charge that Sonoma County's prosecutor justified by portraying Rosenberg as a “biosecurity risk” in light of avian flu. According to Rosenberg, DxE relies on biosecurity protocols that go “above and beyond” industry standards, including quarantining its investigators from birds for a full week before and after entering farms. Rosenberg does not deny removing the chickens, which she named Poppy, Aster, Ivy, and Azalea. “Generally, if we feel an animal is going to die from neglect or maltreatment if we don't remove them from the facility, then we feel that it is justified and necessary to step in to save their life,” she says. Her attorney, Chris Carraway, says that DxE tried reporting allegations of health violations at the facility to “the point of futility.” Rosenberg says reporting alleged violations often leads to getting bounced between offices; a “never-ending loop of no one agency wanting to take responsibility and enforce animal welfare laws.” Under veterinary care, Rosenberg says, Poppy was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, while Aster's feet were found to be “full of pus.” Each of the birds had contracted coccidiosis, she says, referring to a parasite that causes diarrhea, inflammation, and bleeding. Confidential documents obtained separately by WIRED reveal undercover operators for the AAA embedded within the animal rights group and fed the trade organization daily reports about protests and meetings, as well as photographs, audio recordings, and other documentation. During a November 2018 meeting, AAA board members discussed attending DxE events to develop “protective information,” adding they were already in contact with a “security company” that had previously attended DxE's training. At a manager's meeting the following April, the group disclosed that it wanted to “hire someone” to attend a DxE conference in Berkeley, California. Afimac did not respond to a request for comment. “They reached out to us a few weeks ago and asked for records of activist incidents on farms,” say notes from a meeting that May. At the same meeting, members discussed their difficulty getting prosecutors to charge activists with crimes, with one industry representative saying the issue was their lack of legal standing. The rep suggested calling on law enforcement to deploy “terrorism” charges instead—as one national pork producer had reportedly considered. “In the course of our work to support a secure food system, we have occasionally communicated with authorities to flag concerns where there is a potential risk to people, animals, or critical infrastructure.” The nonprofit declined to answer questions about its hiring of undercovers and did not respond when asked whether it had any specific evidence showing activists have caused outbreaks. Smith passed along an alert about an upcoming DxE protest, a march from a local police station to a nearby grocery store, asking if the FBI would connect the group “with law enforcement officials nationwide.” Goldsmith forwarded the alert to another FBI official who forwarded it along to several more, before it eventually reached a counterterrorism center in Washington and a federal investigator with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The WMDD issued an intelligence memo roughly three months later titled “Animal Rights Extremists Likely Increase the Spread of Virulent Newcastle Disease [vND] in California,” citing with “high confidence” claims that violent extremists were “likely” to “spread vND”—a highly contagious and often fatal disease that affects birds—“in the near term” by neglecting biosafety procedures. The FBI highlighted two instances in which it claimed there was “no evidence” of activists following proper protocols.” Analysts at the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC), a multi-agency hub that supports law enforcement, soon threw cold water on the FBI's claims. The agency further noted that despite law enforcement's claims that DxE “almost certainly” violated biosecurity protocols, police reports showed activists had taken “biosecurity precautions to prevent contamination or spread of disease.” Goldsmith had already previously dismissed a similar claim while working for the same unit four years prior. Goldsmith did not respond to a request for comment. “The FBI focuses on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. The FBI can never open an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity.” One of its members, they said, had heard from an unidentified trucker who was growing increasingly frustrated with animal rights activists. Payne had previously attended a presentation by the AAA on “dealing with animal rights activists,” according to emails between them. He'd later invited the AAA to collaborate on a range of dairy-farm proposals in California, alongside multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. Neither Payne nor UC Davis responded to requests for comment. Nor did the California Rural Crime Prevention Task Force. Months after the FBI circulated its now-disputed assessment of activists spreading the virulent Newcastle disease, Payne issued a memo under the rural taskforce's letterhead encouraging his “FBI colleagues” to read an article translated and amplified by a Beijing-based podcast host. The article concerns Chinese “swine stir-fry syndicates” purportedly using drones to spread African swine flu in an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of pork. Payne's email notes that he forwarded the article to a slew of local sheriffs' departments, as well as the state's WMDD office, “which in turn passed it on to FBI HQ ‘for their situational awareness. At least 10 agricultural trade groups and lobbyists were copied. Ryan Shapiro, executive director at Property of the People, says the hundreds of records amassed by his organization offer an unprecedented look at how Big Ag lobbyists allegedly vied to conceal incidents of animal cruelty and disease and targeted law enforcement agencies specifically for capture. “This is a shameless assault on civil liberties, human health, and basic decency,” he says. “There's an inherent relationship between cruelty and disease on factory farms,” says Shapiro, whose MIT doctoral dissertation explored the intersections of national security and controversies over animals. “When you have that many animals packed in so tightly they can't stand up, can't turn around, can't spread their limbs, and are pressed up against each other in their own filth, in their own sickness, of course disease is going to be rampant.” The furor over DxE's activism within the animal agriculture industry reached a fever pitch two months later with the launch of Project Counterglow, an online interactive map of more than 27,500 farms and animal-ag facilities drawn from public regulatory and business records, reporting by individual activists, and artificial intelligence that scanned satellite imagery to reveal previously unknown facilities. The Food Protection and Defense Institute did not respond to a request for comment. Emails from 2023 show officials at the USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture discussing how best to delay news about a highly pathogenic avian flu detected at two Sonoma County farms; a state official having previously warned that “protesters” were likely to be in the area. “Much longer than that and it raises too many questions,” they said. Steve Lyle, a CDFA spokesperson, says the possibility of people showing up to a farm without proper biosecurity training always raises concerns about virus spread. A “crisis response plan” crafted by Washington State livestock and agricultural groups, obtained through a public records request, notes that the federal government's policy is “to assume that any animal disease outbreak or large-scale food contamination incident is an intentional act until proven otherwise.” When rumors about cattle being poisoned or intentionally infected with a virus began circulating around the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and other agencies, the claims were put to rest by the head of an field dairy investigative unit out of Washington State University, whose team had discovered a “serious outbreak” among several herds of yearling cattle. The investigator noted that while a cattle owner was convinced the outbreak was “sabotage from animal rights activists,” other probable sources were clearly present. The investigator said his team had “spent a lot of time trying to convince [the ranchers] that the disease outbreak most likely had nothing to do with bioterrorism, and is most likely due to husbandry and management issues which we laid out very clearly for them.” Pressed by a reporter in 2021 as to why the WSDA kept no tally of livestock in the state, officials noted internally that, while the short answer was it's never been directed to, “privacy is very important to producers, especially with ongoing threats associated with agro-terrorism and activist groups.” That outbreak occurred in an “unusual location in the building,” he said, and did not match the virus's “expected epidemiological pattern.” While stressing that there'd been a report of a simultaneous outbreak at another farm owned by the same company, Goldsmith also cited the AAA in his email as an organization monitoring “animal rights violent extremists.” Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

Goldsmith had already previously dismissed a similar claim while working for the same unit four years prior.

However, chances are that you haven't heard of T-Mobile Fiber Home Internet. T-Mobile is making some big moves today with the announcement that T-Mobile Fiber is moving past its trial phase to an official launch in the U.S. So, what sparked the official rollout of T-Mobile Fiber? In April, T-Mobile announced that it had acquired Lumos, a fiber-to-the-home internet provider serving 475,000 households. Fiber 500, as you would expect, provides symmetrical data speeds of up to 500 Mbps for $75/month with Autopay. The Fiber 500 plan comes with a basic Wi-Fi 6 router, while the Fiber 1 Gig and 2 Gig plans come standard with “whole home” Wi-Fi 6 mesh hardware. T-Mobile customers who also have a qualifying voice line can get $15 off the above pricing each month with Autopay, and all plans come with a 5-year price guarantee. The fourth plan, called Fiber Founders Club, is available for a limited time in “select locations nationwide.” The Fiber Founders Club costs just $70 per month with Autopay for 2 Gbps symmetrical data speeds. T-Mobile also doubles the price guarantee from 5 years to 10 years for these customers, and you don't need a voice line to qualify for the lowest available pricing. It should be noted that all four plans qualify for T-Mobile Tuesdays, which offer various perks available through the T-Life app, including promotions such as a free season of MLB.TV, discount codes from local eateries, and discounts on gas (among other offers). “With the official launch of T-Mobile Fiber, we're delivering on our promise to bring better broadband to more people — the Un-carrier way,” said T-Mobile Chief Broadband Officer Allan Samson. “Our new plans, backed by long-term price guarantees, are designed to give customers more choice and peace of mind. As the fastest growing broadband provider in the country, we'll keep expanding T-Mobile Fiber to reach more communities and find ways to pack more value into our plans.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

If you want to keep up with all the big game releases of the year, you're not going to be able to do that without either immediately deleting them after playing or by expanding your storage capacity. When new titles clock in at over 100GB, you need to make some tough choices in terms of what gets to stay around. The easy solution it to just get yourself a much bigger solid state drive. For instance, the 2TB model is available for $240 on Amazon, which is a 20% discount from its regular price of $300, while the 4TB version has dropped to $450 from $550. The 1TB model is also on sale for $170, down 15% from its $200 original price. Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play: The Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. Great for not just gaming, but any intensive workflows like video editing or working with large datasets. The original PlayStation 5 comes with only 825 GB of internal storage. With the ballooning size of AAA games on the market, you'll be lucky if you can have more than 3 games downloaded onto your system at a time. We have good news: The PS5's storage can be expanded by installing a compatible M.2 solid state drive. The Samsung 9100 Pro is compatible, but with a catch. It's fairly straightforward to install, you can do it yourself following along with a video on YouTube. That's just for the console players though. If you yourself or the loved one you're buying for is gaming on PC, then the non-heatsink version will work out just fine. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Typical AIDA64 preliminary support cadence points to a possible Computex 2026 launch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. There are some new signs of life in the next-gen AMD Ryzen development cycle. On Monday, Finalwire added “preliminary support for next-generation AMD desktop, server and mobile processors.” Yes, that means the system utilities development software team will have received some early information morsels about 'Ryzen 10000 series' processors, if AMD follows the expected naming convention that is. However, before we go on, readers should be warned to rein in any excitement. Looking back at AIDA64's history, such an announcement typically comes around a year ahead of any product launch. Therefore, if this plays out as expected, 'Ryzen 10000' chips will likely be central to AMD's product launch plans at Computex 2026. Even though it may be a year off, we have a few leaks-based information morsels about the 'Ryzen 10000' lineup that are worth summarizing here. On the desktop side of things, probably of greatest interest to our PC enthusiast audience, leaked info from March suggests upcoming Zen 6 architecture processors will remain compatible with the AM5 socket. We think it is likely that AMD will use TSMC's N3P (3 nm-class) process for its Zen 6-based products in 2026. Check out our Ryzen 7 9800X3D review to see the devastating mix of price and (gaming) performance it will have to eclipse. Recently, we also reported on some tantalizing next-gen AMD 'Ryzen 10000' mobile processor leaks. The so-called Medusa Point processors will reportedly carry up to 22 hybrid cores, based on Zen 6. However, these are likely even further away than the desktop chips based on Zen 6, with a launch window of late 2026 / early 2027 expected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company's app is online but cannot process orders, TechCrunch has found. Launched in December 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government's Open Network for Digital Commerce, allowing customers to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets. KiranaPro has 55,000 customers, with 30,000-35,000 active buyers across 50 cities, who collectively place 2,000 orders daily, according to the company. Unlike a typical grocery delivery app, KiranaPro offers a voice-based interface that allows users to place orders from local shops using voice commands in languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, and English. On May 26, KiranaPro executives became aware of the incident while logging into their Amazon Web Services account. Hackers had gained access to KiranaPro's root accounts on AWS and GitHub, Ravindran told TechCrunch. KiranaPro's chief technology officer Saurav Kumar told TechCrunch that the hack happened around May 24-25. The startup said it used Google Authenticator for multi-factor authentication on its AWS account. Some of the biggest cyberattacks in recent years, such as LastPass, Change Healthcare, and Snowflake, were caused by credential theft, such as through password-stealing malware installed on an employee's laptop, and missing or unenforced multi-factor authentication. KiranaPro counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and BCG MD Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. The company has a team of 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala.

The best option that's often forgotten is staring right in front of you—an electric scooter. Right now, Best Buy has it for $200 off (-40%). That brings it down from its usual price of $500 to just $300 for a limited time. Perfect for city life, you can commute to and from work on the HiBoy electric scooter. You can cruise along up to a max speed of 19 mph (I'd like to see you even try to walk that fast) and the scooter folds up so you can carry it easily when going inside or transferring onto a train or bus. Plus, that makes it easy to store in a small apartment. Not only are they just plain fun to ride, an electric scooter is a terrific way to help reduce your carbon footprint. On a single charge, you'll be able to reach an operating range of over 17 miles from your starting point. If you need to commute further than that, I'd probably recommend a car anyway. The HiBoy S2 app for both iPhone and Android can connect to your scooter and be used to lock it when not in use. You can also adjust settings like customized speed and cruise control. Best Buy normally has this particular electric scooter — the HiBoy S2 — for an even $500. Right now, the price has been cut by a solid 40%, bringing it down to just $300.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, an entirely new design inspired by the Vision Pro, and more. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends. Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged. Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone. One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions.

Huang said that the new Nvidia chip "brings together three breakthroughs: the most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device, full hardware ray-tracing, high dynamic range for brighter highlights and deeper shadows, and an architecture that supports backward compatibility." Huang also said the Switch 2 features dedicated AI processors to "sharpen, animate, and enhance gameplay in real-time. "In May, Digital Foundry reported the official specs, including eight ARM Cortex A78C cores featuring the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set, a GPU based on Nvidia's two-generation-old Ampere architecture, and a memory subsystem powered by two 6GB LPDDR5X memory modules (12GB total) operating on a 128-bit memory interface. The console also has 256GB of UFS storage and has a microSD Express card slot that supports additional storage up to 2TB. Much of the video is actually about Nvidia's part in building the original Switch and honoring Satoru Iwata, the fourth president of Nintendo, who oversaw the console's development but passed away before its launch.The Switch 2 is launching at $449.99 when it releases on Thursday (a bundle with Mario Kart World will cost $499.99 for a limited time).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But sometimes a little movie magic comes along and makes even the most simple of meet-cute premises something surreal and mind bending–and that's definitely the case in Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie‘s new movie, Big Bold Beautiful Journey. Directed by Kogonda, Big Bold Beautiful Journey follows two strangers, Sarah and David, who cross paths at a mutual friend's wedding. Moving on from their brief connection, they suddenly find themselves thrust back into each other's lives when the GPS system in David's car suddenly gets a bit 2001: A Space Odyssey and asks David if, well, he wants to go on a big, bold, beautiful journey. But this isn't a more whimsical Her situation going on here–a suddenly sentient car system is the least surreal thing David and Sarah find themselves facing, when they find a magical doorway that lets them journey through time and space, and into pockets of their own histories alongside each other. It's certainly makes for a trippy visual, and a fascinating way for Sarah and David's blossoming relationship to unfold as their histories, and all the joy and grief that comes with discovering someone's past, begin to replay out in front of them. That gag about the car exploding at the end being a bit too dramatic for two people who've just fallen through a gateway in time and space to play out the love story of a life-times is pretty good, too. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.

You can just drop your device and go. And you can hurry about doing whatever it is you need to do for the day while your phone works its way back up to 100%. But if one charger is nice, how about two? And you can save some money by buying in bulk, too. If you're ready to save, check out Amazon to get the Anker Zolo Magnetic Wireless Charger 2-Pack for just $27, down from its usual price of $40. They're like that for all of us. Anker's magnetic chargers deliver 15W fast charging for MagSafe-compatible iPhones, which means you can top off your battery while you work, stream, or scroll without needing to babysit your phone. They stay in place, even if you pick your phone up mid-charge for a quick check-in. And let's face it, we all do that at one point or another. The set includes two chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, which is already a pretty solid value before you even factor in the deal. They're slim, low-profile, and play nicely with iPhone 12 through 16 models. Plus, they come backed by Anker's ActiveShield 2.0 tech, which constantly monitors temperature to help protect battery health over time. If you're still plugging in a Lightning cable every night or juggling slow wireless chargers that overheat and disconnect, this is your sign to level up. With two high-speed magnetic chargers at this price, it's an easy and affordable win for your daily routine. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conkdor, an ostrich-like enemy that made its debut in Super Mario 3D World, should not be able to drive. As a Switch 2 launch title, Mario Kart World heralds the next generation of the series, and it does so with a huge cast of playable racers. Yabuki says that when deciding on the game's cast, the team first had to consider if players would like new characters and, more importantly, if they'd use them. Nintendo wants players to be surprised by who they can play as, but that's not all: “If you're playing a match, would it be fun to see that character alongside you,” Yabuki says. That may explain much of the game's new cast, which includes several characters lacking feet, hands, or both. Yabuki mentions Goomba, the series' iconic, grumpy fanged foes, or Pokey, a cacti character made of stacked spikey balls: “OK, sure, they can drive,” Yabuki says. “I probably wouldn't be able to even explain how they drive exactly in this setting,” Yabuki adds, “but so long as we're surprising and delighting people, I think that's the important part.” The game's cow character is already a huge hit with players since her reveal. Yabuki expects that other new characters will be popular as well. “I'm sure that we'll see a lot of players that are choosing to race as the cow or the penguin,” Yabuki says, “but this is still a Mario Kart game. I hope that everyone remembers to play Peach and Mario as well.” Mario Kart World's huge cast is necessary now that its races can accommodate up to 24 players; the most recent Switch version of the game, Mario Kart 8, allowed only 12 players per round. A race with 24 people can quickly go off the rails. “If we didn't adjust anything else, you'd be receiving too many attacks and it would be too stressful of a gameplay experience,” Yabuki says. “Certainly, we have to think about the chaos element as well,” Yabuki says.

While this ban is unlikely to stop these companies from using the electronic design automation (EDA) software they already have, it will prevent them from getting updates and the required technical support needed to continue designing chips for manufacture in Taiwan, says the Financial Times. Xiaomi is one of the bigger companies to be affected by this move, especially as it just launched the XRing 01 SoC, which uses a 3nm process node from TSMC. Lenovo, which took over IBM's Consumer PC business, and crypto mining hardware specialist Bitmain, also use American EDA software, so they're expected to be affected by this ban as well. This will only impact the most advanced chips, especially those used for AI processing. Aside from that, China has also been working on its own EDA tools to reduce its reliance on American tech. Huawei is one of those, especially as it was one of the first major Chinese companies that received a blanket ban from the U.S.. Empyrean and Primarius Technologies also make their own respective EDA systems, while Semitronix focuses on electrical testing and semiconductor yield improvement. Chinese EDA systems still aren't on the cutting-edge of chip development, but sources say that they're good enough to work with older 7nm nodes and up. However, this will also provide Chinese companies with greater reason to push forward with their own innovations, potentially making them a threat to American technological supremacy in the long run.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok announced on Tuesday that it's officially launching TikTok for Artists, a new music insights platform that is designed to help artists build their careers. The tool is built to help artists and their teams better connect with fans, improve their promotional efforts, and inform content creation on TikTok. These metrics include the number of views, posts, and creator engagements per song, along with similar insights into post performance. Other insights include information about an artist's followers, such as their age, language, and gender. TikTok plays a big part in driving music trends and viral songs, so it makes sense for the company to introduce a dedicated space to help artists better promote their content and drive fan engagement. It's worth noting that the launch of TikTok for Artists comes eight months after ByteDance decided to shut down TikTok Music, a music-streaming service that was being tested in a handful of countries. The events of the past year show that TikTok is no longer trying to compete with services like Spotify and Apple Music, and is instead going to focus on being a platform for music discovery and promotion. TikTok for Artists is now available in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Morocco, United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. The platform will be rolling out in other countries soon, TikTok says. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a preprint study, still awaiting peer review and publication in a journal, astronomers describe this primitive galaxy, giving it the name MoM z14. Earth has an approximate age of 4.543 billion years. A brief reminder about distances relative to space-time. Because light travels at a finite speed of 300,000 meters per second, and because space is expanding, observing light from very distant objects is equivalent to seeing what they were like long ago. For example, when we say that MoM z14 is roughly 13.5 billion years old, that means you would have to travel 13.5 billion years at the speed of light to reach it. So far, there is no point detected by a scientific instrument farther away, and at the same time, older, than this one. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its ability to peer deep into distant space, allows us to study some aspects of the universe in its early stages. So, from our point of view, their light appears to have a longer wavelength because it is stretched by this movement. We call this “redshift”: Their wavelengths are redder because they are longer, and so shift towards the red end of the light spectrum. This is significant because, despite being only 280 million years older than the Big Bang, this shows that MoM z14 does not belong to the first generation of galaxies formed, since stars in these galaxies would be made up only of hydrogen and helium, the elements that predominantly made up the early universe. Heavier elements only arrived later, after being produced in stars. Such discoveries could be a long way off, but we have to keep looking.
