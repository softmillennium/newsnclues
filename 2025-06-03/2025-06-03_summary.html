Over 600 Palestinians have been killed or injured near the US-backed sites in just a week.

Major U.S. firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has pulled out of its involvement in the U.S. and Israel's supposed humanitarian aid scheme in Gaza as human rights groups have warned that the operation is actually a “death trap” that has led to hundreds of casualties so far.

BCG withdrew its ground operation team from Tel Aviv on Friday, The Washington Post reports, and has terminated its contract with the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). One of the senior partners in charge of the operation has also been placed on leave as the firm conducts an internal review, a spokesperson said.

The firm was selected last fall to develop the idea that quickly became yet another avenue for Israeli military massacres when it first opened aid sites last Wednesday. Sources told The Post that the operation at large will be in jeopardy without BCG's involvement, with the firm in charge of setting prices for contractors who built GHF's four distribution centers in Gaza.

“They are actually making the wheels turn,” one person familiar said of BCG's role.

GHF seems determined to continue the operation, however, and has reportedly tapped an evangelical leader and vehement Christian Zionist, Johnnie Moore, to lead the group after its CEO Jake Wood resigned last week. 

Moore, in charge of the project seen as a way for Israel and the U.S. to further their extermination of Palestinians, once lauded President Donald Trump's plan to forcibly expel all Palestinians from Gaza.

Humanitarian groups have shunned the GHF operation since it was first announced months ago, saying that it is just another way for Israel to deny Palestinians crucial needs like food and water. 

On Monday, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) condemned the operation as a “death trap” and reiterated that the only way for Israel to meet its international humanitarian obligations is to stop obstructing aid work by the UN and other established groups.

Over 100 aid seekers in Gaza have been killed since GHF began operations, according to health officials, with Israeli forces seemingly indiscriminately firing on places where people are gathering on their way to the distribution sites. Overall, Israeli forces have killed or injured 600 Palestinians near three GHF sites, according to Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, just over the course of the past week.

This includes 27 Palestinians killed and at least 90 injured on Tuesday when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd near the group's site in Rafah, the third such incident in three days.

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross in the occupied Palestinian territories, the group's field hospital in Rafah received 184 patients after the shooting. 

“In the span of one week, staff at the Red Cross Field Hospital have responded to five mass casualty incidents, four of which occurred in the last 96 hours alone,” the group said. “Today is the highest number of weapon-wounded patients received in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago.”

These massacres, targeting crowds of Palestinians desperate to stave off famine caused by Israel's aid blockade, have had horrific consequences. One man, identified by Euro-Med Monitor as A.B., said he was able to dodge gunfire on the way to the site and obtain a package, but gave it to a woman on the way out who was pleading for help for her and her children.

He turned around to reenter the site when he heard an Israeli drone overhead, broadcasting: “You animals, go away, the supply is out.” Then, as he left, he heard a child's cry, and saw that the woman he gave his package to had been killed. 

“When I returned to my tent, I swore before God and in front of my wife and children that I'd never go to an aid distribution centre, no matter how hard life becomes, even if I had to eat sand,” A.B. said.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Donald Trump appointed himself chair of the performance center in February, leading to boycotts and cancellations

The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has reportedly seen subscription sales fall by about $1.6m – or roughly 36% – compared with 2024 amid Donald Trump's having appointed himself to lead the institution.

The center has made less than $2.7m as of the start of June through subscriptions to its theater, dance, classical and other seasons of performances. The center had generated more than $4.4m by this point a year earlier, according to data obtained by the Washington Post.

The Post says that sales data was collected and shared by former Kennedy Center employees. The data was confirmed by a current staff member, who spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity.

Though the subscription data is only one source of revenue for the center, it could serve as an overall indicator of public standing. Other sources of revenue include donations, individual ticket sales and government funding. The Washington DC-based center's budget for operation was $268m in 2024. About $125m of that came from earned revenue, such as ticket sales, the Post reported.

The employee who leaked the data told the paper: “We understand providing information like this can be seen in a bad light. But we feel that it is necessary to show that mismanagement by the new leadership is becoming a real problem for the health of the organization.”

The employee added that “we feel that we no longer have a choice but to force complete transparency with the public” after several staffers were ignored or outright fired for their opinions.

Trump's appointing himself to be the chairperson of the Kennedy Center in February – less than a month into his second presidency – has ensnared the institution in controversy. He has since reshaped the center's governing board with his own appointees. And the center's former president, Deborah Rutter, has been replaced by the Trump ally Richard Grenell.

A boycott by Les Misérables cast members was the latest in a string of stars pulling out of shows and positions at the center since Trump assumed control. Several shows have been called off, including a stop of the Hamilton tour that was canceled by the production itself, and Finn, a coming-of-age story about a young shark, which was canceled by the Kennedy Center.

The Republican senator known for sycophancy towards the president is pushing a bill that could reshape Ukraine policy

Has Lindsey Graham been playing the long game with Donald Trump?

Graham, who has calibrated his pro-Ukraine support since the inauguration to stay in the US president's orbit, has said he expects this week that the Senate will begin moving his Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a bill that he says would impose “bone-breaking sanctions” on Vladimir Putin and a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil and other goods, potentially targeting China and India.

The fate of the bill still depends on whether Trump gives the go-ahead, according to congressional insiders. But Trump's growing frustration with Putin has emboldened some in the GOP to begin speaking out on the conflict again – with the notoriously flexible Graham leading the charge for tougher sanctions on the Kremlin. Is it nearing a critical mass moment in Congress – a body that has largely abdicated its role in foreign policy since Trump's inauguration?

“I hope so, because it is the right action to take,” said Don Bacon, a Republican House representative who has criticised the White House on its Ukraine policy. “But it is risky to speak for others. I know where I stand. The Senate has an overwhelming majority in support of sanctions and we should move out. It is in our national security interests that Russia fails here and it should be obvious that Putin doesn't want peace, but wants dominance over Ukraine.”

Trump's shift on Russia has come as his efforts to negotiate a speedy ceasefire have failed. Talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Monday led to little progress, and continued outreach from his personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the Kremlin has not brought concessions from Vladimir Putin. A leaked draft of Russia's demands at the negotiations depicted a capitulation: withdrawal from Ukrainian territory claimed by Russia, no Nato membership for Ukraine, caps on the size of the country's military.

Yet it has specifically been the bombardment of cities that has upset Trump, proving once again that Putin has managed to be his own worst enemy when it comes to negotiations.

“I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him,” Trump said last week, repeating part of the comments in public. “He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I'm not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.”

As the White House looks for means to increase pressure on Russia and its enablers like China, the bill backed by Graham and the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal has become a convenient tool to do just that. One person in GOP circles said that the White House was considering letting Republicans “vote their conscience” – in effect allowing Congress to support the bill without facing blowback from the Trump administration.

But that would involve a final decision by the White House, and Trump has still not openly backed new sanctions as more than just a contingency.

“Despite support of 82 or so senators, the bill can't move without support in the House, and the speaker of the House won't move it without the president's support,” said Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. “And it's not clear the president has really decided Putin's the impediment to a ceasefire. Additionally, the Senate will be consumed with passing the reconciliation bill for the next few weeks.”

But as of Tuesday, the leadership appeared ready to move forward.

The weather vane for Trump's gusty foreign policy on Ukraine has been Graham, a veteran political survivor who has built a strong relationship with the president through relentless flattery and has tailored his views to match Trump's when convenient. On Ukraine, he has been so bendable that he could not be broken.

“They play a very careful game because they don't want to upset their relationship with the big guy,” said one person knowledgable about discussions among congressional Republicans. “At the same time, I do think his heart and his head is in the right place. Just really not quite his own courage.”

Graham's interventions have been meaningful. He was instrumental in pushing the minerals deal that Ukraine signed with the US as a way to get Trump's buy-in for its defense. Over a game of golf, he pitched Trump on the “trillions” in mineral wealth in Ukraine and later showed him a map (Trump said he wanted “half” according to one account).

At the same time, he publicly fumed about Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the disastrous White House meeting of late February when Trump and JD Vance argued with the wartime leader. “I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,” Graham said, also suggesting that the Ukrainian leader should resign. (Zelenskyy shot back later that he was ready to offer him citizenship if he wanted to discuss who should lead Ukraine).

Graham's latitude has stunned some of his former colleagues. A former colleague who had worked with Graham on Ukraine policy said that his remarks about Zelenskyy had given him “whiplash”. Asked if Graham had a coherent strategy to influence Trump, the person said: “Graham's strategy is to put Graham first.”

“I think that he understands the big game,” said another person familiar with discussions over the bill. “He would like the policy to be sound, which means [putting sanctions] on the Kremlin. But he values his relationship with the president and that that trumps the first calculation. So if he really feels the president's against, he's not going to go for it.”

Now, with Trump signaling greater readiness for sanctions, Graham has traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy (all smiles) and to Brussels, where he and the EU president, Ursula von der Leyen, discussed potential EU and US sanctions packages to turn up the pressure on Moscow.

“Senator Graham deserves a lot of credit for making the case for tougher pressure on the Kremlin,” said John Hardie, the Russia program deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative thinktank. “Carrots clearly haven't worked, so it's time to start using some sticks, including by going after Russia's oil revenue. This economic pressure should be paired with sustained military assistance for Ukraine.”

Hardie and others noted that Trump could increase pressure on Russia without the Senate bill.

“If President Trump were to decide to go the pressure route, he already has the tools at his disposal to do so,” said Hardie. “For example, he could immediately designate the rest of Russia's shadow fleet and other non-western entities facilitating Russian oil exports and could join with G7 partners in lowering the G7 oil price cap.”

And even if the sanctions are passed, they will ultimately rely on Trump's decision to enforce them.

“The Senate is prepared either way,” Graham wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week. “I have coordinated with the White House on the Russia sanctions bill since its inception. The bill would put Russia on a trade island, slapping 500% tariffs on any country that buys Moscow's energy products. The consequences of its barbaric invasion must be made real to those that prop it up. If China or India stopped buying cheap oil, Mr Putin's war machine would grind to a halt.”

Sweeping cuts made by the Trump administration have already left the government unprepared for hurricane season.

President Donald Trump's acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly told staff that he was not aware that the U.S. has a hurricane season — despite leading the agency primarily responsible for responding to disasters in the U.S.

FEMA chief David Richardson made the comment during a meeting on Monday, according to four sources who spoke to Reuters. Staffers said it was unclear whether his comment was meant as a joke.

The comment was made the day after hurricane season began in the Atlantic Ocean, with the season officially ending in November. Some researchers suggest that the hurricane season is lengthening, however, as the climate crisis drives earlier and later storms, while also making storms stronger than they would be otherwise. 

Indeed, forecasters for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have predicted above-normal hurricane activity for 2025. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are killed by hurricanes each year in the U.S.

In a statement after the report was published, the Department of Homeland Security framed Richardson's comment as a joke. But the statement didn't outright deny the comment, calling the report “meanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy.”

“​​[T]here is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season,” the statement said. “FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.”

However, Richardson's comments — as well as President Donald Trump's flip-flopping on whether he wants to abolish FEMA itself — have reportedly spurred confusion and alarm, leaving even staff concerned over the government's ability to respond to hurricanes and other disasters.

Trump has suggested that he wants to get rid of or severely shrink FEMA, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has publicly announced plans to do so. Though the administration hasn't fully eliminated the agency yet, FEMA has reportedly drastically reduced trainings for state and local emergency hurricane response, potentially leaving communities across the U.S. shorthanded when a hurricane strikes this year.

At the same time, the administration's drastic cuts to the National Weather Service have left the agency majorly short staffed, meaning that the government's ability to predict and track storms is jeopardized.

Further, during the staff meeting on Monday, Richardson reportedly told staff that the agency was scrapping his plan for hurricane response, which he said was almost done. Instead, the agency was going to use last year's hurricane response plan — which wouldn't be possible, staff said, with the administration's cuts to the agency.

Richardson's appointment has also raised concerns over his ability to lead FEMA, especially through multiple staffing crises. The official has already racked up numerous gaffes in just a few weeks as FEMA director. 

During a town hall meeting with staff on the administration's plan for “FEMA 2.0,” for instance, Richardson bizarrely talked about his girlfriend with “huge red hair” educating him on the size of Texas, and went off on tangents about fruits while trying to discuss the future of the agency. He also speculated on the number of laws governing FEMA, while referencing crucial information he had just learned about FEMA “last week.”

Critics said a FEMA director shouldn't be making jokes about something as serious as hurricane preparedness, especially when he's only been in his role for a few weeks and has zero prior experience in emergency management. 

“Suffice to say, disaster response is no joke,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight of FEMA. “If you don't know what or when hurricane season is, you're not qualified to run FEMA. Get someone knowledgeable in there.”

Jersey Mike's employee reportedly called county sheriff's office after finding note in store bathroom that read ‘HELP'

A Navarre, Florida, sandwich shop employee reportedly helped authorities save a domestic violence victim who had allegedly been kidnapped by her abusive, pro-wrestler boyfriend after the worker recently found a note in a store bathroom that read “HELP!”

At the center of the incident is Eleanor Coffee, who was at her job making sandwiches for a shop belonging to the Jersey Mike's chain when she noticed a “little piece of crumpled up paper” that had been discarded next to one of the business's toilet paper dispensers, as she put it to the local news station WEAR-TV.

Coffee at first thought it was a piece of trash but then realized the paper contained a plea for help, a woman's name, a phone number and an address for a nearby home.

“Please help me get home!” the note said in part, according to an arrest report reviewed by Law & Crime. The note's writer ominously also asked for someone to “get” her before Friday, adding: “HELP!”

Coffee alerted her manager to the note and called the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office, whose jurisdiction includes Navarre, she told WEAR. After reviewing security video at the Jersey Mike's shop, deputies established the note had been left by a woman who entered the store with her boyfriend, identified as 34-year-old Jordan Williams, a statement from the sheriff's office said.

The sheriff's office said it was familiar with Williams from prior domestic violence cases. Deputies then obtained a warrant to search the address mentioned in the note at Jersey Mike's before encountering a woman at that home “who confirmed she authored the note and detailed a prolonged period of abuse”.

“She detailed repeated assaults, threats involving weapons, and being held in isolation by Williams for a span of several months,” the sheriff's office said. The agency added that the woman had “visible injuries”, and paramedics brought her to a hospital to be treated for “suspected broken bones and other trauma”.

Deputies ultimately booked Williams – who reportedly wrestled professionally under the ring name Jayden Steele in the local independent circuit – with various felonies, including kidnapping, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and battery by strangulation. A judge ordered Williams held without bond after an initial court appearance on Thursday.

In a statement, Santa Rosa sheriff, Robert Johnson, praised the note writer for “the bravery” she displayed in making herself heard. “Thanks to her courage and the deputies' swift actions, she is now safe and receiving care,” Johnson's statement said.

Coffee, meanwhile, said she would never forget finding the note that led deputies to arrest Williams and find the woman whom he had allegedly kidnapped.

“My heart goes out to her and her family,” Coffee said. “And I'm just … hopeful that really doesn't happen again.”

Program halted suddenly, leaving legal immigrants unable to work due to lack of US social security number

Millions of legal immigrants may be left unable to work after the US Social Security Administration quietly instituted a rule change to stop automatically issuing them social security numbers.

The Enumeration Beyond Entry program is an agreement between the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, where US Citizenship and Immigration Services would provide social security with information from applicants for work authorization or naturalization.

The program began in 2017 under the first Trump administration.

Without any public notice, on 19 March, the program was halted, affecting millions of immigrants every year and burdening Social Security Administration offices, as those applicants will now have to visit a Social Security Administration office and apply separately to receive a social security number.

Following the freeze, the Trump administration issued a memo on 15 April aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from receiving social security benefits, but provided no evidence of it being a problem.

Trump and Elon Musk, billionaire former leader of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have falsely claimed these programs are being used to attract unauthorized immigrants to vote for Democrats.

“Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicare or social security retirement benefits. Nor does any evidence exist that unauthorized immigrants fraudulently receive benefits in large numbers,” wrote Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, an economics professor at Boston College, in a blogpost.

Lee Thacker moved to south-west Minnesota last summer with his now wife, a native of the US. After getting married, he applied for a work authorization card while his permanent residency application was being processed.

When the 52-year-old from Pontypridd in Wales received his work authorization card at the end of April 2025, he began applying for jobs and received a job offer. After he failed to receive his social security number, “I lost the job,” said Thacker.

“I needed a background check and the company doing the check required a social security number, and the company itself has a policy of not employing people without social security numbers. So I am legally entitled to work, but in practice I can't because no one will employ me without a social security number.”

He noted the work authorization form, I-765, still has a checkbox on it to fill out to receive a social security number card, which he did. He paid $260 for the employment authorization card application and was expecting to receive a social security number within two weeks of receiving his work authorization card.

Thacker was not informed why until he visited a Social Security Administration field office about half an hour away, where he was informed about the change.

In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid $25.7bn in taxes to social security, despite not being eligible to receive the benefits.

“It's definitely affected a lot of individuals. We've tried to warn all of our clients,” said Jennifer Bade, an immigration lawyer based in Boston, Massachusetts.

Bade explained the issues and difficulties immigrants face in visiting a Social Security Administration field office, including having to take time off work, language barriers, and issues and delays for immigrants who need a social security number to start a job, open a bank account, or receive a loan.

“The pausing of this program makes no sense,” added Bade. “It's all just meant to attack immigrants, and it has no actual benefits. Pausing this program literally has no benefits.”

Democrats on the House committee on oversight and government reform urged the Social Security Administration to reverse its decision to freeze the program.

According to the then ranking member of the committee, the late congressman Gerald Connolly, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration personally approved the pause despite legal concerns and warnings over the effects of pausing the program.

Hope Rudasill of North Carolina said her husband, whose name is being kept anonymous for fear of retaliation, recently filed for a work authorization card, but did not expect the delay in receiving a social security number, as he was told it would be issued automatically when he filed his application.

“My husband hasn't been able to start his job search because most employers require a valid social security number before even considering applications. It's also prevented him from applying for a driver's license which limits his ability to get around independently,” Rudasill told the Guardian.

“We haven't been able to open a joint bank account, which is not only inconvenient for managing finances, but also creates challenges when we go to our adjustment of status interview [an essential part of applying for lawful permanent residency] as a shared bank account is a key piece of evidence to prove we're building a life together and not having that documentation makes the process more stressful.”

The rule change came as billionaire Musk pushed misinformation about immigrants and social security benefits, including touting data from the Enumeration Beyond Entry program, falsely claiming it was evidence of fraud.

In fiscal year 2024, 3.24m initial employment authorization documents were approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The costs of issuing a social security number through this program in the same year, according to a Social Security Administration memo, was $8 per issuance, compared with $55.80 in a field office.

Those field offices are also operating with reduced staff, as the Social Security Administration sought to cut staff by at least 12%, and Doge has terminated leases for at least 47 offices at the agency. The freeze is likely to add even more pressure to staff at the agency, in addition to new phone restrictions implemented by the Trump administration, which will require individuals to make 1.93m additional trips to social security field offices annually.

“I was hoping I would be able to work within a few months of applying for permanent residency, once I got the employment authorization card,” Lee Thacker added. “If I had known social security cards were no longer being sent out automatically, I would have made an in-person visit shortly after getting my employment authorization card. There must be many people waiting patiently expecting to receive their social security cards. If this is a permanent change local SSA offices will be receiving more in-person visits at a time when staffing numbers are being reduced.”

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Social Security Administration said in an email: “The Enumeration Beyond Entry (EBE) process is currently paused for noncitizens granted work authorization (I-765) and newly naturalized US citizens (N-400) for 90 days, while the agency is evaluating its enumeration policies and procedures. SSA will continue to process EBE applications for those granted legal permanent resident status (I-485) along with all EBE applications that were filed prior to March 18, 2025.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the third attack against the Crimean Bridge since Russia's full-scale war began in 2022, mining and damaging its underwater supports, the SBU announced on June 3.

“God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself," SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement posted on social media.

"Previously, we struck the Crimean Bridge in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater," he added. 

The SBU said the operation "lasted for several months, with agents mining the "supports of this illegal construction."

Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

"And today, without inflicting any civilian casualties, the first explosive was activated at 4:44 a.m.," the SBU said.

Underwater supports of the bridge's piers were severely damaged at the bottom as 1,100 kilograms of explosives in TNT equivalent were detonated, according to the statement.

Russian state media later reported a "Ukrainian intelligence agent" who had constructed a bomb on "orders from Kyiv" had been detained by Russia's FSB

The operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.

A claimed "agent of Ukrainian intelligence services" has been detained in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service said later on June 3, accusing the detainee of producing a "powerful explosive."  

The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission. 

The construction of the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, holds a significant symbolic value for Russia. The $4 billion project was a political statement designed to affirm the Kremlin's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, as the peninsula is not connected by land to Russia.   

Russia's Defense Ministry previously claimed that three Ukrainian drones were downed over Crimea overnight on June 3. 

The Crimean Bridge was closed for traffic between 6 and 9 a.m. local time on that day, according to local Telegram channels. The Mash Telegram channel reported that a Ukrainian drone was shot down over the bridge, and its debris fell onto the road.

According to pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind, the bridge had been closed down for inspection, possibly to examine damage.

Later the same day, Crimean Wind reported a new "powerful explosion" near Kerch at around 3 p.m., writing that a helicopter is patrolling the strait. Several local channels reported that a fresh drone attack against the peninsula was underway in the afternoon, and that the bridge is closed once again.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Protests are unfolding as agents arrest undocumented people at courthouses, workplaces and on the way to school.

Protests over ICE raids are continuing across the United States as agents arrest immigrants at courthouses, from their workplaces, on the way to school and more. Immigration and human rights advocate Adriana Jasso with Unión del Barrio describes protests that met a massive raid in San Diego at a popular restaurant, the targeting of farmworkers, and how her organization has been conducting ICE patrols to alert the community.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We look now how protests over immigration raids and arrests are continuing around the country. In Milford, Massachusetts, this weekend, students walked out of school Monday to show support for Marcelo Gomes da Silva, an 18-year-old high school honor student detained Saturday by ICE agents in three unmarked vehicles as he drove his volleyball teammates to practice at 7:45 in the morning. Marcelo was born in Brazil, had lived in the Milford area since he was 5 years old. He was also a member of the school band and was scheduled to perform the next day at the school's graduation ceremony. So, on Sunday, many students marched in their gowns from their graduation to join hundreds of others at a protest outside Milford's town hall. That's Massachusetts.

Let's go across the country now to San Diego, where outrage is growing after 20 armed and masked ICE agents in full tactical gear raided a popular Italian restaurant Friday. The agents handcuffed the staff, demanded IDs, arrested four workers. Local residents reacted angrily to the raid, attempted to block ICE vehicles from leaving the scene. ICE agents responded by throwing flash-bang smoke grenades at the crowd.

Just two examples of communities expressing outrage over ICE raids. This comes as immigrant communities are also pushing back on the raids and arrests. In San Diego, the Unión del Barrio is conducting community patrols of ICE agents in their neighborhood. This is a clip from a patrol in May. They speak in English and Spanish.

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 1: [Estamos aquí, vigilando la (calle) 39 y] Hemlock. Parece unos vehículos sospechosos. [translated: We're here, watching 39th (Street) and Hemlock. Looks like some suspicious vehicles.]

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 2: Aquí están. They're in front of us. [translated: Here they are. They're in front of us.]

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 3: Sí, sí, los vemos. Estamos al frente de ustedes. ¿Qué vehículos, más o menos? [translated: Yes, yes, we see them. We are in front of you. What vehicles, more or less?]

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 2: Son tres vehículos. [translated: There are three vehicles.]

AMY GOODMAN: One of the people helping on these patrols by Unión del Barrio is Adriana Jasso, who will join us in a minute. This is a clip of her on another patrol, using a bullhorn to alert the community that ICE agents are on site. She speaks in Spanish.

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 4: Aqui tenemos al ICE. Sí era, sí era. [translated: Here we have ICE. Yes, it was (ICE). Yes, it was.]

ADRIANA JASSO: Aquí está ICE. Este es un vehículo de ICE. Un vehículo de ICE que está haciendo inteligencia a nuestra comunidades. [translated: Here is ICE. This is an ICE vehicle. An ICE vehicle that is doing intelligence on our communities.]

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined in San Diego by Adriana Jasso, immigration and human rights advocate with the longtime group Unión del Barrio.

Welcome to Democracy Now!, Adriana. It's great to have you with us. So, we are describing these different stories. Can you tell us first what happened on Friday at this Italian eatery? It was just opening up. Armed, heavily armed, ICE agents, various immigration parts of the government move in. And tell us what happened, and then how the community is responding.

ADRIANA JASSO: Thank you, Amy, for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be with you.

Yes, on Friday evening, around 5 p.m., as members of the community of South Park, which is a middle-class community in — one of the many communities in San Diego was getting ready for dinner, and this particular restaurant has been popular for many years by local families and people who are just about to enjoy an evening of family time. And on Friday, HSI, the investigative branch of CBP, of DHS, came to that location and requested for customers to exit the restaurant, as well as put under arrest and detention to every person working and serving a function in the restaurant.

AMY GOODMAN: And could you tell us, Adriana, in terms of this move toward actual raids, rather than just going in to arrest individual peoples, which the Trump administration started, but now raids in the community, how frequently have these begun to crop up?

ADRIANA JASSO: Yes, thank you, Dr. González.

We have seen an increase in the level of fear, intimidation and terror that our communities are experiencing. We have had a clear escalation of work raids, and including this latest one at this restaurant. At the end of March, a construction site was raided in the East County of El Cajon. And the images and the level of escalation and aggression and excessive use of force, intimidation and terror that some of the images showed in South Park do not compare to what we saw and witnessed in the city of El Cajon, wherein over 80 agents exercised an operation at a work site that lasted six-and-a-half hours, and they detained over 200 workers, with a conclusion of taking into custody 17 of those over 100 workers that they detained for over six hours.

AMY GOODMAN: And what about the situation of farmworkers? The whole nation, not just California, depends on the work of farmworkers in California, many of them immigrant workers. What's the situation, that you've been able to tell of, in the fields?

ADRIANA JASSO: Specifically to the community in the county of Bakersfield and the Central Valley, where most of the food comes from and is cared for and harvested by the hands and the labor of migrant workers and workers of Latino, Mexicano descent, as well as Central America, we have had two major work raids or targeting farmworkers in the Bakersfield, early — mid-December, and a second one that had an impact took place in the farmworkers community in the Orange County, as well, in the Orange County about a month ago. This has been the escalation of targeting, and this came from Border Patrol, another branch of CBP, where over a hundred workers were detained, the first operation, and the second one, over 20 workers were detained. What is particular to highlight is that many of the workers were able to exercise and defend themselves from the excessive use of force and the abusive psychological harm that border agents and ICE agents were trying to inflict at the time of the interaction with the workers.

AMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk, Adriana Jasso, about how the community is organizing? We're seeing communities where a sudden arrest happens, and just the community rises up, from Missouri to Massachusetts. But you've been organizing for years. How are you moving on now? What are you — what are people doing in their organizing as Stephen Miller talks about ramping up to 3,000 arrests each day?

ADRIANA JASSO: We understand and have adhered to our historical responsibility to fight back, to resist and to denounce and take the moral imperative to say that the legal framework, due process, constitutional rights, civil rights, human rights, that were protection to our communities and to the working class of the West and every and other places in the country, this administration has made sure to erase and to try to attack and violate every human right, every constitutional right. Unión del Barrio stands in very much the assessment and the understanding that we have the responsibility to defend our communities. We are organizing night and date, weekend, weekdays, every single possible energy and time that we are able to put into community work and say that we have the right and the responsibility to defend ourselves.

You had a chance to see the community patrols that we have in place from L.A., from Riverside, from San Diego, from Escondido, and we're developing relationships to implement this model in Santa, Barbara and San Francisco, and also potentially looking at growing in places like Utah, New York, Chicago. We are having those conversations because we know and we understand that the moral imperative to fight back, to resist and to not ask for permission or apologize for the right to exist. These are exciting times, yet they are difficult times, painful times. But this also could be an opportunity for the movement to gain the strength to stand up and face a fascistic, harmful government that has done away with the fundamental human rights and constitutional rights that we as communities deserve.

AMY GOODMAN: Adriana Jasso, I want to thank you for being with us, immigration and human rights advocate based in San Diego, California, a member of Unión del Barrio.

            Portuguese and German police on Tuesday launched joint searches of a “vast” area in Portugal's southern Algarve region for new evidence related to the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old British child Madeleine McCann.
    


            Portugal's investigative Judicial Police (PJ) had said on Monday they would execute search warrants between June 2 and 6 at the behest of the public prosecutor's office in Germany's Braunschweig, which in 2022 formally identified German national Christian Brueckner as an official suspect in the case.
    


            A source involved in the search operation said the targeted area was “vast” with police using ground-penetrating radar across several hectares. Portuguese officers were following instructions from German police under a European Investigation Order.
    


            The scale of the searches could be the most extensive since the initial investigation was closed in 2008.
    


            Fresh but relatively focused searches were ordered by Portuguese, British and German police of scrubland, wells and reservoirs in 2014, 2020 and 2023. None of these searches were confirmed to have yielded significant evidence.
    


            Reuters footage showed uniformed PJ officers on a cordon on a dirt road in Atalaia - a neighborhood of Lagos municipality - waving through unmarked vans and cars with German license plates from the city of Wiesbaden, where the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has its headquarters.

            The BKA is assisting Portuguese law enforcement with “criminal procedural measures,” Braunschweig prosecutors told Reuters, declining to provide further details.
    


            The occupants of one of the German vehicles wore bucket hats, clothing with camouflage patterns and covered their faces with bandanas.
    


            A van belonging to Portugal's Maritime Police also arrived. That force has jurisdiction over coastal areas and took part in previous searches of beaches, wells and reservoirs using specialist divers.
    


            The road the police cordoned off is located close to a golf course and less than 1 km (0.6 miles) from the beach. The search area was close to a property that Brueckner lived in, a neighbor told Reuters in 2020, though when was unclear.
    


            Madeleine went missing on May 3, 2007, while on holiday with her family in the Algarve town of Praia da Luz, sparking a frenzied search and gaining the attention of the world's media. She has never been found.
    


            German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and Brueckner, in his 40s, was probably responsible. He has denied responsibility.
    


            Brueckner, a convicted child abuser and drug dealer, is behind bars in Germany for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same area of the Algarve. His sentence runs until September, meaning he is set for release unless prosecutors find enough evidence to charge him over Madeleine's disappearance.
    


            On Jan. 17 Sky News quoted the German prosecutor investigating Madeleine's disappearance as saying there was currently no prospect of charges being brought against Brueckner.

The acting head of Fema told colleagues he was not aware America had a hurricane season, according to a report.

Staff of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were left baffled when David Richardson, who has led the agency since early May, said he had not been aware the country has a hurricane season during a briefing on Monday, according to four sources familiar with the situation.

The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast last week that this year's season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes.

A spokesman for the department of homeland security (DHS) which oversees Fema insisted Mr Richardson was joking when he made the remark.

Mr Richardson said during the briefing that there would be no changes to the agency's disaster response plans despite having told staff to expect a new plan in May, the sources told Reuters.

There is mounting concern that the departures of a raft of top Fema officials, staff cuts and reductions in hurricane preparations have left the agency ill-prepared for a storm season forecast to be above normal.

Hurricanes kill dozens of people and cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually across the US every year. The storms have become increasingly more destructive and costly.

A DHS spokesman said: “Despite mean-spirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what Fema will be doing this hurricane season.

“Fema is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.”

Mr Richardson's remark spurred confusion among agency staff and reignited concern about his lack of familiarity with its operations, three sources told Reuters.

Mr Richardson, who has no disaster response experience, said he will not be issuing a new disaster plan because he does not want to make changes that might counter the Fema review council, the sources said.

Donald Trump created the council to evaluate Fema. Its members include Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, governors and other officials.

In a May 15 staff town hall, Mr Richardson said a disaster plan, including tabletop exercises, would be ready for review by May 23.

The back-and-forth on updating the disaster plan and a lack of clear strategic guidance has created confusion for Fema staff, said one source.

Mr Richardson has evoked his military experience as a former Marine artillery officer in conversations with staff.

Before joining Fema he was assistant secretary at the department for homeland security's office for countering weapons of mass destruction, which he has told staff he will continue to lead.

Mr Richardson was appointed as the new chief of Fema last month after his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, was abruptly fired.

Mr Hamilton had publicly broken with Mr Trump over the future of the agency, but sources told Reuters that Trump allies had already been manoeuvring to oust him because they were unhappy with what they saw as Hamilton's slow-moving effort to restructure.

Mr Trump said Fema should be shrunk or even eliminated, arguing states can take on many of its functions, as part of a wider downsizing of the federal government. About 2,000 full-time Fema staff, one-third of its total, have been terminated or voluntarily left the agency since the start of the Trump administration in January.

Despite Ms Noem's prior comments that she plans to eliminate Fema, in May she approved Mr Richardson's request to retain more than 2,600 short-term disaster response and recovery employees whose terms were set to expire this year, one of the sources said, confirming an earlier report by NBC News.

Those short-term staff make up the highest proportion of Fema employees, about 40 per cent, and are a pillar of the agency's on-the-ground response efforts.

Fema recently sharply reduced hurricane training and workshops for state and local emergency managers due to travel and speaking restrictions imposed on staff, according to Reuters.

Israeli forces fired on dozens of people, including children, near a privatized aid distribution site in southern Gaza.

Israeli forces on Tuesday gunned down dozens of people, including children, close to a privatized aid distribution site in southern Gaza, marking the third consecutive day that Israel's military has opened fire on Palestinians seeking food amid an increasingly dire humanitarian emergency.

A doctor at nearby Nasser Hospital, which is barely functioning and unequipped to handle an influx of patients, told The New York Times that the facility received 19 of those killed in Tuesday's massacre. Most of the victims, according to Dr. Ahmad al-Farra, were children between the ages of 10 and 13, “many with gunshot wounds to the head or chest.”

The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that “the incident shocked local residents and activists, who describe it as ‘another aid massacre' targeting defenseless civilians.”

“It is one of the deadliest incidents since the beginning of aid allocation in the southern Gaza Strip,” the newspaper observed.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that its soldiers opened fire near the aid site operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, but claimed “shots were directed near individual suspects who advanced toward the troops.” The Times reported that an IDF spokesperson “declined to explain the nature of the perceived threat.”

Testimony from witnesses, health officials, and humanitarian workers on the ground contradicted the IDF's account of limited firing at “individual suspects.”

According to The Associated Press, “Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said its field hospital in Rafah received 184 wounded people.”

AP went on to cite several Palestinians who witnessed Tuesday's massacre:

Yasser Abu Lubda, a 50-year-old displaced Palestinian from Rafah, said the shooting started around 4 am in the city's Flag Roundabout area, around one kilometer (1,000 yards) away from the aid distribution hub. He said he saw several people killed or wounded.

Neima al-Aaraj, a woman from Khan Younis, gave a similar account.

“There were many martyrs and wounded,” she said, saying the shooting by Israeli forces was “indiscriminate.”

She said she managed to reach the hub but returned empty-handed. “There was no aid there,” she said. “After the martyrs and wounded, I won't return,” she said. “Either way we will die.”

Rasha al-Nahal, another witness, said “there was gunfire from all directions.” She said she counted more than a dozen dead and several wounded along the road. She said she also found no aid when she arrived at the distribution hub, and that Israeli forces “fired at us as we were returning.”

At least 27 people were killed by Israeli forces Tuesday morning, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The deadly incident occurred after IDF troops killed more than 30 people and wounded dozens of others near the privatized aid distribution site on Sunday and Monday.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Monday that “it is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food.”

“I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable,” Guterres said. “Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law to agree to and facilitate humanitarian aid. The unimpeded entry of assistance at scale to meet the enormous needs in Gaza must be restored immediately. The U.N. must be allowed to work in safety and security under conditions of full respect of humanitarian principles.”

Lisa Shields launched Fispan after noticing banks weren't keeping up with digital challengers.Tijana Martin/The Globe and Mail

One of Canada's most successful women tech entrepreneurs, Lisa Shields, has raised US$30-million for her latest company Fispan Services Inc. in a deal led by U.S. growth equity firm Canapi Ventures.

Beyond the headline information, however, the details of the deal reveal how much the financing market has shifted since the tech bubble burst in 2021. 

The Fispan transaction “is quite different” from deals of that era, which saw money-losing startups pursue growth at all costs and raise huge financings at ever-inflated valuations, said Tom Davis, Canapi's San Francisco-based general partner. 

Instead, it is more indicative of a return to saner market dynamics, he said. “This is a classic growth equity deal.” 

For one, Fispan didn't need the money. Fispan sells subscription software tools that enable banks to embed services for mid-market companies into enterprise resource planning (ERP) and accounting platforms such as Oracle NetSuite, Intuit QuickBooks and Xero. That makes it easier for clients to handle cash and accounts management in one place. 

Fispan has 15 customers, including Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, and is used by 4,500 of their clients.

Vancouver entrepreneur whose last business was sold to PayPal for $400-million expands new fintech for banks

The nine-year-old Vancouver company generates US$25-million-plus in annual revenue after growing by 80 per cent on average over the past three years. It turned profitable last year and still has half the US$16-million from its last funding in 2021. (Fispan did fall prey to the grow-at-all-costs mindset, Ms. Shields admits, before cutting 30 per cent of staff in 2022 and shifting “to serve our bank clients with quality and consistency at all costs.”)

Since Fispan sells to banks, it doesn't spend much on marketing and “has fantastic unit economics, a proven sales motion, a solid customer base and high net dollar retention within existing customers,” said Mr. Davis. Meanwhile, valuations for fintech companies are running at eight to 12 times revenues, about half what they were at the peak. 

So why raise at all? 

“You're asking the question we had as an internal debate,” said Ms. Shields, an aeronautical engineer by training whose previous company, payments platform provider Hyperwallet Systems Inc., sold to PayPal Holdings Inc. for US$400-million in 2018. 

The answer is two-fold, she said: to “remove liquidity pressure” by offering investors a chance to take money off the table. Most of the Canapi-led investment – US$17-million-plus – is going to angel and seed-stage backers in what is called a secondary deal. 

Canadian deal-making still stuck in a rut, despite the hot markets

Secondaries have become commonplace as mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, have dried up. While companies aren't keen to issue equity or sell at lower valuations, many investors are happy to cash in some gains. In fact, Ms. Shields would have been content to do just a secondary offering and was only willing to sell up to US$15-million in primary equity to minimize dilution. 

“We didn't want to take more than we had to,” said Jay Rhind, a Fispan director and partner with Rhino Ventures, the company's largest investor, which has invested $38-million in the company, much of that from buying out other early investors. 

The second reason was to find a new investor with expertise and deep pockets. Fispan had had the same group of investors since 2018 – early Fispan investor Rhino led the 2021 round – and Ms. Shields wanted to add a growth equity firm to her ownership group and boardroom that was familiar with the realities of selling to slow-moving banks. To make the deal big enough to interest growth equity firms, which typically invest large amounts in deals, Ms. Shields targeted a US$40-million raise, but existing investors ultimately weren't willing to sell as much as expected. 

Canapi was the ideal choice for several reasons: Because it invests in a wider range of deals, it was open to investing a lower amount than some growth equity firms. Its leaders hail from finance, financial technology and regulatory affairs (managing partner Gene Ludwig was chief banking regulator of the U.S. during the Clinton administration), and its funders are comprised of 75 financial institutions, many of which could open doors for Fispan. 

That was important for Ms. Shields, who started Fispan after noticing banks weren't keeping up with digital challengers that were plugging their services into business software platforms. She set out to build tools that would make banking services “just as delightful and easy to use as those of any fintech” on those platforms. 

But many fintechs that target mid-market corporations (those with US$30-million to US$2-billion in annual revenues) typically top out before hitting 10,000 customers, she said. Ms. Shields sees a potential market of 250,000 such companies in North America alone and is eying expansion in Britain. 

“Nobody has ever had the kind of market share that really makes it interesting. We think with our bank-based distribution model we have a really interesting opportunity to get there,” she said. 

“I want guidance from people that have worked with banks. This is about structuring the company to be able to continue high growth with discipline in the face of this radical technological shift that's coming, and we want to be part of it.”

Come on down, eh!

A Canadian spinoff of The Price is Right headlines Rogers's new slate of Canadian originals coming to Citytv.

The media giant says Canadian comedian Howie Mandel will host a reimagining of the U.S. game show, which begins production this December in Toronto and will air in the spring of 2026.

While the original was a daytime TV staple, Rogers says it plans to make a prime-time evening version of the show, which has a working title of The Price Is Right Tonight.

In September, Citytv will also air a one-hour red carpet special celebrating the 50th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival, led by Big Brother Canada host Arisa Cox. 

Also on the way are a third season of Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent,” slated for winter, and an eighth season of Hudson & Rex this fall.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

Federal officials drafted warnings about travelling to the U.S. for Canadians and permanent residents in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump this year but did not post them, internal documents obtained through access to information legislation show.

A document – entitled “Potential impact of EOs on Canadians travelling to the USA Draft travel advice updates” – was drawn up by Global Affairs' C Branch, which deals with emergency management as well as travel advice. 

One section (entitled “Scenarios and Options for Senior Management consideration. Communications to Canadians in the United States”) suggests Canadians consider returning home if they do not have proper documents to stay in the U.S. 

Also addressed is an executive order entitled “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.” The American directive, issued on January 20, aims to enhance screening and vetting of foreign nationals entering the U.S.

American civil-rights groups have warned that the order may lead to the reinstatement of a ban on travellers from predominantly Muslim or Arab countries that Mr. Trump introduced during his first term as President. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has said it relies on the same statutory authority that was used to justify that 2017 travel ban.

What are Trump's executive orders on immigration, the ‘border emergency' and birthright citizenship?

The internal Global Affairs document, drawn up earlier this year, contains drafts of several potential travel advisories that could be issued in response, including versions to be used if bans for particular countries are introduced. Most of them reassure Canadian citizens and permanent residents that they would not be affected.

“The Government of Canada has been informed that Canadians travelling with a Canadian passport, including dual citizens who have Canadian citizenship and citizenship from one of the following X countries: INSERT COUNTRIES, will not be affected by the Executive Order,” the document says.

Another draft option reads: “Similarly, entry requirements for Canadian permanent residents with a valid Canadian permanent resident card and a passport from one of those seven countries remain unchanged because of the Executive Order.”

But another says: “Permanent Residents of Canada from one of the above seven countries should consult Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on the Executive Order for information on entry requirements.“

Federal civil servants also suggested specific updates to Ottawa's official advice after Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January declaring that the U.S. government now recognizes only two sexes: male and female.

It suggests a “generic update” to advice for Canadians with an X on their passport, rather than an F or M, that says “you might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the ”X" gender identifier." It adds: “Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.”

About 3,600 Canadians have X on their passport, according to the federal Immigration Department. 

The government already offers general travel advice for transgender and non-binary Canadians, including that “foreign laws and customs related to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics can be very different from those in Canada. As a result, you could face certain barriers and risks when you travel outside Canada.”

Transgender advocate Fae Johnstone, executive director of Queer Momentum, a Canadian LGBTQ advocacy group, said she was pleased that officials were thinking about an update, but speculated that politicians may have vetoed its publication because “Canada is not wanting to pick new fights with Donald Trump.”

”We do need updated travel guidance for people who have X on their passport. It feels like there's a way to do this which isn't about picking a fight with America, but supporting trans folks," she said.

The U.S. has said that its border agents will recognize Canadian passports with an X.

The Global Affairs document was obtained by researcher Ken Rubin through an access to information request and shared with the Globe and Mail. 

It emphasizes that, “It is too early to tell how the different EOs will impact Canadians travelling to the United States. The travel advice found in this document is subject to change and was drafted by making assumptions on the possible implications the EOs will have on Cansits” [Canadian citizens].

In March, Global Affairs updated its travel advice to make Canadians visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days aware of a new U.S. rule requiring them to register with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. 

In April, it further updated its guidance, telling Canadians to “expect scrutiny” from U.S. border guards, who may look through phones and laptops. “Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry, you could be detained while awaiting deportation.” 

In a statement on Friday, Global Affairs spokesperson Charlotte MacLeod said, “The intent of the updates is to ensure Canadians have accurate information about travelling to the United States and that they know which U.S. Government sources to turn to for official advice.”

She added that, “Officials prepare in advance to respond to a variety of possible scenarios, based on new information, analysis of trends, and historical examples. This preparation includes developing draft templates of text that can be quickly adapted to respond to a specific situation if needed, based on the most recent information.”

			Darren Beattie, who alarmed the State Department with his pro-Moscow views, is married to a woman whose uncle has ties to Vladimir Putin

A senior official who dismantled the US government's Russian disinformation unit is married to a Russian woman with links to the Kremlin, The Telegraph can reveal.

Darren Beattie has provoked alarm within the State Department since being appointed in February for his ardent pro-Russian views.

He has been noted for his focus on destroying the agency tasked with tackling Kremlin propaganda.

Mr Beattie, the acting under-secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, is married to a woman whose uncle has taken several roles in Russian politics and once received a personal “thank you” message from Vladimir Putin.

In the years before joining the government, Mr Beattie wrote social media posts suggesting Western institutions should be “infiltrated” by Putin, while he also attacked what he described as the “globalist American empire”.

Donald Trump is under pressure from many in his party, particularly senators, to take a tougher stance on the Russian leader while he continues to refuse to sign a ceasefire deal as the war in Ukraine drags on.

Many of Mr Beattie's social media posts also concern China, repeatedly calling on the US to surrender Taiwan to Beijing, and labelling Britain a “poor and pathetic kingdom” that would be “far better off under Chinese dominion”.

State Department sources expressed scepticism over whether he had undergone security vetting, a process which has been relaxed under Mr Trump.

Mr Beattie was a member of the first Trump administration, but after being sacked in 2018 for allegedly attending a white nationalist conference, he reinvented himself as an “alt-Right” media figure.

In May 2021, public records show, he married a Russian woman called Yulia Kirillova in a ceremony in Broward County, Florida.

Ms Kirillova, who according to her Facebook page was educated in Moscow before studying abroad in Canada and Washington DC, is the niece of Sergei Chernikov, a Russian drinks magnate who part-owns a flat with her mother, Natalia.

Mr Chernikov, whose net worth was estimated to be $150 million in 2005, reportedly received a letter of thanks from Putin for his help in the election campaign which first brought the Russian leader to power.

The same year, Mr Chernikov took his first step into politics, taking a role in the ministry of natural resources, before becoming deputy governor of the Nenets region in Siberia.

From 2008 to 2010, he was a member of Russia's civic chamber, which was founded following a proposal by Putin and is notionally meant to scrutinise the activities of the Russian government.

When the chamber was set up, critics claimed that it would be staffed by Kremlin allies and used to diminish a rival power base in the Russian State Duma.

Both before and after his marriage to Mr Chernikov's niece, Mr Beattie has repeatedly attacked what he called the “globalist American empire” while praising both Russia and China as counterweights to its “woke” ideology.

“The rise of non-woke (China) and anti-woke (Russia) geopolitical competitors to the Globalist American Empire is not a bad thing,” he wrote in October 2021.

He also said he looked forward to its “prestige and power” collapsing on the world stage and claimed that its “position in the global order [is] rapidly deteriorating”.

Mr Beattie, and Revolver, the news outlet he founded after leaving the first Trump administration, argues that the US has sought to engineer “colour revolutions” around the world – a common trope in Russia and China to dismiss pro-democracy movements as Western-backed coup attempts.

The businessman has claimed the US is running “colour revolution ops” in Ukraine, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Myanmar, and that an American “colour revolution brigade” is pushing for a “forever war in Ukraine”.

Two months before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he said: “Imagine the whining from the Globalist American Empire if Putin ‘invades' Ukraine… I love it when our national security bureaucrats fail!”

He has also praised Putin as “brave and strong”, and claimed the Russian leader had “done more to advance conservative positions in the US than any Republican”. He also declared: “Nato is a much greater threat to American liberty than Putin ever was.”

“The funny thing is just about every Western institution would improve in quality if it were directly infiltrated and controlled by Putin,” he wrote in September 2021.

Many of his posts focus on Britain, claiming it treats white people “far worse” than the Uyghur population that Chinese authorities have imprisoned in camps in Xinjiang.

He has labelled Britain a “sewage pit” and “the most utterly repulsive dystopia on earth”.

In a post more than two years after the outbreak of war in Ukraine, he criticised the UK's policy of “antagonising Russia”.

All of these social media posts were still online at the time of writing, although Mr Beattie has deleted disparaging tweets about Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, having previously claimed his now-boss attended “gay foam parties”.

According to Ms Kirillova's Facebook page, she moved to Washington on Jan 28, roughly a week before her husband began his role at the State Department.

Despite his wide-ranging brief at the heart of the US government, Mr Beattie is said to have focused a disproportionate amount of time on seeking to dismantle the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference hub, known as R/Fimi, while building cultural ties with Russia.

R/Fimi, which tracked and countered propaganda from sources including Russia, China and Iran, was a relatively small agency with a budget of just over $50 million at the time it was shut down.

The US's adversaries are estimated to spend tens of billions of dollars a year on foreign disinformation.

Mr Beattie's news outlet Revolver had spent years attacking R/Fimi, accusing it of being part of a “censorship network” designed to silence conservative voices.

Sources said Mr Beattie had doggedly pursued the agency after being appointed, taking it apart piece by piece.

Contractors were sacked and officials were ordered to stop communicating with others in the State Department or external partners without explicit permission.

Even before it was disbanded in mid-April, when Mr Beattie told staff in a brief speech that it was “severely misaligned” with the administration's priorities, its work had essentially wrapped up.

Mr Rubio confirmed in an interview distributed by the State Department the same day that Mr Beattie had played a major role in abolishing R/Fimi.

At the same time as Mr Beattie was working on dismantling the agency, he is said to have pushed to rebuild relations with Russia, insisting on instituting cultural exchange programmes in fields such as ballet and hockey.

He is also said to have taken a significant interest in classified material related to Russia, prompting widespread concern about turning over sensitive information to him.

Sources were highly sceptical if it had undergone a security vetting process, which the State Department's website notes can take anywhere from a couple of months to over a year to complete.

On his first day in office, Mr Trump unilaterally granted top-secret security clearances to personnel in the Executive Office of the President citing a backlog in processing. The office is not part of the State Department.

MIT Technology Review reported this month that Mr Beattie had launched a sweeping effort to obtain records from R/Fimi staff shortly before it closed, apparently with the intention of characterising it as an organisation dedicated to smearing conservatives.

He asked for communications with or about reporters who write about foreign disinformation, along with references to Mr Trump and his allies. One official said the move amounted to a “witch hunt”.

Mr Beattie would need confirmation by the Senate to take on the under-secretary role full-time: as an acting official, he is limited to 210 days.

Allies in the media have suggested he is unlikely to survive his time in the spotlight, and have suggested permanent posts where he could be installed without requiring backing from senators.

A senior State Department official said: “No one in America cares about a British gossip column. This is all fake news and low even for tabloid standards.

“Darren is a tremendous colleague who is committed to advancing President Trump's America First agenda.

“In a few short months, he has been able to spearhead high-level projects that have been critical in advancing a foreign policy that puts our national interests first.”

Mr Chernikov and Ms Kirillova have been approached for comment.

Mr Beattie described the allegations as “malicious defamatory trash that is beneath the standards of even the British tabloid press”.

            The far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) is leaving the Netherlands' government over its policy for asylum-seekers, its leader Geert Wilders said on Tuesday, toppling the governing coalition.
    


            “I signed up for the strictest asylum policy, not for the downfall of the Netherlands,” Wilders told reporters Tuesday morning. “And our responsibility for this cabinet therefore ends here.”
    


            Wilders' decision to withdraw support for the most right-leaning government in Dutch history has plunged the country's politics into chaos. It leaves the government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, with just 51 out of 150 seats in parliament.
    


            Prime Minister Dick Schoof called the decision “unnecessary and irresponsible.” But speaking with reporters after a Tuesday afternoon cabinet meeting, he offered few details on his conversations with Wilders.
    


            He said that without the PVV's support, it was impossible for the government to carry on, and that he would remain in office leading a caretaker government until a new coalition takes over.
    


            Opposition leaders have called for immediate elections.
    


            Polls suggest that, were elections to be held today, the PVV would lose seats but remain the largest party, just ahead of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy.
    


            But that's no guarantee that it would be able to enter a new government. Dutch politics features a constellation of parties, none of which has ever been able to command a majority of Dutch votes. Polls suggest that both center-right and center-left parties would gain from new elections.
    


            Wilders' PVV was the clear winner of a November 2023 election. But a coalition accord struck after months of haggling dictated that, while his party would join the government, he would remain on the sidelines, in parliament.
    


            Wilders has a long history of anti-Islam and anti-immigrant rhetoric, He was convicted of discrimination after insulting Moroccan immigrants at a 2014 campaign rally, and his party calls for “no Islamic schools, Qurans, and mosques.”
    


            Wilders last week held a rare, formal press conference to present the government with an ultimatum for hardening the country's asylum policy – despite the fact that the minister for asylum and migration is a member of his own party.
    


            “The PVV promised voters the strictest asylum policy ever, aiming to make it the strictest in all of Europe,” Wilders said Tuesday. “We proposed a plan to close the borders to asylum seekers, to stop them, to send them away. To stop building asylum-seeker centers, to close them.”
    


            But the coalition, he said, refused his proposals.
    


            “I could do nothing other than say that we are now withdrawing our support for this cabinet.”

Erin Patterson is accused of serving her ex-husband's family poisonous mushrooms.James Ross/The Associated Press

An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband's elderly relatives with a meal laced with poisonous mushrooms wept as she was questioned over expletive-laden messages about the victims on Tuesday, in a case that has captivated the country.

Erin Patterson, 50, is charged with the July 2023 murders of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, along with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband. 

The prosecution alleges she knowingly served the guests Beef Wellington that contained lethal death cap mushrooms at her home in Leongatha, a town of around 6,000 people some 135 km (84 miles) from Melbourne.

Patterson denies the charges, with her defence saying the deaths were a “terrible accident”. She faces a life sentence if found guilty. 

Appearing as a witness for her own defence, Erin Patterson was questioned on Tuesday by her barrister Colin Mandy about a series of expletive-laden messages sent to friends regarding the Patterson family.

The court previously heard the relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, deteriorated shortly before the alleged murders due to a disagreement over child support.

“I wish I'd never said it. I feel ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn't have to hear that I said that,” she said of the messages, that the court has previously heard in the prosecution's case.

“I was really frustrated with Simon but it wasn't Don and Gail's fault,” she told the court through tears. 

Erin Patterson is the first witness for the defence after the prosecution rested its case on Monday, following a month of evidence from witnesses, including relatives and medical, forensic and mushroom experts.

The accused began her testimony on Monday afternoon. It is unknown how long she will give evidence for or whether she will be cross-examined by the prosecution. 

The trial, which began on April 29, has seen intense interest from Australian and international media, with podcasters, journalists and documentary-makers descending on the town of Morwell, around two hours east of Melbourne, where the trial is being held.

State broadcaster ABC's daily podcast about proceedings is currently the most popular in the country, with two others also high in the charts. 

The trial continues.

            Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with the country's prime minister announcing his resignation following weeks of protests sparked by his family's lavish displays of wealth.
    


            Young Mongolians had taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, who lost a vote of confidence in his government on Monday, before stepping down, according to international news agencies.
    


            Democratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country's democracy.
    


            Here's what to know:
    


            The protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister's 23-year-old son's lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car.
    


            Suspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family.
    


            “With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy).
    


            Amina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people.
    


            Deepening the anger is the rising cost of living, soaring inflation in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine, and choking pollution in the capital that's home to half the population.
    


            “The cost of living in Mongolia has skyrocketed — many people are paying nearly half of their monthly income in taxes while barely making enough to cover food, rent, or utilities. Most are not living paycheck to paycheck anymore — they're living loan to loan, debt to debt,” she said.
    


            Protesters have gathered in the capital Ulaanbaatar's central Sükhbaatar Square, in front of the Government Palace, almost daily for two weeks, calling for Oyun-Erdene to release his finances and resign.
    


            The Prime Minister's office called the allegations of financial impropriety “completely unfounded.”
    


            “The prime minister makes regular financial declarations annually in line with Mongolian law,” the office said in a statement to CNN.
    


            For decades, Mongolia has struggled with endemic graft and protests often break out over allegations that corrupt officials and business leaders were enriching themselves with public funds.
    


            Mass protests erupted in 2022 over a corruption scandal involving the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars' worth of coal destined for China.
    


            Though analysts say there is no evidence of corruption by Oyun-Erdene, his son's social media posts deepened the frustration of a public long wary of their elected officials misusing public resources.
    


            “I want a fair society where ordinary people have a voice, and where government officials are held accountable. Seeing so much inequality, injustice, and arrogance from those in power pushed me to speak up,” said Ariunzaya Khajidmaa, 23, a resident of Ulaanbaatar who joined the protests with her 2-month-old baby.
    


            Part of public frustration is that even when corruption cases are prosecuted, they are slow to work their way through the judicial system, leading some to question the independence of the judiciary.
    


            The 2024 Freedom House index said “corruption and political influence in the daily work of judges remain concerns.”
    


            “If you look at the corruption index, it has gone down. And one explanation is that, even though the Prime Minister has exposed a lot of the corruption cases, nothing has been done. So now everybody's looking at the judiciary,” said Bolor Lkhaajav, a Mongolian political analyst and commentator.
    


            The Prime Minister had tried to save his coalition government and parliament, called the State Great Khural, held a vote of confidence on Monday.
    


            Oyun-Erdene failed to secure enough votes and a parliamentary statement later announced in a statement that he had resigned, Reuters and the Associated Press reported. Chinese state media also reported the Prime Minister had resigned.
    


            Oyun-Erdene and his son have submitted themselves to Mongolia's anti-corruption agency and the prime minister said he would resign if the investigation uncovered any irregularities.
    


            CNN has reached out to the prime minister's office for comment.
    


            The protests are just “the tip of the iceberg,” said Jargalsaikhan Dambadarjaa, a Mongolian broadcaster and political commentator, who pointed to some of the major economic shifts in the country.
    


            Oyun-Erdene, who was re-elected to a second term in 2024, had promised to diversify the country's economy, which is dependent on the mining industry accounting for about a quarter of GDP.
    


            Mongolia has huge deposits of coal, copper, gold and phosphorite, and about 90% of Mongolia's coal exports go to China.
    


            Oyun-Erdene's coalition government last year announced 14 new mega projects to boost economic growth, including cross-border railway connections and a major expansion of renewable energy.
    


            And one of Oyun-Erdene's signature policy centerpieces was establishing a national wealth fund, which the government said aimed to redistribute the country's assets to the people.
    


            The Sovereign Wealth Fund law, approved by parliament in April, allows the government to take a 34% stake in mines considered to have strategic mineral deposits, meaning they are vital for the country's economy and development.
    


            There are currently 16 such sites and the profits will go into the fund, with portions allocated to benefitting Mongolian people including through financial assistance, healthcare, education, and housing, according to public broadcaster Montsame.
    


            The move has not sat well with the country's wealthy and powerful mining elite.
    


            “These people, they are now at the edge of losing their power - huge money - which created huge inequality in the country. So they are fighting to the death against this government,” said Jargalsaikhan.
    


            Mongolia has been a parliamentary democracy since its democratic revolution in 1991. But the years since have seen multiple governments toppled, or leaders shuffled.
    


            This instability has led some Mongolians to believe the powers of President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, who is head of state, should be extended. Currently, the president can only serve one six-year term.
    


            “In this mosaic, those who are supporting presidential power argue that, look at Russia and China, they are one-man presidential powers and they are very stable. They say, we tried this parliamentarian system and it looks like it doesn't work. That's their idea,” Jargalsaikhan said.
    


            Khurelsukh has repeatedly said he does not want to change Mongolia's parliamentary democracy. However, some believe amending the constitution to extend presidential term limits is on the table.
    


            “It's a very crucial time, a very delicate time, and it's another test to our democracy,” said Jargalsaikhan. “Freedom comes only with the parliamentary system… If we don't do that, we will be another failed economy, a failed nation.”
    


            In a statement, the prime minister's office said, “there has been a deliberate attempt to undermine” the reforms of the coalition government by a “hostile campaign” that would “turn Mongolia away from a parliamentary democracy and return power and wealth to a small group driven by self-interest.”
    


            Analysts say Mongolia needs to show it can have stable governance so it can attract broader foreign investment and reduce its economic dependence on China and Russia.
    


            Khurelsukh last year welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for an official visit to Mongolia, a trip condemened by Ukraine. The visit was Putin's first to a member country of the International Criminal Court which had issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges on war crimes.
    


            “A lot of the governments that are looking at Mongolia as an oasis of democracy between Russia and China, so they want to trust us, but at the same time, you have to show some accountability and stability for other governments to say, okay, Mongolia is getting better,” said Bolor.
    


            Those on the streets say they are tired of political games and want to see tangible improvements to their daily lives.
    


            “We want stronger anti-corruption measures, public officials who are held to ethical standards, and a system that ensures no one is above the law,” said Ariunzaya.
    


            “It's time for the government to listen to its citizens and take meaningful, lasting action—not just offer words.”

The looming expiration of the New START Treaty, the only remaining bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, has focused national security experts on what comes next. Given the impending deadline, some strategists argue that the United States should engage Russia in a new nuclear agreement and that the way to do so is to open negotiations while continuing to abide by the limits set by New START even after the treaty expires, in early 2026. The first part of this argument has some merit; the second does not. To meet the current moment, the United States must move past New START.

At the time it was signed in 2010, New START had some advantages. The treaty set constraints on deployed strategic nuclear warheads, limiting each side to 1,550 warheads. It also had domestic political utility: in exchange for Republican support for the treaty, Democrats agreed to support modernizing aging strategic nuclear forces. But New START was written for a geopolitical landscape that no longer exists. Back then, although Russian President Vladimir Putin had begun to show his growing discontent with the prevailing world order, he had not yet revealed his determination to rebuild, to the maximum extent possible, the Soviet empire. Moreover, Russia's Cold War–era strategic and regional nuclear forces were aging, and its own full-scale modernization effort had not yet taken shape. Perhaps most important, many observers at the time considered China to be relatively benign and largely content to keep its military within its own borders. Although there were hints that it was seeking future capabilities, China's nuclear forces were based on older systems and seemed limited to maintaining “a minimum means of reprisal.”

Fifteen years later, the world has changed dramatically. Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have emerged as aggressive and expansionist leaders. Russia has, according to Putin, modernized 95 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is pursuing several novel intercontinental systems that were designed to get around New START constraints. Most worrying, Putin has fielded a regional nuclear force of some 2,000 short- and medium-range lower-yield weapons that can be launched from the ground, air and ships. This regional force obliterates the 1991 and 1992 Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, by which both Moscow and Washington agreed to eliminate all army tactical nuclear weapons and dramatically slash holdings of navy and air force tactical nuclear weapons.

China, meanwhile, is undertaking what Admiral Charles “Chas” Richard, the former commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, described as a “strategic breakout.” The “explosive growth” of China's nuclear arsenal, he said, “can only be described as breathtaking.” Beijing, too, is now busy fielding a highly modernized regional nuclear force and is en route to becoming a full-blown nuclear peer to the United States. It is also collaborating with Russia in new ways that threaten U.S. security. As the 2023 congressionally mandated, bipartisan Strategic Posture Commisson unanimously noted: “The new partnership between Russian and Chinese leaders poses qualitatively new threats of potential opportunistic aggression and/or future cooperative two-theater aggression.”

In a world with two potential nuclear-armed enemies, New START no longer provides for U.S. and allied security. By constraining U.S. strategic forces, it undermines the United States' ability to deter Russia and China simultaneously. New START also fails on a regional level by not addressing the shorter-range nuclear weapons that Russia or China would likely use first in wartime. In other words, New START is the wrong treaty for the current time. In the near term, the only way for the United States to meet this new world order is to let the treaty expire and begin increasing its own capabilities.

For the past century, arms control agreements have been used to constrain threats posed by potential aggressor nations. But for the most part, these agreements have worked only when none of the signatories harbored aggressive intent. Where there was such intent, arms control treaties have been covertly or overtly violated or channeled arms competition into areas that were not limited. The naval treaties of the 1920s and 1930s offer a case in point: they limited capital ships but excluded submarines, allowing a robust competition in the latter. And by the 1930s, some of the parties, particularly Nazi Germany, merely pretended to abide by treaty limits. In more recent decades, the Soviet Union and now Russia have been repeat offenders. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union violated the Biological Weapons Convention shortly after its signing, and then went on to violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the 1980s.

Since coming to power in Russia, Putin has violated nine separate arms control agreements and now appears ready to skirt two more: the State Department's most recent arms control compliance report notes that Putin is following his Soviet predecessors in contravening the Biological Weapons Convention by maintaining “an offensive biological warfare program,” and after intelligence reports indicated Russia may be planning to put a nuclear weapon into Earth's orbit, Russia vetoed a UN resolution reaffirming the Outer Space Treaty. Moreover, by deliberately taking reckless actions such as cutting in front of U.S. naval and air forces, Putin's military routinely ignores the 1972 Incidents at Sea Agreement and the Reagan-era Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities Agreement, which both sought to regulate militaries' conduct in order to avoid accidents that could lead to inadvertent escalation or miscalculation. Given these willful and continuing violations, the prospect of negotiating a meaningful arms control deal with Putin under the best of circumstances is far-fetched. Add to the calculus that Moscow's forces have stepped up attacks on Ukrainian cities even as Putin gives rhetorical support to peace talks, and it beggars belief that Russia would engage in good-faith arms control negotiations over the next year.

In the near term, nuclear discussions between Washington and Beijing seem similarly improbable. China, for its part, regards any willingness to engage in arms control as a sign of weakness, and it views the transparency and verification process that would presumably undergird such an accord as intrusive and akin to espionage. When the first Trump administration proposed such talks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry described the proposal as “neither serious nor sincere.” Beijing is also unlikely to contemplate any arms control agreement until it has reached parity with Russia and the United States, which is, according to the Defense Department's China Military Power Report, a decade away.

In the absence of changes in the leadership in Moscow and Beijing, the United States is not likely to see a new nuclear arms control treaty anytime soon. This is disappointing, of course, but arms control is not—and can never be—a substitute for strong deterrence policies and posture. History clearly shows that building strategic nuclear forces creates painful defense dilemmas for adversaries and is the surest formula both for protecting the United States and its allies and for ultimately getting adversaries to the negotiating table. Unilateral restraint has never succeeded in doing that, nor has continuing to abide by outdated agreements that cannot ensure future security. 

To begin meeting the demands of a two-nuclear-peer environment, the United States should prepare now for force posture adjustments once the New START limits disappear. The simplest place to start is by reversing those changes the United States agreed to in order to comply with New START. On the U.S. fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, for instance, close to 100 launch tubes for Trident II missiles have been deactivated since 2011. Roughly 30 B-52 bombers have also been stripped of their nuclear capabilities to meet the treaty's limits. Reversing these moves would quickly boost U.S. deterrence power. The United States should also upload its existing Trident II submarine-launched missiles and its land-based Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles by increasing the number of warheads carried on each missile.

In the medium term, the U.S. Strategic Modernization Program—which was first outlined by the Obama administration and which will modernize all three legs of the nuclear triad—should be expanded to more accurately respond to the current nuclear landscape. The overall increase in deployed warheads, however, need only be modest for the United States to maintain credible deterrence against both Moscow and Beijing. The United States should, for instance, increase the number of new Columbia-class strategic nuclear submarines from “a minimum of 12” to a minimum of 15, and the number of new B-21 bombers from 100 to at least 150. There is no need for the United States to match Russia and China weapon for weapon, but it does need the flexibility to maintain a strategic force that can hold one adversary at bay even after absorbing a first strike and retaliating against the other adversary.

Once New START expires, the United States also needs to let go of the Cold War assumptions that underpin it. With the sole exception of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, every U.S.-Soviet/Russian nuclear arms agreement from SALT I in 1972 to New START has focused on intercontinental-range systems. Regional nuclear forces—both short- and medium-range—were excluded from consideration. Since the 1970s, successive U.S. administrations believed this was an acceptable risk, assuming that any use of nuclear weapons that would occur between Moscow and Washington would rapidly escalate to the use of intercontinental weapons. But that is no longer a tenable assumption. Strategists now generally agree that the first use of a nuclear weapon will occur as the result of an escalating regional conventional conflict. Putin has made such escalatory threats against Ukraine and NATO, and Russia's approximately 2,000 regional nuclear weapons are not subject to New START's 1,550-weapon ceiling. In addition to improving U.S. and allied regional deterrent options (an approach also recommended by the Strategic Posture Commission), any new arms control effort must cover the regional nuclear threats in Europe and the Asia-Pacific.

In the future, any new nuclear treaty should set an overall limit for all deployed nuclear weapons, regional and intercontinental, held by the treaty parties. Under that ceiling, each party could be free to alter the mix of intercontinental and regional weapons at any point, as long as it notified the other party. Such flexibility would bolster currently undersized U.S. military forces as well as the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence guarantees. Of course, traditional arms control advocates will likely object to such an approach since the total number of nuclear weapons allowed will go up—suggesting progress has been lost—but that argument is disingenuous. As it is written, New START simply pretends Russia's regional weapons don't exist. If a new treaty were to freeze the overall force size at Russia's current roughly 3,550 level, the increase in number might look bad, but it would reflect reality. Better bad optics than pretending the weapons don't exist.

Verifying the number of regional nuclear weapons deployed by each side (indeed, even identifying which regional nuclear weapons are deemed “deployed”) will be challenging, especially given their small size and frequent association with launchers that can be used for either conventional or smaller nuclear weapons. But this problem can be overcome once both sides recognize they have an interest in establishing limits. And if the parties can't get to that modicum of goodwill, it will be fruitless to pursue a treaty in the first place.

Until then, the United States should take all necessary steps to maximize the deterrent potential of its current arsenal. If it instead tries to hold on to New START constraints in the unrealistic hope that doing so will coax Moscow back to the table, it will find itself mired in Cold War nostrums about strategic stability that were derived from a bipolar world. All the while, it will struggle to keep pace with the novel challenge of dealing with two nuclear peers that, increasingly, are working together against U.S. interests.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on June 2 slammed Russia for only providing its memorandum of a peace proposal at talks earlier in the day, saying that "the Russians are once again stalling for time."

"(I)f this is just another attempt to buy time, then there should be one response: tougher international sanctions," Umerov said in a post to Facebook.

"Our documents were submitted in advance. In contrast, the Russian 'memorandum' appeared only today — during the meeting itself. This created conditions that prevented the meeting from delivering the results needed to end the war," he added.

Ukraine and Russia held another round of peace talks on June 2, after their first meeting in Istanbul on May 16. Both rounds of talks were largely inconclusive, with Russia reiterating its rejection of a ceasefire.

Umerov attended the peace negotiations in Istanbul on June 2, leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which included several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors. Umerov also led Ukraine's 12-member delegation on May 16.

"We conveyed the positions formulated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One of the key points — an unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days. This has been our principle and the position of our partners for many months," Umerov said.

Russia only proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies.

"Russia rejects even the very idea of stopping the killings. That's why we appeal to the world: pressure is needed for real peace, not for an imitation of negotiations," Umerov said.

At the first round of peace talks, both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, which took place from May 23-25. 

On June 2, Ukraine and Russia agreed to work on another prisoner exchange with up to 1,200 captives from each side.

Zelensky, later on June 2, criticized Russia's proposal for a 2–3-day local ceasefire to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, speaking during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Zelensky earlier on June 2 called on U.S. President Donald Trump to deliver a "strong new package" of sanctions against Russia if peace talks in Istanbul remain unsuccessful.

"If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised," Zelensky said.

Trump on May 30 said that he was "very surprised" at Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities amid peace efforts.

The U.S. leader has repeatedly threatened additional sanctions against Russia, but has thus far refused to implement the measure.

Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is committed to ending the war. If not, he warned, the White House would "respond a little bit differently."

LUXEMBOURG, June 3. /TASS/. An armed conflict between EU countries and Russia cannot be ruled out due to Brussels' irrational policy, Fernand Kartheiser, a European Parliament member who represents Luxembourg, said in an interview with TASS following a visit to Moscow.

"Given, among other things, Europe's irrational policy and the aggressive atmosphere in which it is being pursued, the risk of an armed confrontation with Russia cannot be ruled out, unfortunately," he pointed out. According to Kartheiser, the situation "is growing increasingly dangerous" because of "large-scale propaganda and the suppression of freedom of speech" in Europe.

The politician highlighted the need "to at least try to prevent an arms race and do everything possible to counter the arguments of warmongers."

Kartheiser emphasized that the main goal of his visit was to demonstrate that Russia' "is a partner, not an enemy."

Kartheiser, who heads Luxembourg's right-wing Alternative Democratic Reform Party, was elected to the European Parliament in 2024. He has consistently called for normalizing relations between the European Union and Russia.

Kartheiser visited Moscow on May 25-28 at the invitation of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament). He held meetings with Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Grigory Karasin, chairman of the Federation Committee (upper house of parliament) on Foreign Affairs and Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

11:39 JST, June 3, 2025

Yomiuri Giants lifetime honorary manager Shigeo Nagashima, one of Japan's most beloved sports figures whose achievements as a player and manager earned him the moniker of “Mr. Pro Baseball,” died on Tuesday. He was 89.

Nagashima passed away due to pneumonia at 6:39 a.m. in a Tokyo hospital.

Nagashima visited Tokyo Dome for an exhibition game between the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 15, and took a photo with Shohei Ohtani. The following day, he developed a fever and was diagnosed with pneumonia.

His condition worsened and his blood pressure dropped in late May, but he held on, which impressed his doctor and others. At one point his blood pressure stabilized, and he appeared to be stable. However, he passed away on Tuesday morning — the birthday of his daughter Mina, who had been caring for him.

“I will never forget my birthday of watching my father continue to hang on,” she said.

Born in Usui (now Sakura), Chiba Prefecture, Nagashima entered Rikkyo University after graduating from the former Sakura No. 1 High School. At Rikkyo, he broke the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League record for career home runs with eight.

In his first season with the Yomiuri Giants in 1958, he led the Central League in both home runs and RBIs and was named the Rookie of the Year.

His clutch performances — most notably a walk-off home run in the first pro baseball game ever attended by the then Emperor and Empress in 1959 — sparked a national frenzy.

Together with teammate and fellow legend Sadaharu Oh, the pair nicknamed “O-N” played a key role in the Giants winning an unprecedented nine consecutive Japan Series titles from 1965.

He became known for his passionate performances, dazzling baseball fans with his dynamic fielding at third base and his powerful —  sometimes exaggerated —  swings that often delivered clutch hits.

He ended his 17-year playing career in 1974, saying at a memorable retirement ceremony at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo: “My Giants are forever immortal.” His uniform number, 3, is now retired by the Giants.

Upon retirement, he became the Giants' manager, leading the team to the Central League pennant twice over six seasons.

He began a second stint as manager in 1993 that lasted nine seasons. In that span, the team captured the Central League pennant three times and won the Japan Series in 1994 and 2000.

Nagashima retired in 2001 and was later afforded the title of lifetime honorary manager. In 2003, he took on the role of manager of Japan's national baseball team, and led it in the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. However, he suffered a cerebral infarction in March 2004 and was unable to lead the team in Athens. Afterward, he worked hard on his rehabilitation and at times appeared in public to show his fans how he had progressed.

In 2013, he received the People's Honor Award from the government with baseball great Hideki Matsui, his protege who he mentored during his time with the Giants.

Nagashima was hospitalized and received treatment for gallstones in summer 2018. In 2021, he was one of the torchbearers along with Matsui and Oh for the Tokyo Olympic Games, and became the first person from the baseball world to receive the Order of Culture.

The United Kingdom on June 2 launched its Strategic Defense Review, a plan to dramatically boost defense spending in light of the increased threat Russia poses to European security, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, adding that it is "the largest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War."

"Every part of society, every citizen of this country, has a role to play because we have to recognize that things have changed in the world of today... The front line, if you like, is here," Starmer said.

"We face war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, growing Russian aggression in our waters, menacing our skies," he added.

The media reported on June 1 that a defense review would recommend increasing the U.K.'s military spending and introducing new equipment, including jets capable of launching tactical nuclear weapons.

The British military has a substantial nuclear arsenal, but can only launch such weapons from its submarines after decommissioning a number of platforms at the end of the Cold War.

Starmer announced a wide range of new defense spending commitments amid the increased threat Russia poses to Euro-Atlantic security.

Twelve new nuclear submarines are set to be built within the framework of the Aukus partnership with the U.K, U.S., and Australia.

The U.K. plans to boost weapons production and increase stockpiles, including plans to produce 7,000 long-range weapons and six new munitions factories. 

Weapons spending is set to increase by 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) to a total of 6 billion pounds ($8.1 billion). Another 15 billion pounds ($20 billion) will be invested in the U.K's nuclear warhead program.

"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War," Starmer said.

NATO officials have increasingly warned that Russia could attack the alliance's eastern flank in the coming years amid Russia's war against Ukraine.

Finland expects an increased Russian military buildup on its border once the war against Ukraine is over, Major General Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defense forces, told the Guardian in an interview published on May 21.

Russia has increasingly threatened Ukraine's allies as it continues to wage its war.

Members of NATO's eastern flank, including Finland and Poland, have raised concerns that Russia could intensify military buildup on their borders if Ukraine and Moscow reach a ceasefire.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Turkey on May 16 and June 2. The negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Russia reiterating maximalist demands. The talks mainly yielded agreements toward prisoner exchanges.

WASHINGTON, June 3. /TASS/. The Washington administration will not allow Tehran to enrich uranium under a potential deal on Iran's nuclear program, US President Donald Trump said.

"The Autopen (former US President Joe Biden - TASS) should have stopped Iran a long time ago from 'enriching.' Under our potential agreement - we will not allow any enrichment of uranium!" he wrote on the Truth Social platform.

Earlier, the Axios news website reported that the nuclear deal proposal the United States had given Iran on May 30 would allow limited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to-be-determined period of time, contradicting public statements from top officials.

EXCLUSIVE – FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News Digital that the case involving two Chinese nationals who were charged Tuesday with allegedly smuggling a "dangerous biological pathogen" into the U.S. to study at the University of Michigan laboratory demonstrates a serious national security threat to America's food supply. 

"This case is a sobering reminder that the Chinese Communist Party continues to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate our institutions and target our food supply, an act that could cripple our economy and endanger American lives," Patel told Fox in a statement. "Smuggling a known agroterrorism agent into the U.S. is not just a violation of law, it's a direct threat to national security. I commend the FBI Detroit Division and our partners at CBP for stopping this biological threat before it could do real damage."

University of Michigan research fellow Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu – both citizens of the People's Republic of China – have been charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy, smuggling goods into the United States, false statements, and visa fraud, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan announced Tuesday. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 

The couple are accused of smuggling a fungus called Fusarium graminearum, which scientific literature classifies as a "potential agroterrorism weapon," according to the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors note the noxious fungus causes "head blight," a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, and "is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year."

The Justice Department also says fusarium graminearum's toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and "reproductive defects in humans and livestock." 

According to the criminal complaint, Jian, 33, allegedly received Chinese government funding for her work on the pathogen in China. 

Federal prosecutors say Jian's electronics contain information "describing her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party." 

Liu, 34, allegedly works at a Chinese university where he conducts research on the same pathogen, according to the complaint. Federal prosecutors say "he first lied" but then admitted to smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the United States through the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. His alleged goal was to conduct research on the pathogen at the laboratory at the University of Michigan where his girlfriend, Jian, worked, according to court documents.

The FBI arrested Jian in connection with the allegations, and she was scheduled to make her first federal court appearance in Detroit on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Justice Department. It's unclear whether Liu has been taken into custody.

"The alleged actions of these Chinese nationals – including a loyal member of the Chinese Communist Party  – are of the gravest national security concerns," U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon said in a statement. "These two aliens have been charged with smuggling a fungus that has been described as a ‘potential agroterrorism weapon' into in the heartland of America, where they apparently intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme."

STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WILL 'AGGRESSIVELY' REVOKE VISAS FOR CHINESE STUDENTS

CBP Director of Field Operations Marty Raybon said the criminal charges levied against Jian and Liu "are indicative of CBP's critical role in protecting the American people from biological threats that could devastate our agricultural economy and cause harm to humans; especially when it involves a researcher from a major university attempting to clandestinely bring potentially harmful biological materials into the United States."

"This was a complex investigation involving CBP offices from across the country, alongside our federal partners," Raybon said. "I'm grateful for their tireless efforts, ensuring our borders remain secure from all types of threats while safeguarding America's national security interests."

Jian is still listed as a post-doctoral research fellow on the University of Michigan website as of Tuesday afternoon. Fox News Digital reached out to the University of Michigan for comment on Tuesday but did not immediately hear back.

The Justice Department noted that a trial cannot be held on felony charges in a complaint, and a determination will be made about whether to seek a felony indictment when the investigation is completed.

The charges were announced at a time when the Trump administration is cracking down on what they categorize as anti-American radicals at U.S. universities, particularly foreign students engaged in antisemitic or anti-Israel protests on campus. 

Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio also announced he would be "aggressively" revoking the student visas for Chinese nationals, "including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields."

A man accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza appeared in court in Boulder, Colorado on Monday. Mohamed Sabry Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in an attack that the FBI immediately described as an act of terror. Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack.

Witnesses recounted the dramatic scenes after eight people, calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd.

The FBI says the suspect in an attack in Boulder, Colorado that injured six yelled “Free Palestine” and used a makeshift flamethrower.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — The man charged for injuring a dozen people in Boulder, Colorado in an attack on a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza went disguised as a gardener and told police his initial plan was to kill them all.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, faces hate crime charges in federal court and attempted murder and other charges in state court.

Soliman — whose first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents — had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday's attack in which he yelled “Free Palestine,” police said. He didn't carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” police wrote in an affidavit.

The two incendiary devices he did throw into the group of about 20 people were enough to injure more than half of them, and authorities said he expressed no regrets about the attack.



Soliman was being held Tuesday on a $10 million, cash-only bond, according to prosecutors. He's due back in a Boulder County courtroom Thursday. More charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

Public defender Kathryn Herold is representing Soliman. She declined to comment after Monday's hearing where he officially was charged.

Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

He was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

Immigration agents on Tuesday were taking Soliman's wife and five children into custody, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a post on X. Federal officials also are investigating whether any of his family members knew about his plan, Noem wrote in the post.



Soliman told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” according to an FBI affidavit. Zionism is a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Sunday's attack at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder had been planned for more than a year and specifically targeted what Soliman described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime.

That charge carries a sentence of life in prison when it includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

The attack came on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and as the Israel-Hamas war continues to inflame global tensions. The war has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the United States. The Boulder attack was barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

“This attack was not random. It was a deliberate hate crime against the Jewish community that was planned for months,” Sen. John Hickenlooper said Tuesday on Senate floor in the U.S. Capitol referring to Boulder attack.

“The scope of that hatred is unconscionable,” continued Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat. “These were men and women who dedicated their time to advocating for innocent hostages, who have been now held in captivity for over 600 days.”



The 12 people hurt in the attack are demonstrators with Run for Their Lives. The events have been staged globally since 2023 and call for Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Organizers say the walk in Boulder was the first in which they have faced violence.

The weekly demonstration Sunday was wrapping up when the crowd was attacked with a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails, authorities said.

Police liaisons assigned to the victims said none were ready to speak Monday with reporters. They range in age from 52 to 88, and their injuries spanned from serious to minor.

Three people remained hospitalized Tuesday at the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus, spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. Christensen declined to provide information on their conditions and said they are currently declining media interviews and have requested privacy.

U.S. supporters of the Israeli hostages say they're scared but have vowed to keep demonstrating.

            The US trade war with China has a major sticking point: rare earths minerals.
    


            Last month, President Donald Trump said the United States needed Greenland “very badly,” renewing his threat to annex the Danish territory. Greenland is a resource-rich island with a plentiful supply of critical minerals, a category that also includes rare earths elements, under its ice sheet. Trump also signed a “rare earth deal” with Ukraine.
    


            The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration. China for years has built up near-total control of the materials as part of its wider industrial policy.
    


            Here's what you need to know about rare earths.
    


            Rare earths are 17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.
    


            The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth's crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process, and also environmentally damaging.
    


            Rare earths are ubiquitous in the technologies we rely on every day, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They're also crucial for batteries in electric vehicles as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.
    


            Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They're used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research note from CSIS.
    


            The International Energy Agency said 61% of mined rare earth production comes from China, and the country controls 92% of the global output in the processing stage.
    


            There's two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn't have the capabilities for the tough task of separating rare earths after extraction.
    


            “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.
    


            However, the Trump administration's announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America's reliance on China for rare earths separation, she said.
    


            The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.
    


            On Friday, Trump said on Truth Social that China violated a trade truce put in place last month. Beijing has kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products, which were seen as a response to Trump's “reciprocal tariffs” on Chinese goods announced in April. After agreeing on the truce in Geneva, US officials had expected China to ease export restrictions on those minerals.
    


            The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a US Geological Survey report.
    


            On Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “the administration is actively monitoring China's compliance with the Geneva trade agreement” and that US officials “continue to be engaged in correspondence with their Chinese counterparts.”
    


            Beyond China, rare earths are also featured in US foreign policy objectives with Ukraine, Greenland and Saudi Arabia.
    


            “Ukraine is a very, very nascent mining industry, and even though it was a part of the conversation, we don't actually have a mapping of what's economically viable,” Baskaran said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joins 'America Reports' to discuss the hate crime charges against the Colorado terror suspect as new details are released and the Republican holdouts on President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.'

The family of the Boulder, Colorado firebombing suspect is in federal custody, sources confirm to Fox News.

According to senior sources within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the wife and five children of 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman were taken into custody. 

"Mohamed's despicable actions will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, but we're also investigating to what extent his family knew about this horrific attack," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X video post on Tuesday afternoon. "If they had any knowledge of it or if they provided any support to it."

The family is being processed for expedited removal, sources said.

Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa after entering the U.S. during the Biden administration, three DHS and ICE sources told Fox News.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. 

He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 

On March 29, 2023, Soliman was granted work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

Victims and witnesses observed Soliman throw what appeared to be a glass bottle, which burst upon impact, creating large flames, towards a crowd of peaceful pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder on Sunday, June 1, authorities said.

Twelve individuals were injured in the attack. None of the victims have died.

Now facing a litany of charges – including multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, and possession of incendiary devices – Soliman is being held on a $10 million bond.

Judicial District Attorney Michael Dougherty outlined the severe potential penalties facing Soliman if convicted on all charges related to the June 1 attack. He faces 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder – eight for attempted murder with intent and deliberation, and eight for attempted murder with extreme indifference.

If convicted and the sentences are ordered to run consecutively, he could face a maximum of 384 years in state prison for those charges alone. In addition, Soliman is charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device, which could add up to 48 years if served consecutively.

He also faces 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device, carrying a potential additional 192 years. In total, the maximum possible sentence could reach 624 years if all convictions are handed down and run consecutively.

Along with charges on the state level, he has also been federally charged with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin. 

His next court appearance, for filing charges, will be Thursday, June 5 at 3:30 p.m. MT.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Wisconsin man is facing charges accusing him of forging a letter threatening President Donald Trump's life in an effort to get another man who could testify against him in a criminal case deported.

Prosecutors said in a criminal complaint filed Monday that Demetric D. Scott was behind a letter sent to state and federal officials with the return address and name of Ramón Morales Reyes.

Scott was charged Monday with felony witness intimidation, identity theft and two counts of bail jumping. A court commissioner set a $30,000 cash bail for him during his initial court appearance Tuesday and scheduled a preliminary hearing for June 10. 

Scott's attorney, listed in online court records as public defender Alexander Kostal, declined comment when reached by phone Tuesday, referring questions to the state public defender's headquarters in Madison. The office's legislative liaison, Steve Knudson, declined comment when reached by phone. 

Immigration agents arrested Morales Reyes, 54, on May 21 after he dropped his child off at school in Milwaukee. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the arrest, saying he had written a letter threatening to kill Trump and would “self-deport” to Mexico. The announcement, which also was posted by the White House on its social media accounts, contained an image of the letter as well as a photo of Morales Reyes.

But the claim started to unravel as investigators talked to Morales Reyes, who doesn't speak English fluently, and obtained a handwriting sample from him that was different from the handwriting in the letters, according to court documents.




Morales Reyes is listed as a victim in the case involving Scott, who is awaiting trial in Milwaukee County Jail on armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. The trial is scheduled for July.

According to a criminal complaint and an information, another form of a charging document, Scott knocked a man identified by the initials R.M. off his bicycle in Milwaukee in September 2023, cut him with a box cutter and then rode off on R.M.'s bike.

R.M. was taken to a hospital and treated for what the documents called “a small laceration” that did not require stitches. Police arrested Scott a few hours after the alleged robbery. According to the documents, he told investigators that he saw a man riding his bicycle, he wanted it back and he may have struck the man with a corkscrew. 

Scott's attorney in the robbery case, Robert Hampton III, didn't return an email seeking comment.

Law enforcement officers listened to several calls Scott made from the jail in which he talked about letters that needed to be mailed and a plan to get someone picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement so Scott's trial could get dismissed, according to the criminal complaint. He also admitted to police that he wrote the letters, documents said.

Morales Reyes works as a dishwasher in Milwaukee, where he lives with his wife and three children. He had recently applied for a U visa, which is for people in the country illegally who become victims of serious crimes, said attorney Kime Abduli, who filed that application.

Abduli told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Monday that she was glad Morales Reyes was being cleared of any involvement in the letter writing.

His deportation defense lawyer, Cain Oulahan, confirmed Tuesday that Morales Reyes is from Mexico. Oulahan wrote in an email Monday night that the main focus now is to secure Morales Reyes' release from custody and the next step will be to pursue any relief he may qualify for in immigration court. 

“While he has a U visa pending, those are unfortunately backlogged for years, so we will be looking at other options to keep him here with his family, which includes his three US citizen children,” Oulahan wrote.

Alexis Nungaray and Kelvin Alvarenga, mother and grandfather of Jocelyn Nungaray, and Harris County, Texas D.A. Kim Ogg discuss learning about Jocelyn's murder at the hands of illegal migrants and seeking the death penalty for the suspects.

One of two suspects charged in Jocelyn Nungaray's murder is now accused of raping an American woman in Costa Rica, according to former Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg.

Two Venezuelan illegal immigrants who may have ties to the Tren de Aragua gang — Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, 26, and Johan Jose Rangel Martinez, 21 — are charged in the 12-year-old's June 2024 murder. They allegedly sexually assaulted and strangled the pre-teen to death, leaving her body tied up in a bayou in Houston.

Ogg told FOX 26 Houston last week that she learned over the course of her investigation as DA, before her successor Sean Teare took office last year, that Pena Ramos had been involved in a prior sexual assault in Costa Rica involving an American woman who was apparently on vacation at the time.

"It happened in Costa Rica. It happened to an American citizen who came forward with that information after their pictures were shown on national television," Ogg told the outlet. "When she reported it to the authorities in Costa Rica, they did nothing. Imagine the frustration of that individual. I don't want that to be swept under the carpet."

The victim is not from Texas but felt compelled to come forward when Nungaray's murder made national headlines and she saw the suspects' photos on the news.

"The courage of any crime victim to come forward like that is remarkable to me and that played a major role in determining whether the death penalty is appropriate," Ogg told FOX 26.

Ogg, who was seeking the death penalty for both suspects while in office, added that "authorities had no idea of their past behavior," such as charges in other countries, which "makes it hard to determine if someone is going to be a future danger."

The former district attorney said she came forward with the information to FOX 26 now because she is "very concerned about the decisions" that Teare "has been making," referencing multiple cases that have been dismissed recently.

"I think it's important for the public to get the final say," Ogg added. "Do they deserve death for the rape and murder of Jocelyn? Or should they spend their life in the penitentiary? What I don't want is some backdoor deal done in the quiet of the night and a long time after people have forgotten the horror of this case. I just want people to remember Jocelyn, and I want them to hear and make a decision about the evidence."

Alexis Nungaray, Jocelyn's mother, has since become an advocate for victims of crimes allegedly committed by illegal immigrants. In a May interview, Alexis Nungaray described the 12-year-old as "a very creative, talented, free-spirited 12-year-old girl." 

Nungaray said Jocelyn "was very quirky" and "an old soul." She liked dressing in 1990s-style cargo jeans and Converse and loved listening to music from as far back as the 1940s and 1950s.

"She was very different and unique. She was an amazing friend," Nungaray said.

Nungaray also said she is grateful to President Donald Trump for both his support and for "keeping his promises" regarding immigration enforcement.

DA TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ACCUSED IN NUNGARAY MURDER CASE

"I support immigration, but I say there's just a right way and a wrong way to do it," she explained. "He's protecting the people, and he's taking consideration to the people, us the citizens and making sure we're safe and our kids are safe, women are safe, that we're all safe in our communities."

"We've still got a long way to go," she went on. "But I will always advocate for her and be her voice and stand up for better border control and immigration laws. Because I know 1 million percent, Jocelyn's death should have been preventable."

Pena Ramos illegally crossed into El Paso, Texas, in May 2024, sources with the Department of Homeland Security previously confirmed to Fox News. He was caught by Border Patrol agents and was released into the U.S. with a Notice to Appear in court. 

Rangel Martinez also crossed illegally into El Paso in March and was caught by Border Patrol. He was released into the U.S. on an unknown basis. 

Jocelyn had been at a convenience store and was talking to her 13-year-old boyfriend on the phone after sneaking out of her family's apartment. The boyfriend told investigators that he could hear Nungaray talking with two people.

Senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane breaks down Ukraine's largest attack on Russia since the beginning of the war. 

After Ukraine launched a sudden drone assault on Russian installations, it brought new attention to the U.S.' own vulnerabilities, regardless of which side the U.S. stood on Kyiv's attack.

In recent years, Chinese Communist Party-linked entities have commercially targeted land around the U.S., including in the vicinity of sensitive installations like the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota.

The Fufeng Group's 300-acre farmland purchase in 2021 first raised the collective antennae of Congress to such under-the-radar transactions – and even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis swiftly banned them in his state as a result, among other efforts around the country.

On Tuesday, North Dakota's senators agreed that the U.S. must remain vigilant for any malign activity, whether it be from relatively novel drone assaults to potential espionage through real estate transactions.

UKRAINE'S SURPRISE ATTACK SHOWS IT MAY TAKE A ‘MAJOR DRONE STRIKE' TO CHANGE US DEFENSE POLICY, EXPERTS SAY

"When adversaries can buy our land, attend our universities, photograph silos in our prairies, perform aerial surveillance, park their ships near our military bases, or even just join our PTAs, they have more opportunities to be nefarious," Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer told Fox News Digital.

"Our posture must always be vigilant, never assuming foreign actors are benign or have the best intentions," he said. "Whether it's directly spying, indirectly influencing, or sending drones to blow up aircraft, the ability of the enemy increases when we allow them easy access near our national interests." 

Cramer's Flickertail State counterpart, Sen. John Hoeven, joined an effort to prevent such land-buys and has worked with federal partners to update the process in which foreign investment is analyzed for approval and decided upon.

"We need to remain vigilant against China and other adversaries," said Hoeven, who is co-sponsoring South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds' bill banning individuals and entities controlled by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from purchasing farmland or commercial land near sensitive federal sites.

CHINA'S US INFLUENCE COULD FACE CRACKDOWN UNDER SLATE OF NEW BILLS

"At the same time, we're working to update the CFIUS process [which governs federal approval of foreign investments] to ensure proper reviews are taking place as well," Hoeven said.

"We also are working to develop the technology we need to protect our domestic military bases from potential drone threats."

Rounds' bill also has bipartisan support, including from Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., whose state also hosts sensitive government sites like Nellis Air Force Base and Area 51.

"It is common sense that we should not allow our foreign adversaries to buy agricultural land next to these locations," Masto said in a statement.

Rounds added in a statement that America's "near-peer adversaries… are looking for any possible opportunity to surveil our nation's capabilities and resources."

Even private-sector entities have expressed concern, including the South Dakota Soybean Association, which said farmland must be protected from foreign purchase for both agricultural and national security purposes.

Interim Top Federal Prosecutor for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba addresses reports that New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has allegedly ordered police to stop cooperating with ICE on ‘Hannity.'

Newark Mayor and Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Ras Baraka filed a lawsuit Tuesday against interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, accusing her of false arrest and malicious prosecution in connection with his May 9 arrest and charges outside a federal immigration center.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey, accuses Habba of acting politically in Baraka's May 9 arrest outside the Delaney Hall detention center, near Newark Liberty International Airport. Baraka was arrested during a protest outside the facility, after being accused of trespassing and ignoring warnings from law enforcement officials to leave. He was held in custody for several hours before being released. 

The U.S. attorney's office said last month it would drop the charges against Baraka "for the sake of moving forward." 

The civil lawsuit filed by Baraka seeks damages for what his lawyers described as his "false arrest and malicious prosecution," as well as the allegedly defamatory remarks Habba made about his case, including on social media. The lawsuit includes screenshots of Habba's social media posts in question.

Baraka, an outspoken opponent of Trump's immigration policies, was briefly charged with criminal trespassing last month outside Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility near Newark, New Jersey. He was one of several public officials, including Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman, from the New Jersey congressional delegation, all of whom had massed outside the facility in protest.

Habba claimed he "ignored multiple warnings" from officials to remove himself from the privately owned ICE detention center – a contention Baraka disputed.

"After they finally told us to leave, and I told them I was leaving, they came outside the gate and arrested me," he previously said in an interview on MSNBC. "So it looked like it was targeted."

In the lawsuit, Baraka's lawyers accused Habba of acting as "a political operative, outside of any function intimately related to the judicial process, and in her individual personal capacity."

It also accuses her of green-lighting the arrest despite "clear evidence that Mayor Baraka had not committed the petty offense of ‘defiant trespass.'" Also named as a defendant in the case is Ricky Patel, a DHS Investigations agent in charge in Newark.

The news comes as Baraka, a prominent progressive figure, continues his gubernatorial campaign ahead of the June 10 Democratic primary, in a bid to replace outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy, who is approaching the end of his two-term limit.

Rich Lowry and Richard Fowler join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss the president being caught off guard by the tariff acronym being used by some on Wall Street.

FIRST ON FOX— The Democratic National Committee on Tuesday parked a new, decked-out food truck in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. 

The truck itself, rented out by the party, was custom-wrapped in photos of the president himself, and those inside were doling out a free, mouth-watering lunch option to passers-by. But those in Washington know there's no such thing as a free meal. And that's certainly the case here, because the food truck in question is a taco truck— a clever, policy-themed provocation hitting on tariffs, which the DNC sees as one of Trump's most vulnerable areas heading into 2026.

The DNC's renting and customization of the taco truck, as well as its plans to hand out free Trump-branded tacos to passers-by, was previewed exclusively to Fox News Digital. It looks to seize on the acronym TACO, or "Trump Always Chickens Out," to provoke Trump's ire. The phrase was coined by Wall Street analysts when referring to Trump's tariff policies – and more specifically, espousing the view among some that Trump will walk back the steep reciprocal tariffs he announced in April, which are currently playing out in federal courts. 

Beyond simply presenting a moral quagmire to hungry RNC employees and other Hill staffers, DNC officials told Fox News that they see the truck as an effective way to draw attention to Trump's tariff policies, which they described as "playing games with working families' livelihoods."

The DNC wrapped a rented taco truck in the following image. DNC officials told Fox News that they plan to park the truck outside the RNC on Tuesday to hand out free tacos to draw attention to President Donald Trump's tariffs and economic policy. (Democratic National Committee.)

"Trump always chickens out – we're just bringing the tacos to match," DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital of the effort. 

"Instead of realizing his tariff chaos is wrecking the economy, Trump continues to drag America towards more economic pain, and the rest of the world sees Trump for exactly what he is: a chicken," he added.

The food truck comes as Trump's power to enact sweeping tariffs has come under legal scrutiny. There is also an open question of whether the administration would actually move forward with the harsh import fees.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously acknowledged that the threat of tariffs could be used as more of a negotiating tactic or an opening salvo for future trade talks, including between the U.S. and China, and described Trump's uncertainty in the process to reporters last week as a means of "strategic uncertainty in the negotiations."

As of this writing, three separate federal courts are weighing Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to stand up the harsh import fees. The plan, which Trump announced on April 2, invokes IEEPA for both his 10% baseline tariff on most U.S. trading partners and a so-called "reciprocal tariff" against other countries.

The administration has appealed two lower court decisions that blocked his use of the law to either enact or threaten to enact the harsh tariffs. Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed a lower court order from the U.S. Court of International Trade, allowing Trump's tariff policy to continue for now while the court continues to investigate the merits of the case. Two other lower court challenges remain in flux. 

In the meantime, however, the moniker TACO has gotten under the president's skin. Last week, Trump blasted a reporter who asked him about the phrase, describing it as a "nasty question." 

"Don't ever say what you said," Trump told the reporter. "To me, that's the nastiest question," he said.  "I chicken out, oh, I have never heard that," Trump said, noting that lowering the tariffs was part of an ongoing "negotiation" with China.

He continued, "You mean because I reduced China from 145% that I set down to 100 and then down to another number? I said, ‘You have to open your whole country.'"

Democrats are using the truck to seize on what they see as a clear sore spot for the president, and a way of tying Trump more directly to any market uncertainty and turmoil that has come as a result of the tariffs.

It comes as the party has struggled to coalesce around a unifying message in the aftermath of the 2024 elections. 

The party has been criticized for failing to seize on Elon Musk's departure from his official role in the Trump administration at the end of May, and for focusing its energy on attacking intraparty strategies and DNC board members, rather than going after the RNC more broadly.

The Republican National Committee, for its part, brushed off the truck in question – as well as the notion that it impacted voters or RNC staff in the manner intended. The truck itself was parked outside St. Peters Church, one block away from the building itself.

"LMFAO. A taco truck?" Zach Parkinson, the RNC communications director, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

"Are they going to be giving out free vasectomies again too? These people are morons," he said, adding: "No wonder Democrats' approval rating is at a historic low."

The taco truck stunt signals a shift in strategy, as Democrats adopt a more Trump-style approach to political attacks ahead of the 2026 midterms, but some of their efforts have missed the mark.

Earlier this week, conservative commentators took aim at a TikTok posted by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), in which he is filmed eating a taco in an attempt to mock Trump's tariff strategy, with some declaring it "cringeworthy."

DNC officials did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions on whether the party plans to pursue the tariff strategy beyond the taco truck, or if it sees these issues as a way to counter Trump and his allies with red state voters in the midterms and beyond.

Fox News host Mark Levin gives his take on the America First Committee and Iran's nuclear enrichment on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.'

President Donald Trump on Monday evening looked to reaffirm his administration's position when it comes to nuclear negotiations with Iran and said Tehran will not be allowed "any enrichment of uranium."

His message, which surfaced on multiple social media platforms, appeared to be a direct response to a report by Axios which cited two sources with "direct knowledge" of a secret proposal that Washington provided to Tehran, allegedly said the U.S. would agree to permit "limited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to-be-determined period of time."

WHITE HOUSE URGES IRAN TO ACCEPT NUCLEAR DEAL AS IAEA REPORTS URANIUM ENRICHMENT SPIKE

Fox News Digital could not independently verify the details of the proposal, but if the decision to grant Tehran some uranium enrichment were granted, it would directly contradict public comments issued by lead negotiator Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump.

Iran has repeatedly said it will not agree to a uranium enrichment ban, arguing it has the right to the process, which is also vital for nuclear energy. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Monday reiterated this point in a press conference from Egypt, and, according to the Tasnim News Agency, said he plans to respond to the U.S. proposal soon.

Araqchi did not comment on the specifics of the agreement but said his "response will be based on the principles of the Iranian nation." 

The proposal also reportedly included the notion that Iran could join a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as a solution to its enrichment needs. However, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei on Monday reportedly argued that this was not a new solution, nor an adequate substitute.

US AND IRAN CLASH OVER URANIUM ENRICHMENT AS NUCLEAR TALKS RESUME IN ROME

"If some parties are proposing such a process, we welcome it and have no problem with participation either. But we emphasize that such an initiative cannot replace enrichment inside Iran," the spokesperson said. 

The White House has not said how long it will attempt to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program, as security officials have repeatedly warned that Iran could be playing for time as the threat of U.N. snapback sanctions is set to expire come October. 

Iran on Tuesday reiterated that it is not going to abandon negotiations but suggested it would not cave to Washington's demands either.

"Iran won't leave the negotiating table while protecting its national interests," a spokesperson for the Iranian government, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said, according to the Tasnim News Agency.

Though she added, "All scenarios are on the table. We are prepared for everything."

The White House has not said how long it will attempt to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program, as security officials have repeatedly warned that Iran could be playing for time as the threat of U.N. snapback sanctions is set to expire come October. 

Iran on Tuesday reiterated that it is not going to abandon negotiations but suggested it would not cave to Washington's demands either.

"Iran won't leave the negotiating table while protecting its national interests," a spokesperson for the Iranian government, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said, according to the Tasnim News Agency.

Though she added, "All scenarios are on the table. We are prepared for everything."

The speculative guesswork distracts from the all-too-ordinary issues at the center of his case.

Over the past year and a half, I've kept finding myself in unexpected conversations about Diddy. Cab drivers, deli cooks, and far-flung uncles have all wanted to chat about the 55-year-old rapper who's now on trial for charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transportation to engage in prostitution. There is, certainly, plenty to talk about: Federal prosecutors allege that the media mogul liked to throw baby-oil-slicked orgies—called “freak-offs”—where abuse and exploitation regularly occurred. (He pleaded not guilty; his lawyers say he never coerced anyone into anything.) But the conversations tend to be less about Sean “Diddy” Combs than about playing a guessing game: Who else was involved?

Some of the people I've spoken with had theories about Justin Bieber, citing rumors suggesting that the singer—a teenage protégé of Diddy's—had been preyed upon (“Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims,” Bieber's representative said in a statement last month). Others speculated that the Democratic Party, whose candidates Combs has campaigned for over the years, was in some way implicated in the case. Most of them agreed that Diddy was comparable to Jeffrey Epstein in that he was probably at the hub of a celebrity sex-crime ring.

Since the trial began a few weeks ago, it's become clear what these conversations were: distractions from the bleak, all-too-ordinary issues that this case is really about.

The wild nature of the conspiracist narratives surrounding Combs can't be understated. In January, social-media users wondered if the fires that swept through glitzy L.A. neighborhoods were meant to destroy evidence pointing to the participation of other celebrities. On Amazon last year, sales spiked for a salacious memoir purportedly written by the rapper's late girlfriend, Kimberly Porter, and published by a self-described investigative journalist using the pseudonym Jamal T. Millwood—the latter being the supposed alias that Tupac used after he, according to legend, faked his death. (Amazon pulled the book from its offerings after Porter's family lambasted it as a forgery.) One viral fake news story, based on no evidence at all, said that Will Smith had sold one of his children into Combs's servitude. On Truth Social last fall, Donald Trump himself shared a meme featuring a fabricated image of Kamala Harris and Diddy, with text reading, “Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?”

The media also stoked the fervor. A former bodyguard of Combs's gave an interview for a TMZ documentary saying that politicians, princes, and preachers were mixed up in the rapper's debauchery. The conservative influencer Charlie Kirk devoted a portion of one webcast to wondering, “Maybe P. Diddy has footage of Barack Obama doing something he shouldn't have been doing?” Piers Morgan hosted a singer, Jaguar Wright, who insinuated that Jay-Z and Beyoncé had committed crimes much like the ones Diddy is charged with. After those stars issued a vigorous denial and threatened to sue, Morgan apologized and edited any mention of them out of the interview online—and then, in February, retired General Michael Flynn presented Wright with a “Defender of Freedom Award” at Mar-a-Lago.

A few actual facts underlay all of this QAnon-esque speculation. For more than a decade, Combs's legendary White Parties attracted a medley of stars to the Hamptons, Los Angeles, and Saint-Tropez. Attendees often joked publicly about how rowdy the festivities could get. Over the past year or so, dozens of people—an array of musicians, workers, models, and others who have crossed paths with him since the 1990s—have sued Combs for a variety of offenses (all of which he denies), and some of those suits have alluded to alleged misdeeds by other celebrities. (One lawsuit naming Jay-Z was dropped after the star denied the claim; he has since countersued for defamation.)

Still, the speed and sheer giddiness with which conspiracist thinking eclipsed the known details of Combs's case confirmed a few bleak realities about the psyche of a country in which economic inequality and sexual abuse are both stubbornly endemic. A whole class of politicians, commentators, and media platforms exist to exploit the resentments that everyday people hold toward the rich and famous. Meanwhile, rates of sexual harassment and assault—reportedly experienced by 82 percent of women and 42 percent of men in the United States in their lifetime—remain as high as they were when the #MeToo movement erupted in 2017. Examining the real reasons for this is less fun—and, for many, less profitable—than imagining that Hollywood is a front for ritualistic sadism.

The trial itself, which began in Manhattan on May 12, has not yet revealed a network of super-famous evildoers. Although the testimony has surfaced vivid and bizarre details about the rarefied lives of celebrities, it's also told an intimate, human, oddly familiar story about how power can warp relationships in all sorts of ways. I realized that in the random conversations I'd had leading up to the trial, I'd heard a lot about the imagined villains, and very little about the people they were said to have hurt.

Combs's downfall in the public eye began in November 2023, when an ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, filed a lawsuit alleging that he had raped and physically abused her. The suit was settled one day later out of court, but many of its details are resurfacing now. Although the federal trial against Combs is expected to last at least eight weeks and feature dozens of witnesses, Diddy and Ventura's relationship has been central to the testimony. Prosecutors say Combs ran an organized criminal enterprise that served, in part, to assist in and cover up this one woman's subjugation.

Ventura, now 38, was a 19-year-old aspiring R&B singer when she met Combs around 2005. He'd heard her first-ever single, “Me & U”; it would become a hit, but Diddy promised that he could guide her to a career of lasting success. He signed her to a 10-album deal with his label, Bad Boy Records, and released her debut album in 2006. It is still her only album to ever come out.

Their relationship soon evolved from professional to romantic. The singer said she'd initially rejected the rapper's advances but that she'd felt pressured to do what he wanted because her career was largely in his hands. He also reportedly provided her with gifts, threatened her with punishment, and supplied her with drugs until she felt he controlled her life. She said that he then used that control liberally, dictating what she wore, whom she socialized with, which medications she took.

He also beat her. Hotel security-camera footage from 2016 published by CNN last year—and used as evidence in the trial—showed Combs chasing Ventura down a hallway, throwing her to the ground, kicking her, and pulling her by her sweatshirt. The video is a small and terrible glimpse into their relationship. Diddy is in a towel and clearly furious; Ventura, starkly alone, makes no effort to defend herself. “My behavior on that video is inexcusable,” Combs said in a filmed mea culpa last year; during the trial, his lawyers have acknowledged that he was violent toward her.

Other witnesses in the trial have testified that the hotel assault was not an isolated incident. One former assistant, Capricorn Clark, reported seeing Combs repeatedly kick Ventura after learning that she'd been romantically involved with the rapper Kid Cudi. Another former assistant, George Kaplan, described a 2015 altercation between Combs and Ventura on Diddy's private jet. He heard the sound of breaking glass in a private area, where he then saw Combs standing and holding a whiskey glass over Ventura, who was on her back. According to Kaplan, Ventura screamed, “Isn't anybody seeing this?” No one on the plane intervened, Kaplan said.

The now-notorious freak-offs allegedly occurred against this backdrop of violence and intimidation. Ventura's lawsuit said that toward the beginning of Combs and Ventura's relationship, Combs hired a man to have sex with Ventura while Diddy watched. Encounters like that, involving sex workers and drugs, became regular occurrences that could last for days at a time. The freak-offs were, prosecutors say, “performances” for Combs's pleasure. And they affected the performers; Ventura testified to having medical problems, mental-health issues, and drug addiction as a result of them.

Combs's defense argues that Ventura willingly participated in these events. His lawyers have cited text messages in which she appears to express enthusiasm: “I'm always ready to freak off,” she wrote to him in August 2009. Other texts suggest a more complicated picture—in 2017, Ventura wrote, “I love our FOs when we both want it.” She and prosecutors assert that whenever she tried to resist Combs's commands, he would bring her to heel with physical violence and threats of blackmail and financial harm. Ventura's lawsuit alleged that when she tried to break up with him for good in 2018, he raped her in her home (an accusation that Diddy's defense has concertedly pushed back on during the trial).

Ventura is not the only alleged victim of Combs's. His employees have shared particularly disturbing stories: Clark said that Combs kidnapped her twice; a former assistant identified as Mia testified last week that the rapper repeatedly sexually assaulted her. (Diddy's lawyers dispute that the kidnappings ever happened and have questioned Mia's credibility.) Prosecutors are pursuing racketeering charges on the theory that Combs didn't act alone: For example, they say he may have had someone set Kid Cudi's car on fire (the defense denies Combs's involvement in that arson). In this way, Diddy's case is also a story about what happens when it's easier to take the check and not ask too many questions.

But fundamentally, the trial is another highly public test of the definition of consent. It recalls the prosecutions of Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer who allegedly dangled job prospects to women interested in the film industry in exchange for sex (one of his convictions was overturned last year and is being retried now). It also evokes R. Kelly, the musician who wooed aspiring singers with promises of career help and then violently kept them—and other women—in sexual servitude (behavior for which he is currently serving 31 years in prison).

And the issues here transcend celebrity. When #MeToo erupted eight years ago, it forced many everyday Americans to reexamine experiences they'd had in their workplaces and homes. The movement has, by many indications, petered out or even curdled into backlash: Yesterday, one of Diddy's lawyers asked Mia whether she was looking for a “Me Too money grab,” which suggests he thinks the very words Me Too might be tinged for some jury members. But to sit with the allegations against Combs—and the experiences of the alleged victims—is to again be confronted with the underlying reasons that movement happened. It's to be confronted with the intolerable things that happen when men are given the power to pursue their desires however they want, and to extract whatever they want from their underlings.

A lot of people would evidently prefer to turn away from that confrontation—and to focus on fantasy. Since I started paying attention to the case, my YouTube algorithm has become polluted by videos with AI-generated courtroom sketches of stars such as Will Smith and Jay-Z, paired with totally imaginary testimony about their involvement in Combs's crimes. The videos are yet another sign that our society is losing any shared sense of reality. They do, however, have disclaimers stipulating that they are fiction, which raises the question: Why is this the story someone wants to hear?

Perhaps because tales of demonic Hollywood cabals offer a simple, clear-cut narrative that doesn't ask us to reflect on how domestic violence and sexual coercion really get perpetuated—and perhaps because that narrative benefits certain agendas. Last month, I tuned in to Asmongold, a popular Twitch streamer who interprets the daily news for a large audience of young, often aggrieved men. He had a glazed look in his eyes as TV news footage related to the trial played on his screen. Then he said, “I don't care about this case at all—until Diddy starts naming names.”

Retired NYPD Inspector Paul Mauro discusses the recent anti-Israel incidents in the U.S. and the attack in Boulder, Colorado as the country grapples with antisemitic violence. 

The suspect accused of bombing a gathering of pro-Israel demonstrators said he turned to improvised explosive devices after being denied the purchase of a firearm due to his immigration status.

According to an affidavit filed by the Boulder Police Department, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman told detectives that he had taken a concealed carry class in preparation to buy a firearm but was ultimately blocked from completing the purchase because he is not a U.S. citizen. 

"He said that he had previously tried to purchase a firearm, but resorted to the Molotov cocktails when he could not purchase a gun because he was not a legal citizen," acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said in a news conference on Monday afternoon. 

With access to guns restricted, the Egyptian national revealed to authorities that he turned to YouTube to learn how to construct homemade firebombs.

Soliman allegedly created 18 Molotov cocktails before driving to Boulder on Sunday, June 1 and prepared for the peaceful pro-Israel demonstrators to arrive for the "Run For Their Lives," in support of the Israeli hostages. Soliman is accused of throwing two incendiary devices at the crowd. 

Judicial District Attorney Michael Dougherty said they have identified four additional victims – bringing the total to 12. None of the victims have died.

"We're going to continue to encourage victims and witnesses to come forward and contact law enforcement," Dougherty said in the Monday news conference. "But we now have 12 victims. And later this week, we'll be filing formal charges against him."

Authorities said all but two victims have been released from area hospitals. They did not note the severity of the injuries from the attack.

Victims and witnesses observed Soliman throw what appeared to be a glass bottle, which burst upon impact, creating large flames, the affidavit said. He also allegedly used a commercial weed sprayer as a "makeshift blowtorch."

According to the affidavit, authorities discovered multiple glass bottles containing liquid, a lighter, rags, an insecticide sprayer, and an AR-style rifle BB gun in Soliman's 2015 silver Toyota Prius.

Along with the materials, authorities also found a Quran and paperwork with the words, "Israel," "Palestine" and "USAID."

In his interview with law enforcement, Soliman said he bore no remorse for his actions and reiterated his intent to carry them out again if given the opportunity. 

The affidavit noted that Soliman left behind an iPhone and a journal at his Colorado Springs home, detailing his motivations and preparations for the attack.

Now facing a litany of charges – including multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, and possession of incendiary devices – Soliman is being held on a $10 million bond.

Dougherty outlined the severe potential penalties facing Soliman if convicted on all charges related to the June 1 attack. He faces 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder – eight for attempted murder with intent and deliberation, and eight for attempted murder with extreme indifference.

If convicted and the sentences are ordered to run consecutively, he could face a maximum of 384 years in state prison for those charges alone. In addition, Soliman is charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device, which could add up to 48 years if served consecutively.

He also faces 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device, carrying a potential additional 192 years. In total, the maximum possible sentence could reach 624 years if all convictions are handed down and run consecutively.

Along with charges on the state level, he has also been federally charged with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin. 

"No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind. But our laws recognize that such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, their religion, or their national origin," Grewell said. "According to our complaint and the charges brought by D.A. Dougherty's office, Mr. Soliman stated that he had been planning this attack for a year, and he acted because he hated what he called the ‘Zionist group.'"

His next court appearance, for filing charges, will be Thursday, June 5 at 3:30 p.m. MT.

President Donald Trump caught allies by surprise when he announced his decision over the weekend to withdraw billionaire commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman as his nominee for the next NASA administrator.

The Senate had been scheduled to vote on Isaacman's confirmation this week, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in April. But White House officials argue that Isaacman's past support for Democrats essentially tied the president's hands.

“The Administrator of NASA will help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump's bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars,” White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in a statement. “It's essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump's America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon.”

White House officials cited reporting from the Washington Examiner in January detailing Isaacman's more than $322,000 in donations to Democrats since 2010. That period included $100,000 donations to then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) super PAC in 2021 and more than $100,000 in donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2022 to 2024. Furthermore, White House officials cited Isaacman's ownership of a Russian MiG-29 fighter jet, potentially the only one privately owned in America, and his being a registered Democrat in Pennsylvania as justifications to withdraw his nomination.

Trump didn't specifically mention Isaacman's past donations while announcing his decision Saturday night.

“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA, I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Still, multiple Republican congressional staffers, all avowed supporters of the president, and aeronautical industry insiders say that growing tension between the recently departed Elon Musk, who had lobbied for Isaacman's nomination behind the scenes, and other senior members of the president's team contributed to the personnel decision.

Trump originally announced his plans to nominate Isaacman, buoyed by Musk's support, before entering office back in December of 2024. Two Senate GOP staffers told the Washington Examiner that the decision, made before the Trump team could stand up its Office of Presidential Personnel, cut short the vetting process for Isaacman and other possible NASA candidates.

Musk stepped down from his role as a special government employee on Friday, but not after running into conflict with Trump Cabinet officials regarding the slash-and-burn cuts to the federal workforce advocated by the Department of Government Efficiency. One senior aeronautical executive told the Washington Examiner that Office of Presidential Personnel Director Sergio Gor and other senior Trump advisers saw the Isaacman nomination as a means of settling the score with Musk.

“This was just a power play — the real people who are actually in charge of the White House letting Elon know, ‘we're running things,'” that person said.

White House officials vehemently denied that Musk's departure, and any conflict he had encountered with Trump's Cabinet, had factored into the president's decision on Isaacman. 

Both Senate GOP aides and aeronautical insiders floated retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Steven Kwast as the heir apparent to Isaacman.

Kwast, a decorated pilot and former commander of the Air Force's Education and Training Command in San Antonio, has steadily supported Trump and his push to launch both the Space Force in his first term and the Golden Dome missile defense system, which Trump announced in May.

Kwast has also said that space will emerge as a critical battlefield in future conflicts with China and has raised alarm bells about Beijing's plans to further develop “global reach” aircraft.

“China's plans to mature these hypersonic technologies is hardly a surprise. China is far ahead in developing and flying hypersonic weapons,” he co-wrote in a May op-ed published by Newsmax.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, himself a longtime proponent of American space dominance, told the Washington Examiner that he had not spoken to the president about his next choice to lead NASA but gave Kwast a full endorsement to fulfill that role if called upon.

THREE ISSUES ON WHICH TRUMP HAS DONE A TOTAL 180 COMPARED TO HIS FIRST TERM

“I have worked for years with Kwast. He was the brilliant head of the Air University. He is probably the most forward looking Air Force General I've ever worked with, and he would be an extraordinary leader at NASA,” he said Monday.

Fox News correspondent Stephanie Bennett reports on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's comments on the China threat and Indo-Pacific politics on ‘Fox Report.'

President Donald Trump blasted China recently on Truth Social, saying Beijing had "TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US." Trump furiously concluded, "So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!" 

Apparently, in return for mutual deescalation of trade tensions, Beijing had committed to again allow the free flow of rare earth minerals to the U.S. However, they did not follow through on that promise. No wonder Trump was angry; he should not, however, have been surprised. 

The White House will try to resolve this issue, and will hopefully again reduce mutual tariffs. The stock market will celebrate a near-term resolution, business managers will exhale, and shoppers won't hoard Barbies for Christmas. 

TRUMP WARNS COURT RULING AGAINST TARIFFS COULD LEAD TO 'ECONOMIC RUINATION' OF US

But longer term, the Trump White House must commit to eliminating our dependence on China for essential goods, which gives Beijing a stranglehold on our economy. China is an enemy and cannot be trusted. Relying on them for rare earths or for other critical goods, like pharmaceuticals, is dangerous. 

The US and Ukraine signed a key rare earth minerals deal earlier in 2025. FILE: Drag-line excavator mines rare earth materials on Ukrainian soil on February 25, 2025, in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine. (Photo by Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)

Rare earths are "essential"; we need lanthanum and cerium, for instance, to make camera lenses and catalytic converters, respectively. Indeed, we need rare earths to produce everything from cars to missiles to cell phones. China accounts for about 60% of global mine output as well as 90% of processed materials. Our economy comes to a virtual standstill without these products. The Chinese know this and will take advantage of that reliance.  

This is one reason that Trump's proposal of a joint venture with Ukraine is brilliant. If the two countries can together begin to mine and process rare minerals, the U.S. will have a vested interest in defending Ukraine against Russian aggression (while our presence might presumably deter another assault) and the undertaking would also help alleviate our reliance on China. Ukraine is home to 22 of the 34 minerals classified as "critical" by the EU; we need them.  

PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA IS OPEN TO ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH US ON RARE EARTH MINERALS

It is not just rare earths and minerals we should be concerned about. Since the COVID-19 emergency, Americans have become increasingly aware that we also depend on China (and to a lesser degree India) for many essential pharmaceuticals, a reliance which could prove deadly should Beijing choose to block exports.  

In last year's first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001. The shortages sent parents searching high and low for amoxicillin and other prescription drugs for themselves and their kids. 

The Covid pandemic revealed the downside of not being self-sufficient in medical goods, when Beijing chose to withhold vital drugs and personal protective equipment from Americans. One of the most outrageous derelictions of Joe Biden's presidency was not addressing that dangerous vulnerability.    

At the outset of the pandemic, China controlled roughly half the global production of products like face masks and ventilators; though they expanded output 12-fold as Covid spread, they stopped exports to the U.S. The United States, for its part, was importing about 90% of the surgical face masks we used, even though we had invented virus-filtering N95 masks and disposable nitrile gloves.   

UKRAINE SIGNS DEAL TO GIVE US ACCESS TO RARE MINERALS WITH TRUMP ADMIN 'COMMITTED TO A PEACE PROCESS': BESSENT

Between January and March 2020, Chinese exports of critical medical goods to the U.S. fell sharply. China apologists argue (wrongly) that the decline stemmed from tariffs placed on such goods during the first Trump administration. Ventilators, oxygen masks and other medical products were not covered by Trump's tariffs against China; the fall-off was a purposeful decision by Beijing to restrict U.S. supplies. 

Reacting to critical shortages, with health workers having to reuse masks and wear garbage bags over their heads for protection, U.S. firms stepped up and began producing the necessary protective gear. But, as the emergency waned, China resorted to its usual practices and flooded our market with cheap products, undercutting U.S. manufacturers.

That's when the Biden administration should have stepped in to protect U.S. producers; for an administration that exhibited an almost religious zeal for wearing masks, ensuring domestic output (and availability) would seem a layup. They did not. 

In April 2025, the New York Times reported, "Few domestic industries have been as devastated by the flood of cheap Chinese imports as manufacturers of face masks, exam gloves and other disposable medical gear that protects healthcare workers from infectious pathogens." At the height of the pandemic, some 107 U.S. companies had started up to produce masks and glove; today only five remain.

It was not just PPE that became scarce. In 2020, the New York Times quoted a Chinese health specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations saying, "Chinese pharmaceutical companies have supplied more than 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone, as well as 70 percent of acetaminophen and 40 to 45 percent of heparin in recent years."  

ONE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES CAN FINALLY PUT AN END TO AMERICA'S RELIANCE ON CHINA

Congress, alarmed by revelations of U.S. dependence for PPE and pharmaceuticals, did what they do best: ordered up some studies on the issue and demanded better reporting. During Trump's last year in office, his administration tried to boost domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, but the effort died in the Biden years. 

In last year's first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001.

This is a fixable problem. If we can devote hundreds of billions of dollars to boosting domestic production of windmills and semiconductors, surely we should be taking similar steps to end our dependence on Chinese-provided drugs.

The New York Times revealed the Biden administration's multi-billion-dollar solution to drug shortages writing, "The White House earlier this month proposed…  linking Medicare payments to hospitals in part on whether hospitals do a good job buying drugs from companies that demonstrate quality over the long term, rather than just the cheapest price." 

That is not a solution. Instead, a solution would entail reducing our dependence on China for essential goods of all kinds and making domestic manufacturing profitable again through lower taxes, new technology like AI and deregulation. These are policies that dominate the Trump agenda, and they will work to make the U.S. independent again.

SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria is close to realizing its decades-old goal of joining the euro currency union and deepening ties with the more prosperous countries of Western Europe. But the government faces a populist backlash against the shared currency on the eve of a key decision by European Union authorities.

Fears of inflation, poverty and the unknown are mingling with disinformation spread on social media that aims to turn people against the euro. The discontent tracks with increased support for populist and anti-EU parties across Europe, which is exploited by nationalist and pro-Russian politicians in a country that remains one of Europe's poorest and most afflicted with corruption.

“Adopting the euro will make us feel the threshold of poverty. After all, prices will be in euros,” said 78-year-old retiree Tanya Ignatova.

“Bulgaria is not ready for the euro. Someday we may be ready, but not now,” said another retiree, Mario Georgiev.

Several thousand people rallied against the euro in the capital on Saturday, urging a referendum on whether to transition from the lev currency to the euro. The head of the pro-Russian Varazhdane party, Kostadin Kostadinov, told the crowd that “Bulgaria has risen and declared: Freedom, we choose the Bulgarian lev!”




Others in Bulgaria say the country already benefits from EU membership and it does not matter what the currency is. “We have inflation now and we will have it in the future,” said 26-year-old Konstantin Bozhinov.

Aiming at deepening European integration amid growing geopolitical tensions, the government is pressing ahead. It has asked for a review of whether it meets the requirements of low inflation, sound government finances and legal conformity to EU institutions. On Wednesday, the European Commission will announce the results.

If the commission gives a green light, other member states will decide on Bulgaria's candidacy in the coming weeks.

At the last review in 2022, Bulgaria failed on the inflation requirement. Inflation has since fallen.

President Rumen Radev has encouraged the anti-euro voices by proposing a referendum on the currency, citing public concerns over inflation and purchasing power. That followed a protest in February that saw the offices of the EU's executive commission in Sofia spattered with red paint and its entrance set on fire.

The president's proposal was turned down by the pro-European majority in parliament, which accused Radev of acting in favor of Russia with his last-minute attempt to sabotage the euro adoption.

According to the EU's multi-country Eurobarometer survey released last week, 50% of Bulgarians are against the adoption of the euro, while 43% are in favor. In contrast, trust in the euro continues to grow across the rest of the EU.

Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. It has been plagued by political instability and corruption that have fueled euroscepticism among its 6.4 million citizens. Analysts say disinformation campaigns from abroad have fed fears of economic changes that could bring more poverty.

Scores of false claims by opponents of the eurozone have been published on social networks. One claim says the EU plans to take away people's savings if they fail to spend them within a certain period. Another claims that plans to introduce a digital version of the euro are part of a plan to control everyone.

“There is a powerful brainwashing of the average Bulgarian. Illusory fears are being spread, lies are being told wholesale, unscrupulously and brazenly,” said Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in Sofia.

Economists say joining the euro will not bring massive change to Bulgaria's economy in the short run. That's because the government has pegged the currency to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.

Joining the euro can bring lower borrowing costs, greater ease in comparing domestic and foreign prices and no need to exchange money when vacationing in another euro country. More than that, it's a sign of integration into the EU and its large economy. Members get a seat on the European Central Bank's interest rate-setting committee.

Countries agree to join the euro when they join the EU, but so far 20 of 27 members have taken the step. Croatia was the last to join in 2023.

Bulgaria's government has very little debt, at 24.1% of GDP — the second lowest in the EU and well below the 60% level in euro membership criteria. That's a sharp contrast to its neighbor, Greece, which entered the euro in 1999 with high debt that was concealed through complex financial transactions. Greece's broken finances eventually triggered a eurozone-wide crisis.

Bulgaria's government has been “fiscally super conservative ... the risk of Bulgaria becoming a fiscal risk to the eurozone is essentially zero,” said Zsolt Darvas, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.

Fears of inflation are not entirely without basis. Experience in other countries shows that “whenever there is a changeover from national currency to the euro, there is often a minor inflation effect, but it's typically less than 1%,” said Darvas

Economists say a one-time increase occurs as service providers such as restaurants, which don't adjust prices as often as other sectors, take advantage of re-doing menus and price lists to implement hikes.

AKOBO, South Sudan (AP) — Wiyuach Makuach sat on her bed in a dimly lit ward of a hospital near South Sudan 's border with Ethiopia and rested her remaining arm in her lap as she recalled the airstrike that took her other arm and nearly killed her.

“Everything was on fire,” she said in an interview at the hospital in the border town of Akobo where she was being treated for her injuries. 

The bombing happened on May 3 at another hospital in the northern community of Fangak where she had traveled to be with her 25-year-old son while he sought treatment for tuberculosis. A series of strikes there, including several at the Doctors Without Borders facility, killed seven people.

“I ran outside and started rubbing mud on myself to stop the burning,” Makuach said.

Makuach, 60, is just one of the dozens of civilians who aid groups say have been killed or badly injured by airstrikes in recent weeks as South Sudan's army clashes with militia groups across the country. The army says it targets only combatants, and has not commented on civilian casualties. 

“The army displaced us and our families into the bush and that's when we decided we would fight back,” said Gatkuoth Wie, 24, who was wounded while fighting in northern Jonglei State.

The fighting has led to U.N. warnings that South Sudan is again on the brink of civil war. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to send to South Sudan a group of eight deportees from Cuba, Vietnam and elsewhere who have been convicted in the U.S. of serious crimes, sparking a legal fight that has reached the Supreme Court.




Many of those wounded in the South Sudan clashes have been transported to Akobo, where the International Committee for the Red Cross has set up a temporary surgical response. Others have been stranded for days by the fighting.

Doctor Bjarte Andersen, a surgeon working with the ICRC, says that the fighting has made it difficult to transport patients that have been critically wounded. “We know of one person who has died waiting for transportation, but there are probably more,” he said.

“The most critical cases cannot even be moved, they are not likely to survive the journey,” said Christina Bartulec, who oversees the organization's medical operation in Akobo.

The ICRC does not track which patients are combatants and which are civilians. Most of the people brought to their facility are young men, several of whom told The Associated Press that they were engaged in fighting.

In the past month, however, an increasing number of the victims have been women and a few children, according to hospital staff.

One is Kuaynin Bol, 15, who was gravely injured by a blast as he lay asleep in his home. Surgeons have removed bone fragments from his brain and performed four operations on his leg, which was badly broken.

Simmering tensions between the government and opposition groups erupted in March when a local militia called the White Army overran a military barracks in Nasir, a town in the country's northeast.

The government pinned responsibility for the attack on First Vice President Riek Machar, placing him under house arrest and detaining other members of his SPLM-IO party. It also brought in Ugandan forces to support a sweeping military offensive against opposition troops and community militias across the country.

That offensive centered on Upper Nile State and allegedly involved use of improvised incendiary weapons that Human Rights Watch has said killed at least 58 people, including children.

In May, the fighting spread to northern Jonglei State where Fangak is located, a region previously unaffected by the violence, after the government alleged several barges were hijacked by opposition forces there.

Isaac Pariel, a member of Machar's opposition party who is the local chairman in Fangak of the government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, said that at least 25 civilians have been killed this month. But the true toll is likely higher, as much of the fighting has taken place in remote areas that are inaccessible to medical workers.

One bombardment in the village of Wichmon on May 15 killed 12 people including 8 children, according to local authorities and one eyewitness. The Associated Press was unable to independently verify those figures.

The government has not officially claimed responsibility for the strikes. 

Army spokesman General Lul Ruai Koang told The Associated Press he was not authorized to comment on “ongoing military operations across the country.”

The violence has been devastating for civilians already reeling from successive humanitarian crises.

Much of the fighting has taken place in South Sudan's Greater Upper Nile region, a vast floodplain that in recent years has been ravaged by extreme weather, disease, and severe food insecurity.

“The people here are moving all the time, just during the night,” said William Nyuon, a Fangak resident. “They fear the plane will come and bomb them again.”

            Staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency were caught off-guard and left bewildered when the disaster relief agency's new acting head David Richardson told personnel that he was previously unaware the United States has a hurricane season, which started Sunday.
    


            Richardson made the comments during a briefing Monday morning, multiple sources told CNN. While some interpreted the remark as a joke, others said it raised concerns about the recently appointed acting administrator, who has no prior experience managing natural disasters.
    


            A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN the comment was made in jest, adding, “FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.”
    


            It remains unclear whether Richardson's comment – joking or not – reflects a lack of knowledge before assuming his current role. In recent weeks, he has repeatedly referenced FEMA's preparations for hurricane season in meetings and interviews.
    


            Reuters first reported Richardson's comments in the meeting.

            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appointed Richardson – a former Marine combat veteran and martial-arts instructor – in early May, firing President Donald Trump's first acting FEMA chief just hours after he broke from other Trump officials and told lawmakers he did not support eliminating FEMA.
    


            Richardson has promised to enforce Trump's agenda. In an all-hands meeting on his first day at FEMA, Richardson told agency staff he will “run right over” anyone who tries to prevent him from carrying out the president's mission, CNN previously reported.
    


            Since then, the Department of Homeland Security has installed more than a half-dozen of its officials into key roles at FEMA to effectively run the agency. Most of them, like Richardson, have little experience handling disasters.
    


            In Monday's meeting, Richardson announced that FEMA will not release an updated disaster plan for this hurricane season as previously promised, saying the agency does not want to get ahead of Trump's newly formed FEMA Review Council, sources said.
    


            Instead, FEMA will largely default back to its operating procedure from 2024, though the agency enters this hurricane season in turmoil, with a dramatically smaller workforce.
    


Roughly 10% of FEMA's total staff have left since January, including a large swath of its senior leadership, and the agency is projected to lose close to 30% of its workforce by the end of the year, shrinking FEMA from about 26,000 workers to roughly 18,000, according to a FEMA official briefed on the numbers.
    


            In a memo issued last month that was obtained by CNN, Richardson officially rescinded FEMA's 2022-2026 strategic plan, saying it “contains goals and objectives that bear no connection to FEMA accomplishing its mission.”

A man accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza appeared in court in Boulder, Colorado on Monday. Mohamed Sabry Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

Witnesses recounted the dramatic scenes after eight people, calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd.

Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in an attack that the FBI immediately described as an act of terror. Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack.

The White House said the violence seen in Boulder, Colorado Sunday is “unacceptable” after a man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Suspect in Boulder attack that injured at least 12 people faces multiple state and federal charges including commission of a hate crime.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A man posing as a gardener to get close to a group in Boulder holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza planned to kill them all with Molotov cocktails, authorities said Monday.

But he had second thoughts and only threw two out of the 18 incendiary devices he had into the group of about 20 people, yelling “Free Palestine” and accidentally burning himself, police said. Twelve people were injured in the Sunday attack. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn't spray it on anyone but himself “because he had planned on dying.”

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote in an affidavit. He didn't carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. The suspect's first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said during a press conference Monday.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

During a state court hearing Monday, Soliman appeared briefly via a video link from the Boulder County Jail wearing an orange jumpsuit. Another court hearing is set for Thursday. Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after the hearing. 

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88, and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims had what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration when video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He's right there. He's throwing Molotov cocktails.” A police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego said he was across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, police wrote. 

Osante said that after the suspect threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. 

Soliman told investigators he constructed the devices after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Soliman also told investigators he took a concealed carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he is not a legal U.S. citizen.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

In video and photos shot right after the attack by a woman at the gathering, Soliman can be seen pacing without his shirt on with what appears to be burns down one of his arms. He and a small group of people around him are screaming at each other, with some witnesses filming him. 

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers who'd play with Pruiett's kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman's home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

In the wake of the terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) called for urgent action on gun control and a national reckoning with violent hatred and extremism.

The man suspected of carrying out the firebomb attack during a peaceful pro-Israel demonstration has been charged with a federal hate crime and numerous state-level offenses, including multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a crowd, injuring 12 people in what authorities are calling an “act of terrorism.”

Investigators say Soliman told them he had “researched on YouTube how to make Molotov cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them.” State court documents further reveal that Soliman had previously taken a concealed carry class in an effort to obtain a firearm, but resorted to using incendiary weapons after he was denied a gun purchase due to his lack of legal U.S. citizenship.

The attack, which targeted demonstrators marching in solidarity with hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, was reportedly accompanied by the assailant shouting “Free Palestine.” 

Raskin, a senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, appeared on MSNBC's The Weekend: Primetime on Sunday and called the attack a symptom of deeper national crises, including an epidemic of gun violence. He used the moment to press for long-standing Democratic priorities on gun policy reform.

“The safety of the people is the paramount imperative for government,” Raskin said. “People have the right to peacefully assemble, to exercise freedom of speech and religion. We've got to take whatever precautions we need to make sure that people can do that.”

He pointed to the Boulder incident as part of a broader national trend.

“Now we're seeing it in Colorado, but we've seen it across the country,” Raskin continued. “We are still in the midst of a gun violence epidemic. So we need to be acting with due concern for human life. I mean, this is why, of course, we have been fighting for universal, violent criminal background checks. We are for a ban on military-style assault weapons in the country. You know, our lax gun laws are a danger to everybody in America.”

TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' SPURS EARLY 2026 CAMPAIGN JABS

The MSNBC segment, hosted by Antonia Hylton, Catherine Rampell, and Ayman Mohyeldin, also touched on the global implications of rising antisemitism and politically motivated violence. Mohyeldin pressed Raskin on the connection between overseas conflicts, particularly the war in Gaza, and increasing domestic tensions.

“It's profoundly troubling to see all of these violent incidents taking place against the Jewish community,” Raskin responded. “We don't want wars to spill over and engulf everybody all over the world in violence.”

STOCKHOLM (AP) — A Swedish commission recommended Monday that international adoptions be stopped after an investigation found a series of abuses and fraud dating back decades.

Sweden is the latest country to examine its international adoption policies after allegations of unethical practices, particularly in South Korea.

The commission was formed in 2021 following a report by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter detailing Sweden's problematic international adoption system. Monday's recommendations were sent to Minister of Social Services Camilla Waltersson Grönvall, who said her department would review the report.

“The assignment was to investigate whether there had been irregularities that the Swedish actors knew about, could have done and actually did,” Anna Singer, a legal expert and the head of the commission, told a news conference. “And actors include everyone who has had anything to do with international adoption activities. 

“It includes the government, the supervisory authority, organization, municipalities and courts. The conclusion is that there have been irregularities in the international adoptions to Sweden.”

The commission called on the government to formally apologize to adoptees and their families. Investigators found confirmed cases of child trafficking in every decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, including from Sri Lanka, Colombia, Poland and China.

Singer said that a public apology, beside being important for those who are personally affected, can help raise awareness about the violations because there is a tendency to downplay the existence and significance of the abuses.




An Associated Press investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), last year reported dubious child-gathering practices and fraudulent paperwork involving South Korea's foreign adoption program, which peaked in the 1970s and ‘80s amid huge Western demands for babies.

The AP and Frontline spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated child origins, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they had been sent to new parents overseas.

The findings are challenging the international adoption industry, which was built on the model created in South Korea. 

In March, South Korea's truth commission concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children's backgrounds and origins. 

The Netherlands last year announced it would no longer allow its citizens to adopt from abroad. Denmark's only international adoption agency said it was shutting down, and Switzerland apologized for failing to prevent illegal adoptions. France released a scathing assessment of its own culpability.

South Korea has sent around 200,000 children to the West for adoptions in the past six decades, with more than half of them placed in the U.S. Along with France and Denmark, Sweden has been a major European destination of South Korean children, adopting nearly 10,000 of them since the 1960s.

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — A Guatemalan court ordered Monday the arrests of Colombia's attorney general and a former Colombian defense minister who led a U.N. anti-corruption mission in Guatemala.

Guatemalan prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche, who himself has been sanctioned by the United States and other countries for allegedly interfering in corruption investigations, had requested that an appeals court issue the arrest orders for Colombia's top prosecutor Luz Adriana Camargo Garzón, who was the chief of investigations of the Guatemala mission, and Iván Velásquez, who had led the mission and later was Colombia's defense minister.

Curruchiche said Camargo and Velásquez had committed illicit association during their investigation into bribes paid to Guatemalan officials by Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.

Along with former Guatemalan prosecutors working with the U.N. mission, Velásquez and Camargo were part of “a criminal structure led by the former CICIG commissioner,” using the Spanish initials of the U.N. mission, Curruchiche alleged. 

Curruchiche had long ago focused his investigation on an agreement the anti-corruption prosecutors had signed with Odebrecht that would offer reduced penalties in exchange for the company's cooperation in the investigation. His boss, Prosecutor General Consuelo Porras, has also been sanctioned by the U.S. and other governments for blocking corruption investigations. Last week, a U.N. expert warned her office was using criminal law to pursue enemies.

Velásquez responded via X after learning of the accusations.




“So now the corrupt Guatemalan attorney general and her prosecutor Curruchiche – designated as corrupt and sanctioned by the United States and the European Union – extend their persecution for Luz Adriana Camargo and me,” Velásquez wrote. “My solidarity with the former officials and so many Guatemalan citizens who the Attorney General's Office has forced into exile.”

Camargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Among those former Guatemalan prosecutors forced into exile was Juan Francisco Sandoval, who led the special prosecutor's office against impunity.

Sandoval, who led the Odebrecht investigation with support from the U.N. mission and has been living in exile in the United States, said last month in a statement that Curruchiche's investigation was “a sham and a manipulation strategy.”

The U.N. mission operated in Guatemala from 2007 to 2019, when then-President Jimmy Morales decided to not renew its mandate, after it linked members of his family to a case.

It had worked with Guatemalan prosecutors to take down criminal structures in the country, sending judges, prosecutors, other public officials, including former presidents to trial for corruption.

President Donald Trump boasted of the United States's stockpile of weapons while warning that Iran would not be allowed to enrich uranium, a major sticking point in negotiations.

Iranian nuclear negotiations appear to be losing momentum, with a senior Iranian official on the negotiating team telling Reuters that Tehran is poised to reject the latest U.S. offer. Trump vented his frustrations in a post on Truth Social, blaming former President Joe Biden's administration for the conundrum and contradicting reports that the U.S. would allow limited uranium enrichment.

“The AUTOPEN should have stopped Iran a long time ago from ‘enriching.' Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” he wrote.

He followed that post six minutes later with another about the U.S.'s military power:

“Just had a great talk with our Military Leaders. It is the strongest Military we have ever had, including the fact that we are stockpiling weapons at a rate never seen before by our Country. Hopefully, however, we will never have to use them!”

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly gave a new proposal to Tehran on Saturday, outlining “preliminary ideas” to be discussed at the sixth round of nuclear talks in the coming days, according to Axios. It allegedly contained details that contradict the public statements of Trump administration officials. Contrary to Trump and his administration's insistence, the deal allegedly allows limited low-level uranium enrichment within Iran.

Iran would halt new research and development of new centrifuges and “dismantle critical infrastructure for conversion and processing of uranium.”

US SUBMITS NUCLEAR DEAL PROPOSAL AFTER IRAN INCREASES URANIUM ENRICHMENT

“President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb. Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the Administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios in a statement.

Trump has balanced negotiations with saber-rattling, threatening Iran with military action if a deal couldn't be reached. Despite this, he has clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his push for military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Israel has readied a strike force to hit Iranian targets swiftly if talks fall through.

Donald Trump Jr. is distancing himself from his father's meme coin — while defending the family's broader foray into crypto as a response to being frozen out of the traditional banking system.

"I wasn't involved in the meme coin," Trump Jr. said in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "I'm more focused on the stablecoin, the bitcoin mining."

Meme coins are a class of cryptocurrency fueled by social media buzz and celebrity hype rather than real-world utility. They often skyrocket in value before crashing just as quickly — a pattern that's drawn concern from regulators, particularly when high-profile figures are involved.

President Donald Trump's $TRUMP token, 80% of which is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliated entities, has become the centerpiece of the family's expanding crypto empire. Trump Jr. noted that the token was launched before his father returned to office.

The coin went live three days before the Inauguration, eventually soaring to a $15 billion market cap before erasing most of those gains. Still, the project creators get a fee for every trade.

Between January and the end of April, more than $324 million in trading fees were routed to wallets tied to the project's creators, according to Chainalysis. The token's code automatically directs a cut of each transaction to these addresses, allowing the team to profit from ongoing activity. 

The blockchain analytics firm said it stopped tracking the president's meme token in early May, citing a need to refocus resources on paying clients.

The Trump family's deepening involvement in crypto has drawn widespread criticism — including concerns that a sitting president with ties to tokens could create new avenues for influence peddling or foreign capital flows.

Trump Jr. didn't dispute the potential for abuse but framed blockchain anonymity as a mitigating factor.

"You don't know who's actually doing any of these things," he said. "It's hard to influence if you don't actually know where this stuff's coming from."

In January, Tron blockchain founder Justin Sun upped his stake in World Liberty Financial's WLFI tokens to $75 million. A court filing the following month showed that Sun and the Securities and Exchange Commission were exploring a resolution to the regulator's civil fraud case against the crypto entrepreneur.

Sun later purchased the president's meme token, winning a contest for top holders, and raising his stake in Trump family-tied tokens to at least $97 million.

Trump Jr. emphasized that the family's broader embrace of crypto was not a vanity move, but a response to being debanked after his father's political rise.

He said he and his brother saw crypto as a more equitable system — one that could protect even well-established players like themselves from arbitrary exclusion.

"I could call any single banker in New York City," he said. "They'd pick up the phone, I'd be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden they wouldn't take your call. You couldn't get financing. We were debanked."

That shift, he said, pushed the Trumps to explore decentralized alternatives "out of necessity."

That philosophy, he added, now underpins the family's stablecoin initiative USD1, launched through World Liberty Finance. The token claims to be fully backed by U.S. Treasurys and aims to serve as a compliant dollar-pegged asset.

Trump Jr. argued that stablecoins like USD1 could support U.S. financial dominance, not threaten it:

"They're literally some of the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasurys in the world, replacing a lot of the countries that would have been traditionally doing that," he said, referencing crypto firms like Tether, which controls nearly 70% of the global stablecoin market. 

At nearly $120 billion in U.S. government debt on its books, according to its latest self-attestation, Tether now ranks among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasurys — ahead of countries like Germany and the UAE.

"Stablecoins could be the savior of U.S. currency," he said.

Magic Eden, best known as a non-fungible token marketplace, says it has partnered with the team behind President Donald Trump's meme token to launch an official $TRUMP-branded cryptocurrency wallet.

Dubbed the $TRUMP Wallet, the product will feature the president's name and likeness, as well as support trading of $TRUMP and other digital assets including bitcoin.

A waitlist for the wallet opened Tuesday at TrumpWallet.com, ahead of a broader launch slated for later this summer, according to a Magic Eden spokesperson.

Eric Trump, who has taken on leadership roles across several of his father's crypto ventures, claimed to have no knowledge of the project.

"I run @Trump and I know nothing about this project! @worldlibertyfi $Trump @AmericanBTC," he posted on social media site X.

CNBC reached out to Magic Eden for clarification on Eric Trump's denial.

CNBC reached out to the $TRUMP token team to ask about the terms of the partnership, potential revenue-sharing and whether the wallet would require KYC, but did not immediately hear back.

Billed as "the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans," the project was promoted on X with the promise of a share in $1 million in $TRUMP rewards. Users who sign up and refer friends can climb the waitlist, Magic Eden said in a statement to CNBC.

The gamified promotion is the latest attempt to drive inflows into Trump-affiliated crypto ventures — and it deepens the president's growing ties to the digital asset industry.

The family's expanding crypto portfolio already includes NFTs, a stablecoin, a decentralized finance platform with its own virtual token, meme coins named after him and the First Lady, as well as plans for crypto exchange-traded funds through Truth Social's new financial arm, TruthFi.

Magic Eden, whose CEO attended the president's recent fundraiser dinner for winners of a previous $TRUMP coin contest, appears to be building the wallet on top of Slingshot Finance, a self-custodial trading app it acquired in April.

Slingshot's platform features meme tokens such as BONK and FARTCOIN and does not directly collect user identity information. Instead, identity checks are handled by MoonPay, its fiat on-ramp provider.

It remains unclear whether the wallet will require its own KYC procedures, or how revenue and responsibilities will be split between Magic Eden and Trump-affiliated entities.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concern Tuesday with the progress on inflation, saying recent lower readings could reverse after tariffs work their way through the economy.

In addition, Cook said she expects President Donald Trump's moves on trade policy could take a toll on the labor market, though she noted that the economy for now is in relatively good shape.

"I do not express views on the Administration's policies. But I do study the economic implications, which appear to be increasing the likelihood of both higher inflation and labor-market cooling," the policymaker said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

On inflation, Cook noted that progress has been made, with core inflation at 2.5% and headline at 2.1% in April, according to a report last week that uses the Fed's preferred measure.

However, economists largely expect the tariffs to push costs higher. Fed officials generally view tariffs as one-off occurrences for prices, but the broad range of the Trump levies could change the equation.

"Price increases tied to changes in trade policy may make it difficult to achieve further progress in the near term," Cook said. "The recent post-pandemic experience with high inflation could make firms more willing to raise prices and consumers more likely to expect high inflation to persist."

Indeed, a survey-based measure of inflation points to a significant spike over the next year. Market-based measures, however, indicate more muted expectations further out.

Cook's comments come two weeks ahead of the Fed's next policy meeting on June 17-18. Market expectations overwhelmingly indicate the central bank will be on hold again regarding interest rates, and most statements from policymakers since the last meeting back that up. Traders expect the next Fed cut to come in September.

Cook did not specify when she thinks the Fed can ease again, saying current policy is set in a place where she and her colleagues can respond to threats on either side of the Fed's mandate for full employment and low inflation.

"I see the U.S. economy as still being in a solid position, but heightened uncertainty poses risks to both price stability and unemployment," she said. "When making decisions, I think it has been valuable to remain a student of economic history. Our recent past has provided some useful lessons for decision-making during periods of high uncertainty and elevated risks to our dual-mandate goals."

Earlier in the day, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expects just one rate cut this year as "most of the [inflation] measures are still flashing red."

However, in a speech over the weekend, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he expects tariffs to be on the lower end of expectations, with impacts in the second half of the year that nonetheless could allow the Fed to enact "good news" rate cuts before the end of 2025.

GOP Tax Bill:

President Donald Trump attacked fiscal conservative Rand Paul as “crazy” Tuesday morning as he pressed reluctant Republican senators to move forward swiftly with his massive tax and spending package.

The Kentucky senator earlier said on CNBC that he wouldn't vote for the president's signature legislation because it would increase the legal US debt limit.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stocks reversed course late in the session on Tuesday to close marginally higher, with the Stoxx 600 index provisionally eking out a 0.01% gain.

Major bourses were all in the green, with Germany's DAX up 0.64%, France's CAC 40 up 0.33% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 up 0.13%.

The euro dropped 0.56% against the U.S. dollar after data showed inflation in the euro zone eased to a cooler-than-forecast 1.9% in May, below the European Central Bank's 2% target. The figures supported expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the ECB at its meeting on Thursday, with some economists suggesting a follow-up rate cut in June now looks more likely.

Tomorrow we'll be monitoring talks between European Commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who are due to meet in Paris around 9 a.m. local time. It's also the day U.S. President Donald Trump's hastily announced hike in duties on steel imports to 50% — expected to fuel domestic inflation and rock the struggling European steel industry — will come into effect.

CNBC will be broadcasting from SuperReturn in Berlin, one of the world's largest gatherings of the private equity industry, with guests including Carlyle's Head of Global Credit Mark Jenkins and Bain's EMEA private equity head Alexander Schmitz. See you then.

Ratings agency S&P Global has made 26 negative ratings actions, including eight downgrades, five CreditWatch negative placements and 13 outlook revisions due to tariffs since the start of March through to the end of May.

Data from S&P published in a report Tuesday showed 24 of the 26 entities were corporations, 18 of which were based in the U.S., including Fender Musical Instruments Corp. — downgraded from stable to negative — and Conair Holdings — downgraded to developing from negative.

Outside of the U.S., Slovakia's sovereign rating was cut to negative from stable, while China's Geely Holding, automaker Volvo's parent company, was also cut to negative from stable.

European firms impacted included Dutch chemicals firm Pearls, and window coverings manufacturer Hunter Douglas Finance.

U.S. markets have seen a muted open, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both down by around 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%.

Fund manager Giles Parkinson of Trinity Bridge sold shares of luxury retailer Moncler in early March and avoided steep losses in the weeks following as the stock slid.

Parkinson's caution wasn't borne out of analyst reports, hushed industry whispers, or traditional financial modeling, but from what he called a "good short-term guide to luxury industry writ large": the spending patterns of international tourists.

His thesis was confirmed when Moncler reported its first quarter 2025 results on April 16. While not disastrous, it painted a clear picture of a company navigating choppier waters.

The euro was 0.2% lower against the U.S. dollar and 0.07% down against sterling at 10:42 a.m. in London, after data showed inflation in the euro zone eased to 1.9% from 2.2% in May. The rate was lower than the 2% expected. 

Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was a little over 2 basis points lower at 2.497%. 

European stock markets remained largely in the red, with the regional Stoxx 600 index down 0.2%. 

"We expect inflation to fall further in the coming months, leaving the headline rate comfortably below 2% in the second half of the year," Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. 

"This won't have much of a bearing on Thursday's ECB decision, which already looked almost certain to be a 25bp cut. But May's inflation data strengthen the case for another cut at the following meeting in July," 

— Jenni Reid

Sweden's Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson has told CNBC that Washington's seesawing over global trade and tariffs is worse than levies themselves.

"The most constant right now seems to be the sudden shifts of [U.S. President] Mr. Trump," she told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition."

"He's changing almost on a daily basis what will happen, and that's of course really costly for our companies, for our households and for the global economy. So right now, the uncertainty and the unpredictability is worse than tariffs," she said.

Inflation in the 20-member euro zone eased to 1.9% in May, coming in below analyst expectations and also under the European Central Bank's target of 2%. 

The headline decline, assisted by a steep monthly drop in services inflation from 4% in April to 3.2% in May, further builds the case for a widely anticipated interest rate cut from the European Central Bank when it meets on Thursday.

Shares of Starlink competitor Eutelsat rose by more than 6% as the company is reportedly in discussions to raise 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) from investors.

Bloomberg News reported that Eutelsat, which runs the OneWeb satellite constellation, is in talks with the government of France, the United Kingdom, and shipping company CMA CGM to raise funds to build its low-earth orbit network.

The deal would take the French government's stake in the company to 30% from the current 13.59%, Bloomberg said.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has turned lower after rising in early trade. The benchmark was lower by 0.2% at 8.30 am in London.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100, CAC 40 and Germany's DAX were also in the red by 0.1%.

Swiss bank Julius Baer plans to cut costs by 130 million Swiss Francs ($158.8 million) by 2028 as part of its strategic review.

The bank said that the savings will be in addition to its target to lower expenses by 110 million Swiss Francs ($134 million), which was announced in February. Julius Baer said it expects to exceed that target by 20 million Swiss Francs.

Analysts largely welcomed the strategy update from the bank's new chief executive, who took control at the start of this year.

"The words discipline/disciplined appear a total of 19 times in the Strategy Update presentation from Julius Baer under new CEO Stefan Bollinger and this is giving the right messaging to all stakeholders given the issues over the past years, in our view," said JPMorgan's Amit Ranjan in a note to clients.

The bank also revealed its plans to increase gross profit margins, assets under management and return on its CET reserves.

"While targets appear conservatively struck and imply earnings below consensus, this makes sense but is likely to require evidence of a better outcome and buybacks to resume to see earnings growth and upgrades coming through," said RBC Capital analyst Anke Reingen.

Good morning from London and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action in European financial markets, as well as business news, analysis, earnings and data.

Futures data from IG on Tuesday morning suggests London's FTSE will open 6 points higher at 8,787, Germany's DAX 42 points higher at 23,984, France's CAC 40 up 6 points at 7,741 and Italy's FTSE MIB up 106 points at 40,073.

The specter of U.S. tariffs has returned to the fore for markets this week, after President Donald Trump said Friday that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50% on June 4.

Investors will also be monitoring any developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, which soured last week. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggested Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could have a conversation as soon as this week.

Investors in Europe will be keeping a close eye on the latest inflation data from the euro zone.

Flash data from the single currency area is expected to show inflation cooled toward 2% in May, paving the way for the European Central Bank to deliver a widely expected 25 basis point rate cut at its next meeting on Thursday.

Euro zone inflation was unchanged at 2.2% in April, missing expectations for a move lower.

— Holly Ellyatt

U.S. stock futures slipped on Tuesday morning after the major averages began June's trading on a positive note.

In the regular session, the S&P 500 climbed 0.41%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.67%, and the Dow added 35.41 points, or 0.08%.

Stocks ended Monday higher despite rising tensions between China and the United States, with Beijing countering President Donald Trump's accusations that it had violated a temporary trade agreement. Investors had grown hopeful that the two countries could work out a trade deal, but this latest development points to negotiations taking a turn for the worse.

Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose overnight after China's manufacturing activity in May shrank at the fastest pace since September 2022, a private survey showed.

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 48.3, missing Reuters' median estimate of 50.6 and dropping sharply from 50.4 in April, as a sharper decline in new export orders highlighted the impact of prohibitive U.S. tariffs.

Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka sued his state's top prosecutor, Alina Habba, on Tuesday over his arrest last month at an immigration detention center in his city.

Baraka's federal lawsuit alleges that Habba falsely arrested, maliciously prosecuted and defamed the Democratic mayor.

Habba is President Donald Trump's former personal defense lawyer, and his pick for interim U.S. attorney for the Garden State.

The civil suit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey accused Habba of "acting for political purposes and fulfilling her stated goal of 'turning New Jersey red' by instigating and/or authorizing the false arrest of Mayor Baraka, a Democrat."

The suit comes just over two weeks after Habba said her office would drop its case against Baraka "for the sake of moving forward."

In the same statement, Habba accused U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., of assaulting law enforcement officers during a scuffle that took place outside the detention center as Baraka was being handcuffed.

McIver is charged with two counts of assaulting, resisting, and impeding law enforcement officials in connection with the incident at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility center known as Delaney Hall.

Both McIver and Baraka have decried their prosecutions as acts of political intimidation by the Trump administration.

"They abused their power to violently arrest me at Delaney Hall despite being invited inside," Baraka said in an X post announcing his lawsuit against Habba and Ricky Patel, a special agent at the Homeland Security Department's Newark division.

"No one is above the law," Baraka said.

The mayor was arrested on May 9 after he and three U.S. House members demanded to be let inside the facility to conduct oversight. Members of Congress are legally permitted to enter ICE facilities without prior notice.

Baraka, who has previously sought to enter Delaney Hall, says he was invited onto the property by an agent of the private company that owns it.

Habba, announcing the arrest on X later that day, alleged that Baraka "committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself" from Delaney Hall.

"He has willingly chosen to disregard the law," Habba claimed. 'NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW."

Baraka's lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges he was held in federal custody for five hours, calling it an unusually strict for law enforcement to take ahead of an initial court appearance for the "petty offense of trespassing."

Ten days after his arrest, Habba moved to dismiss the charges.

Two days later, federal Judge Andre Espinosa granted that motion — but not before admonishing Habba over the "worrisome misstep" by her office.

The "hasty arrest" culminated in an "embarrassing retraction of charges" and suggests a "failure to adequately investigate" and "thoroughly consider the implications of your actions," the judge said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday talked up the capabilities of Nintendo's new Switch 2, days before the long-awaited console is set to hit store shelves.

In a video posted by Nintendo, Huang called the chip inside the Switch 2 "unlike anything we've built before."

"It brings together three breakthroughs: The most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device, full hardware ray tracing, high dynamic range for brighter highlights and deeper shadows, and an architecture that supports backward compatibility," Huang said.

He added that the console has dedicated artificial intelligence processors to "sharpen, animate and enhance gameplay in real time."

Huang's comments come as Nintendo prepares to release the Switch 2 on Thursday. The Switch 2 is Nintendo's first new console in eight years, and it is expected to be a bigger and faster version of its predecessor. The device costs $449.99.

Huang also paid tribute to the vision of former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata, who died before the original Switch was released.

"Switch 2 is more than a new console," Huang said. "It's a new chapter worthy of Iwata-san's vision."

WATCH: Nintendo expects to sell 15 million units of the Switch 2

Ten years ago, my wife, daughter and I relocated from the Washington, DC area to Lisbon, Portugal. Living here has been one of the best experiences of our lives, so we're not surprised that it's the country Americans want to move to the most.

But once we arrived, we soon learned that some of our expectations before the move were unrealistic. For example, we thought we could fully integrate simply by mastering the language and making a lot of Portuguese friends. Ten years later, we still feel just as culturally "American" as we did when we first landed.

Now that we've fully settled in, our friends back home often ask about what living and retiring abroad is really like. Here are the top three myths about leaving the U.S.:

"Laid-back" and "low-stress" aren't necessarily the same things, especially if you're used to efficiency and attentive customer service.

It may take minutes to open a bank account in the U.S., but it could take weeks or longer for an American expat to do it in a country like Portugal, where banks require significant documentation and review periods before opening an account. 

And if you're worried about American politics, moving abroad won't stop the news cycle. In fact, without the reassuring familiarity of being "home," moving abroad might make you even more stressed.

So if your motivation for relocating overseas is to leave your worries behind, you may become disillusioned with life in a foreign country. But if your goal is to pursue excitement, novelty and the great unknown, then you'll have an easier time overcoming the unwelcome surprises that exist in even the most laid-back countries. 

The cost of living in a country like Portugal might be lower than comparable lifestyles in the U.S., but Americans often face extra administrative steps when they live abroad that can result in added costs.

For example, you may need to hire both a U.S. accountant for your U.S. income taxes, plus a local accountant to file your taxes for your country of residence.

Depending on which country you move to, you should consider the volatile nature of currency exchange rates. For example, the euro rose from about $1.03 early this year to nearly $1.14 today, so most things that my family buys in Portugal now cost us over 10% more than they did a few months ago. 

Most importantly, don't overlook the value of your time. A medical prescription in Portugal might cost a fifth of what it costs in the U.S., but can take five times longer to fill.

If one of your goals for moving abroad is to lower your living expenses, I suggest doing three things:

In Lisbon, there's a huge number of expat-focused group activities. There are co-working spaces that cater to expat communities and language schools. But as welcoming and friendly as Portugal tends to be, you may struggle to make new connections if you're based in more rural parts of the country. 

So how can you meet new friends and colleagues? If you're traveling with school-age children, does the school organize parent activities? Do you have hobbies you can pursue in a group setting, especially groups that meet regularly so you'll start to see the same faces over and over again?

Also important: What about your "helper" network? If you face a sudden need to take a return trip to the U.S., for example, who will care for your pets while you're gone? If you get into an accident, who will notify your family back home if you're unable to do so? 

My best advice is to have a written contingency plan, complete with names and phone numbers for who will stand in for you if necessary. It's okay if there are blanks in your contingency plan — you can fill those in as you develop new relationships in your new country. 

As for the one belief about moving abroad that actually is true? "You'll love living near the ocean on a glorious, sunny day." A picture tells a thousand words.

President Donald Trump is pausing one of the harshest consequences for student-loan borrowers who default on their debt.

On Monday evening, the Department of Education confirmed to Business Insider that it would be pausing Social Security garnishment for defaulted student-loan borrowers after restarting collections on May 5.

"The Department has not offset any social security benefits since restarting collections on May 5, and has put a pause on any future social security offsets," Ellen Keast, an Education Department spokesperson, told BI.

"The Trump Administration is committed to protecting social security recipients who oftentimes rely on a fixed income," Keast continued. "In the coming weeks, the Department will begin proactive outreach to recipients about affordable loan repayment options and help them back into good standing."

A notice posted to the Department of Education's debt resolution page also said that the department is "delaying offsets of these monthly benefits for a couple of months and plans to resume sometime this summer."

The notice added that the department still intends to resume wage garnishment "later this summer."

This announcement comes after a five-year pause that Trump started during the pandemic, halting negative credit reporting and collections on defaulted student loans. Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said that collections would resume once again in an effort to restore accountability to the student-loan system.

"Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense. Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others," McMahon wrote in a May opinion piece.

A federal borrower typically enters default after missing payments for more than 270 days. Those who are in default can rehabilitate their loans or consolidate their loans — both of which can be time-consuming — or file for bankruptcy.

Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default. The New York Federal Reserve recently found that the number of borrowers who moved into serious delinquency surged to 8.04% in the first quarter of 2024, meaning that millions more could enter default this summer.

Some student-loan borrowers previously told BI that they cannot afford to lose their Social Security income if they default on their debt.

"There will be no retirement. I'll die on the job," James Southern, a 63-year-old borrower, said. "Even if I were at my full retirement age, they'd garnish the Social Security, so I'm still going to have to work in order to survive."

Constellation Energy Corp. agreed to sell power from an Illinois nuclear plant to Meta Platforms Inc. as artificial intelligence sends power demand soaring.

The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp signed a 20-year contract to buy 1,121 megawatts from the Clinton plant starting in mid-2027, when a state subsidy expires, according to a statementBloomberg Terminal Tuesday. Constellation, the biggest US nuclear operator, and Meta didn't provide financial details.

Wall Street calls it a golden age for alternative assets. Richard Ennis, who spent decades helping pensions and endowments devise modern portfolios, calls it a costly delusion draining billions from portfolios — one that will come undone in the coming decades. 

For years, the pitch to institutional investors has been the same: passive returns on stocks and bonds are fine as they go, but to thrive money managers need hedge funds, private assets and other alternative vehicles. Yet after dissecting the data, Ennis — who helped pioneer the art of investment consulting — finds there is surprisingly little evidence it's true.

A representative of the Trump Organization said the group “knows nothing” about a crypto wallet project called the “$TRUMP Wallet,” despite the app's branding and claims being tied to the U.S. president.

“The Trump Organization knows nothing about this project," a spokesperson for the Trump Organization told CoinDesk.

The app, according to its sparse but live website, promises users the ability to hold and trade digital assets. It includes no technical documentation or launch timeline but features a waitlist for early access. Magic Eden, the crypto marketplace reportedly involved in the project, had confirmed the project through a post by its CEO Jack Lu on X. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has leaned into crypto since reentering the political arena ahead of last year's election. Past initiatives tied to Trump include World Liberty Financial, a stablecoin venture, and the meme tokens Trump Coin and Melania Coin, both of which launched before his 2025 inauguration.

According to the wallet's website, Magic Eden is working with GetTrumpMemes.com, the website behind the Trump memecoin. 

Donald Trump Jr., one of the president's children, also said in an X post that the organization has "zero involvement with this wallet product," but that World Liberty will "soon" launch its own wallet. His youngest son, Barron Trump, also denied the partnership.

 In May 2025, an Italian crypto millionaire was allegedly tortured for weeks in a luxury Manhattan townhouse, hung from a roof ledge and attacked with a chain saw as his captors demanded his bitcoin password. Just months earlier, another crypto executive had his finger severed by kidnappers demanding millions in digital currency.


 Crypto investors are waking up to how these aren't isolated incidents—they're part of a terrifying new wave of violent crimes that many worry has put a target on their backs. As Bitcoin and other digital assets have reached record highs, criminals are shifting from laborious online hacking to brutal, real-world extortion.


 Criminals are increasingly professional in their approach, leveraging a mix of digital sleuthing and real-world surveillance. Many victims are identified after flaunting their crypto wealth on social media or in public forums, despite the lessons many learned after the Kim Kardashian kidnapping saga.


 Others are exposed through data breaches at exchanges. Each passing week, it seems, more of the private information of cryptocurrency users is leaked. For example, in May 2025, Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) announced that hackers had accessed home addresses and account balances of almost 70k customers in the previous months, putting thousands at risk of targeted extortion and physical threats.


 Besides hacks, criminals have bribed insiders at crypto exchanges to leak sensitive customer data. This information can then be used to select and find high-value targets for kidnapping or home invasion.


 The luxury SoHo townhouse rented for up to $40,000 per month seemed like the perfect backdrop for crypto success. Instead, it became a torture chamber where 28-year-old Italian entrepreneur Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan was allegedly held for 17 days, his captors using increasingly brutal methods to crack his bitcoin wallet.


 According to police, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, both of whom have a history in the crypto world, didn't just threaten their victim—they hung him off the building's roof ledge, shocked him with electrical wires, and menaced him with a chain saw. When all that failed, they allegedly forced him to smoke crack cocaine and took Polaroid photos of his bound and bloodied body as trophies of their work.


 In the United States, a violent gang orchestrated a series of home invasions involving $3.5 million in stolen crypto between September 2022 and July 2023. Victims were threatened, tortured, and forced to transfer their digital assets under duress. The ringleader, Remy Ra St. Felix, was sentenced to 47 years in prison in 2024 after court documents revealed the gang's use of extreme violence, including inserting sharp objects under fingernails. “The victims in this case suffered a horrible, painful experience that no citizen should have to endure,” said U.S. Attorney Sandra J. Hairston for the Middle District of North Carolina in a prepared statement. “The defendant and his co-conspirators acted purely out of greed and callously terrorized those they targeted."


 The attacks span continents. In France, the crypto world recoiled in early 2025 when attackers didn't just kidnap the father of a prominent entrepreneur, but filmed themselves severing his finger and sent the video to his son, demanding €5 million (about $5.7 million) in crypto ransom.


 David Balland, a co-founder of Ledger, the crypto security firm, endured similarly gruesome attacks during his January 2025 kidnapping. Balland's finger, too, was cut off—a bloody calling card to prove the kidnappers' seriousness to anyone considering non-payment.


 Canada and Australia have also seen high-profile kidnappings, with crypto executives and traders abducted and forced to pay ransoms ranging from $40,000 to $1 million in digital assets.

 For crypto holders, the message is clear: visibility is a liability. Security experts urge investors to avoid sharing details of their holdings online, even with friends, and to use pseudonyms and fresh digital wallet addresses for each transaction. Physical safety measures are just as important—avoid posting geotagged photos, flaunting luxury items, or revealing travel plans that could signal wealth.


 Technical defenses matter, too. Store the bulk of your assets in multi-signature or cold wallets, which require multiple keys or are kept offline, making immediate transfers under duress impossible. Consider setting up decoy wallets with small amounts of crypto to surrender if threatened, while keeping the majority of your funds inaccessible in an emergency.


 Finally, stay informed about the latest scams and extortion tactics.


 The rise of crypto extortion is a stark reminder that digital wealth can bring very real-world dangers. As criminals become more brazen and sophisticated, crypto holders must balance the pursuit of financial freedom with a heightened sense of caution. Protecting your assets and, more importantly, yourself means you'll need to give much more thought to security because in the new world of crypto riches, the risks are no longer just virtual.

One NFT sold for 99.9 solana, or over $16,000 at current prices. 


Donald Trump's meme coin venture has entered the NFT scene, a familiar territory for the sitting US President. 

Holders of the $TRUMP meme coin as well as those who attended Trump's gala dinner in May for his meme coin whales, were airdropped NFTs on the solana blockchain, according to a Tuesday announcement by the meme coin project's X account. 

Addresses, such as 12f1o and 2PdmU, received NFTs from three different collections – Diamond Hands, Gold Gala Dinner, and Power to the Holders –  if they met each of the criteria outlined by the meme coin project. 

“1. If you successfully registered for the dinner, 2. were top 220 on the leaderboard, 3. or held strong through the dinner (Diamond Hands), check your wallet,” the post said.  If an address met one element of the criteria, they'd receive only the corresponding digital collectible.

The Diamond Hands NFT collection, which has a total supply of 118 NFTs, had a single transfer sale in the last 24 hours, but was the most expensive purchase of its cohort at 99.9 solana worth more than $16,000, data from NFT marketplace Magic Eden shows.  

With a total supply of 219 NFTs, the Gold Gala Dinner collection had four sales within the period which had an average sale of nearly 42.5 solana representing about $6,900. 

Power to the Holders, the cheapest among the group with the largest supply of 1,049 NFTs, has had the most amount of transfers standing at 17 sales generating over $21,000 in total trading volume in the last 24 hours. 

Magic Eden also revealed Tuesday afternoon it's partnering with the meme coin's team to launch a Trump-branded crypto wallet.

The newly released NFT collections continue a years-long history of Trump rolling out digital collectibles and incentivizing dinners to buyers. The sitting president last dropped an NFT collection in August 2024 where buyers who acquired multiples could get rewards such as an invite to a gala dinner with Trump. 

In December 2023, Trump released a different collection on the Polygon blockchain titled the “Mugshot Edition.” Again, some of those who purchased the digital items received, you guessed it, an invitation for a dinner.

DLNews reported in February that Trump generated between $7.3 and $8.2 million from his NFT collections, citing his financial disclosures from 2023 and 2024. The first time Trump promoted NFT cards using his image was in 2022, which sold out in a day for about $4.4 million, per a Forbes report. 

NFTs reached a fever pitch in 2021 after digital artist Beeple sold an NFT piece to art auction house Christie's for $69 million. The hype cycle included celebrities donning NFT profile pictures  and public companies rolling on NFT campaigns. The NFT mania has largely faded, with former giants like Yuga Labs selling CryptoPunks to a nonprofit.

The $TRUMP meme coin has increased roughly 3% in the last 24 hours, but has dropped 10% in the past seven days to trade hands at $11.44 as of writing. 

The bitcoin miner is sitting on a pile of crypto worth over $5 billion.

The ongoing streak of positive inflows is the longest since last December, when ethereum was trading near the $4,000 mark.

The company aims to be the Strategy of ethereum.

“Orange is the new gold.”

“We're building with conviction and readiness,” the firm's CEO told Sherwood News.

While Andreessen Horowitz proclaims the end of crypto's “foundation era,” the most important foundation in the business is in the midst of a, well, foundational shakeup.

Earlier this year, Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak replaced Aya Miyaguchi as the Ethereum Foundation's executive directors (the latter assumed a new role as the organisation's president).

Now, the single largest team within the foundation has undergone a substantial restructuring, shedding more than a dozen employees in the process.

In a blog post on Monday, the Ethereum Foundation said its Protocol Research & Development arm would continue under a new name: Protocol.

At the same time, its headcount will drop from more than 110 employees to fewer than 100, according to organisation charts shared before and after the restructuring.

This is the team that works on Ethereum itself. The foundation also has an operations team as well as teams that research privacy-enhancing technology and support software developers building applications atop Ethereum.

The streamlining is the latest in a series of moves meant to address the belief that Ethereum's love affair with decentralisation has come at a cost, to wit: the focus and efficiency that comes with decisive, top-down leadership.

Earlier this year, the Ether cryptocurrency languished while Bitcoin and Solana hit all-time highs.

Critics blasted Ethereum co-founder and foundation board member Vitalik Buterin for the foundation's seemingly hands-off approach to Ethereum development and called for Miyaguchi's ouster.

While Buterin insists Miyaguchi's transition from executive director to president began long before critics' frustration boiled over, the new co-EDs wasted no time signaling they had heard the criticism and would lead accordingly.

In April, they said they had three priorities for the next year: making Ethereum more performant, ensuring layer 2 blockchains remain affordable, and improving user experience.

As I wrote at the time, that was a bit of a pivot for an organisation that had long believed the road to mass adoption ran through layer 2 blockchains alone.

Monday's changes were all about delivering on that pivot, senior EF employees wrote.

“We encourage every team in Protocol to consider how their work is supporting our execution of these strategic initiatives,” the blog post reads.

“Critical to our execution is the presence of leaders in our group whom the community trusts. We are being more explicit in assigning leaders to accelerate our strategic initiatives in order to increase accountability.”

Not everyone was pleased.

Ethereum developer Péter Szilágyi — who appears to have left the foundation amid the restructuring — said “this is where the word ‘decentralised' was quietly, forever removed from #Ethereum's roadmap.”

Others were less concerned that a more assertive foundation would compromise Ethereum's decentralisation.

“I applaud strong leadership that facilitates decentralization to actually happen instead of the kumbaya of the past that couldn't even get a basic website done to convey what Ethereum is even about,” Sebastian Bürgel, a vice president at Gnosis DAO, said.

Ethereum has performed well in recent weeks, but that doesn't mean investors have forgotten the days when it was trading above $4,000.

The ECB selects XRP Ledger and White Network for a 12-month CBDC pilot across 500 financial firms.

XRP Ledger leads the ECB's Digital Euro pilot with White Network adding compliance and resilience.

ECB begins CBDC testing using XRP Ledger and White Network to power cross-border Eurozone payments.

The ECB's Digital Euro pilot uses XRP Ledger as core tech and WHITE as secondary infrastructure.

The ECB launches a regulated, cross-border CBDC trial backed by XRP Ledger and White Network.

The European Central Bank has initiated a 12-month pilot for its official Digital Euro project, selecting XRP Ledger and White Network as infrastructure providers. The program will test real-time settlement, cross-border payments and regulatory compliance across 500 financial institutions. This move marks a pivotal moment in Europe's transition toward a central bank digital currency.

The ECB selected XRP to support high-speed and compliant digital currency transactions across the Eurozone. XRP Ledger will serve as the primary infrastructure, delivering more than 1,500 transactions per second with sub-five-second finality. This ensures institutional-grade reliability and responsiveness in real-time financial environments.

The Digital Euro pilot will restrict each transaction to a maximum of €10,000 to ensure safety and manageability during testing. XRP performance benchmarks align with these parameters, offering programmable, auditable and transparent transactions. The ECB will gather usage data to evaluate performance, integration capabilities and potential scalability.

The pilot will undergo three phases between June 2025 and May 2026. These include infrastructure validation, institutional integration and full-scale testing across regulated financial networks. XRP Ledger's integration aims to demonstrate secure and efficient cross-border transaction capabilities in compliance with EU standards.

The White Network by WhiteRock has been designated as the secondary infrastructure platform for the ECB Digital Euro trial. The network features institutional support tools designed to complement XRP Ledger's capabilities in regulated environments. White Network will offer resilience and diversity to the pilot's infrastructure stack.

White Network brings compliance-focused features tailored to European monetary regulations. These include smart contract governance tools, custody solutions and secure messaging protocols. As part of the program, it will serve in parallel to the XRP Ledger to enable diverse testing scenarios.

The White Network($WHITE) surged 350% in recent days amid strong market anticipation. The platform's team also launched a fair token initiative rewarding early holders, creating additional incentives. WhiteRock expects increased institutional engagement as the pilot progresses and the ecosystem expands.

The pilot operates under the ECB's Digital Currency Innovation Division with full EU regulatory compliance embedded into all operational phases. Each of the 500 financial entities involved must adhere to transaction, security and reporting standards set by the central bank.

The phased rollout includes deployment, controlled testing and final performance analysis with key indicators guiding each phase's success metrics. All infrastructure providers must meet high security, speed and stability benchmarks to remain in the pilot. The findings will inform the future structure of a fully implemented Digital Euro.

If successful, the ECB may use this pilot as the baseline for wider digital euro deployment. The integration of XRP and White Network will be continuously assessed based on user feedback and technical outputs. Upon pilot completion, final recommendations will be released after May 2026.

Bitcoin is regaining after a week of losses, rising back above $106,000 as of this writing—but top meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) is up more on the day, while Pepe (PEPE) and other less-valuable meme coins are sizably outperforming the top coin in terms of daily gains.

DOGE and PEPE, both among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, have gained 3% and 9% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin has climbed about 2% in that time. 

But while the top memes are leading BTC, they're severely underperforming a basket of established Solana-based animal meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF), Popcat (POPCAT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Moo Deng (MOODENG), all which are beginning a rebound off double-digit percentage losses in the last 7 days.

Each member of the group has gained at least 10% in the last 24 hours, led by WIF, which has jumped 20% to $1.02. That's still nearly 79% off its March 2024 all-time high of $4.83, however.

The group, which all earned centralized exchange listings during last year's Solana meme coin frenzy, have also experienced trading volume increases during the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.

Beyond Solana, other established meme coins are leading the charge higher on their respective chains. The Ethereum-based SPX6900, a token which was created with the intention of flipping the S&P 500 in market cap, is up 12.9% to a $1.04 billion market cap—and unlike other meme coins, has actually gained in the last week. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index maintains a total market capitalization of around $47.5 trillion.

Ethereum's Mog Coin (MOG) has also added 15.5% in the last 24 hours. Newer meme coin ecosystems are joining the party too, with Hyperliquid's PURR token gaining nearly 38.7% in the last 24 hours.

All this comes while the meme coin category has managed just a 3.1% gain during that time, and remains down nearly 10% over the last week.

Even though Bitcoin has started its rise once more, Bitcoin dominance—or its market capitalization relative to the entire crypto market cap—has fallen to 64.15%. That's a drop of around 0.16%, and further off the four-year high it marked one month ago as memes and alts outperform.

HOLO allocates 66% of cash reserves to crypto, generating $19.08M income; represents major asset allocation shift with mixed risk profile.

MicroCloud Hologram has made a significant financial move by allocating up to $200 million of its $303 million cash reserves (approximately 66% of total cash) toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. This represents an extraordinarily high concentration of capital in volatile digital assets for a technology service provider.

The company reports it has already generated $19.08 million in cumulative investment income from these positions, suggesting an approximate 9.5% return on the initial investment. While this appears positive on the surface, investors should recognize this performance occurred during a period of broader cryptocurrency market strength.

What's particularly notable is the scale of this allocation relative to HOLO's balance sheet. Committing 66% of cash reserves to cryptocurrency derivatives represents a dramatic departure from traditional corporate treasury management practices, which typically prioritize capital preservation through diverse, low-risk instruments.

The remaining cash ($103 million) is earmarked for technology development across blockchain, quantum computing, holography, and AI-AR integration. This dual strategy of aggressive crypto exposure alongside core technology investment creates a hybrid business model—part technology company, part crypto investment vehicle.

HOLO's strategy diverges significantly from most public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, as those firms typically allocate a much smaller percentage of reserves. This approach introduces substantial volatility risk to HOLO's financial foundation, potentially impacting its ability to fund operations and R&D should cryptocurrency markets experience prolonged downturns.

Investors should carefully evaluate whether this represents prudent diversification or an overconcentration in speculative assets that fundamentally alters the company's risk profile.

SHENZHEN, China, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ: HOLO), ("HOLO" or the "Company"), a technology service provider, announced that they have purchased up to $200 million in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. As of Jun. 03, the  cumulative investment income has reached $19.08 million. HOLO currently holds $303 million in cash reserves. The company plans to allocate these $303 million reserves toward derivatives and technology development in cutting-edge fields such as Bitcoin-related blockchain, quantum computing, quantum holography, and AI-powered AR.This move marks HOLO's further exploration and practice in the cryptocurrency sector while also demonstrating its determination and strategic vision for future business expansion.

The purchased Bitcoin and its derivatives this time will be incorporated into HOLO's capital reserve strategy, aiming to enhance the company's financial stability and long-term growth potential through diversified investments. HOLO stated that purchasing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency derivatives is a key initiative in its exploration of the cryptocurrency market, helping it gain insights into market mechanisms, price fluctuations, and investment strategies. Through this plan, HOLO seeks to accumulate valuable experience for future business expansion and capital operations in the cryptocurrency sector.

The company currently holds approximately $303 million in cash reserves. The allocated funds of up to $200 million will primarily be used to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with significant market influence and growth potential, as well as related securities derivatives. These assets will become a crucial part of HOLO's financial reserves, helping to enhance the diversity and risk resilience of its overall asset portfolio. Meanwhile, HOLO also announced that its the  cumulative investment income have now reached $19.08 million. This figure highlights HOLO's commitment to maintaining a strong financial position while also striving to create long-term value for its shareholders. HOLO emphasized that it will continue to uphold a prudent business strategy, enhance profitability and market competitiveness, and generate greater returns for its shareholders.

As a technology service provider, HOLO has also achieved significant breakthroughs in quantum system research and large-scale DeepSeek integration. These technological innovations not only provide strong support for HOLO's investments in the cryptocurrency sector but also lay a solid foundation for its future business expansion.

With the continuous growth of the cryptocurrency market, more and more enterprises are entering this field. As one of the pioneers, HOLO's investment decisions and strategic planning will undoubtedly serve as a model for other companies. Moving forward, HOLO will continue to explore and advance in the cryptocurrency sector, creating greater value for its shareholders while making a positive contribution to the overall development of the industry.

 BTC price action is already hunting liquidity immediately above price as support thickens, but market analysis doubts that new highs will come this week. 

Key points:

Bitcoin seeks to take liquidity around $106,000 as traders hope for a sustained price recovery.

Significant support is in place down to $97,000, boosting the odds of price holding.

Profit-taking is underway but lacks the intensity of classic cycle tops, research says.

Bitcoin (BTC) retargeted $106,000 after the June 3 Wall Street open as traders eyed the start of a bullish turnaround.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reversing losses seen after the daily close.

After dipping below old all-time highs from late 2024, Bitcoin managed to halt declines amid concerns that $100,000 may come in for a support test.

Analyzing the current market setup, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades hinted at the potential for liquidity grabs above and below the spot price.

“There are still a lot of positions built up on both sides,” he wrote in part of his latest X commentary. 

Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass underscored the potential for price to “squeeze” higher or lower to take neighboring liquidity, with upside liquidity already in the firing line.

Referencing one of its proprietary trading tools, trading resource Material Indicators highlighted key areas of support in the event of a fresh downturn.

“FireCharts shows ~$263M in BTC bid liquidity laddered down to $97,750, and an additional block of plunge protection just above the Yearly Open,” it observed on the day. 

Material Indicators nonetheless doubted the odds of Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs in the coming week without a suitable volatility catalyst.

“The trend undoubtedly is still up, but there has been no strong continuation above $100K+ this year just yet,” Daan Crypto Trades summarized the day prior. 

In new research into profit-taking activity among the Bitcoin hodler base, onchain analytics firm Glassnode showed just how unusual recent returns have been.

“The recent Bitcoin ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit,” it stated alongside a chart of the spent output profit ratio (SOPR) metric in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain.” 

Glassnode added that despite hodlers cashing out, the market had not yet reached the kind of “euphoric” state seen during previous long-term price tops.

Dimitra, a blockchain-based agricultural technology company, has partnered with Layer 1 blockchain platform MANTRA to bring real-world agricultural assets on-chain.

Jon Trask, Dimitra's founder CEO, told CoinDesk at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas last week that the partnership aims to eventually bring a billion dollars worth of agricultural assets, starting with cacao in Brazil and carbon credits in Mexico, onto MANTRA's blockchain.

Trask added that the two pilot projects with MANTRA are currently small in scale — in Brazil, only 25 of the 374 cocoa farmers in Brazil's so-called “cocoa pole” in the southern region of Roraima are currently signed up to participate — but could be expanded “indefinitely” with enough investor interest.

Through the partnership, MANTRA holders will be able to invest directly in smallholder farmers, providing funding for a variety of regenerative agricultural projects in a way that is made traceable and verifiable by the blockchain. Trask estimated that investors could see between a 10-30% return on their investments annually, which he clarified was a a projected range based on preliminary modeling — with agriculture comes risks like pests and drought which could impact yield, he added.

Trask said that Dimitra is still in the process of integrating the two pilot programs with MANTRA, but expects that holders of MANTRA's native OM token will be able to invest in the projects within the next couple of months.

Dimitra's announcement comes a month after MANTRA took a beating. Its OM token plummeted 90% in a flash-crash in April. Since the crash, OM has hovered around $0.34 — a far cry from its height of $8.47 in February.

Asked why Dimitra went forward on a partnership with MANTRA following the fallout, Trask said that the deal pre-dated the crash, but admitted it initially gave him pause.

“We made the deal many months ago,” Trask told CoinDesk. “Then they had their crash, and we all took a pause to reassess to ensure we were making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of the community and projects amid a time of volatility.”

But ultimately Trask decided to move forward with the partnership, telling CoinDesk that, when the dust settled, he still found the fundamental reasons for the partnership to hold true: MANTRA had a strong team, he said, the real-world asset (RWA) development was sound, and he was impressed by their virtual asset service provider (VASP) license, granted by Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), which it obtained earlier this year.

MANTRA has done a number of RWA tokenization projects in the Middle East, including tokenizing $500 million worth of real estate in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a Dubai-based real estate group.

“Tokenizing agriculture isn't just about innovation, it's about finding solutions to real-world issues long associated with food supply — at scale — and for long-term impact,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Dimitra is solving real-world problems, with a focus on traceability and transparency — and we're proud to help bring those to a wider audience. MANTRA Chain was built to support projects like these.”

Solana was once just a niche Layer 1 blockchain, but now it has decidedly emerged onto the international financial scene. Integration between major banks and Solana's powerful blockchain is bringing crypto and regular finance closer together than before. Because of this, digital asset investing is now looking ahead to an era where the technology is scalable, fast, and practical.

Because evolving markets and investors want more thoughtful and open solutions, blockchain is naturally becoming part of the banking industry. Solana's work with major institutions matters for both sides, as it will shape future interactions. 



At the same time, people's broader interest in crypto investment is rising, thanks to ETF approvals, the rise of decentralised finance, and strong demand for Bitcoin price updates alongside Solana.

The Bank-Blockchain Connection: Why Now?

Many banks are cautious about new technologies, especially when those technologies may affect their usual models. Lately, a new story has emerged. Financial institutions are no longer deciding if blockchain is worth exploring—they are now working out which partners would be best to work with.

What draws people to invest in and use Solana is that it is both fast and inexpensive. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have had trouble meeting demand at peak times, Solana was designed to process a high volume of transactions without raising costs. Because of these skills, people regard this enterprise as a great option for handling real-world asset tokenisation, promising banks many opportunities.

With blockchain tech providers partnering with Solana, banks can explore applying tokenisation to traditional assets, including bonds, equities, and derivatives. We want to improve the financial system, not replace it with something new. 

Since blockchains operate constantly and anywhere, handle data transparently, can be programmed, and reach any country, they handle settling and complying with regulations much better than traditional systems.

Making Real-World Assets Available as Tokens

Solana's making it possible to use banks for tokenised assets is a significant catalyst for change in the industry. With the traditional system, assets such as real estate, stocks, and government bonds require multiple steps, which causes much delay and high costs. Using tokenisation, digital versions of these assets appear on the blockchain, simplifying things.

With Solana, it gets much more straightforward. For a tokenised bond, issuance, trading, and settlement take minutes, not days, as it does with traditional bonds. Investors may hold fractional stocks, immediately trade their shares on the secondary market, and clearly see their holdings and current value. With blockchain, banks experience lower expenses and can reach a wider range of clients.

It also matters to ordinary investors. Since traditional asset classes are now less expensive and easier to trade, more people can invest small amounts in them. A retail trader might join investors on Solana to buy a part of a commercial real estate asset—something not possible for individual investors before.

The Reason Behind Crypto Becoming Popular

Using Solana will expand beyond the banking industry's technological foundations. Because the gap between traditional finance and blockchain is shrinking, more institutions are expected to offer services built on blockchain to their customers. This means you might get options like tokenised checking, benefits in crypto through rewards and frictionless movement between fiat and virtual currencies.

The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies makes a strong statement to the market. Because of this faith from institutions, many retail investors are encouraged to learn more about what blockchain technology offers. Because banks now accept Solana, its reputation will increase, much as Bitcoin did when institutions started investing in it.

Bank-released stablecoins, tokenised reward points, and debit cards working on Solana might be other changes we notice. These could improve the ability to use blockchain and attract a much larger number of people to use it daily.

Strong Technical Aspects Are the Basis for Better Financial Integration

Due to its specific design, Solana operates well under high-volume financial conditions. While many blockchains depend on sequential data, Solana creates its transaction log using Proof of History. With these increases, the system can easily support the large amount of data banks use.

Using smart contract automation allows banks to programme assets, handle settlements automatically, and check compliance rules without staff intervention. Speed and data are crucial in finance, so these capacities are needed, not just welcomed.

In addition, Solana's list of developers, providers of technical resources, and financial apps is growing larger. Because of these solid community networks, banks and businesses can use these solutions without doubt, since the blockchain system is constantly advancing and improving.

Today and the Future

As expected, there will be difficulties ahead. The lack of clear rules continues to be a problem for blockchain adoption in the finance industry. 

Banks will continue to encounter new legal rules as they carry out tokenisation and set up blockchain solutions. Keeping data safe is still very important. Knowing Solana's technology, it is vital for services dealing with money to be well-defended from hacks and vulnerabilities.

Solana's link with leading banks goes beyond an agreement; it confirms that future finance will be secure, open and fast. Once institutions start using blockchain technology, the whole investing world can change. Tokenisation will offer investors faster transactions and wider opportunities and banks will experience less expense and better efficiency.

As traditional finance and crypto work side by side, rather than against one another, Solana takes a key position in these sectors. Because it is fast, easily expandable and designed for developers, it makes ideas that once seemed science fiction a reality. This trend will eventually cause crypto to replace speculative tech and become the mainstay of the financial sector.

Mintable is set to launch NFT collectibles as part of its interactive Eco Trail Treasure Hunt ahead of the country's annual Youth4Climate Festival 2025, as part of the Singapore Sustainability Festival.

The Singaporean NFT marketplace is preparing to launch five unique NFTs that visitors can collect by participating in a blockchain-based card game held at City Square Mall on Kitchener Road, Singapore. The Eco Adventure card game will run alongside the Singapore Sustainability Festival, scheduled from June 6 to June 8.

During the festival's run, participants will be able to collect digital badges that they can obtain by scanning eco-friendly installations throughout the mall and completing mini sustainability lessons. Once completed, participants will be able to collect up to five unique NFT collectibles dubbed “Green Stop” NFTs without prior web3 knowledge needed. 

Partnering with City Developments Limited, the Singapore Innovation Centre, the Asia Blockchain Association, and the Sustainability Alliance, Mintable's B2B utility NFT arm, Mintology, will power the Eco Adventure card game using blockchain. The initiative leverages the project's gasless NFT infrastructure.

Mintable CEO Zach Burks sees the joint campaign with Go Green SG as an opportunity to engage young people and spark interest in sustainability. The program also introduces them to web3 technology, including NFTs, by taking a “balanced approach” and promoting healthy attitudes toward digital innovation.

“We are excited by the potential of the gasless minting technology deployed into the treasure hunt and will continue working with key government bodies to build future solutions that help everyday individuals better interact with the world around them,” said Burks.

The mini sustainability lessons cover topics such as upcycling workshops, materials exploration, the importance of trees, and the impact of visual upcycled art in society. All lessons are designed to be kid-friendly and interactive, integrating Mintable's web3 technology with real-world engagement.

Participants who collect all five NFTs will be eligible to enter the festival's lucky draw for a chance to win prizes. The joint campaign aims to demonstrate how NFTs can be seamlessly integrated into government-supported green initiatives while boosting the adoption of web3 technology.

According to the country's Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index 2025, crypto ownership in Singapore has fallen by 11%. A survey conducted by Independent Reserve Singapore found that nearly 50% of crypto investors have sold their holdings in the past year, with 67% of them making a profit.

ICO, the UK's data and info regulator, is moving its HQ to 20,000 sq ft at No.3 Circle Square.

The UK's independent data protection and freedom of information regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), is set to relocate its headquarters to Manchester city centre, having agreed a lease for 20,000 sq ft of high-quality workspace at Bruntwood SciTech's No.3 Circle Square.

A landmark development at the heart of the city's knowledge quarter, the £87 million, 267,000 sq ft innovation hub is the latest phase of the Circle Square neighbourhood to be brought forward. The building is being delivered by Bruntwood SciTech, the UK's largest property platform dedicated to the growth of the innovation, tech, and science sectors, in a joint venture between Bruntwood, L&G and Greater Manchester Pension Fund.

The ICO plays a vital role in empowering people through information. The move from the regulator's base which it has held since being founded, in Wilmslow, Cheshire, will see it establish its new national headquarters within the 15-storey development. The ICO expects to move to Manchester in autumn 2026. 

Relocating to the Oxford Road Corridor places the regulator at the heart of one of Europe's most dynamic knowledge quarters, offering direct access to Manchester's world-leading universities, a highly skilled graduate talent pool, and a vibrant urban environment. The move supports the organisation's ambition to access a broader and more diverse talent pool, enabled by Manchester's excellent connectivity and position at the heart of a vibrant, tech-driven community at Circle Square. Alongside its flexible floorplates, No.3 Circle Square has been designed to promote collaboration, support flexible ways of working, and enhance employee wellbeing.

The ICO's arrival at this growing community follows a series of significant moves that continue to drive momentum. This includes global sportswear brand PUMA, which is relocating its UK headquarters to No.3 Circle Square, and Auto Trader, the UK's largest digital automotive marketplace, which has committed to seven floors within the same building.

It joins an established cluster of innovation-led businesses already based at Circle Square, including Avalere Health, Roku, BlueSkeye AI, and HP Enterprise, as well as those located in the dedicated startup Tech Incubator – all contributing to a thriving ecosystem of technology, health, digital and creative leaders. This growing collective of global brands, scale-ups and pioneering start-ups reflects Circle Square's position as one of the UK's most vibrant and collaborative destinations for innovation.

The development of No.3 Circle Square follows the successful completion of the fully-let No.1 and No.2 Circle Square and forms part of an ongoing £243 million investment across seven assets currently being built or undergoing refurbishment in Manchester city centre by Bruntwood SciTech, including Pall Mall, King's House, 117-119 Portland Street, and Greenheys at Manchester Science Park, as well as Citylabs 4.0, which officially opened its doors in March.

No.3 Circle Square will include a shared roof terrace with expansive views across the city, breakout spaces and lounges, 24/7 access with high-speed connectivity, dedicated onsite security, and access to on-site meeting rooms.

Wellbeing and active travel have also been prioritised, with a bespoke gym, secure bike storage and high-quality shower and changing facilities also included. The building will also open onto Symphony Gardens; a newly landscaped space designed to complement the neighbouring Symphony Park and promote biodiversity and provide access to shared green space at Circle Square. 

A joint venture between Bruntwood SciTech and Vita Group, the Circle Square neighbourhood also offers more than 100,000 sq ft of retail and leisure space, including Manchester-favourite Onda Pasta Bar, North Tap Room, Half Dozen Other and Federal Cafe Bar.

Sustainability is one of the core principles in the design of No.3 Circle Square as part of Bruntwood SciTech's net zero carbon commitments. The building will be net zero carbon in both its construction and operation of its communal spaces, and is expected to achieve BREEAM Excellent status, as well as a NABERS 5-star rating and an EPC A rating. Its innovative features to maximise energy efficiency and improve fresh air and climate control for those within the building include an all-electric heating system with state-of-the-art heat pumps, roof mounted solar panelling, a smart Building Management System (BMS) and local Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) units.

Josh Whiteley, Commercial Director, Bruntwood SciTech, said: “This latest commitment underlines our vision for Circle Square as a destination of national significance for digital, data and technology-led organisations. The ICO's decision to relocate its UK headquarters here reflects the strength of Manchester's knowledge economy and the value of being part of a dynamic innovation community.

“At Circle Square we've created an environment that brings together forward-thinking businesses, academic institutions and emerging talent in a place purpose-built for collaboration and growth. Whether they're global leaders or scaling disruptors, our customers benefit from access to tailored support, a connected ecosystem, and workspace designed to meet the needs of modern, mission-driven organisations.

“Manchester has long been recognised as one of the UK's most ambitious and innovative cities – and this letting further reinforces its position as a hub for data, digital services and policy leadership. It's also a significant milestone in Bruntwood SciTech's mission to support the UK's knowledge economy through long-term, place-based investment – ensuring that businesses have the infrastructure and community they need to thrive.”

Jen Green, Executive Director – Strategy and Resources at ICO, said: “Our relocation to Circle Square will create a working environment that better supports how we operate now and into the future. The new space will provide a more flexible, collaborative setting for our teams, with improved access to the facilities and connections we need.

“Wilmslow has been a welcome home for the ICO for 40 years, and we will continue to have a small presence in the area beyond next year. Moving to Manchester puts us close to universities and other organisations working in data and digital, and will also support our efforts to attract new and diverse talent and strengthen the way we engage with the wider sector.”

Councillor Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council, said: “We welcome the ICO's decision to make Manchester its new national headquarters. It is further evidence of how attractive our city – with a huge talent pool, access to expertise including from our world class universities, and national and global connections – is proving to employers considering the best place to be. This move underlines Manchester's momentum and how Circle Square, which has recently also attracted Puma's national headquarters, is contributing to it.” 

Manchester Museum has been recognised as one of Europe's leading museums after winning the European Museum of the Year Award 2025.

A new railway connecting Liverpool and Manchester could kickstart a £90bn economic transformation across the North West – and help reshape how major infrastructure is delivered in the UK.

Greenheys tops out at Manchester Science Park, set to deliver cutting-edge lab space and a new HQ for UK Biobank's vital research.

A crypto billionaire with a reputation for funding public safety projects San Francisco is asking officials to greenlight a $9.4 million gift to create a new, state-of-the-art technology hub for the city's police force.

The donation, which is made up of funds linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, would relocate San Francisco police's Real-Time Investigations Center, which oversees its work with drones, surveillance cameras and automated license plate readers, from the SoMa Hall of Justice to an office at 315 Montgomery St. in the Financial District.

If approved, the Police Department would sublet the Montgomery Street location for free from Ripple, which paid $2.3 million for the lease through December 2026 but is no longer using the space, according to a proposal ordinance.

The other $7.25 million would come from the San Francisco Police Community Foundation, a charitable organization Larsen set up last year to support local police and crime-fighting initiatives.

Police commissioners are scheduled to discuss the funding proposal Wednesday at their weekly meeting. If they agree to accept the money, the decision would fall on the Board of Supervisors for a final approval.

In a Monday interview, Larsen credited last year's tech advancements with helping a chronically short staffed police force drive down crime rates and keep themselves safe.

"I think we can clearly see what a force-multiplier this is," he said, noting the city's historically low rates of crime over the last year. "The number of tools that they have is quite small, and we know that (expanding them) will have an impact."

Evan Sernoffsky, a spokesperson for the police department, said the gift would "supercharge" a unit that in 2024 assisted in over 500 arrests and helped drive a 40% drop in auto thefts over a one-year period.

"We cobbled together our current (Real Time Investigations Center) with everything we basically had lying around," Sernoffsky said. "Little did we know how effective it would become with just the tools at our disposal."

In a statement, Mayor Daniel Lurie credited the center for supporting an understaffed department and helping to keep neighborhoods safe.

"With this new facility, the SFPD will have the tools and the technology it needs to take this work to the next level," Lurie said. "I want to thank Chris Larsen for his continued dedication to our police officers and the safety of all San Franciscans."

Both police and other city officials have for months bemoaned deficiencies in housing the department's technological epicenter the Hall of Justice, a crumbling building constructed in 1958 that relies on 1960s-era wiring.

"In its current location, the RTIC has experienced power and internet outages, and plumbing leaks from the ceiling," the proposal ordinance stated. "The RTIC is in a windowless room in a concrete structure, which limits cell phone and emergency radio transmission capabilities."

During a recent press conference at the RTIC's Hall of Justice location, police asked reporters to refrain from charging their equipment in the room's electrical outlets because doing so risked overwhelming the system.

Last year touched off a technological revolution for city police following the passage of Prop. E, an assortment of measures that increased police powers and loosened the amount of oversight surrounding their surveillance technology.

A wave of new equipment was introduced in short order. It included a fleet of officer-piloted drones, hundreds of new automated license plate readers and towering mobile security cameras stationed in crime hotspots.

Many San Franciscans have embraced the advancements as an overdue response to its stubbornly high rate of car break-ins and other property crimes. But the tools remain deeply unpopular with privacy advocates who fear that they're vulnerable to abuses.

The proposed windfall would both relocate the RTIC and expand it; with funds earmarked for purchases included a dozen additional drones and related software, a new video wall and the installation of fiber internet services.

Larsen has previously footed the bill for other big-ticket items to support police and public safety, including a citywide network of surveillance cameras and an initial $1 million to the police charity to support officer wellness.

Technology has hidden side effects -- we reveal them here

Organized digital criminals have found another vulnerable group to attack: artists.  Using the confusion and buzz around crypto and NFTs, they are approaching artists with tempting partnership offers — we'll make and sell NFTs of your work, and you'll earn tidy commissions. But after months of promising messages, and alleged big-ticket sales, the criminals ask the artists to pay taxes and fees and then disappear with the money.

It happened recently to Douglas Newton, a charming artist from Brooklyn who specializes in still-life oil paintings of candy. For a few months last year, he thought he'd stumbled on an amazing way to pay for his grandkids' college after an NFT broker approached him on LinkedIn.  Instead, most of his retirement money was stolen by the NFT criminals. We tell his story in this week's episode of The Perfect Scam. 

I spoke with Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez for this story. Crypto crimes are so rampant — particularly in Brooklyn — that he's set up a special task force.  While investigating Newton's crime, he discovered a series of other artists who'd been hit by the same crime — they were approached about a buyer who wanted an NFT of their art, paid fees, then learned the buyer was fake.

(NFTs — non-fungible tokens — are a part of the crypto universe, a digital representation of a piece of art (or anything, really) that is entered into the blockchain to prove it's a one-of-a-kind creation.  Some people think NFTs will be valuable one day. I don't. I do think they are another great playground for criminals and speculators.)

Experts constantly give trite advice like, “You should never pay money to make money,” but when you are in a small business, that's not an option. Artists, like others in small businesses, have to take small leaps of faith like this all the time. And of course, hearing the words, “I want to buy your painting,” can send even the most level-headed artist into a romantic fever.  So that makes artists particularly vulnerable to crypto/NFT scams. I hope you'll communicate this warning to anyone you know who makes and sells artwork online, even if it's just a passion project. Also, as a society, we really need to protect our artists from scams.  Douglas' work is beautiful and I'd hate for artists like him to get so discouraged that they stop creating and sharing their work.

——————-Partial transcript————————-

[00:10:09] Douglas Newton: And I just wasn't crazy about the idea, but I was approached on LinkedIn by a woman. Her name was Ernestine Vigil. She lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She said she liked my work, you know, and she would like to convert one of them to an NFT and sell them.

[00:10:31] Bob: So Douglas trades LinkedIn messages with Ernestine for a while.

[00:10:35] Douglas Newton: Well, I was intrigued because she said, you know, I can sell this, this thing and she picked a, a work out of my website. It was actually a pastel drawing of just two people I'd done in, in a life drawing class, and she said she can sell it.

[00:10:55] Bob: And critically, she was absorbing the expense of making the NFT, a few hundred dollars, and do all the legwork. So what's the risk? Douglas gives her permission.

[00:11:06] Douglas Newton: Go ahead, and go, they sent me a contract actually, a paper contract that I filled out and mailed back. She didn't flatter me too much, it was more like, this, we just have to do this, and we just have to do that, and then you're going to get a lot of money, and it kept going up.

[00:11:26] Bob: So he fills in the paperwork, sets up a crypto account as she told him to do. About two months go by and then Douglas hears from her again with amazing news.

[00:11:37] Douglas Newton: I thought, you know I'd be, I'd be happy to sell it for $1000, the actual thing, or less even. It's just a drawing, and a pastel drawing, and uh, she said I, she could sell it for $49,000, and then she told me it had sold for $49,000.

[00:11:55] Bob: She sold the NFT for $49,000?! That's amazing.

[00:12:02] Douglas Newton: It was like free money because I, I hadn't expected to even sell the thing, you know. I thought, oh I'm going to surprise my family with all this money that's suddenly appeared. And I kept it a secret from the beginning.

[00:12:17] Bob: Well you, you probably were imagining, you know, what, you could pay for college for the kid or, or…

[00:12:22] Douglas Newton: Yeah! Oh yeah, yeah, I would do re–, repairs on the house. Not that it needs that much, but you know, just lots of extra money. It was wonderful.

[00:12:33] Bob: But then, after a couple more months pass, the news gets even more wonderful. The NFT has been sold again, resold actually for even more money, so now he's entitled to eventually more than $300,000.

[00:12:49] Douglas Newton: I said, “Great, where's the money?” And then she said, “Oh, by the… it sold, it's resold for much more, but you have to pay the sales tax and the, what they call internet fees.” They call them “gas” in the trade, internet fees. And so she started asking me for money.

[00:13:12] Bob: The requests are small at first, just a thousand dollars for sales tax and internet fees. Douglas sends that to her using his new cryptocurrency account. Then she needs several thousand more. And as the days go by, the requests and fees keep going up. Douglas doesn't have that kind of cash lying around.

[00:13:32] Douglas Newton: I ended up getting a, a personal loan at Citibank for $4000, and I ended up maxing out a couple of credit cards.

[00:13:41] Bob: He would send the money to this agent using PayPal, but that had limitations. Ernestine asked him to send money almost daily for several weeks until…

[00:13:53] Douglas Newton: I can't remember the exact figures, but it was like $2000 a day they would let me do. And somehow, I worked my way through $100,000.

[00:14:03] Bob: Just to give me a, an example, at one point she calls and says, “Great news. Now it's been sold for $150,000, but you need to put up $20,000.” Or you tell me, what, what kind of numbers would…

[00:14:14] Douglas Newton: That's exactly how it went. It was uh, we were conversing on LinkedIn back and forth. I never talked to her on the phone. It was all on LinkedIn and later on we switched to email for some unknown reason.

[00:14:31] Bob: Douglas has maxed out his credit card so he turns to the only other source of funds he has in his quest to get this NFT windfall released.

[00:14:41] Douglas Newton: And I was just selling all this, all these IRAs getting them into Citibank, getting the money into Citibank, and then converting them.

[00:14:50] Bob: What was the largest single dollar amount she asked for? Do you remember?

[00:14:54] Douglas Newton: Oh, it must be about 20 or something like that.

[00:15:00] Bob: But all the while, he thinks he has a huge payout coming. In fact, his cryptocurrency website shows just that.

[00:15:07] Douglas Newton: By the time it was over, she said I was going to get $310,000.

[00:15:14] Bob: You could look at an account and it looked like you had $300,000 worth of bitcoin there, right?

[00:15:20] Douglas Newton: Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. 310. I had to pay another $10,000 to get the key to unlock the money. That was the last thing they wanted me to do. Some, some sort of a key that would unlock the money.

[00:15:37] Bob: And all this is so tantalizing, right? Because they kept saying just pay this little bit more and you can unlock all this money.

[00:15:43] Douglas Newton: Yeah. I hate to admit it, but I sent all my IRAs at Vanguard to them.

[00:15:50] Bob: While all this is going on, Douglas doesn't tell his family. The whole time he's hoping he can surprise them with this windfall. But after that last request, haunting doubts creep into his mind.

[00:16:03] Douglas Newton: Over months, I kept this a secret, I kept thinking, this must be a scam but I would look it up on the internet and I didn't get any definitive proof that it was. It was like a nightmare. It, it was a horrible experience, it really was. Kind of the worst thing that ever happened to me.

[00:16:20] Bob: Oh God, I'm so sorry.

[00:16:23] Douglas Newton: Yeah, and I just, and I kept it a secret and I really thought I would surprise my family with $310,000, until they asked me for more money than I had in my IRAs at Vanguard, and at that point I just, something dawned on me, and I just realized that you know I, I didn't have any more money to give them, and it was that I was being scammed. I really realized, it took that for me to realize that I was being scammed.

[00:16:54] Bob: The feeling is devastating.

[00:16:59] Douglas Newton: Just the fact that I would spend all this money and nothing, nothing real ever happened, just promises. I remember waking up late at night thinking about this and going on the computer and googling everything I could think of. I never found anything definite, you know, like some other person who'd been scammed by them. I couldn't find it. But I had a lot of doubts and gradually the doubts got bigger than the hope, and uh when they asked for that last, last $10,000, which I did not have, then I, I confessed everything to my wife and my kids and uh, that, that was a really bad day.

[00:17:40] Bob: A really, really bad day.

[00:17:44] Bob: Can we talk about the day you had to tell your, your family? What was that like?

[00:17:47] Douglas Newton: Oh, it was horrible. It was just horrible. And they couldn't believe it at first, and then I, you know I, I showed them the numbers.

[00:17:56] Bob: Douglas' son ends up traveling home to help his dad deal with the fallout.

[00:18:02] Douglas Newton: My son lives in Vermont, and he came down and together we tried to do something. So we, we went to the police. We went to the Brooklyn DA, who were all very helpful, but they said this money's gone. You're not going to get it back. And they, they traced some of the calls, the emails I sent and they thought the money went to Europe, and then eventually Nigeria, imagine. Well I could imagine. But to Germany and other countries that it was part of a whole gang of people. She was just the representative, I'm sure working on a percentage.

[00:18:42] Bob: The Brooklyn DA is Eric Gonzalez, and he's taken a particular interest in NFT and crypto scams. There's even a task force — we'll get to that — but he tries to help Douglas as best he can.

[00:18:55] DA Eric Gonzalez: I think in this particular case that we're, we're talking about an 85-year-old victim had really invested his life savings in trying to recoup money, monies that he thought he had earned by selling his NFTs online. W met him when he came into the office.

[00:19:16] Bob: And it's a good thing he did report it because when the Brooklyn DA investigates, he finds out other artists have also been victims of these same criminals.

Guests at last month's Trump meme coin holders dinner were airdropped up to three NFTs, one of which has already sold for approximately $16,000. Even people who registered but didn't make the top 220 cutoff to attend, were given an NFT. Among that category, an NFT has already sold for $4,000.

Despite the big sales, there appears to be no utility for these NFTs. The official TRUMP meme coin X account called them “historic collector's items that celebrate the Crypto President.”

As promised, if you participated in the “Dinner With Trump”, your $TRUMP NFTs are now in your wallet. These NFT's are on Solana. They are historic collector's items that celebrate the Crypto President! 

🎖️ 1. If you successfully registered for the dinner, 2. were top 220 on the…

— TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) June 2, 2025



The Trump gala dinner took place in May and was open to the top 220 holders of the official meme coin of the President of the United States. It was held at his National Golf Club in Washington, D.C.. Outside the event, more than 100 demonstrators protested the dinner calling for the end of “crypto corruption.” And high-ranking U.S. Democrats claimed that the event could open the door to foreign actors to buy political influence through the meme coin.

But that didn't stop the event from happening. Some attendees relished the hour that President Trump was present. While others were disappointed by the absence of one-on-one Trump time and appalled by the “cheap steak” that was served.

It took almost two weeks for the attendees to receive the limited-edition NFTs for attending and holding the tokens.

There are three different NFTs, sent depending on how dedicated to the meme coin the recipient was. The “Power to the Holders” NFT was sent to 1,049 addresses and appears to be the bottom tier collectible shared with people who registered for, but didn't necessarily attend, the dinner. The “Gold Gala Dinner” NFT was sent to 219 addresses belonging to people who attended the event.

Finally, 118 “Diamond Hands” NFTs were sent to those that held their tokens throughout the dinner, according to the official Trump meme coin X account.

People like Morten Christensen, founder of AirdropAlert, bought a hefty bag of TRUMP tokens on the spot market, thus qualifying for the dinner, while also shorting the same amount elsewhere to reduce the fluctuation of the meme coin's price.

Christensen sold their supply before the dinner and confirmed to Decrypt they did not receive the Diamond Hands NFT as a result. But they said they did receive the Power to the Holders and Gold Gala Dinner NFTs.

By selling, they've missed out on a potential $16,000 after one Diamond Hands NFT sold for 99.9 SOL late on Monday. This is the only NFT of this class to have sold at the time of writing.

As for the other rarities, the Gold Gala Dinner NFT collection has a floor price of 48.15 SOL ($7,700) while the Power to the Holders collection floor price sits at 7.6 SOL ($1,200),  according to Magic Eden.

One X user suggested that Diamond Hands holders should be invited to play a round of golf at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. To this, the official TRUMP meme coin account responded, “that would be awesome.”

Yuma, a development studio and accelerator for decentralized AI (deAI) network Bittensor, has partnered with the University of Connecticut (UConn) to create a building program focused on pooling together specialized machine learning called “BittBridge.”

The partnership with Yuma will give a student-led team the opportunity to work toward operating and developing a project on Bittensor called a subnet, making UConn among the first academic institutions to build on the network, according to a press release.

While AI is everywhere today, it remains reliant on a handful of large corporations, centralized infrastructure and locked in a computing power arms race.

Bittensor, by contrast, makes AI a collective, decentralized process by rewarding contributors for using AI – activities ranging from text translation and data storage to predicting the structure of complex protein chains – focused into problem-solving clusters called subnets.

"The launch of BittBridge underscores UConn's role as an academic pioneer, providing students with cutting-edge experiences in decentralized AI and blockchain technology,” said Professor Greg Reilly, interim dean of the University of Connecticut School of Business in a statement. 

"In a rapidly evolving technological field, the best way to prepare our students is to immerse them in real-world innovation," Reily said.

Yuma is the latest company launched by crypto entrepreneur Barry Silbert, the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG).

"The transformative power of AI shouldn't be limited to a few tech giants or well-funded companies with massive compute access," Silbert said in a statement. 

"Our partnership with UConn represents a significant step in building pathways so the next wave of talent – including students and builders across disciplines – can enter deAI and help shape the outcomes of this extraordinary technology,” Silbert said.

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that altcoins may collapse in their Bitcoin (BTC) pairs any moment now.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 900,000 YouTube subscribers that the TOTAL 3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, remains in a downtrend against the flagship crypto asset and has yet to find a market bottom.









“I don't care how great you think your altcoin community is. I don't care if your developers that you follow have not yet rugged you. Altcoins, in my opinion, are oscillators at best against Bitcoin, and many of them just bleed to Bitcoin. So if individually altcoins will bleed to Bitcoin, then collectively they should as well, and that's the reason why I think alt/Bitcoin pairs will eventually find themselves down here [at 0.25]. I think it's just a matter of time.”

A move toward the support area highlighted by Cowen would signal that altcoins are significantly underperforming Bitcoin.
Cowen also points out that altcoins are in a multi-year downtrend against Bitcoin with no signs of reversing the trend anytime soon.
“I don't know exactly when alt/Bitcoin pairs are going to go to the range lows. I can't tell you that, but what I can say is what you're witnessing is basically the slow conversion of people holding alts and then they are just converting them to Bitcoin… 
The chart tells you what's happening. Alts put in a new low against Bitcoin [on June 1st]. So any prior altseason that was called for, any prior call for a low by alt/Bitcoin pairs up until today was wrong.”
TOTAL3/BTC is currently hovering at 0.33.

 Bitcoin hovers around $105,000, but bulls struggle with upside momentum as $100,000 comes into the picture. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price consolidates around $105,000 as liquidity builds up on either side of the spot price.

After failing to flip $106,000, BTC/USD is retracing to establish support, but $100,000 is a key level of interest for Bitcoin traders.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price trades 6% below its all-time highs of $111,900, and traders warn the asset may see a “larger correction” in June as $100,000 becomes a key level of interest.

In a repeat of the move that followed its rise above $100,000 on May 8, Bitcoin has successfully held above this level for more than three weeks.

This is the critical point on traders' radars and one that has not received a convincing retest recently.

MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe spotted Bitcoin hovering at $104,300 saying that after being rejected from the $106,000 level, BTC may drop lower before regaining upward momentum.

An accompanying chart showed $100,000 was the key level to watch on BTC's four-hour timeframe. 

Pseudonymous analyst CrypNuevo shared a chart showing that Bitcoin failed to flip the resistance at $106,000 into support. 

Meanwhile, popular analyst AlphaBTC projected a deeper correction that could see BTC price drop as low as $90,000, if the support at $100,000 is lost.

As reported by Cointelegraph, BTC price action could preserve $100,000 as support based on Glassnode's market value realized value (MVRV) bands.

Several traders eyed a potential downside liquidity grab with bid orders thickening below the spot price, and others clustering below $100,000.

“$100K is a strong psychological level and liquidity tends to stack in these levels,” said CrypNuevo in a separate post on X. 

The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass showed price eating away at bids around $105,000, with the bulk of interest clustered between the spot price and $100,000.

High bid orders were also building up below $100,000, with $170 million worth of liquidity sitting around $93,200.

On the upside, the $112,500-$113,500 cluster was the main liquidity area. 

“There is significant liquidity in both directions, with a more concentrated build up below the lows of the last few days,” AlphaBTC said on X.

Following the explosive 2021 Bitcoin and crypto bull run, the expectations of an “altcoin season” have become even more pronounced. This term refers to a period where the prices of altcoins rise rapidly and outperform the Bitcoin price by a large margin. Usually, this happens after the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high, and money is rotated into altcoins. However, this has not been the case this cycle. So what happened to altcoin season?

Crypto analyst and expert Michaël van de Poppe took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share with his over 790,000 followers that the altcoin season has yet to begin. This goes against the widespread belief that the altcoin season has already come and gone, and is officially over. According to van de Poppe, the altcoin market is actually still in a bear market, but it is about to end.

The analyst's prediction comes as the Bitcoin price remains above six figures, and yet the altcoin market continues to struggle close to its lows. Despite the abysmal market movement and the massive decline in positive sentiment, the crypto analyst still believes that the best is yet to come. 

He predicts that the crypto bull market is about to begin, and this would be bigger than ever because the bear market has gone on for so long. Furthermore, he points out that this cycle is different than previous cycles and the next 1-3 years will be different as well. Thus, he predicts many investors will miss it for being impatient.

Using the chart above, which was created by crypto analyst TechDev, van de Poppe shows that the altcoin market is at a pivotal point. It shows a period where the Bitcoin price is rising and altcoins have remained flat. However, this has usually turned out to be the calm before the storm, and altcoin season tends to follow. If the analyst is right, then the altcoin season never started, and is still in the future.

As Michaël van de Poppe mentioned, this cycle has been quite different from the previous one, and there have been a few reasons for this. The first is the advent of large buys from institutions such as Michael Saylor's Strategy and heavy hitters like BlackRock buying up Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The natural consequence of this is that money is now only staying in Bitcoin rather than rotating out at the top into altcoins like last cycle.

Also, a big difference between the current cycle and the 2020-2021 cycle is the availability of free cash. Following the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, governments around the world disbursed billions of dollars to citizens to help them weather the storm, and this ‘free cash' had inadvertently found its way into the market, triggering a massive altcoin season.

Other factors that have been pointed out to have contributed to this are the extreme P2P that emerged with the advent of instant meme coin creations. Thousands of new coins flood the market daily, and this has left liquidity spread thin. Also, broader macroeconomic factors such as Donald Trump's tariff wars have contributed greatly to keeping market performance muted, and the weaker altcoins have suffered more for it.

 The GENIUS Act could soon be up for Senate debate and crypto lobbyists urged senators to quickly pass the bill as amendments on credit card fees threaten to delay the bill. 

A stablecoin-regulating bill will soon be on the US Senate floor for debate, and crypto lobbying groups have called on lawmakers to focus on passing the bill, as some senators have flagged possible amendments.

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act could pass the Senate as soon as this week. It seemingly has enough votes to pass to the House after the Senate moved the bill forward in a procedural vote on May 19.

Now, crypto groups the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Digital Chamber and the DeFi Education Fund have said they're ready to help lawmakers maintain “positive momentum” to get the bill before the House. 

“As the bill continues through the amendment process, we respectfully urge lawmakers to remain committed to its central goal: providing a targeted and comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight,” the groups said in a joint statement on June 2.

Many Democrats have again backed the bill after pulling support, originally citing concerns over President Donald Trump's ties to crypto, including his family's crypto platform launching a stablecoin.

However, the stablecoin legislation could now hit a roadblock from an unrelated amendment about credit card fees.

Senators Dick Durbin and Roger Marshall want to attach their “swipe fee” legislation, the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA), to the stablecoin bill,  Politico reported on June 2.

The amendment would force payment networks like Visa, Mastercard and American Express to compete on the fees they charge merchants for processing transactions.

The controversial measure has been strongly opposed by banks and card networks, claiming government overreach. 

Meanwhile, crypto advocates are scrambling to prevent their long-sought victory from being derailed by the unrelated credit card amendments, which have created a political minefield.

James Czerniawski from the libertarian group Americans for Prosperity said last month that the changes are “unacceptable,” and claimed that the proposed amendment was “bad policy,” which undermines Americans' access to credit.

Other suggested amendments include new disclosure requirements for government officials holding stablecoins, guardrails against Trump family crypto ties, bans on Chinese and foreign ownership of stablecoin issuers, and reforms to the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering rules, crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett reported on June 2. 

“If no agreement is reached, procedural hurdles will likely slow things down and potentially push final passage into the week of June 9,” she said.

Less than a month after the Pectra Upgrade, the Ethereum Foundation believes that the world's second-largest crypto, both as a technology and as an ecosystem, is approaching major breakthroughs with higher stakes for a broader audience.

Yet those stakes could be at risk if the people steering it are entrenched in what it calls a messy process: shipping protocol.

"We must rethink our current approach to designing, developing, and stewarding the protocol," the foundation wrote Monday, announcing the restructuring of its Protocol Research & Development teams.

The move is set to consolidate development efforts under a new "Protocol" division, focusing on three immediate goals. The foundation touts the move as a way to "respond proactively" to demands that it claims are "hard to articulate and even harder to fulfill."

"Ethereum already powers the lion's share of internet capital markets, onchain communities, and secures $200 billion plus in value,"  Binji Pande, growth lead at Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution Optimism, told Decrypt. "Protocol now gives it the clarity and execution it deserves by scaling what works, improving UX, and keeping Ethereum useful for the world."

The overhaul divides teams into three initiatives: scaling the main blockchain (Layer 1), scaling blobs for data storage, and improving the user experience.

Each initiative is assigned dedicated leadership: Tim Beiko and Ansgar Dietrichs are responsible for L1 scaling, Alex Stokes and Francesco D'Amato will oversee blob scaling, while Barnabé Monnot and Josh Rudolf are tasked with improving user experience.

Protocol would help give developers across the Ethereum system "with clearer signals on where the base layer is headed—who to speak to, what to collaborate and double-down on," Joshua Cheong, head of product at Layer 2 protocol Mantle, told Decrypt. "That clarity enables us to innovate faster and with more confidence."

But not everyone is staying and making the cut for Protocol. Some members "won't be continuing with the Ethereum Foundation," it said, while encouraging ecosystem projects to recruit departing talent.

Decrypt reached out to the Ethereum Foundation to learn more.

The three teams will be supported by Dankrad Feist, a prominent researcher and cryptographer renowned for "Danksharding," a blockchain optimization process named after him. Feist will work as strategic advisor to all tracks.

Last year, Feist was involved in a conflict of interest controversy, when he, alongside fellow core developer Justin Drake, confirmed they received tokens for their advisory relationship with EigenLayer, a restaking protocol for Ethereum.

“It is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient, and we have been working on a formal policy to address this," Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation's former Executive Director, said at the time.

Still, the Ethereum Foundation's efforts at restructuring with Protocol aim to bridge a perceived gap between research and actual implementation.

Previous upgrades, such as Pectra, faced several hurdles: testnet failures earlier this year delayed the rollout by weeks as developers scrambled to patch bugs.

Now, through Protocol, the foundation is attempting to show "the world is ready for the world computer."

Bitcoin continues to showcase resilience in the current cryptocurrency market cycle, consistently setting new records while many altcoins remain below their previous peaks.

Currently trading just above $104,000, Bitcoin has recently retraced from its all-time high above $111,000, set last month. Contrasting Bitcoin's consistent growth, Ethereum and other prominent altcoins have yet to surpass historical highs that they reached several years ago, highlighting a notable divergence in market performance.

This divergence has been a focal point among analysts, prompting a deeper examination of investor behavior and capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins. Recent insights from CryptoQuant analyst Dan suggest that while Bitcoin remains dominant, the situation for altcoins might shift in the upcoming phase of the crypto market cycle.

Bitcoin Investor Behavior Suggests Potential Shift Ahead

CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan recently explored the broader implications of this Bitcoin-dominated cycle in his market commentary. According to Dan's analysis, previous market cycles typically saw a gradual reduction in mid-to-long-term Bitcoin holdings as investor capital redistributed into altcoins.

This shift traditionally drove altcoins significantly higher, usually marking the late stages of a bullish cycle. However, this cycle exhibits a different pattern.

Frequent minor corrections in Bitcoin's price are followed by more significant and sharp downturns for altcoins, demonstrating persistent weakness. Crypto Dan notes that currently, very few altcoin investors have realized meaningful profits, an unusual circumstance compared to prior cycles.

Despite this ongoing difficulty for altcoin holders, the analyst maintains optimism, emphasizing that historical patterns suggest Bitcoin's dominance typically declines towards the end of each cycle.

If history repeats, altcoins might experience substantial upward movements as the cycle approaches its maturity. Thus, while altcoins currently underperform, investors are advised to maintain patience until Bitcoin's momentum reaches its final bullish push, potentially signaling a turning point.

Whale Activities Hint at Upcoming Altcoin Attention

Complementing this perspective, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Maartunn, provided insights into stablecoin inflows to major exchanges.

Specifically, Maartunn highlighted that over 75% of Tether (USDT) deposits to Binance, tracked via the TRC-20 network, originated from large wallets, commonly known as whales, since November 2023.

Over 75% of USDT Inflows to Binance Are from Whales

“The data shows a clear trend: whales prefer Binance. Since November 2023, approximately 75% of total USDT deposits to Binance have originated from whale addresses.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/KCBA8cVCdb

This substantial concentration of whale activity suggests that major market participants prefer Binance for significant capital movements involving stablecoins.

The notable whale-driven inflows to Binance could indicate preparation for substantial market activity, including potential purchasing of Bitcoin or an eventual shift towards altcoins.

Historically, stablecoin deposits from large holders precede increased volatility and trading activity, as whales position themselves strategically in anticipation of market shifts.

Over the past few weeks, the crypto market has slowly recovered from its previously extended bear cycle, with the Bitcoin price making new all-time highs and Ethereum surging to unexpected levels. Now, bold predictions of a new price peak and a possibly parabolic altcoin season are spreading, with a crypto analyst forecasting Bitcoin climbing to $200,000 and Ethereum hitting $10,000. 

The Bitcoin price is on a trajectory toward $200,00,0, and Ethereum could reach $10,000 by the end of 2025, according to market expert Ash Crypto. This bold prediction is backed by market signals that suggest that the next phase of the crypto bull cycle is accelerating. 

After months of sideways consolidation, the market appears to be on the verge of a massive upward move, and Ash Crypto believes that this will not only be a breakout for top assets but also the beginning of a full-scale altcoin season. Historically, strong rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum act as precursors to altcoin surges, with capital rotating back from large-cap coins into smaller, high-potential tokens. 

As the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) tops, altcoins typically begin outperforming, delivering exponential gains in short timeframes. During the last bull cycle, Ethereum skyrocketed to new all-time highs, leading the altcoin market and paving the way for other cryptocurrencies to surge.

Current data shows that similar patterns are forming, indicating that the altcoin cycle could begin as soon as BTC and ETH break through key resistance levels and reach their highest levels yet. 

The message to investors and traders by Ash Crypto is to “not get shaken out and not sell early”. He highlights that selling at current levels, especially after enduring deep drawdowns, would be premature. 

Presently, Bitcoin is roughly 50% below its projected target of $200,000, while Ethereum still trades well under $5,000. At the same time, many altcoins are trading 70-90% below their previous highs, presenting a rare opportunity for high-risk and high-reward plays.

As Bitcoin and Ethereum set the stage, Ash Crypto is projecting 10x to 20x returns on select assets, particularly those with strong utility, active development, real-world use cases, and a vibrant and supportive community. 

Sharing similar sentiments about an impending altcoin season, market expert CryptoElites announced on X that the Bitcoin Dominance has officially reached a peak. The analyst shared a chart with BTC.D sitting at a high of 64.35%, indicating that altcoins may be preparing to skyrocket. 

Notably, after the Bitcoin Dominance reached critical resistance zones and peaked in 2021 and 2019, altcoins outperformed significantly. The analyst's chart shows that altcoins jumped by a whopping 50x in 2021, as capital rotated out of BTC. 

Now, in 2025, BTC.D has reportedly reached its highest price around similar key resistance levels. If it tops out and reverses just like before, CryptoElites predicts that a new altcoin season will begin, potentially paving the way for another 50x gains in select cryptocurrencies.

According to a recent study, in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), epileptic seizures are significantly more common than previously known. The discovery deepens understanding of the symptoms of this memory disorder and emphasises the importance of taking epileptic seizures into account in the treatment and monitoring of patients.

Coordinated by Neurocenter Finland, this major project by the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu examined the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD. The research dataset is one of the largest in the world, and the results have been published in the prestigious JAMA Neurology journal.

Epilepsy occurred years before the FTD diagnosis 

Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. The newly published study fills this information gap and shows that epilepsy is considerably more common in patients with FTD than previously estimated.

The study analysed patient data from the university hospitals of Kuopio and Oulu from the period 2010-2021. Out of a total of 12,490 medical records, the study identified 245 patients with FTD and 1,326 patients with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to examining the prevalence of epilepsy in these patients, the prevalence was also examined in healthy controls.

"Our results show that epilepsy is considerably more common among those with FTD than those with Alzheimer's disease or in healthy controls," says Doctoral Researcher Annemari Kilpeläinen, the first author of the research article and a medical specialist in neurology.

"It is noteworthy that epilepsy occurred in some patients with FTD already ten years before their dementia diagnosis, and it was more common in all the examined stages of the disease than previous international studies have reported."

The prevalence of epilepsy was assessed at several time points from ten years before to five years after the dementia diagnosis. In patients with FTD, the prevalence of epilepsy increased over time, and five years after the diagnosis approximately 11% had epilepsy. In addition to epilepsy diagnoses, medications used for epilepsy were more common in patients with FTD, which strengthens the reliability of the results.

Epilepsy might be left undiagnosed

Diagnosing epilepsy in patients with FTD may be challenging as the symptoms of the disease may resemble epileptic seizures. This may lead to underdiagnosis and delays in treatment. However, untreated epilepsy can significantly worsen patients' condition.

"Identifying epilepsy is important because its treatment can improve patients' functional capacity and quality of life. Knowledge about the association between epilepsy and FTD raises new research questions: do these diseases share some pathophysiological mechanisms and could some FTD symptoms be caused by alterations in the specific electrical systems of the brain," says the project's principal investigator, Associate Professor and Director of UEF Brain Research Unit Eino Solje.

An extensive research project brings together different fields of science

The recently published study is part of an extensive project that combines exceptionally extensive real-life patient data with different kinds of unique registers. The project involves a strong cooperation between the University of Oulu and the University of Eastern Finland as well as different fields of science, including between researchers in the fields of medicine and law. Kuopio University Hospital and Oulu University Hospital are part of the international European Reference Network EpiCARE and recognised centres in the field of epilepsy treatment and research.

Researchers at Swansea University have discovered that baboons walk in lines, not for safety or strategy, but simply to stay close to their friends.

Baboons often travel in structured line formations known as 'progressions' as they move through their home range. Previous studies offered conflicting explanations for this behavior. Some proposed that the order was random, while others argued that baboons strategically positioned themselves, with vulnerable individuals walking in the center to reduce their risk of attack.

Now, using high-resolution GPS tracking, researchers from Swansea University have re-examined this behavior in a group of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) on South Africa's Cape Peninsula. Their findings, published in the journal Behavioral Ecology, reveal that baboon movement patterns are driven by social bonds rather than survival strategies.

The team analysed 78 travel progressions over 36 days and showed that the order in which the individual baboons travelled were not random.

The researchers tested four potential explanations for the baboon progression order:

After analysing the data, the researchers found that the baboons' movement patterns were driven solely by their social relationships.

Dr Andrew King, Associate Professor at Swansea University said: "Surprisingly, the consistent order we see for the baboons we studied isn't about avoiding danger like we see in prey animals when they position themselves in the middle of their social group, or for better access to food or water like we see in like we see in the movements of plains zebra. Instead, it's driven by who they're socially bonded with. They simply move with their friends, and this produces a consistent order.

"In the baboon group we studied, the more socially connected, higher-ranking individuals usually walk in the middle of the group, while lower-ranking baboons are often out in front or at the rear. During these group movements -- like heading to a familiar sleeping spot -- it's likely that the group already knows where they're going. So, the baboons at the front aren't really leading; they're just out ahead."

This finding introduces the concept of a 'social spandrel'. In buildings, spandrels are the triangular spaces that emerge as by-products when arches are placed side by side. In biology, a spandrel refers to a trait that arises not because it was directly selected for, but as a side effect of something else. In this case, the consistent travel patterns among baboons emerge naturally from their social affiliations with each other, and not as an evolved strategy for safety or success.

Marco Fele, the study's lead author and PhD student at Swansea University, said: "We know that strong social bonds are important for baboons -- they're linked to longer lives and greater reproductive success. But in this context, those bonds aren't serving a specific purpose. The travel order we see is simply a by-product of those relationships, not a strategy with immediate benefits. Our study highlights the potential for these kinds of spandrels in collective animal behaviour."

Metrics details

Caloric restriction and methionine restriction-driven enhanced lifespan and healthspan induces ‘browning' of white adipose tissue, a metabolic response that increases heat production to defend core body temperature. However, how specific dietary amino acids control adipose thermogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified that weight loss induced by caloric restriction in humans reduces thiol-containing sulfur amino acid cysteine in white adipose tissue. Systemic cysteine depletion in mice causes lethal weight loss with increased fat utilization and browning of adipocytes that is rescued upon restoration of cysteine in diet. Mechanistically, cysteine-restriction-induced adipose browning and weight loss requires sympathetic nervous system-derived noradrenaline signalling via β3-adrenergic-receptors that is independent of FGF21 and UCP1. In obese mice, cysteine deprivation induced rapid adipose browning, increased energy expenditure leading to 30% weight loss and reversed metabolic inflammation. These findings establish that cysteine is essential for organismal metabolism as removal of cysteine in the host triggers adipose browning and rapid weight loss.

The Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE-II) clinical trial in healthy adults demonstrated that a simple 14% reduction of calories for 2 years without specific dietary prescription to alter macronutrient intake or meal timings can reprogramme the immunometabolic axis to promote healthspan1,2,3. Thus, harnessing the pathways engaged by caloric restriction (CR) in humans may expand the current armament of therapeutics against metabolic and immune dysfunction. Induction of negative energy balance and resultant activation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by CR is thought to underlie some of its beneficial effects on healthspan1. However, it has also been suggested that CR-induced metabolic effects may be due to decreased protein intake in food-restricted animal models4,5. Adding back individual amino acids to calorie-restricted Drosophila abolished the longevity effects, and traced to the limitation of methionine, an important node for lifespan extension5. Indeed, methionine restriction (MR) in rodents increases lifespan6 with enhanced insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue thermogenesis and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation7. Surprisingly, in long-lived Drosophila fed an MR diet, adding back methionine did not rescue the pro-longevity effect of diet, and it was hypothesized that activation of the methionine cycle may impact longevity5. Commercial MR diets contain 0.17% methionine compared with normal levels of 0.86%, but notably, the MR diets also lack cystine8,9, another sulfur-containing amino acid (SAA), which is required for protein synthesis, including synthesis of glutathione, taurine, CoA and iron–sulfur clusters10,11. Of note, in rats, MR-induced anti-adiposity and pro-metabolic effects, including reduction of leptin, insulin, IGF1 and elevation of adiponectin, were reversed when animals were supplemented with cysteine in the diet12. Furthermore, cysteine supplementation in MR rats did not restore low methionine, suggesting no increase in the methionine cycle12, where homocysteine is converted into methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT)10. The existence of the trans-sulfuration pathway (TSP) in mammals indicates that in case of dietary cysteine scarcity, the host shuttles homocysteine from the methionine cycle via the production of cystathionine, which is then hydrolysed into cysteine by the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH)10,13. Cysteine is an ancient molecule that evolved to allow early life to transition from anoxic hydrothermal vents into oxidizing cooler environment14,15. Thus, cysteine, the only thiol-containing proteinogenic amino acid, is essential for disulfide bond formation and redox signalling, including nucleophilic catalysis10,13. It remains unclear whether cysteine specifically controls organismal metabolism and whether sustained CR in healthy humans can help understand the fundamental relationship between energy balance and SAA homeostasis pathways that converge to improve healthspan and lifespan.

Adipose tissue regulates organismal metabolism by orchestrating inter-organ communication required for healthy longevity. To study the mechanisms that drive CR's beneficial effects on human metabolism, we conducted an unbiased metabolomics analysis of the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SFAT) of participants in the CALERIE-II trial at baseline and 1 year after 15% achieved CR and weight loss1,2,3. The partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLSDA) of abdominal SFAT biopsies revealed that 1 year of mild sustained CR substantially altered the adipose tissue metabolome (Fig. 1a). The unbiased metabolite sets enrichment analyses demonstrated significant increases in cysteine, methionine and taurine metabolism, which indicates rewiring of cysteine metabolism (Fig. 1b,c). Further analyses of our previously reported RNA sequencing data of humans that underwent CR1,2. revealed that compared to baseline, 1 and 2 years of CR in humans increased the adipose expression of CTH (Fig. 1d) with a concomitant reduction in the expression of BHMT (Fig. 1e). These data suggest that rewiring of cysteine metabolism may involve reduction in methionine cycle and changes in trans-sulfuration pathway metabolites (Fig. 1c). Notably, previous studies have found that long-lived rodents upregulate metabolites in TSP that generates cysteine from methionine16,17. Consistent with our findings in humans that underwent CR, data from multiple lifespan-extending interventions in rodents identified upregulation of CTH as a common signature or potential biomarker of longevity18.

Source data

Metabolomic analyses revealed that despite an increase in CTH expression post-CR, adipose cysteine levels were significantly reduced upon CR (Fig. 1f) with no change in homocysteine and cystathionine (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Consistent with the reduced expression of BHMT in methionine cycle, there was a decline in concentration of dimethylglycine (DMG) (Fig. 1f). CR caused a reduction in cysteine derived metabolites, γ-glutamyl–cysteine (γ-Glu–Cys), glutathione (GSH) and cysteinyl glycine (Cys–Gly) (Fig. 1g). Collectively, these results suggests that food restriction that resulted in 15% CR in humans reduces enzymes and metabolites that feed into methionine cycle and lowers cysteine (Fig. 1c).

Cysteine is thought to be biochemically irreplaceable because methionine, the other sole proteinogenic SAA, lacks a thiol group and hence cannot form complexes with metals to control redox chemistry19. To determine whether cysteine is required for survival and organismal metabolism, we created a loss of function model where cysteine becomes an essential amino acid requiring acquisition from the diet by deletion of CTH (Cth−/− mice) (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Cysteine deficiency was thus induced by feeding adult Cth−/− mice a custom amino acid diet that only lacks cystine (cystine-free (CysF) diet), whereas control mice were fed an isocaloric diet that contained cystine (CTRL diet) (Fig. 1h). Utilizing this model, we found that mice with cysteine deficiency rapidly lost ~25–30% body weight within 1 week compared to littermate Cth+/+ mice fed a CysF diet or Cth−/− fed a control diet (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Upon clinical examination of the cysteine-deficient mice, 30% weight loss is considered a moribund state that required euthanasia. The weight loss in mice lacking CTH and cystine in the diet was associated with significant fat mass loss relative to lean mass (Extended Data Fig. 1d) in cysteine-deficient animals. Pair feeding of cystine depleted diet fed animals produced similar weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 1e). This rapid weight loss was not due to malaise or behavioural alteration, as Cth−/−CysF mice displayed normal activity and a slight reduction in food intake in the first 2 days after CysF diet switch that was not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 1f and link of video file of cage activity). The Cth-deficient mice on the control diet were indistinguishable from control littermates in parameters indicative of health, they displayed higher nest building and no change in grip strength, gait, ledge test, hindlimb clasping and displayed no clinical kyphosis (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). Furthermore, compared with Cth−/− mice on control diet, the analyses of liver, heart, lungs and kidneys of Cth−/−CysF mice did not reveal pathological lesions indicative of tissue dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Notably, restoration of up to 75% cystine levels in the diet of Cth−/− CysF mice that were undergoing weight loss was sufficient to completely rescue the body weight over three weight-loss cysteine-depletion cycles, demonstrating the specificity and essentiality of cysteine for the organism (Fig. 1j).

To identify changes in metabolites upon cysteine-deprivation-induced fat mass loss, we conducted serum and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SFAT) metabolomics analyses (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Compared with Cth-deficient mice fed a normal diet, the Cth−/−CysF mice had reduced cystine levels, suggesting that cysteine deficiency is maintained by a reduction in systemic cystine levels (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Cysteine depletion also elevated the cystathionine and l-serine levels, compared to control diet fed animals (Fig. 1k). Other SAA metabolites such as methionine, homocysteine (HCys) and glutamic acid were not significantly changed (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Taurine levels in the Cth-deficient mice on a cystine-free diet also did not change compared with control animals. Notably, the γ-glutamyl peptide analogues of cysteine and GSH such as 2-aminobutyric acid (2AB) and ophthalmic acid (OA or γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyryl-glycine) were increased in the serum of cysteine-deficient mice (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Notably, in subcutaneous and brown adipose (BAT) depots and in liver, cysteine deficiency induces total glutathione (GSH) and oxidized GSH (GSSG) depletion (Fig. 1m,n and Extended Data Fig. 2b,d).The increase in γ-glutamyl peptides (2AB and OA) in cysteine-limiting conditions in vivo is consistent with studies that show that GCLC can synthesize γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyryl-glycine in a GSH-independent manner and prevents ferroptosis by lowering glutamate generated oxidative stress20. OA is a GSH analogue in which the cysteine group is replaced by l-2-aminobutyrate (2AB). On a normal cysteine-replete diet, 2AB is produced from 2-oxobutyrate (2OB) and glutamate in the presence of aminotransferases21. Thus, the increase in 2AB despite the removal of cystine in diet could be due to an alternative pathway of deamination of threonine into 2AB22. Indeed, l-threonine levels are increased upon cysteine depletion in mice (Fig. 1n). Previous studies found that GSH can inhibit glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC)23,24 regulating its production by a feedback mechanism. Thus, the removal of cysteine and reduction of GSH may release this disinhibition (Fig. 1m). Consistent with this hypothesis and elevated OA levels, Gclc and Gss expression were increased in cysteine-starved mice (Fig. 1o). The increased OA production versus GSH production reveals adaptive changes induced by systemic cysteine deficiency. Cysteine is required for protein synthesis. However, in mice where cysteine is depleted for 5 days, protein synthesis was not impaired in subcutaneous, visceral, brown adipose depots and in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Cysteine is also required for Fe–S clusters21,25. The RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of genes involved in Fe–S cluster assembly, including Bola3, was unimpaired or increased during cysteine depletion25 (Fig. 1p and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Consistent with the association between increased Bola3 and adipose browning in a cysteine-deficient state, adipose-specific deletion of Bola3 decreases energy expenditure (EE) and increases adiposity in mice upon aging26. Upon short-term cysteine starvation, Fe–S clusters are preserved in adipose depots. Additionally, cysteine is crucial for coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis. We observed a significant reduction in CoA levels in BAT and liver upon cysteine starvation (Fig. 1q). The in vivo spin trapping and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed that cysteine deficiency significantly increased lipid-derived radicals in BAT with undetectable signals in white adipose tissue (WAT) (Fig. 1r and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Also, given aconitase is regulated by reversible oxidation of (4Fe–4S)2+ and cysteine residues, depletion of cysteine also reduced aconitase activity in SFAT with no change in BAT (Fig. 1s). Together, these data demonstrate that removing cysteine causes lethal weight loss and induces adaptive changes in organismal metabolism, including upregulation of Gclc, elevated γ-glutamyl peptides with depletion of CoA and GSH (Fig. 1l,m,q and Extended Data Fig. 2d).

The decrease in fat mass during cysteine deficiency is driven by loss of all major fat depots including subcutaneous fat (SFAT), visceral epididymal/ovarian adipose fat (VFAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Histological analyses revealed that this reduction in adipose tissue size is associated with transformation of white adipose depots into a BAT-like appearance, with the formation of multilocular adipocytes, enlarged nuclei, and high UCP1 expression, a phenomenon known as ‘browning' that increases thermogenesis27,28 (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Of note, the SFAT browning in cysteine-deficient mice was reduced upon cystine-restoration in diet (Fig. 2b). Similar response was observed in visceral fat (VFAT) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Consistent with the browning of SFAT, the cysteine-deficient animals showed significantly increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (Fig. 2c) and thermogenic marker genes (Fig. 2d). The UCP1 and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) induction upon cysteine deficiency in adipose tissue was reversed by cysteine repletion (Fig. 2c). Consistent with 30% weight loss at day 5, the glycerol concentrations were depleted in the sera of cysteine-deficient mice and were restored by cysteine-repletion-induced weight regain (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The differentiation of Cth-deficient preadipocytes to mature adipocytes and subsequent exposure to cysteine-free culture conditions did not affect their thermogenic genes or UCP1, suggesting that a non-cell autonomous mechanism may control adipocyte browning (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

We next investigated whether changes in energy absorption, energy intake or EE contribute to cysteine-depletion-induced weight loss. Analysis of energy absorption by faecal bomb calorimetry revealed no significant difference in control and cysteine-deficient mice (Fig. 2e). Moreover, although the cumulative food intake over 5 days of weight loss was not statistically different (Fig. 2f), the cumulative food intake in the first 2 days (Extended Data Fig. 3e) after switching to CysF diet was lower (P < 0.05), which may contribute to early weight loss. Calculation of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or representation of the data as regression between EE and body mass, demonstrated that EE was increased in cysteine-deprived animals during the dark cycle (Fig. 2g) and not in the light cycle (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g). In addition, there was no difference in locomotor activity between control or cysteine-deficient mice (Extended Data Fig. 3h), suggesting that cysteine depletion increases EE. Of note, the increase in EE was supported by increased fat utilization, as the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in cysteine-deprived animals was significantly reduced (Extended Data Fig. 3i,j).

We next determined the specificity of cysteine on mechanisms that may contribute to rapid weight loss. Weight regain after cysteine repletion substantially reversed adipose browning (Fig. 2b,h and Extended Data Fig. 3b) and normalized the glycerol, ATGL and UCP1 levels in adipose tissue. (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c). Furthermore, replacement of single amino acid cysteine, also reversed the cysteine-starvation-driven reduction in RER, suggesting restoration of organismal metabolism to normal carbohydrate utilization instead of fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 2i). Of note, cysteine repletion significantly increased food intake for the first two days, suggesting that animals can sense cystine in diet and compensate via hyperphagia to restore bodyweight setpoint (Fig. 2j). The EE upon cysteine replacement was not significantly different during weight rebound (Fig. 2k). These data suggest that cysteine replacement can reverse weight loss by mechanisms that involve reduced adipose browning and decreased fat utilization while change in EE alone does not account for rapid weight restoration.

We conducted the RNA sequencing of the major adipose depots to investigate the mechanisms that control adipose tissue browning and associated remodelling. As displayed by the heatmap, cysteine deficiency profoundly altered the transcriptome of adipose tissue (Extended Data Fig. 3k). Gene set enrichment analysis comparing Cth−/− CTRL and Cth−/− CysF identified that the top downregulated pathways were involved in the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, highlighting the broad remodelling of the adipose tissue (Extended Data Fig. 3l). In addition, multiple metabolic pathways seemed to be regulated by cysteine deficiency within the SFAT with ‘respiratory electron transport chain and heat production' as the top pathway induced during cysteine deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3l). Indeed, numerous genes identified by the ‘thermogenesis' Gene Ontology term pathway such as Ucp1, Cidea, Cox7a1, Cox8b, Dio2, Eva1, Pgc1, Elovl3 and Slc27a2, were differentially expressed comparing Cth+/+ CysF and Cth−/− CysF in the SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 3m). These results demonstrate that cysteine depletion activates the thermogenic transcriptional programme.

To investigate the cellular basis of adipose tissue remodelling during cysteine deficiency, we isolated the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) by enzymatic digestion and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of SFAT. We isolated SVF cells from Cth+/+ and Cth−/− fed CTRL or CysF diet with each sample pooled from four animals (Extended Data Fig. 4a). A total of 4,666 cells in Cth+/+ CTRL; 5,658 cells in Cth+/+ CysF; 4,756 cells in Cth−/− CTRL; and 3,786 cells in Cth−/− CysF were analysed for scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Consistent with previous results29,30, the unbiased clustering revealed 15 distinct cell populations including αβ T cells, γδ T cells, ILC2s and natural killer (NK) T cells, B cells, reticulocytes, mesothelial-like cells, Schwann cells and several myeloid clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4b–d). Comparison of Cth−/− CysF with other groups revealed dramatic changes in cellular composition (Fig. 2l). Particularly, loss of clusters 0, 1 and 2 were apparent upon cysteine deficiency (Fig. 2l). Of note, these clusters contained the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes induced by β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316243 (ref. 31) (Extended Data Fig. 4e), highlighting the potential role of sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-derived noradrenaline (NA) in regulating the effects of cysteine deficiency. By expression of Pdgfra, we identified these clusters as enriched for adipocyte progenitors (Fig. 2m). We conducted a pseudotime analysis to place these clusters on a trajectory and illuminate their cell lineage. Trajectory analysis based on pseudotime suggested that cluster 2 may differentiate into two separate preadipocyte clusters, clusters 0 and 1 (Fig. 2m). Cth−/− CysF animals proportionally lost clusters 0 and 1, while relatively maintaining cluster 2 compared with the other groups (Fig. 2m), suggesting that more differentiated preadipocytes are mobilized during cysteine deficiency. Indeed, cluster 2 expressed Dpp4, an early progenitor marker that has been shown to give rise to different committed preadipoctyes32 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Cluster 0 was enriched for both Icam1 and F3, which are expressed by committed adipogenic and antiadipogenic preadipocytes, respectively29,32 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Cd9, a fibrogenic marker in preadipocytes31,33, along with the collagen gene, Col5a3, were broadly expressed across clusters 0 and 1, and was specifically lost by day 4 of inducing cysteine deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). The loss of these preadipocyte clusters were orthogonally validated by FACS (Extended Data Fig. 4h). We next sought to identify beige/brown adipocyte precursors in our scRNA-seq dataset to understand whether there was an increased commitment towards brown adipocytes. Clearly, Tagln or Sm22, which has been previously described in beige adipocytes34,35, is specifically expressed by a subset of cells in cluster 1 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Of note, these Tagln-expressing cells are lost with cysteine deficiency (Fig. 2l). Given the strong browning phenotype observed on day 6, it is possible that these cells become mobilized and differentiate early on during cysteine deficiency, leading to the absence of these cells as mature adipocytes are not captured within the SVF. Indeed, when we performed pathways analysis on cluster1, comparing gene expression of Cth−/− CysF with Cth−/− CTRL, we found that one of the top upregulated pathways was ‘adipogenesis' (Extended Data Fig. 4i). Furthermore, examination of the expression of stem associated markers and mature adipocyte markers in the adipocyte progenitor clusters revealed a clear downregulation of stem markers and an increase in mature adipocyte markers, suggesting that cysteine deficiency was driving the maturation of progenitor cells (Fig. 2m and Extended Data Fig. 4j). However, given the robust transformation of the adipose tissue during cysteine deficiency towards browning, it is unlikely that mobilization of brown precursors alone is mediating this response. Previous studies have found that in certain models, beige adipocytes can originate from pre-existing white adipocytes, in addition to de novo adipogenesis36. The potential role of cysteine in the trans-differentiation of mature white adipocytes into brown-like adipocytes needs to be further examined using future lineage-tracking studies.

To determine the mechanism of adipose thermogenesis caused by cysteine starvation, we next investigated the processes upstream of increased fatty acid oxidation. We measured the lipolysis regulators, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (pHSL) and ATGL and found that cysteine deficiency increased ATGL expression without consistently affecting pHSL levels (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ATGL preferentially catalysers the first step of triglyceride hydrolysis, whereas the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) has a much broader range of substrates with a preference for diacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters37. Given a dramatic browning response in WAT post-cysteine deficiency, the increased ATGL is consistent with previous work that shows BAT relies heavily on the action of ATGL to mobilize lipid substrates for thermogenesis38. This is further supported by a decrease in most lipid species, particularly triglycerides and diacylglycerol in the BAT of cysteine-deficient mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Considering dramatic adipose tissue browning and elevated UCP1 expression upon cysteine starvation, we next sought to investigate whether this is a homeostatic response to defend core body temperature (CBT) or whether temperature setpoint is perturbed to causes hyperthermia. We measured CBT utilizing loggers surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity in Cth−/− mice on CTRL or CysF diet over 6 days when animals lose weight. Of note, despite conversion of WAT into brown-like thermogenic fat, the CBT was not different between control and cysteine-deficient mice (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). These data suggest that either cysteine- may signal the host to defend CBT within tight normal physiological range or any metabolic heat that is generated is dissipated due to the animal housing in the sub-thermoneutral temperature. To confirm adipose thermogenesis in vivo, we utilized a highly sensitive and specific magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method called biosensor imaging of redundant deviation in shifts (BIRDS)39 to determine the temperature of BAT in Cth+/+ and Cth−/− animals after 6 days of CysF diet. This method relies on measuring the chemical shift of the four nonexchangeable methyl groups from an exogenous contrast agent, TmDOTMA, which has a high-temperature sensitivity (0.7 ppm per °C). The TmDOTMA− methyl resonance has ultrafast relaxation times (<5 ms), allowing high signal-to-noise ratio by rapid repetition for superior signal averaging39. The temperature was calculated from the chemical shift of the TmDOTMA− methyl resonance according to (equation (1) and Methods). Compared to cysteine-replete animals, the in vivo local temperature in BAT of cysteine-deficient mice was significantly greater than surrounding tissue (Fig. 3c,d), suggesting increased thermogenesis.

Changes in nutritional stress induced by CR, MR or low-protein diets upregulate the expression of FGF21, which, when overexpressed, increases lifespan and also upregulates EE40,41. The induction of cysteine deficiency in Cth-deficient mice caused a dramatic increase in the FGF21 concentration in blood (Fig. 3e) and Fgf21 expression in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 5f), which was reversed by cysteine-repletion-induced weight restoration (Fig. 3e). Similar to FGF21, the hormone GDF15, can also be induced by cellular or nutritional stress-mediated signalling42. Cysteine depletion at day 4 after weight loss significantly increased GDF15, which was not restored after cysteine-repletion-induced weight regain (Fig. 3f). Given the cysteine-repleted diet switch increases food intake, the higher GDF15 levels during weight rebound are likely insufficient to cause food aversion. Notably, recent studies suggest elevated endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress in Bhmt−/− mice with reduced methionine cycle, is associated with increased FGF21 and adipose browning43. Cysteine deficiency led to induction of ER-stress proteins CHOP, calnexin, IRE1α and BIP (Fig. 3g). However, deletion of CHOP in cysteine-starved Cth−/− mice did not rescue weight loss (Fig. 3h) nor did it alter the FGF21 and GDF15 serum levels (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h) demonstrating that induction of the CHOP-dependent ER-stress response does not drive cysteine's metabolic and neuroendocrine effect.

Given that cysteine specifically regulated FGF21 during weight loss and regain (Fig. 3e), we generated Fgf21−/−Cth−/− double knockout (DKO) mice to test whether FGF21 controls adipose browning and weight loss in cysteine-starved mice. In the absence of FGF21, cysteine deficiency-induced weight loss and reduction in adiposity in Cth−/− mice were blunted, but the weight-loss trajectory continued and was not rescued (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 5i). The Fgf21−/−Cth−/− DKO mice had lower EE compared to Cth−/− mice on the CysF diet (Fig. 3j). However, the RER was not different, indicating that Fgf21−/−Cth−/− mice still substantially utilized fat as an energy source (Extended Data Fig. 5j). This was supported by maintenance of lipolysis signalling observed by levels of pHSL and ATGL in Cth−/− mice, but reduced UCP1 protein and mRNA expression in WAT of Fgf21−/−Cth−/− (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 5k). Of note, the WAT of Fgf21−/−Cth−/− DKO mice maintained classical multilocular browning characteristics (Fig. 3l) suggesting that FGF21 is not required for adipose browning. These results suggest that FGF21 is partially required for weight loss but does not mediate lipid mobilization or adipose browning caused by cysteine deficiency.

Cysteine deprivation revealed a metabolic crisis that may signal the host to activate thermogenic mechanisms. However, across animal vivarium, including ours, mice are housed at sub-thermoneutral 20 °C temperatures and are constantly under thermogenic stress due to slight cold challenge28. To further confirm that mice were indeed inducing thermogenesis to defend CBT, we housed cysteine-deficient animals at 30 °C thermoneutrality. The cysteine deficiency in Cth−/− mice housed at 30 °C also led to similar weight loss as 20 °C with significant browning of adipose tissue (Fig. 3m,n and Extended Data Fig. 5l). The degree of browning and gene expression of Ucp1 and Elovl3 in CysF Cth-deficient mice at thermoneutrality were relatively lower than inductions observed at 20 °C (Fig. 3o). Furthermore, expression of genes involved with lipid regulation and browning such as Prdm16, Ppargc1a, Ppara, Pparg and Cpt1 (Fig. 3p) were significantly increased in SFAT, suggesting that even at thermoneutral temperatures, Cth−/− CysF-fed mice activate fat metabolism and have increased thermogenesis caused by cysteine deficiency. In addition, compared to controls, the cysteine-deficient mice at thermoneutrality retained higher Ucp1 expression in BAT (Extended Data Fig. 5m). Together, cysteine-depletion-induced weight loss and adipose browning are maintained at thermoneutrality.

The liver is believed to be the primary organ responsible for maintaining systemic cysteine homeostasis10,13. Immunoblot analyses confirmed the highest CTH expression in the liver, followed by the kidney, thymus and adipose tissue (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Given that CR in humans lowers cysteine levels in adipose tissue; we generated adipocyte- and hepatocyte-specific Cth-deficient mice to explore the cell-type-specific mechanism of cysteine in weight loss (Fig. 4a–h). As expected, liver-specific deletion of Cth did not alter CTH expression in the kidney and adipose-specific ablation of Cth maintained the expression in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Neither liver- nor adipose-specific deletion of Cth led to a reduction in serum cysteine levels (Fig. 4c,d,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d) or caused fat mass loss when cysteine was restricted in the diet (Fig. 4e,f).

Further liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses of sera from hepatocyte-specific Cth-deficient mice maintained on CysF diet showed no changes in cystathionine, γ-glutamyl-dipeptides, cysteine or cystine (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with low CTH activity, livers of the CysF-fed mice (Alb-Cre:Cthf/f, CysF) had lower levels of cysteine, cystathionine, S-adenosyl homocysteine, 2AB and ophthalmate (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g and Supplementary Table 4). Of note, the levels of cystathionine and cysteine/cystine in subcutaneous adipose tissue of liver-specific Cth-deficient mice were unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i and Supplementary Table 5). Consistent with these data, no change in serum cysteine/cystine were detected in adipose tissue specific Cth−/− mice that had no weight loss on a cysteine-free diet (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 6j and Supplementary Table 6). The TSP metabolites can potentially be generated by the gut microbiota19. The Cth−/− animals co-housed together with Cth+/+ mice still maintained weight loss when fed a CysF diet, suggesting that microbiota derived metabolites do not account for the weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 6k). These results demonstrates that Cth across multiple tissues may defend systemic cysteine pool to prevent uncontrolled thermogenesis and death when cysteine content is low in diet.

Given that UCP1 is a canonical regulator of non-shivering adipose thermogenesis44,45 and as cysteine elimination induced UCP1 expression in WAT, we next deleted UCP1 in cysteine-deficient mice to determine its role in adipose browning. Notably, we found that Cth−/−Ucp1−/− double knockout (DKO) mice had equivalent food intake (Extended Data Fig. 6l), lost weight at a similar rate to its Cth−/− littermates on a CysF diet and displayed similar browning-like features with multilocular adipocytes (Fig. 4i,j). The ablation of UCP1 in cysteine-deficient mice lowered EE during dark and light cycles (Fig. 4k,l) but did not affect the CBT (Fig. 4m). Despite similar body weight loss and browning phenotype, Cth−/− and Cth−/−Ucp1−/− DKO mice show significant differences in the interaction between EE and body weight (Fig. 4l). Therefore, UCP1 depletion and other parameters such as body composition may account for this significant difference in the correlative trend between EE and body weight. The lack of UCP1 in Cth-deficient mice undergoing cysteine starvation displayed elevated ATGL and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, suggesting increased lipolytic signalling (Fig. 4n,o). Despite lack of UCP1, gene expression indicative of the thermogenic programme, such as Ppargc1, Cidea and Cpt1 are significantly increased in Cth−/−Ucp1−/− DKO mice compared to Cth−/− in the BAT after 6 days of CysF diet (Fig. 4p). Furthermore, gene expression of other mediators of the thermogenic genes such as Acadm, Cox7a1, Elovl3 and Slc27a2 are also significantly increased in Cth−/−Ucp1−/− DKO mice compared to Cth−/− animals fed cysteine-restricted diet (Fig. 4p). UCP1-independent thermogenesis has been reported previously46. The futile creatine cycle is proposed to regulate UCP1-independent thermogenesis47. Compared to control animals, the creatine cycle genes Ckb and Alpl were not significantly different in SFAT of cysteine-deficient animals (Extended Data Fig. 6m). The creatine synthesis genes, Gatm and Gamt were significantly reduced with cysteine deficiency in SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6m). The expression of one of the creatine kinases that utilizes ATP, Ckmt2 and the transporter for creatine, Slc6a8 were also not differentially regulated in SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6m). Notably, Slc6a8, Ckmt1 and Ckmt2 expression was increased in BAT of Cth−/−Ucp1−/− animals compared to cysteine-deficient animals (Fig. 4q), suggesting a potential role of these effectors in BAT thermogenesis in the cysteine-starvation model.

The alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic regulatory genes Atp2a2 and Ryr2 that control calcium cycling48 were not impacted by cysteine deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 6n). Similarly, Sarcolipin and Atp2a2, which can increase muscle driven thermogenesis49 were also not affected in skeletal muscle of Cth-deficient mice lacking cysteine (Extended Data Fig. 6o). The futile lipid cycle is also implicated in UCP1 independent thermogenesis50. Of note, Cth−/− mice on a CysF diet have significantly elevated expression of Dgat1, Pnpla2 and Gk with no change in Lipe in SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6p). The expression of these genes was also induced in absence of UCP1 in BAT and SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6q,r). However, absence of association between changes in gene expression of major UCP1 independent regulators does not rule out causal role of some of these mechanisms in cysteine-deprivation-driven adipose browning. These results suggest that systemic cysteine deficiency-induced thermogenesis depends mainly on an as-of-yet unknown non-canonical UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.

As cysteine-elimination-induced adipocyte browning is non-cell autonomous (Extended Data Fig. 3d), we evaluated upstream mechanisms that control cysteine-starvation-induced thermogenesis. We conducted an unbiased whole-brain activity mapping screen to determine the circuitry responsible for regulating the thermogenic induction. Using whole-brain immunolabelling and clearing tandem iDISCO+51, we mapped the differential expression of the immediate–early gene c-Fos (Fig. 5a). Subsequently, we quantified c-Fos positive cells across brain regions and registered them to the Allen Brain Atlas with CLEARMAP52. Notably, key components of the canonical thermogenesis circuitry (Fig. 5a–d) were significantly activated upon 5 days of exposure to a cysteine-free diet.

In brief, thermogenic signals seem to converge in the dorsal lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN), a critical hub that integrates inputs related to both environmental temperature changes and internal metabolic shifts53. From the LPBN, thermogenic signals are relayed to the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a key sensory integrator that regulates thermogenesis54,55. The MPOA then initiates a thermogenic response primarily through activation of the SNS. This response can be mediated by direct monosynaptic projections from the MPOA to premotor regions involved in sympathetic activation or through polysynaptic pathways involving the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) adjacent to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)56,57,58. All these regions were significantly activated (Fig. 5c,d). These findings support the role of the SNS in mediating cysteine-dependent thermogenesis. By activating this well-established thermogenic circuitry, cysteine deficiency induces a potent metabolic response, highlighting a critical mechanism by which systemic amino acid depletion can modulate EE and adipose browning. This underscores the broader physiological relevance of cysteine metabolism in energy homeostasis and thermoregulation.

Upstream of lipolysis, nonshivering thermogenesis is mainly activated by the SNS-derived adipose noradrenaline59. Mass-spectrometric analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue (Fig. 5e), including imaging mass spectrometry of BAT (Extended Data Fig. 7a) revealed that cysteine-starvation-induced browning is associated with increased NA concentrations. This was coupled with a significant reduction in NA-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase-a (Maoa) (Fig. 5f), without affecting catechol-o-methyl transferase (Comt), suggesting increased adipose NA bioavailability (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Finally, to test whether SNS-derived NA is required for adipose browning, the inhibition of β3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) by L748337 in Cth-deficient mice lacking cysteine-protected animals against weight loss (Fig. 5g), despite having a similar food intake (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Inhibition of β3-adrenergic signalling blunted adipose browning (Fig. 5h) and lowered Ucp1 (Fig. 5i), as well as lipolysis inducers pHSL and ATGL that are downstream of ADRB3 signalling (Fig. 5j,k). This was consistent with our unbiased RNA sequencing analyses that showed that cysteine-regulated adipose clusters contained the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes induced by β3-adrenergic receptor agonist (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Together our findings suggest that cysteine-depletion-induced browning is non-cell autonomous and lack of cysteine drives increased SNS activity leading to augmented ADRB3-mediated NA signalling that controls adipose browning to weight loss.

We next tested whether cysteine deficiency could be utilized to induce an adaptive thermogenic mechanism for fat mass reduction in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. The Cth−/− mice that had been fed HFD for 12 weeks were switched to an isocaloric HFD containing (HFD-CTRL) or lacking cystine (HFD-CysF). The Cth−/− mice fed a HFD-CysF diet were able to lose approximately 30% body weight within 1 week despite maintaining a high calorie intake (Fig. 6a). This weight loss was associated with major reductions in fat mass (Extended Data Fig. 7d). With weight loss, cysteine-deficient mice had reduced fasting glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 6b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7e) and increased EE (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Furthermore, cysteine deficiency in obese mice reduced RER suggesting higher fat utilization (Fig. 6e). Notably, immunohistological analysis of the white adipose depots demonstrated that cysteine deficiency induced browning even while on HFD with increased expression of UCP1 in SFAT and VFAT (Fig. 6f). Additionally, consistent with improvement of metabolic function in obesity, the gene expression of inflammasome components Il1b, Il18, Nlrp3, Casp1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Tnf were reduced in F4/80+CD11b+ adipose tissue macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (Fig. 6g) These results demonstrate that induction of cysteine deficiency can cause rapid weight loss in mouse model of diet-induced obesity, opening new avenues for future drug development for excess weight loss.

Adipose tissue regulates metabolism by orchestrating inter-organ communication required for healthy longevity60. Analyses of adipose tissue of humans that underwent moderate CR in free-living conditions have highlighted genes and pathways that link energy metabolism and inflammation to influence healthspan1,2. In rodents, restriction of calories up to 40% reduces CBT and induces browning of the adipose tissue of mice reared in sub-thermoneutral temperature61. The CR in humans upregulated the fatty acid oxidation and futile lipid cycling induced-thermogenic pathways but UCP1 was undetectable in adipose tissue of CALERIE-II participants1. Similarly, weight loss in obese humans is not associated with classical UCP1 adipose tissue browning62. This suggests that alternative UCP1-independent mechanisms maybe at play in human in response to CR. In this regard, reduction of CBT63 and increased FGF21 is a common link between CR and MR-induced adipose browning and increased longevity7,41,61. Our studies demonstrated that reduction of cysteine and subsequent rewiring of downstream cysteine metabolism is linked to adipose browning and weight loss.

Expression and activity of the TSP genes CBS and CTH increase when cysteine is low10. Indeed, during CR, the TSP is induced to defend against the depletion of cysteine levels. MR regimens that improve lifespan are also restricted or deficient in cysteine12, and it is unclear whether MR or cysteine restriction drives pro-longevity effects. Thus, to understand the metabolic requirement of dietary non-essential amino acid such as cysteine, a genetic mouse model is required that lacks Cth in conjunction with restriction of cysteine. Notably, previously reported Cth mutant mice originally generated on a 129SvEv mouse strain maintained on cysteine-replete normal chow diet were reported to display hypertension and motor dysfunction characteristic of neurodegenerative changes in corpus striatum64,65. Using this same model cysteine depletion in this global Cth-deficient mice also causes weight loss and adipose tissue browning together with decrease of CoA levels similar to our findings66. We also demonstrate that conditional deletion of Cth (on a pure C57/B6 background) in adipose tissue and liver is not sufficient to induces weight loss and cause adipose browning as other tissues compensate to maintain to systemic cysteine concentrations after cysteine elimination in the diet. Our data establish that systemic cysteine depletion drives adipose tissue thermogenesis without causing behavioural defects or pathological lesions.

While it is still unclear why cysteine deficiency triggers the activation of adipose browning, the mechanism of thermogenesis depends on upstream SNS-mediated sympathetic β3-adrenergic signalling and partially requires FGF21 and can be successfully maintained even in the absence of UCP1 and at thermoneutrality. Future studies of specific ablation of UCP1-independent thermogenic genes in Cth−/− mice on cysteine restriction are required to determine the causal downstream pathway that causes thermogenesis. The model of cysteine-deprivation-induced strong browning response may thus allow the discovery of an alternate UCP1-independent mechanism of adipose tissue thermogenesis.

In healthy humans undergoing CR, consistent with reduced cysteine, glutathione, a major redox regulator, was reduced in adipose tissue. The Cth-deficient mice on a cysteine-free diet show a decrease in CoA and GSH with a compensatory increase in Gclc, Gss and accumulation of γ-glutamyl-peptides. Despite increased oxidative stress, the adipose tissue histology, RNA sequencing and lipidomic analysis of BAT did not reveal overt ferroptosis in cysteine-depletion-induced weight loss. Future studies may reveal cysteine-dependent alternative protective mechanisms that control redox balance and ferroptosis while sustaining UCP1-independent thermogenesis.

Taken together, this study expands our understanding of pathways activated by pro-longevity dietary interventions that confer metabolic adaptation required to maintain tissue homeostasis. Thus, the manipulation of TSP activity to drive adipose tissue browning also has implications for developing interventions that control adiposity and promote longevity. In humans, restriction of methionine and cysteine increased FGF21 and caused a reduction in body weight with improvement of metabolic parameters67. Similar to our findings, the metabolic benefits of methionine and cysteine dietary restriction in humans were greater than MR alone67. Here, based on human dietary restriction studies and mouse models of cysteine deficiency, we demonstrate that cysteine is essential for organismal metabolism as its absence triggers adipose browning with progressive weight loss.

The participants in this study were part of the CALERIE Phase 2 study68, which was a multicentre, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial by recruitment of non-obese healthy individuals. Overall, 238 adults participated at three different locations: Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Washington University and Tufts University (NCT00427193, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov). Duke University served as a coordinating centre. Participants were randomly assigned to of 25% CR or ad libitum caloric intake for 2 years. CR group participants actually reached 14% of CR1,3. Men were between 21 and 50 years old and women were between 21 and 47 years old. Their body mass index was between 22.0 and 27.9 kg m–2 at the initial visit. Samples were collected at baseline, 1 year and 2 years of intervention. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy was performed on a portion of CR group participants and used for RNA sequencing and metabolomics in this study. All studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Pennington institutional review board with written informed consent from all participants.

All mice were on a C57BL/6J (B6) genetic background. Cth−/− mice (C57BL/6NTac-Cthtm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu/Ieg) were purchased from the European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository. Breeding these mice to Flipase transgenic mice from The Jackson Laboratories generated Cthfl/fl mice, which were crossed to Adipoq-cre and Albumin-cre, purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Ucp1−/− and CHOP−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories and crossed to Cth−/− mice. Fgf21−/− mice were kindly provided by S. Kliewer (UT Southwestern) as described previously40 and crossed to Cth−/− mice. All mice used in this study were housed in specific-pathogen-free facilities in ventilated cage racks that deliver HEPA-filtered air to each cage with free access to sterile water through a Hydropac system at Yale School of Medicine. Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard vivarium chow (Harlan 2018s), unless a special diet was provided, and housed under a 12-h light–dark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity conditions (approximately 22 °C and 60% humidity). Unless stated, male mice were used for the experiments, aged 3–5 months at the start of the experiment. All experiments and animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. Animals were either allocated to experimental groups depending on their genotype or randomly when working with the same genotype.

For cysteine-deficiency studies, mice were fed either a control diet (511387), CysF diet (510027), HFD-CTRL diet (511412) or HFD-CysF diet (511411) purchased from Dyets, for 6 days unless specified otherwise. For pair-feeding studies, mice were provided with either ad libitum or 2.22–2.27 g of diet daily.

Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and optionally frozen and stored at −80 °C. Samples were left on ice, vortexing every 10 min for 30 min. For tissue samples, snap-frozen tissues were ground by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies (and source) were diluted 1:1,000 and used to measure protein expression: β-actin (Cell Signalling 4967), pHSL p660 (Cell Signalling 4126), ATGL (Cell Signalling 2439S), UCP1 (Abcam ab10983), CTH (Novus H00001491-M03), tubulin (Abcam ab7291), HSL (Cell Signalling 4107), TH (Cell Signalling 2792), IRE1a (Cell Signalling 3294), Calnexin (Novus NB300-518), BiP (Cell Signalling 3177), CHOP (Cell Signalling 2895), HSP90 (Cell Signalling 4874), anti-puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich MABE343) and HSP40 (Cell Signalling 4868); followed by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted 1:5,000 (anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signalling 7074) or peroxidase AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-035-003)).

Cells or ground tissue (described above) were collected in STAT-60 (Tel-test). RNA from cells were extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy micro kits following the manufacturer's instructions. For tissue samples, RNA was extracted using Zymo mini kits following the manufacturer's instructions. During RNA extraction, DNA was digested using RNase free DNase set (QIAGEN). Synthesis of complementary DNA was performed using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using Power SYBR Green detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Light Cycler 480 II (Roche). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

Cth−/− HFD-CTRL and HFD-CysF mice were fasted 14 h before glucose tolerance test. Glucose was given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection based on body weight (0.4 g kg−1). Cth−/− CTRL and CysF mice were fasted for 4 h. Glucose was given by i.p. based on lean mass determined by EchoMRI (2 g kg−1 lean mass). Blood glucose levels were measured by handheld glucometer (Breeze, Bayer Health Care).

Adipose tissue was digested at 37 °C in HBSS (Life Technologies) + 0.1% collagenase I or II (Worthington Biochemicals). The SVF was collected by centrifugation, washed and filtered using 100-μm and 70-μm strainers. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then for surface markers, including anti-CD45-BV711 (BioLegend, 103147) or anti-CD45-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, 103114), anti-CD3-Perp-Cy5.5 (BioLegend, 100327), anti-B220-AF488 (BioLegend, 103225), anti-CD11b-BV711 (BioLegend, 101241), anti-F4/80-BV421 (BioLegend, 123132), anti-Ly6G-AF700 (BioLegend, 127622), anti-Siglec F-AF647 (BD, 562680), anti-CD24-PerCp-Cy5.5 (eBioscience, 45-0242-80), anti-F3-PE (R&D, FAB3178P), anti-CD31-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-0311-81), anti-Pdgfra-BV605 (BioLegend, 135916), anti-Dpp4-FITC (BioLegend, 137805) and anti-CD9-APC (BioLegend, 124813). Antibodies were diluted 1:200. Cells were fixed in 2% PFA. Samples were acquired on a custom LSR II or sorted with a FACSARIA cell sorter, using Diva software (v.8.0.1). Data were analysed in FlowJo (v.10.3).

For SVF, female Cth+/+ and Cth−/− mice were fed CTRL of CysF diet for 4 days. SFAT was collected, with lymph nodes removed, pooled and digested. Isolated cells were subjected to droplet-based 3′ end massively parallel scRNA-seq using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent kits as per manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics). The libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq3000 instrument (Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, barcode processing and single-cell 3′ counting was performed using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics). The Cell Ranger count was used to align samples to the reference genome (mm10), quantify reads, and filter reads with a quality score below 30. The Seurat package in R was used for subsequent analysis31. Cells with mitochondrial content greater than 0.05% were removed and data were normalized using a scaling factor of 10,000, and number of unique molecular identifiers (nUMI) was regressed with a negative binomial model. Principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed using the top 3,000 most variable genes and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) analysis was performed with the top 20 principal components. Clustering was performed using a resolution of 0.4. The highly variable genes were selected using the FindVariableFeatures function with mean >0.0125 or <3 and dispersion >0.5. These genes are used in performing the linear dimensionality reduction. PCA was performed before clustering and the first 20 principal components were used based on the ElbowPlot. Clustering was performed using the FindClusters function, which works on k-nearest neighbour graph model with granularity ranging 0.1–0.9 and selected 0.4 for the downstream clustering. For identifying the biomarkers for each cluster, we performed differential expression between each cluster to all other clusters, identifying positive markers for that cluster. To understand the trajectory of the adipocyte progenitors, we used Monocle2 to analyse scRNA-seq data of clusters 0, 1 and 2 (ref. 69).

Snap-frozen tissues were ground by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in STAT-60. RNA was extracted using Zymo mini kits. RNA was sequenced on a HiSeq2500. The quality of raw reads was assessed with FastQC. Raw reads were mapped to the GENCODE vM9 mouse reference genome (GENCODE) using STAR Aligner with the following options: –outFilterMultimapNmax 15 –outFilterMismatchNmax 6 –outSAMstrandField All –outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate –quantMode TranscriptomeSAM. The quality control of mapped reads was performed using in-house scripts that employ Picard tools. The list of rRNA genomic intervals that we used for this quality control was prepared on the basis of UCSC mm10 rRNA annotation file (UCSC) and GENCODE primary assembly annotation for vM9 (GENCODE). rRNA intervals from these two annotations were combined and merged to obtain the final list of rRNA intervals. These intervals were used for the calculation of the percentage of reads mapped to rRNA genomic loci. Strand specificity of the RNA-seq experiment was determined using an in-house script, on the basis of Picard mapping statistics. Expression quantification was performed using RSEM. For the assessment of expression of mitochondrial genes, we used all genes annotated on the mitochondrial chromosome in the GENCODE vM9 mouse reference genome. PCA was performed in R. For PCA, the donor effect was removed using the ComBat function from the sva R-package. Gene differential expression was calculated using DESeq2. Pathway analysis was conducted using fgsea (fast GSEA) R-package (fgsea) with the minimum of 15 and maximum of 500 genes in a pathway and with 1 million of permutations. For the pathway analysis, we used the Canonical Pathways from the MSigDB C2 pathway set (MSigDB1 and MSigDB2), v.6.1. The elimination of redundant significantly regulated pathways (adjusted P < 0.05) was carried out using an in-house Python script in the following way. We considered all ordered pairs of pathways, where the first pathway had normalized enrichment score equal to or greater than the second pathway. For each ordered pair of pathways, we analysed the leading gene sets of these pathways. The leading gene sets were obtained using fgsea. If at least one of the leading gene sets in a pair of pathways had more than 60% of genes in common with the other leading gene set, then we eliminated the second pathway in the pair.

Frozen tissues or serum samples, together with internal standard compounds (mentioned below), was subjected to sonication in 500 μl of ice-cold methanol. To this, an equal volume of ultrapure water (LC–MS grade, Wako) and 0.4 volume of chloroform were added. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 15,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was then filtered using an ultrafiltration tube (Ultrafree MC-PLHCC, Human Metabolome Technologies), and the filtrate was concentrated by nitrogen spraying (aluminium block bath with nitrogen gas spraying system, DTU-1BN/EN1-36, TAITEC). The concentrated filtrate was dissolved in 50 μl of ultrapure water and utilized for ion chromatography (IC)–MS and LC–MS/MS analysis. Methionine sulfone and 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid were employed as internal standards for cationic and anionic metabolites, respectively. The recovery rate (%) of the standards in each sample measurement was calculated to correct for the loss of endogenous metabolites during sample preparation.

Anionic metabolites were detected using an orbitrap-type MS (Q-Exactive focus; Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a high-performance IC system (ICS-5000+, Thermo Fisher Scientific) that allows for highly selective and sensitive metabolite quantification through IC separation and a Fourier transfer MS principle. The IC system included a modified Thermo Scientific Dionex AERS 500 anion electrolytic suppressor, which converted the potassium hydroxide gradient into pure water before the sample entered the mass spectrometer. Separation was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Dionex IonPac AS11-HC column with a particle size of 4 μm. The IC flow rate was 0.25 ml min−1, supplemented post-column with a makeup flow of 0.18 ml min−1 methanol. The potassium hydroxide gradient conditions for IC separation were as follows: from 1 mM to 100 mM (0–40 min), to 100 mM (40–50 min) and to 1 mM (50.1–60 min), with a column temperature of 30 °C. The Q-Exactive focus mass spectrometer was operated in the ESI-negative mode for all detections. A full mass scan (m/z 70–900) was performed at a resolution of 70,000. The automatic gain control target was set at 3 × 106 ions, and the maximum ion injection time was 100 ms. The source ionization parameters were optimized with a spray voltage of 3 kV, and other parameters were as follows: transfer temperature of 320 °C; S-Lens level of 50, heater temperature of 300 °C; sheath gas of 36 and Aux gas of 10.

Cationic metabolites were measured using LC–MS/MS. The LC–MS-8060 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu corporation) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source was employed to perform multiple reaction monitoring in positive and negative ESI modes. The samples were separated on a Discovery HS F5-3 column (2.1 mm internal diameter × 150 mm length, 3-μm particle, Sigma-Aldrich) using a step gradient of mobile phase A (0.1% formate) and mobile phase B (0.1% acetonitrile) with varying ratios: 100:0 (0–5 min), 75:25 (5–11 min), 65:35 (11–15 min), 5:95 (15–20 min) and 100:0 (20–25 min). The flow rate was set at 0.25 ml min−1 and the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C.

For low concentration monoamine measurements, extracted tissue metabolites by abovementioned protocol were injected with an autosampler (M-510, Eicom) into a HPLC unit (Eicom) coupled to an ECD (ECD-300, Eicom). The samples were resolved on the Eicompak SC-5ODS column (φ3.0 × 150 mm, Eicom), using an isocratic mobile phase (5 mg l−1 EDTA-2Na, 220 mg l−1 sodium 1-octanesulfonate in acetate/citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 3.5)/methanol (83:17, v/v)), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 and a column temperature of 25 °C. At the ECD, analytes were subjected to oxidation reactions within the ECD unit with WE-3G graphite electrode (applied potential is +750 mV against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Resulting chromatograms were analysed using the software EPC-300 (Eicom).

To extract total lipids, frozen tissues were mixed with 500 μl of 1-butanol/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 5 mM ammonium formate. The mixture was vortexed for 10 s, sonicated for 15 min in a sonic water bath and then centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 20 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 0.2-ml glass insert with a Teflon insert cap for LC ESI–MS analysis.

For lipidomic analysis, a Q-Exactive focus orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was connected to an HPLC system (Ultimate3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were separated on a Thermo Scientific Accucore C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 2.6 μm) using a step gradient of mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (2 mM ammonium formate in acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol/water, ratios of 10:88:2, v/v/v, with 0.02% formic acid). The gradient ratios used were 65:35 (0 min), 40:60 (0–4 min), 15:85 (4–12 min), 0:100 (12–21 min), 0:100 (21–24 min), 65:35 (24–24.1 min) and 100:0 (24.1–28 min) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1 and a column temperature of 35 °C. The Q-Exactive focus mass spectrometer operated in both positive and negative ESI modes. It performed a full mass scan (m/z 250–1,100), followed by three rapid data-dependent MS/MS scans, at resolutions of 70,000 and 17,500, respectively. The automatic gain control target was set at 1 × 106 ions, and the maximum ion injection time was 100 ms. The source ionization parameters included a spray voltage of 3 kV, transfer tube temperature of 285 °C, S-Lens level of 45, heater temperature of 370 °C, sheath gas at 60 and auxiliary gas at 20. The acquired data were analysed using LipidSearch software (Mitsui Knowledge Industry) for major phospholipids (PLs). The search parameters for LipidSearch software were as follows: precursor mass tolerance of 3 ppm, product mass tolerance of 7 ppm and m-score threshold of 3.

The tissue block was frozen and secured onto a disc using a cryoembedding medium (Super Cryoembedding Medium, SECTION-LAB), then equilibrated at −16 °C in cryostats (Leica Biosystems). Tissue sections, 8-µm thick, were cut and mounted onto conductive indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Matsunami Glass Industries). A solution of tetrafluoroborate salts of 2,4-diphenyl-pyrylium (DPP) (1.3 mg ml−1 in methanol) for on-tissue derivatization of monoamines and DHB-matrix (50 mg ml−1 in 80% ethanol) were manually sprayed onto the tissue using an airbrush (Procon Boy FWA platinum; Mr Hobby). The manual spray was performed at room temperature, applying 40 μl mm−2 with a distance of approximately 50 mm. The samples were analysed using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The raster scan pitch was set at 50 µm. Signals of noradrenaline-DPP (m/z 384 > 232) were monitored with a precursor ion isolation width of m/z 1.0 and a normalized collision energy of 45%. Ion images were reconstructed using ImageQuest v.1.1.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% PFA. Brains were then put through a 24 h post-fixing period, after which, immunolabelling and whole-brain clearing were performed according to previously established protocols. Antibodies used for c-Fos labelling were Synaptic Systems rabbit c-Fos 226008 (primary) and Alexa-Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (secondary), respectively. Fos labelling studies were next analysed using ClearMap52. For acquisition, cleared samples were imaged in a sagittal orientation (left lateral side up) on a light-sheet microscope (Miltenyi Blaze) equipped with a sCMOS camera and LVMI-Fluor ×4 objective lens equipped with a 6-mm working distance dipping cap. Inspector Microscope controller software was used. Samples were scanned in the 640 nm channel. Images were taken every 6 μm and reconstructed with ClearMap software52 for quantification or Imaris v.10.1 software for visualization. The 480-nm channel was used with a ×1.3 objective lens for autofluorescence.

Animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane, first at a rate of 2–3% and maintained at 0.5–2% in oxygen during surgery. Mice were kept on a heating pad throughout surgery. Mice were injected with buprenorphine and bupivacaine as pre-emptive analgesia. A small ventral incision of 1 cm was made after clipping hair and disinfection with betadine and 70% ethanol. DST nano-T temperature loggers (Star-Oddi) were placed in the peritoneal cavity, and abdominal muscle and skin were sutured closed. After surgery, mice were singly housed and provided with Meloxicam for 48 h. After 7 days, sutures were removed. Ten days after surgery, mice were started on CTRL or CysF diet, and loggers were removed for data collection after killing. Loggers were programmed to take temperature readings every 30 min.

The EE, RER, activity and food intake of mice were monitored using the TSE PhenoMaster System (v.3.0.3) Indirect Calorimetry System. Each mouse was housed in individual chambers for 3 days for acclimation and switched to experimental diet for 6 days. Each parameter was measured every 30 min. EE and RER were calculated based on the oxygen consumption (O2) and carbon dioxide production (CO2). Mouse activity was detected by infra-red sensors, and food intake and water consumption were measured via weight sensors on food and water dispensers located in the cage.

The parameters of body composition were measured in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI; Echo Medical Systems). The amount of fat mass, lean mass and free water were measured by the analysis. For the analysis, each mouse was placed in an acrylic tube with breathing holes and the tube was inserted in the MRI machine. The analysis per mouse takes approximately 90 s and automatically calculated numerical results were analysed.

Mice were acclimated in climate chambers (model 7000-10, Caron) at either 30 °C or 20 °C, with humidity maintained at 50% under a 12 h light–dark cycle. After 1 week acclimation, mice were switched to either CTRL or CysF diet for 6 days, while maintained in the climate chambers. Mice were handled daily to measure body weight.

Faeces were collected daily over the course of CTRL or CysF feeding. Samples were dried for 72 h. Faecal bomb calorimetry was performed at UT Southwestern Medical Center Metabolic Phenotyping Core using a Parr 6200 Isoperibol Calorimeter equipped with a 6510 Parr Water Handling.

After blood collection by cardiac puncture, samples were allowed to clot for 2 h. Serum was collected after centrifugation. FGF21 and GDF15 levels in the serum were measured by ELISA (R&D). Cysteine levels were determined by competitive EIA (LS-Bio). Glycerol levels were determined by colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Snap-frozen tissues were homogenized in PBS supplemented with EDTA and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were filtered through 10 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filters (Millipore). Total GSH and GSSG levels were determined by colorimetric assay (Cayman Chemical). Coenzyme A levels were measured by fluorometric assay (Abcam). Data were normalized to protein concentration, determined beforehand with colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad).

SUnSET assay was performed to assess protein synthesis70. Mice were injected with puromycin (Invivogen) (40 nmol g−1 body weight). Mice were killed 30 min after administration and tissues were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were processed for western blotting to assess incorporation of puromycin in newly synthesized proteins.

Mice were administered twice daily L748337 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (5 mg kg−1) by i.p. injection. Mice were weighed daily and assessed for their health.

Tissues were collected in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 5-μm thick sections. Tissues were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or stained for UCP1 (Abcam) and goat anti-rabbit HRP (DAKO) and developed for colour using Abcam DAB substrate kit.

The animals were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber and then kept at 2–3% during surgery. The animal was laid back on a microwaveable heating pad. Before incision, a single dose of bupivacaine was given for analgesia. A 1–2-cm midline incision was made on the neck to expose the jugular vein. Another small incision (<1 cm) was made at the back of the neck. A sterile polyurethane or silicone catheter with a metal guide was inserted from the back of the neck, where the vascular port was fixed to the jugular vein. Before implantation the port and the catheter were flushed with heparinized saline (25 IU ml−1). The jugular vein was catheterized toward the heart. The skin was closed with surgical sutures after application of triple antibiotic ointment and the vascular port was fixed. The duration of the surgical procedure was 15–20 min.

TmDOTMA− was purchased from Macrocyclics. Temperature mapping with BIRDS was performed on a 9.4T Bruker scanner. The respiration rate was monitored during the entire duration of the experiment. A 200 mM TmDOTMA− solution was infused at a rate of 60 to 80 µl h−1 for 1–2 h. The infusion rate was adjusted according to animal physiology. The T2-weighted MR images were acquired with a field of view of 23 × 23 mm2, 128 × 128 matrix, 23 slices of 0.5-mm thickness, TR = 3 s and TE = 9 ms. The extremely short T1 and T2 relaxation times (<5 ms) of the TmDOTMA− methyl group allowed ultrafast temperature mapping with BIRDS using 3D chemical shift imaging (CSI) acquisition with a short TR (10 ms) and wide bandwidths (±150 ppm). Temperature mapping with BIRDS was started immediately after detection of global MR signal of TmDOTMA− methyl group, at about 1 h after the start of the infusion. The CSI was acquired using a field of view of 23 × 15 × 23 mm3, 809 spherical encoding steps, 21 min acquisition and reconstructed to 23 × 15 × 23, with a voxel resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. Selective excitation of the TmDOTMA− methyl group was achieved using a single-band, 200-µs Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) RF pulse. The MR spectrum in each voxel was line broadened (200 Hz) and phased (zero-order) in MATLAB (MathWorks), and the corresponding temperature Tc was calculated from the chemical shift \({\delta }_{C{H}_{3}}\) of the TmDOTMA− methyl group according to

where δ0 = −103.0 ppm and the coefficients a0 = 34.45 ± 0.01, a1 = 1.460 ± 0.003 and a2 = 0.0152 ± 0.0009 were calculated from the linear least-squares fit of temperature as a function of chemical shift \({\delta }_{C{H}_{3}}\). Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t-test with two tails, with P < 0.05 used as a cutoff for significance.

POBN (α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone, Enzo) was used for spin trapping; POBN was dissolved in saline and administered i.p. at 500 mg kg−1 body weight. Tissue samples (VFAT, SFAT and BAT) were collected 45 min after injection, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until EPR measurements. Lipid extraction was performed using chloroform:methanol (2:1) (Folch extraction) as described previously71. All EPR spectra were recorded in a quartz flat cell using an X-band EMX plus EPR Spectroscope (parameters: 3,480 ± 80 G scan width, 105 receiver gain and 20 mW microwave power; time constant of 1,310 ms and conversion time of 655 ms).

Aconitase activity was measured with an Aconitase Assay kit (Cayman). Freshly collected SFAT and VFAT samples were measured at 500 μg total protein pe ml, and BAT samples were measured at 100 μg total protein per ml. All results were normalized to 500 μg ml−1 total protein concentration. The standard protocol provided with the kits was followed.

Stromal vascular fraction from visceral depots of Cth−/− was isolated as previously described. Cells were plated in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) and expanded for 3–5 days. Adipocyte differentiation was induced with growth medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg ml−1), rosiglitazone (1 μM), iso-butyl-methylxanthine (0.5 mM) and dexamethasone (1 μM) for 48 h. Cells were maintained on differentiation medium containing insulin (5 μg ml−1) and rosiglitazone (1 μM) for 96 h. Fully differentiated cells were then treated with various concentrations of cystine (0–200 μM) for 48 h, in cystine and methionine-free DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 200 μM methionine.

Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Data were analysed with GraphPad (v.9.4.0) or R (v.3.4.2). Statistical differences between groups were calculated by unpaired two-tailed t-tests. For comparing groups over time, mice were individually tracked, and groups were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak's correction for multiple comparisons. For all experiments P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in the field. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Some mice were excluded from the study due to abnormal health conditions or reaching the humane end point.

Self-healing concrete could be greener, more resilient, and longer lasting than the standard variety.

The production of concrete, as well as the key ingredient—cement—is one of the leading generators of CO2 emissions on Earth, contributing to at least 8 percent of the world's global budget. So, it's no surprise that scientists and engineers are trying to figure out ways to lower this building material's impact.

One solution is to not use it altogether—the creation of mass timber buildings in the U.S. has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Another is to devise some way to make concrete more sustainable, or even find ways for it to be a carbon negative building material. However, the area that's gotten the most attention in the past few decades is figuring out how to make concrete longer-lasting, and even better than the widely used ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). 

The most common method for increasing concrete's longevity is by ripping a page out of the Roman playbook and developing means for concrete to essentially “self-heal.” The reason why the 2,000-year-old aqueducts throughout Italy don't look a day over 500 is because Romans used “lime clasts” mixed in with concrete that essentially filled cracks before they formed. Now, scientists from Texas A&M University are investigating ways to pull off a similar trick using lichen. The results of the study were published in the journal Materials Today Communications.

Of course, self-healing concrete isn't new—headlines have popped up for years touting new techniques for making concrete long lasting, and some have even used microbes. But the authors of this new study say they've stumbled upon a technique that improves on previous attempts in one major way.

“Microbe-mediated self-healing concrete has been extensively investigated for more than three decades” Congrui Grace Jin, senior author of the study from Texas A&M, said in a press statement, “but it still suffers from one important limitation—none of the current self-healing approaches are fully autonomous since they require an external supply of nutrients for the healing agents to continuously produce repair materials.”

Lichen, often found clinging to trees and rocks, is actually a complex symbiotic system filled with cyanobacteria, fungi, and algae. The researchers created a synthetic lichen that consisted of a cyanobacteria that can use sunlight (as well as elements from the atmosphere) as food, and some fungi that naturally produce materials that can seal cracks. Specifically, the fungi can pull in ionized calcium, which spurs the production of calcium carbonate—the ultra-hard material found in seashells and coral. (Calcium carbonate is actually the same material that made Rome's concrete extremely strong in antiquity.)

In lab tests, the synthetic lichen was able to fill cracks—even in concrete—relying on just sunlight and air for food. Using this autonomous repair system can not only extend the life of concrete, but also cut down on repair costs. The authors are now testing whether this synthetic fungi could repair existing cracks as well. 

Challenges still remain for the widespread adoption of self-healing concrete. Right now, not many companies make the stuff, and it's still more expensive to produce that typical, run-of-the-mill concrete. Some experts say it could still be a decade before self-healing additives really take off. 

When that happens, though, the lichen will be ready.

Metrics details

The detection of low-mass exoplanets (≤10 Earth masses (M⊕)) yields fundamental inputs for current theories of planet formation and evolution, and supplies critical information for the planned direct-imaging missions that aim to detect and characterize Earth-like planets in the habitable zones around solar-like stars. However, the most efficient detection techniques available for low-mass exoplanets (that is, photometric transit and radial velocity methods) are heavily biased towards the detection of short-period planets (for example, ≤100 days) and strongly favour late-type stars. Here we report the discovery of Kepler-725 c, a 10 ± 3 M⊕ exoplanet within the habitable zone of the late G-type dwarf Kepler-725. Through analysis of the transit timing variations of the relatively short-period (39.64 days) warm Jupiter Kepler-725 b, we find that Kepler-725 c has a period of 207.5 days and travels in an eccentric orbit (with an eccentricity of 0.44 ± 0.02 and an orbital semi-major axis of 0.674 ± 0.002 au), receiving a time-averaged insolation of 1.4 times the Earth's value. This discovery demonstrates that the transit timing variation method enables the detection and accurate mass measurement of a super-Earth/mini-Neptune within a solar-like star's habitable zone. Similar searches for such exoplanets could be conducted in other exoplanetary systems in the era of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and upcoming PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars and Earth 2.0 missions.

The contours in each panel enclose 68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7% credible regions, respectively. While the green dashed lines enclose the 68.3% credible intervals.

Only known low-mass planets (gray filled circle + cross) that have mass measured with precision better than 33% and radius measured with precision better than 33% are shown (source: TEPCat). The different lines represent the theoretical models of various compositions for exoplanets. All error bars represent 1-standard deviation.

Metrics details

Despite substantial progress in artificial intelligence (AI) for generative chemistry, few novel AI-discovered or AI-designed drugs have reached human clinical trials. Here we present the results of the first phase 2a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and efficacy of rentosertib (formerly ISM001-055), a first-in-class AI-generated small-molecule inhibitor of TNIK, a first-in-class target in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) discovered using generative AI. IPF is an age-related progressive lung condition with no current therapies available that reverse the degenerative course of disease. Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with 30 mg rentosertib once daily (QD, n = 18), 30 mg rentosertib twice daily (BID, n = 18), 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18) or placebo (n = 17). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who have at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, which was similar across all treatment arms (72.2% in patients receiving 30 mg rentosertib QD (n = 13/18), 83.3% for 30 mg rentosertib BID (n = 15/18), 83.3% for 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 15/18) and 70.6% for placebo (n = 12/17)). Treatment-related serious adverse event rates were low and comparable across treatment groups, with the most common events leading to treatment discontinuation related to liver toxicity or diarrhea. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic dynamics (Cmax, Ctrough, tmax, AUC0–t/τ/∞ and t1/2), changes in lung function as measured by forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, forced expiry in 1 s and change in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in 6-min walk distance and the number and hospitalization duration of acute exacerbations of IPF. We observed increased forced vital capacity at the highest dosage with a mean change of +98.4 ml (95% confidence interval 10.9 to 185.9) for patients in the 60 mg rentosertib QD group, compared with −20.3 ml (95% confidence interval −116.1 to 75.6) for the placebo group. These results suggest that targeting TNIK with rentosertib is safe and well tolerated and warrants further investigation in larger-scale clinical trials of longer duration.

The process of developing novel therapeutics is increasingly slow and costly1, with an average of US$2–3 billion spent over the course of 10–15 years to bring a new drug to market2. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated proof-of-concept innovation and potential to accelerate and decrease costs across all stages of pharmaceutical research and development by facilitating disease-associated target prioritization3,4,5, compound design and optimization6,7,8,9,10, and clinical trial performance11,12,13,14,15. Shifting more of the time-, material- and labor-intensive steps of drug discovery to AI platforms enables more rapid nomination of therapeutic candidate compounds that explore the possible chemical space more thoroughly16,17 and with a concomitant reduction in hands-on screening18,19, thus allowing more preclinical candidate compounds to enter clinical testing and, eventually, clinical practice.

Despite these advancements, few AI-discovered or AI-designed drugs have reached clinical trials. AI-discovered drugs have experienced similar levels of phase 2 trial failure as non-AI-discovered drugs20,21, and none has so far progressed through phase 3 trials21. The question of whether AI can impart meaningful, sustained disruption to drug development has remained unanswered21.

As an answer to this question, our group used generative AI-driven discovery tools22,23 to identify Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) de novo as a critical regulator of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathology as it orchestrates multiple profibrotic and proinflammatory cellular programs9. Our approach resulted in the first antifibrotic, small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, rentosertib (formerly ISM001-055), for the treatment of IPF designed by generative AI. We reported the development and positive phase 0 and 1 trial results of rentosertib9 (NCT05154240 and CTR20221542 (accessed via http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/)), the first report of a targeted TNIK inhibitor entering clinical testing, which found rentosertib to be safe and well tolerated by healthy individuals, exhibiting a favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in both trials9. This was also, importantly, the first reported instance of AI platform-enabled discovery of both a disease-associated target and a compound for that target. Our generative AI-powered approach streamlined preclinical candidate nomination to a mere 18 months and completion of phase 0/1 clinical testing to under 30 months from the initiation of target discovery, representing a revolutionary shift in the streamlining of drug discovery9.

IPF is an age-related, progressive lung disease diagnosed by excluding other potential causes of interstitial lung disease (for example, environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or drug toxicities)24 and marked by interstitial pneumonia, dyspnea and cough25, histologically characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling26,27,28,29. Affecting between 10 and 60 per 100,000 individuals in the USA, with an approximately tenfold greater incidence in those over 65, IPF occurs at a rate similar to stomach, brain and testicular cancers25. The median survival time after diagnosis is 2–4 years despite widespread availability of targeted antifibrotic therapies26,30, highlighting the ongoing need for novel, effective therapies to treat IPF. The current standard-of-care (SOC) therapy regimen to treat IPF includes either nintedanib, a broadly acting inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases31, or pirfenidone, an inhibitor of TGFβ-mediated fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition32. Clinical trials investigating these two drugs in patients with IPF have demonstrated only a slowing of disease progression33,34, as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) and self-reported quality of life (QOL) metrics, and unclear benefit to survival26, making the development of therapies that can restore lung function and reverse the course of disease a priority.

Here, we present the results of a phase 2a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and impact on FVC of rentosertib at a range of doses for up to 12 weeks in patients with IPF. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints and analyses were designed to further measure lung function, QOL metrics and cellular phenotypes associated with rentosertib treatment and response.

Among the 128 patients screened for inclusion, 71 (55.5%) patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 17), 30 mg rentosertib once daily (QD, n = 18), 30 mg rentosertib twice daily (BID, n = 18) or 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18) (Extended Data Fig. 1). The most common reason for screening-based exclusion was obstructive pulmonary disease comorbidity indicated by forced expiry in 1 s (FEV1)/FVC less than 0.7 at visit 1 (baseline) or diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) percent of predicted normal falling outside the range of ≥25% and <80% at baseline. Patients were also excluded for a recent history of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (within 4 weeks) at visit 1 (baseline) or before visit 2 (week 1). The intention-to-treat population included 71 patients, and 55 (77%) completed the 12-week placebo-controlled period (15 (88%) in the placebo group, 16 (89%) in the 30 mg rentosertib QD group, 12 (67%) in the 30 mg rentosertib BID group and 12 (67%) in the 60 mg rentosertib QD group). Overall, 16 (22.5%) patients discontinued treatment before the conclusion of the 12-week study due to either adverse events (AEs) or other withdrawal; 2 from placebo, 2 from 30 mg rentosertib QD, 6 from 30 mg rentosertib BID and 6 from 60 mg rentosertib QD groups. All patients were included in the safety and efficacy analyses (Fig. 1).

Of 128 patients screened for inclusion, 71 were randomized to receive 30 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18), 30 mg rentosertib BID (n = 18), 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18), or placebo (n = 17) over the course of 12 weeks. Sixteen patients discontinued treatment prior to the end of treatment.

Source data

Clinical and demographic characteristics, including age, body mass index (BMI) and baseline lung function, were similar across treatment groups (Table 1).

The rates of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were similar across all treatment groups (13/18 (72.2%) in the 30 mg rentosertib QD group, 15/18 (83.3%) in the 30 mg rentosertib BID group, 15/18 (83.3%) in the 60 mg rentosertib QD group and 12/17 (70.6%) in the placebo group) (Table 2), with similar incidence for patients concurrently taking SOC antifibrotic therapy or not (Supplementary Table 1). Treatment-related AEs were more common among patients who received rentosertib compared with placebo, with 5/17 (29.4%) in the placebo group versus 9/18 (50.0%) in the 30 mg QD group, 11/18 (61.1%) in the 30 mg BID group, and 14/18 (77.8%) in the 60 mg QD group. Of these, few were serious AEs (SAEs), with no treatment-related SAEs reported in the placebo group, 1/18 (5.6%) of the rentosertib 30 mg QD group, 2/18 (11.1%) in the 30 mg BID group and 2/18 (11.1%) in the 60 mg QD group (Table 2). The most common TEAEs were hypokalemia (2 in placebo (11.8%), 3 in 30 mg QD (16.7%), 5 in 30 mg BID (27.8%) and 3 in 60 mg QD (20.4%)), hepatic function abnormal (2 in placebo (11.8%), 2 in 30 mg QD (11.1%), 4 in 30 mg BID (22.2%), diarrhea (0 in placebo, 2 in 30 mg QD (11.1%), 3 in 30 mg BID (16.7%) and 5 in 60 mg QD (27.8%)) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (1 in placebo (5.9%), 1 in 30 mg QD (5.6%), 1 in 30 mg BID (5.6%), 6 in 60 mg QD (33.3%) and 3 in 60 mg QD (16.7%)). A complete listing of TEAEs is presented in Supplementary Table 2.

The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was AEs (12/16 (75%)), and the treatment of 7 of the 12 patients was discontinued for AEs due to liver injury or dysfunction (0/18 (0%) in the 30 mg QD group, 4/18 (22.2%) in the 30 mg BID group and 3/18 (17%) in the 60 mg QD group) (Supplementary Table 3). Four of the seven (57.1%) total participants who withdrew because of liver toxicity were concurrently administered nintedanib antifibrotic therapy. Three of the four (75%) remaining discontinuations were due to patient withdrawal from the trial (3/71 patients (4.2%)). One patient died of heart failure before the week 12 end-of-treatment (EOT) visit determined to be unrelated to the trial owing to a history of degenerative aortic valve disease, aortic valve incompetence, left ventricular dysfunction, aortic dilatation, pulmonary hypertension, increased blood glucose and hypercholesterolemia, as well as a lack of other AEs reported and no notable findings for vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or laboratory tests since randomization. A complete listing of patients whose treatment was discontinued due to TEAE is presented in Supplementary Table 4.

FVC is the gold-standard metric for assessing the lung function of patients with IPF and response to therapeutic intervention33,34,35. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients who received placebo experienced deteriorating FVC with a mean change of −20.3 ml (95% confidence interval (CI) −116.1 to 75.6). Patients who received 30 mg rentosertib QD showed a similar mean reduction in FVC of −27.0 ml (95% CI −88.8 to 34.8), patients who received 30 mg rentosertib BID experienced a mean change of +19.7 ml (95% CI −60.5 to 99.9) and patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD showed improved FVC, with and +98.4 ml (95% CI 10.9 to 185.9) (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD not concurrently taking SOC antifibrotic therapy exhibited significant improvement in FVC (+187.8 ml, 95% CI 68.6 to 306.9 ml), whereas patients concurrently taking 60 mg rentosertib QD with either nintedanib or pirfenidone did not exhibit significant changes in FVC (Extended Data Fig. 3).

The changes in DLCO and FEV1 were relatively small and similar across treatment regimens (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). Changes in self-reported QOL and physical ability metrics, such as responses to the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and 6-min walk distance (6MWD), respectively, were likewise similar across treatment groups (Extended Data Fig. 4f–i), although our modeling indicated a significant increase of least-squares mean change of the LCQ scores of patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib compared with those receiving placebo (two-sided P = 0.0495).

Three patients (16.7%) receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD and one patient (5.9%) receiving placebo experienced acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) (Supplementary Table 5). The patients in the 60 mg QD group were all hospitalized in response to their acute exacerbations with a mean duration of 23.3 days, whereas the patient in the placebo group was not hospitalized.

A PK analysis of rentosertib concentration in the blood plasma of patients with IPF after single and multiple doses shows a favorable PK profile, with greater exposure in patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD compared with patients receiving 30 mg rentosertib QD or 30 mg rentosertib BID, peaking 1 h after administration (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Table 6). The area under the plasma–concentration curve (AUC0–t), measuring total exposure to the drug to the last available time point, was greater for the 60 mg rentosertib QD at both week 0 (first dose) and week 12 (EOT; arithmetic mean 1,630 and 3,450 h ng−1 ml−1, respectively) than for 30 mg rentosertib BID (315 and 1,390 h ng−1 ml−1) and 30 mg rentosertib QD (553 and 788 h ng−1 ml−1) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 6). The steady state was achieved at week 2, and no obvious drug accumulation was observed by week 12. The geometric mean half-life (t1/2) ranged from 10.9 to 12.0 h at week 12.

a–c, Pharmacokinetic dynamics of rentosertib in patient sera collected predose and periodically throughout 24 h posttreatment at week 0 (a), at 0 h posttreatment at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (b) and 48 h after administration at week 12 (c). d, AUC0–t of rentosertib exposure; n = 22 in 30 mg QD, n = 21 in 30 mg BID, n = 20 in 60 mg QD. e, Cmax of rentosertib exposure; n = 22 in 30 mg QD, n = 21 in 30 mg BID, n = 20 in 60 mg QD. f, Ctrough of rentosertib exposure in patient sera collected pretreatment at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All data represent arithmetic mean ± s.d.

A higher AUC0–t and t1/2 at week 12 for all dosages indicates an increased exposure to rentosertib with increases time on treatment (Fig. 3a,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Change in patients' FVC from baseline to week 12 was positively correlated with AUC0–t and trough concentration (Ctrough) (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Not surprisingly, the Cmax exposure was greatest in patients receiving the 60 mg QD dose, with both 30 mg QD and 30 mg BID showing similarly lower Cmax (Fig. 3e), whereas Ctrough was similar between 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD dosages (Fig. 3f). Together, the PK dynamics suggest that higher dosage leads to increased exposure from higher initial net absorption, with a more pronounced effect by the end of the treatment period associated with slower clearance.

We performed proteomic profiling of patient serum samples to understand the mechanism of action of rentosertib, guide development of biomarkers of response and evaluate the hypothesis that inhibition of TNIK may target biological aging36. We identified a total of 2,841 proteins using the Olink Explore 3072 panel across serum samples collected from patients in all treatment groups at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Using a linear regression model to evaluate time-dependent effects of rentosertib treatment on protein expression changes, we found that treatment duration substantially impacted protein expression patterns, with 20, 82 and 192 proteins significantly changing with treatment at weeks 2, 4 and 12, respectively (Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P value <0.1) (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Paired statistical testing to assess dose-associated changes in protein expression compared with placebo identified 1, 8 and 22 high-confidence (Padj < 0.05) differentially abundant proteins in sera from patients receiving 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD rentosertib, respectively, using a generalized linear model (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Tables 7–9). Restricting analysis of differential proteins from baseline to week 12, the number of significantly altered proteins increased substantially with higher dosing: 0, 39 and 115 in the 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD groups, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Together, this suggests that the duration of rentosertib treatment and the dose are associated with changes in serum protein profiles.

Downregulated proteins associated with 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD treatment include known fibrosis-associated proteins such as MMP10, PTPRZ1, COL1A1, FAP, FN1, ROBO2, ASPN and LTBP2 (Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Tables 7–10). Analyzing the differentially abundant proteins to find association with change in FVC found that ASPN, PTPRZ1, MMP10 and CHAD were both significantly inversely correlated to change in FVC (P < 0.05) and significantly downregulated after administration of rentosertib at the week 12 time point, suggesting an array of potential biomarkers for response to treatment (Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Tables 7–9). Pathway enrichment analysis identified extracellular matrix organization as the most downregulated Reactome pathway gene set in both treatment groups, suggesting a reduction in excessive extracellular matrix production (Fig. 4e,f).

We queried diverse published gene expression datasets profiling the tissue of patients with IPF and that of healthy individuals using our AI-powered target discovery platform, PandaOmics37, for expression patterns of these top genes to validate their relevance to IPF. COL1A1, MMP10 and FAP were found to be universally upregulated in IPF patient samples compared with healthy individuals, and FN1 was upregulated in most datasets (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

We further found that the abundance at week 12 of proteins previously reported to be associated with lung function38 and transplant-free survival39 in patients with IPF, such as ADAMTSL2, COL6A3, CCN3, COL24A1, KRT19 and LTBP2, were associated change in FVC (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The expression of inflammation-associated pathways, other immune-related proteins, such as IL-10 and CD5, and other extracellular matrix-related proteins, such as COL6A3, were found to have significant associations with time on treatment and change in FVC, further suggesting that TNIK plays a diverse role in various aging-related dysregulated pathways36 (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 8).

In this phase 2a study, treatment with rentosertib at 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD over 12 weeks was safe and well tolerated. Treatment-related SAEs were rare, with a similarly low rate across treatment and placebo groups. The most common TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were liver toxicity related and occurred mostly in patients who were also treated with nintedanib antifibrotic therapy, although notably not pirfenidone. In addition to liver toxicities, diarrhea and hypokalemia were among the most common TEAEs among participants treated with rentosertib. To determine the respective and synergistic contributions of rentosertib and SOC antifibrotic therapies to liver and gastrointestinal toxicity, as well as any potential effects on absorption or trough levels, we require further drug–drug interaction studies and assessment in a larger cohort of mixed SOC antifibrotic recipients and nonrecipients.

Treatment with 60 mg rentosertib QD over 12 weeks was associated with a trend toward an increase in FVC in patients with IPF. The 60 mg rentosertib QD dose exhibited the greatest mean improvement in lung function, as measured by FVC, whereas patients receiving placebo experienced an average decline in FVC. Patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD experienced a mean increase in FVC percentage change of 2.82% by our modeling, meeting the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) reported for FVC in IPF of 2–6% (ref. 40). Subgrouping patients by concurrent SOC antifibrotic treatment showed patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD without SOC antifibrotic exhibited the strongest increase in FVC, suggesting potential interaction between the drugs that will be investigated in future trials. The incongruity of increased FVC with stable DLCO may be attributed to low numbers of patients in each treatment arm and the inherent variability of DLCO measurement41.

The impact of rentosertib treatment on QOL metrics was largely inconclusive, with large variances within treatment arms, although our modeling found that patient-reported coughing-related QOL (via LCQ) was significantly improved in patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD. As various QOL metrics integrate the functionality of a number of organ systems, of which lung health is one contributing factor, a lack of difference among the treatment groups may be due to the relatively short data collection period and small cohort size.

AE-IPF is a strong indication of dismal patient prognosis42 with a median survival of 2.2 months after onset43, and incidence informs long-term therapeutic efficacy. Three acute exacerbations occurred in the 60 mg rentosertib arm and one in the placebo arm; however, a 12-week study is a relatively short time frame to capture such long-term disease events or trajectory44. An unintended consequence of rentosertib's potential immunomodulatory mechanism of action9 may be a dampened site-specific immune response, potentially leading to increased susceptibility to infection, a known trigger for a subset of AE-IPF45,46. Because AE-IPF is a clinically important occurrence, we intend to assess its incidence in longer trials with larger cohorts in the future, which would assess patients for at least 12 months to more fully capture the incidence of AE-IPF and other potential AEs.

Assaying the serum proteome in patients provided insight into changes in circulating proteins associated with higher doses of rentosertib. The top up- and downregulated proteins showed high overlap between the 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD doses, with downregulated proteins enriched for association with extracellular matrix organization, a key feature of fibrotic progression in IPF. Moreover, a number of the top downregulated proteins are known to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis: MMP1047, LTBP239,48,49, KRT1939 and COL24A139 have been nominated as biomarkers for IPF and transplant-free survival; PTPRZ150 activates β-catenin signaling, which contributes to IPF development51, and BHLHE40 regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in IPF via β-catenin52; COL1A1 is a key component of dysregulated extracellular matrix deposition characteristic of fibrosis53,54,55; ASPN plays a role in myofibroblast transformation56 and may play a central role in IPF tissue remodeling55,57; circulating ROBO2 is associated with poor IPF prognosis58; FAP is expressed exclusively in fibrotic loci in the lungs of patients with IPF59; and CHAD binds to type II collagen in cartilaginous fibrotic loci60,61. Downregulation of this IPF-associated protein profile supports the hypothesis that inhibition of TNIK modulates IPF pathophysiological pathways and points to a potential serum protein signature as a biomarker for response to rentosertib treatment.

The limitations of this study include the small cohort size of each arm, the geographical and demographic homogeneity of the participants (all were residents of China of similar race) and a short period of follow-up, which limit the assessment of long-term safety and efficacy. Despite the short duration and the number of withdrawals from the trial across all arms (n = 16/71 (22.5%)), the results are encouraging for additional study of this drug candidate and target, suggesting that rentosertib is generally safe and potentially effective and, more broadly, that using AI in both target identification and in drug design may enhance the efficiency of the drug development process. Longer phase 2 or 3 trials studying rentosertib in a larger, heterogeneous sample of patients with IPF from around the globe are warranted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of rentosertib treatment for IPF.

This phase 2a, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multidose trial of rentosertib in adults with IPF was performed at 21 sites across China beginning 19 July 2023 and running through 11 June 2024. Adults with IPF were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio via interactive response technology to receive oral rentosertib (at a dose of 30 mg (QD), 30 mg (BID) or 60 mg (QD)) or placebo (QD) for 12 weeks, along with the continued use of SOC medications (Fig. 1). Patient screening occurred, on average, 30 days before the first dosing at the second visit. Patients were clinically evaluated on day 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12 (end of treatment) and week 13 (end of study). The study treatment rentosertib was provided by Insilico Medicine or a designated contract research organization, packaged and labeled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice. Resupply to the sites was managed via an interactive response technology system, which also monitored expiry dates of supplies available at the sites. Access to the randomization codes was controlled and documented.

The trial was conducted following the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The institutional review board or ethics committee at participating centers approved protocols and adhered to local laws before initiation of the clinical trial. All patients in this study provided written informed consent. Trial management and data processing, summarization and analyses were conducted by Fortrea Clinical Pharmacology Services, Leeds, UK.

Authors used by the study sponsor were involved in the trial design, collection, analysis and data interpretation. Subjects, investigators, site study staff, reviewers and everyone involved in study conduct or analysis were blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after data freeze. Bioanalytics staff were allowed to identify samples from subjects assigned to placebo treatment but did not disclose randomization until trial unblinding. These authors contributed to manuscript preparation across all iterations of the manuscript. The first and last authors of this study vouch for the completeness of all data reported in this publication.

Eligible patients were 40 years of age or older with an IPF diagnosis as defined by the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines62. Enrolled patients presented with stable IPF and were deemed suitable for study participation on the basis of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG and laboratory evaluation. Patients previously receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone were enrolled if their antifibrotic therapy had been stable for >8 weeks before the first (screening) visit. Eligible patients had to meet all three of the following criteria during the screening visit: (1) FVC >40% predicted of normal, (2) DLCO corrected for hemoglobin ≥25% and <80% predicted of normal, and (3) FEV1/FVC ratio >0.7 based on prebronchodilator value. Patients were excluded for concomitant respiratory disorders or health concerns, including, but not limited to, cystic fibrosis, active aspergillosis, active tuberculosis, confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at visits 1 or 2 or severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization within 6 months of visit 1 or long COVID-19, clinically relevant or severe pulmonary hypertension, acute IPF exacerbation within 4 months before visit 1 and/or during the screening period, upper or lower respiratory tract infection that has not fully resolved within 4 weeks before visit 1 and/or before visit 2 (day 1), active on the lung transplantation register or expected to become active on the lung transplant register within 6 months before visit 1, a history of lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplant, current smoker, BMI >40 kg m−2, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT ≥1.5 times upper level of normal or total bilirubin ≥1.5 times upper level of normal at visit 1, eGFR ≤60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula) at visit 1, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure >160 mmHg or diastolic pressure >95 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive treatments) at visit 1, unstable cardiac angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months before visit 1, taking oral corticosteroids, any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years before visit 1, known hypersensitivity or contraindications to serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, any condition or treatment possibly affecting drug absorption (for example, gastrectomy or metoclopramide), taking restricted medications (for example, moderate-to-strong CYP3A4–CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers or medications primarily metabolized by CYP3A4–CYP1A2) or consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pomelo, Seville orange or Seville orange-containing products within 48 h before day 1, substantial trauma or major surgery within 3 months before visit 1 or planned major surgery during the study and 12-lead ECG demonstrating corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) >450 ms for males and >470 ms for females, or a QRS interval >120 ms at visit 1. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the associated study protocol.

Given an approximate sample size of 15 subjects per treatment arm, there exists a 90% probability of observing at least one AE if the true population rate is approximately 15%, which is sufficient to assess the feasibility of safety parameters.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered rentosertib for up to 12 weeks in adult patients with IPF compared with placebo. The primary endpoint for this study was the percentage of patients who have at least one TEAE. Patients were continually monitored for AEs during the 12 weeks of rentosertib treatment and for 1 week after administration of the final dose, with study drug-related SAE and AEs of special interest collected if they occurred beyond the study period.

The secondary efficacy endpoints measured the relative and percent change in FVC from week 0/visit 2 up to week 12. The absolute and relative change in FVC (%) predicted from week 0/visit 2 up to week 12 as well as the change in DLCO (%) predicted from week 0 up to week 12 was also measured. Twenty-one subjects (29.6%) had FVC and FEV1 measured at baseline (randomization with spirometry equipment sourced from the local site meeting the 2019 American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guideline criteria)63, provided that the subject's baseline and end-of-treatment spirometry were performed with the same equipment. Fifty subjects (70.4%) had FVC and FEV1 measured at baseline/randomization with centrally sourced SpiroSphere devices (Clario) provided by the sponsor with study-specific training and proficiency tests to the operating staff to meet the 2019 ATS/ERS guideline criteria63 with central overread. All DLCO measurements were assessed with devices from each site according to the ATS/ERS guidelines64, and all measurements were conducted with the same equipment for each site. FVC MCID has been reported to be a change of 2–6% in patients with IPF40.

The change in LCQ, a 19-item questionnaire that assesses cough-related QOL65, from week 0 to weeks 4, 8 and 12 was also analyzed. The LCQ examines three domains (physical, psychological and social) related to the patient's experience within a 24-h time frame. The range for the total score on the LCQ is 3–21, with the sum of each domain score ranging from 1 to 7. A higher score indicates a better QOL, with an MCID reported to be a change of 1.3 points for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease66. The LCQ questionnaire has mainly been validated in disease settings such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease67, noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis68 and chronic cough69.

The change in 6MWD in meters from week 0 to week 12 was also evaluated.

Other secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic parameters of rentosertib and related metabolites after the first dose at visit 2 and the last dose at visit 6 (EOT). This study also collected data on the number of acute IPF exacerbations and the number of days hospitalized after acute IPF exacerbations from week 0 through week 12.

The exploratory endpoints analyzed include the change in IPF blood biomarkers after rentosertib treatment at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Changes in the blood proteome in treated patients were also measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12.

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was performed for endpoints including FVC. The model includes treatment as a fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate. LCQ scores were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures. FVC and other spirometry measurements were collected at baseline and at week 12, with all patients being measured at baseline and a total of 22 patients missing week 12 measurements (5 receiving 30 mg rentosertib QD, 6 receiving 30 mg rentosertib BID, 8 receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD and 3 receiving placebo). Missing values at week 12 were imputed using a multiple imputation method assuming missing at random. All statistical comparisons were made using two-sided tests. No statistical comparisons of AEs between treatment groups were performed. Given an approximate sample size of 15 subjects per treatment arm, there exists a 90% probability of observing at least one AE if the true population rate is approximately 15%, which was sufficient to assess the feasibility of safety parameters, although a sample size calculation based on statistical power considerations was not performed. Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the association between FVC change and AUC0–t or Ctrough.

The safety population included all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. The intent-to-treat population included any randomized subjects. The intent-to-treat population was used for summary of demographic and baseline characteristics and for analysis of secondary endpoints, except PK analysis. Assessment of PK parameters included subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one measurable concentration collected after dosing. Assessment of serum biomarkers was performed on subjects who had a predose baseline value and at least one value after treatment initiated.

For Olink proteomics analyses, we utilized a generalized linear mixed model to assess the association between each protein and dose or FVC change. The formula for modeling the treatment effect is

The lme4 package was used for the generalized linear mixed model analysis. For modeling the FVC changes, we conducted the statistical analyses in two steps. In the first step, we regressed the protein level (NPX) against the visit to obtain the slope of protein change rate for each individual. In the second step, we regressed the FVC changes against the slope of protein change rates obtained from the first step. This was conducted using the lm package. Pathway analyses were performed using the clusterProfiler R package, with Reactome processes70 as the curated pathway set.

Metrics details

Associations between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC) have been uncovered, but larger and more diverse studies are needed to assess their potential clinical use. We expanded upon 12 metagenomic datasets of patients with CRC (n = 930), adenomas (n = 210) and healthy control individuals (n = 976; total n = 2,116) with 6 new cohorts (n = 1,625) providing granular information on cancer stage and the anatomic location of tumors. We improved CRC prediction accuracy based solely on gut metagenomics (average area under the curve = 0.85) and highlighted the contribution of 19 newly profiled species and distinct Fusobacterium nucleatum clades. Specific gut species distinguish left-sided versus right-sided CRC (area under the curve = 0.66) with an enrichment of oral-typical microbes. We identified strain-specific CRC signatures with the commensal Ruminococcus bicirculans and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showing subclades associated with late-stage CRC. Our analysis confirms that the microbiome can be a clinical target for CRC screening and characterizes it as a biomarker for CRC progression.

CRC is the third most frequent and the second most lethal tumor type worldwide1. It has a 30% higher incidence in men2 and 60–65% of all CRC cases occur in individuals with no previous family history (sporadic cancers)3. Only 40% of cases are diagnosed before metastasis2, with highest survival rates when the tumor is diagnosed at an early stage and a 5-year survival rate for stage IV for colon and rectal cancer of 11% and 15%, respectively4. CRC originates in the epithelial layer of either the proximal or distal colon plus rectum5, usually referred to as right- and left-sided CRC, respectively. Progression from benign precursor lesion (adenoma) to a malignant tumor (carcinoma), termed the adenoma–carcinoma sequence, may take several years6 and is characterized by an accumulation of mutations in tumor cells5, impairment in the gut mucosal barrier and intestinal inflammation7,8.

Interest in the tumor microenvironment has increased alongside advances in distinguishing tumor histological features and expression patterns of CRC9, with the gut microbiome suggested as another important hallmark of cancer9. Specific microbes have been proposed as major contributors to carcinogenesis, particularly pks+ Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium nucleatum10,11. Several individual cohort studies and earlier meta-analyses have observed distinct microbiome signatures in patients with CRC when compared with patients with adenomas or healthy controls12,13,14,15,16,17, consistently across different countries and cohorts18,19,20. A few noteworthy metagenomic studies also interrogated microbiome changes along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence and according to primary neoplasia location15,21, and links between CRC and oral species have been suggested15. Further evidence points toward the enrichment of oral-typical microbes (at the genus level21) and of oral biofilm-forming species22 in the gut metagenomes of patients with proximal CRC. However, no metagenomic studies have gone beyond characterizing already well-known strain-specific factors influencing CRC risk (for example, pks island, fragilysin), and no untargeted searches for subspecies and strain-level genomic associations with CRC phenotypes are available. These gaps in the state-of-the-art currently limit the microbiome's potential to be used as a screening tool in clinical settings.

Here, we investigated gut microbiome composition along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence and across different primary tumor locations using a meta-analytical approach comprised of an unprecedented number of cohorts (12 public studies and 6 new cohorts generated in this study) and samples (2,116 from public studies and 1,625 from our new CRC cohorts). We also used new computational, statistical and machine learning (ML) strategies to achieve higher profiling resolution extended to previously unknown species and differentiated clades of F. nucleatum23.

We established a large and diverse set of gut metagenomic cohorts associated with sporadic CRC and with information on CRC stage (stages 0–IV) and primary tumor location (right-sided or left-sided). To this end, we sequenced 1,625 new stool metagenomes from 6 previously unpublished CRC cohorts (Methods) and integrated them with 2,116 stool metagenomes from 12 public studies. In total, we leveraged 1,471 samples from patients with CRC (1,191 with staging information and 989 with primary tumor location information), 702 from patients with colorectal adenoma and 1,568 from control participants, from 16 case-control and two CRC-only studies (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Four of the six newly sequenced cohorts (cohorts 1–4, n = 671) are part of the European ONCOBIOME initiative (Methods and ‘Data Availability'), whereas the fifth (cohort 5) is part of the Micro-N Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII) (n = 897)24. Cohort 6 included stool samples from CRC cases and controls (n = 18 and 39, respectively) from the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital and the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (Istanbul, Turkey). Considering the 3,741 metagenomes in the 18 integrated datasets, we gathered 94 stool metagenomes from patients with stage 0 CRC or carcinoma in situ, and more than 250 for each single stage from stage I to stage IV. In total, 344 samples were from individuals whose primary tumors originated in the right colon (cecum, ascending and transverse colon (10 cohorts)) and 645 samples were from patients whose primary tumors originated in the left colon and rectum (11 cohorts) (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2a). In addition, cohort 1 includes patients with stage IV CRC with either resected primary tumor (n = 68) or in situ primary tumor (n = 95).

a, Overview of the cohorts (n = 18) and sample sizes (n = 3,741) according to case-control, cancer stage and primary tumor location, along with the cohorts used to define oral-typical species. b, Number of samples available from each CRC stage and the two primary tumor locations. Symbols indicate the cohort. c, Sample microbiome richness at each stage and primary tumor location. Box plots represent the within-category microbial richness distribution summarized by the first and third quartiles as hinges of the box, the median and whiskers extending to the largest or smallest value not exceeding 1.5× the interquartile range from the two ends of the box, with data beyond these values plotted individually as outliers. d, Meta-analyzed SMDs of the associations between alpha-diversity (Shannon diversity (upper) and SGB richness (lower)) and all paired comparisons. The 95% CIs for each meta-analysis model are indicated by a horizontal line. P values were computed via two-tailed t-test. Significant associations (P < 0.05) are indicated by a light blue diamond. SMD values corrected for age, sex and BMI (Methods) are indicated by a star (blue when P < 0.05). No correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed. e, Meta-analysis of the association between the cumulative relative abundance of oral species (oral-to-gut score) and all paired comparisons (left) and between the number of oral species (oral-to-gut richness) and all paired comparisons (right). Symbols and axes are similar to d. P values were computed via two-tailed t-test. No correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed. SMD values corrected for age, sex and BMI are indicated by a star. f, PERMANOVA (stratified by dataset) derived R2 according to CRC stage and primary tumor location, computed via adonis2 (Methods) on Bray–Curtis distances. Comparisons with P < 0.01 are highlighted in dark blue. Circles indicate the R2 explained by strain-level microbial features, and comparisons with P < 0.01 are marked with an asterisk. The text f0.5 denotes the feature set defined in the Methods section ‘Strain-level feature identification'. A, adenoma; C, control; L, left-sided; R, right-sided; 0, stage 0; I, stage I; II, stage II; III, stage III; IV, stage IV; U, stage not available.

Samples were profiled using MetaPhlAn 4 (ref. 25), which leverages species-level genome bins (SGB)26 to enumerate and quantify characterized (known SGBs (kSGBs) having at least one cultivated reference) and uncharacterized species (unknown SGBs (uSGbs) lacking cultured representatives). In total, we detected 3,866 bacterial, 15 eukaryotic and 23 archaeal SGBs. Some bacterial species spanned multiple SGBs, as was the case for CRC-associated F. nucleatum species for which five SGBs described known and unknown subspecies found by MetaPhlAn 4 (that is, SGB6001, SGB6007, SGB6011, SGB6013, SGB6014), with SGB6007 and SGB6013 recently independently investigated23 and corresponding to F. nucleatum subspecies animalis (Fna) clade 2 (C2) and Fna clade 1 (C1)23. To test the relevance of the presence and overall abundance of oral microbial species in the CRC gut ecosystem, we defined a panel of typically oral SGBs. These were defined on an independent set of 990 matched oral and stool samples from 495 healthy individuals in 5 public microbiome studies27 (Methods). In particular, we considered oral SGBs to be those prevalent (>20%) in the oral microbiome but not (<5%) in the gut microbiome (Methods and Supplementary Table 3).

Functional profiles were also generated with HUMAnN 3.6 (ref. 28), and used for a comprehensive analysis on UniRef90 (UR90) gene profiles and corresponding functional grouping according to MetaCyc Pathways, Enzyme Commission (EC) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. In addition, we investigated within-species phylogenetic structure for uSGBs using StrainPhlAn 4 (ref. 25) and evaluated the resulting 112 within-SGB phylogenies to assess differential strain carriage by CRC phenotypes and for subclade association with CRC-related microbial genes.

Consistent with previous reports18, gut microbial alpha-diversity was higher in CRC than controls in 9 of 16 cohorts (SMD > 0, only two with P < 0.05), but this was not a particularly strong effect according to the meta-analytic approach via standardized mean differences (SMD), which was not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05) (Fig. 1c,d, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 4). We observed no clear relationship between richness and clinical stage compared with controls. Estimated oral-to-gut microbiome score (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2a–e) was instead higher both in CRC cases (Hedges' SMD = 0.47, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1e) and in later CRC stages (Hedges' SMD = 0.14, P = 0.003). In addition, CRC originating from the right colon presented lower richness (Hedges' SMD = 0.25, P = 0.07) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 4) and a higher presence of orally derived SGBs than CRC originating from the left colon and rectum (Hedges' SMD = −0.23, P = 0.003) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 4).

Control and CRC microbiomes were clearly compositionally distinct, confirming previous findings (proportion of sum of squares R2 = 0.014, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) P ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 5). Stage 0–III microbiomes were not different from stage IV (R2 = 0.01, P ≥ 0.05), and stages 0–II (early) were not different from stages III–IV (late) (R2 = 0.01, Bray–Curtis; PERMANOVA P ≥ 0.05) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5). In addition, the microbiome of patients with adenoma did not differ significantly from controls (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting a more crucial role for the gut microbiome in the adenoma–carcinoma transition compared with earlier phases. Primary locations (right versus left) showed microbiome differences (R2 = 0.017, P = 0.002) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5) with no strain-level contribution to the separation (Fig. 1f and Methods). Altogether, the combined data support the potential of enriched oral microbial infiltration into the gut microbiome as a differentiator of CRC stages and locations (Fig. 1e,f).

ML applied to stool metagenomics can be a potential option for noninvasive CRC screening18,19,28. Here, we tested whether leveraging increased sample sizes and methods could further improve predictions of CRC cases. To do so, we exploited ML algorithms models18,28,29 in three different ways: (1) 10-fold cross-validation (CV) applied 20 times on each dataset separately (per-dataset CV); (2) a training–testing approach applied to pairs of distinct datasets (between-dataset CV); and (3) a leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) setting, in which the classifier was trained on all but one dataset and tested on the left-out dataset (iterated over each left-out dataset) (Methods and Fig. 2a).

a, Cross-prediction matrix of the ML classifier trained and tested to predict CRC versus control samples. Dataset-wise CV AUCs are reported along the diagonal. Off-diagonal cells report performances of a classifier trained on the cohort on the row and tested on the cohort on the column. Bottom six rows report different LODO validations obtained by training a classifier on all the cohorts but one and testing on the left-out cohort (column), on the complete taxonomic profiles (All SGBs), the subset of oral SGBs (Oral SGBs), the subset of all SGBs except the oral SGBs (Nonoral SGBs), gene families clustered according to the EC numbers (EC genes) and MetaCyc pathways (Pathways), respectively, and a filtered set of gene families (Genes) (Methods). b, Significance levels of meta-analysis on microbial taxa and pathways between controls and CRC. The x axis shows the SMD and the y axis shows −log10(q). Positive values of Hedges' g SMD indicate a positive association with CRC (higher abundance in CRC than controls), while negative values indicate a positive association with controls (higher abundance in controls than CRC). Associations with q < 0.1 are reported in blue. I2 values for heterogeneity in meta-analysis are reported if ≥50% c, Twenty strongest SGBs associated with CRC and ten with controls. Each line on the y axis reports the set of single-dataset and Hedges' model SMD (values on the x axis, with the same directions as in b, represented by symbols and diamonds, respectively. Significant single-dataset comparisons (q < 0.1) are colored dark gray. Only significant Hedges' g significant values (q < 0.1) are reported. SMD values corrected for age, sex and BMI (Methods) are indicated by a star (colored blue when q < 0.1). Oral SGBs are highlighted in bold. g, group.

Predictions of CRC status using a LODO approach achieved the highest and most stable area under the curve (AUC) values (average AUC = 0.85, ranging from 0.71 to 0.97) (Fig. 2a) and were an improvement compared with previous studies (average LODO AUC = 0.81)18. Predictions based on CV were, as expected, generally high but variable across datasets (average AUC ± s.d. = 0.87 ± 0.09, ranging from 0.68 to 0.96), with similar results for between-dataset CV (average AUC > 0.72 ± 0.11) (Fig. 2a).

We then tested the use of only oral and nonoral SGBs for CRC case versus control classification and obtained similar AUC values to the model considering all SGBs (average LODO AUC = 0.83 compared with 0.85 when considering only oral SGBs and 0.79 when considering nonoral SGBs) (Fig. 2a), confirming that a large part—but not all—of the predictive power of the microbiome for CRC lies in the presence of oral-typical taxa in the stool. By contrast, ML models using different sets of microbiome functional features were less predictive (average LODO AUC of 0.68 to 0.72). These results reinforce the potential of predictive tools applied to stool metagenomics to be useful for CRC screening when trained on large and diverse datasets and highlight the predictive importance of oral species present in the gut during CRC.

We next aimed to pinpoint specific microbiome biomarkers associated with CRC using the increased power of our multicohort framework (Methods). We identified 125 SGBs with increases relative abundance in CRC (q < 0.1, 106 kSGBs and 19 uSGBs) and 83 SGBs more abundant in controls (53 kSGBs and 30 uSGBs) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 6); none of the eukaryotic species were differentially abundant (Supplementary Table 7). Bacterial biomarkers for CRC encompassed not only known associations, such as Parvimonas micra, Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (SMD = 0.63, 0.59 and 0.58, respectively)18, but also newly associated SGBs such as multiple genomically distinct F. nucleatum SGBs (SGB6007 (Fna C2 in ref. 23), F. nucleatum animalis, SGB6014 F. nucleatum vincentii, SGB6011 F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum (F. nucleatum sensu stricto), SGB6001 F. nucleatum polymorphum, SGB6013 (Fna C1 in ref. 23) F. nucleatum vincentii; SMD = 0.54, 0.5, 0.47, 0.43, and 0.34, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 6), two Bacteroides fragilis SGBs (SGB1853 and SGB1855 group; SMD = 0.32, q < 0.1) and two Hungatella hathewayi SGBs (SGB4741 and SGB4742; SMD = 0.33 and 0.27, q < 0.1) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 6). Of the 19 associated uSGBs, two (SGB63163 and SGB63167) were assigned at the phylum level (Firmicutes), four (SGB3996, SGB4367, SGB14306 and SGB14315) at the class level (Clostridia) and nine at the family level. Only four SGBs were uncharacterized at the species level (that is, belonging to known genera): Solobacterium SGB6833 (distinct form the previously associated Solobacterium moorei18), Peptostreptococcus SGB749 and two Porphyromonas SGBs. The effect sizes of the signature identified via meta-analysis significantly correlated with the average ranks of the LODO-evaluated ML models (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.41, P < 0.001) (Extended Data Fig. 4), thus supporting the robustness and consistency of the two independent approaches.

A considerable fraction of the identified CRC gut biomarkers were oral-typical species: 21 of the 125 SGBs (16.8%) positively associated with CRC were oral-typical, in contrast to 34 of 488 (7.0%) nonsignificantly associated with CRC (Fisher's test, P < 0.01). No oral SGB was associated with controls and a greater proportion of oral SGBs were associated with CRC at lower q thresholds (18 of 90 at q < 0.05). By reconstructing strain- and subspecies-level phylogenies for oral-typical species associated with CRC via PhyloPhlAn 3 (ref. 30) using metagenome-assembled genomes and isolates, we further identified several subclades of taxa that appear to be more prevalent in the oral cavity or the gut, including clades of F. nucleatum SGB6007 and three Veillonella species (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Within oral species, there is thus evidence of genomic adaptation to the intestinal environment. In addition, to better characterize the tropism of the 21 oral SGBs that are more abundant in CRC (Extended Data Fig. 5a), we exploited datasets with dental plaque and tongue dorsum metagenomes from the same individuals31. We determined that 11 SGBs were more abundant in the dental plaque (7 of the top 8 species), whereas 5 were more abundant in the tongue dorsum (Extended Data Fig. 5a), thus hinting at a potential major contribution of biofilm-forming microbes in the intestinal CRC microbiome.

To test whether the microbiome biomarkers for CRC were associated with the presence of the primary tumor in the gut, we evaluated the microbiome potential to discriminate between patients with stage IV CRC who had an in situ primary tumor and patients with resected primary tumor from the AtezoTRIBE study. We obtained a LODO AUC = 0.78 with a classifier trained on all the other studies for distinguishing between cases and controls. In addition, 13 (11 oral) of the 20 SGBs most associated with CRC (Fig. 2b) were also significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant when the primary tumor is present rather than resected (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). Overall, this reinforces the relevance of oral-to-gut introgression by oral commensals18 and that the primary tumor microenvironment determines the overall stool microbiome signature in CRC.

We investigated the microbiome's functional repertoire alteration in CRC-affected individuals (Supplementary Table 6). In agreement with previous work18, the cutC gene showed higher abundance in CRC-associated metagenomes (CRC versus control SMD = 0.28; q = 0.001) (Supplementary Table 6). In total, 241 MetaCyc pathways were also positively associated with CRC (q < 0.1) and 68 with controls (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 6). At the enzyme level, sulfur-producing enzymes were associated with CRC (including EC 4.4.1.2 homocysteine desulfhydrase (SMD = 0.52, q < 0.001) and EC 1.8.1.8 protein disulfide reductase (SMD = 0.41, q < 0.001)), consistent with previous work32 (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 6). In addition, the association between CRC and two pathways involved in the production of oleate in aerobes (PWY-6282 (SMD = 0.4, q < 0.1) and PWY-7664 (SMD = 0.9, q < 0.1)) (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 6) corroborated a previous hypothesis of an association between oleate and the proliferation of cancerous cells33.

We then tested whether increased ammonia levels are characteristic of CRC tumor microenvironments34 and found several pathways and enzymes involved in ammonia production or sequestration that were significantly altered in the presence of CRC. In particular, l-histidine degradation pathways were more frequently encoded in CRC metagenomes (meta-analysis SMD = 0.41, 0.32, respectively, q < 0.1) (Supplementary Table 6). The first step of this pathway involves the enzyme histidase (EC 4.3.1.3) cleaving an amino group off l-histidine to create urocanate and ammonia as by-products, and this histidase was similarly enriched in CRC (SMD = 0.46, q < 0.1), late CRC (SMD = 0.18, P = 0.02) and metastatic CRC metagenomes (SMD = 0.35, q < 0.1). In addition, a second ammonia lyase enzyme, methylaspartate ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.2), was also highly associated with CRC metagenomes (SMD = 0.45, q < 0.1) and the opposite for l-histidine biosynthesis (SMD = −0.33, q < 0.1) (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Table 6). The tumor microenvironment of CRC was previously characterized as having increased levels of host-produced ammonia, leading to T cell exhaustion34, but our results suggest a potential role for gut microbiota in ammonia regulation in the tumor microenvironment.

To assess whether CRC-associated gut microbiome alterations are stage specific, we considered samples in each stage separately as well as combined into early (0–II) versus late (III–IV) CRC. We observed no strong differences when discriminating between healthy individuals and patients with colorectal adenoma (Fig. 3a). By contrast, controls and adenomas were distinct when contrasted to early or late CRC stage metagenomes (Fig. 3a) with the highest AUC values obtained when comparing stage II and stage IV against controls (average AUC of 0.88 and 0.86, respectively) and adenomas (average AUC of 0.7 and 0.81) (Fig. 3a). The high AUC values obtained when classifying controls versus early stages individually confirm that the microbiome already differentiates at the beginning of the disease. Single stages were also partly distinguishable among themselves (AUC of 0.65 and 0.71 for stage I versus stage II and for stage I versus stage IV, respectively) (Fig. 3a).

a, LODO AUC predictions based on taxonomic microbiome composition (upper) and microbial functional potential (lower). Paired comparisons are indicated in the header (Class 1 versus Class 2). Each cell contains the AUC from a random forest validated in LODO, tested on the study reported in the row and trained on the remaining studies. The last five rows of the matrix report the average LODO AUC values predicted using oral microbes, all SGBs except the oral ones, EC profiles, pathways profiles and a subset of the gene families (Methods). b,c, Significant species (Hedges' model effect size P < 0.01, none presented q < 0.1) found in association either with earlier or later stages in meta-analysis considering the following comparisons (all presented I2 < 50%). b, Stages 0–II versus stages III–IV. c, Stages 0–III versus stage IV. The shape of each point indicates the dataset-specific effect size for each species, and the blue diamonds indicate Hedges' model effect size on SMD. P values were computed via two-tailed t-test. SMD values were corrected for age, sex and BMI and indicated by a star (blue if P < 0.01). Oral SGBs are highlighted in bold. g, group.

We then investigated which microbial SGBs were differentially abundant in early and late CRC stages, as well as in metastatic CRC. We found 17 SGBs associated with late CRC, but only four associated with early CRC (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 6). Among the former were five SGBs of oral origin: Slackia exigua SGB14784, P. micra SGB6653, Solobacterium SGB6833, Dialister pneumosintes SGB5842 and Streptococcus mutans SGB8000. Interestingly, P. micra SGB6653 was already increased in stage I, along with G. morbillorum SGB7295, while F. nucleatum SGB6007, despite being significantly increased in stage I, appeared to be consistently more abundant starting in stage II of CRC (Supplementary Table 8). We note that stage-specific taxa are usually part of the whole CRC versus healthy state signature (8 of the 17 significant SGBs between early versus late CRC) indicating a continuum in microbiome trends along stages rather than distinct configurations.

Among the nine SGBs significantly more abundant in stage IV, H. hathewayi SGB4741 showed the greatest increase in abundance (Fig. 3c) with Methanobrevibacter smithii SGB714 also among the top associated species (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 6).

Considering pathways, we found four pathways differential between early versus late CRC (P < 0.01) (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 6), while 14 were increased in stage IV versus all the other stages combined (q < 0.1) (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Although few microbial pathways were found to be associated with late or early CRC stages, we confirmed the previously reported association between methane metabolism and stage IV CRC15 (METHANOGENESIS-PWY, SMD = 0.4, P < 0.01) (Supplementary Table 6).

We then investigated SGBs showing particularly consistent trends of increased or decreased abundance across all CRC stages (Methods, Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9). Two such examples were P. micra SGB6653 and F. nucleatum SGB6007, in which the abundance started to increase at stage I (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9). Conversely, Akkermansia muciniphila (SGB9226 and SGB9228) and Parabacteroides distasonis SGB1934 were generally more abundant in later stages of CRC (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9). These results suggest that the microbiome changes in late-stage CRC17,18,19 occur predominantly on a continuum and become more pronounced as the cancer progresses (Fig. 4b).

a, Linear mixed model coefficients (in the heatmap cells) showing the associations between each microbial species and each stage when compared with controls. Positive values (from orange to brown) indicate increased stage SGB abundances compared with in controls, while negative coefficients (blue) indicate decreased abundances. Significant associations (q < 0.1) are indicated by a star. Associations also found significant in either right- or left-sided CRC for each stage (q < 0.1) are indicated by a right- or left-pointing triangle, respectively. Oral SGBs are highlighted in bold. Box plots represent the distribution of three SGBs with significant changes in the abundances in CRC stages. b, Jaccard similarities between the signatures of sequential CRC stages. c, Overlap for CRC stages signatures with oral SGBs and the species associated with cardiometabolic risk in the PREDICT 1 (P1) study, with T2D, IBD, CD and inflammatory diseases (Intest./Syst. infl.). The number of stage-associated SGBs is reported on top of each column. The number of SGBs in each signature is reported at the end of each row. d, LODO AUC for right-sided versus left-sided CRC classification, considering all SGBs, oral SGBs only, nonoral SGBs, EC numbers, MetaCyc pathways or a subset of all the gene families (Methods). e, SGBs significantly associated (q < 0.1) either with right- or left-sided CRC. Meta-analysis Hedges' g is indicated by a diamond, while the SMD values corrected for age, sex and BMI are indicated by a star (blue if q < 0.1). Oral SGBs are in shown bold. f, SMD values of a meta-analysis of right- versus left-sided tumor-related microbiome composition (y axis) versus the coefficients of a meta-analysis of stages 0–II versus stages III–IV (x axis, left), and 0–III versus stage IV (x axis, right) for taxonomic profiles. Common signature SGBs are in shown orange (q < 0.1 and P < 0.01, respectively); SGBs significant in the cancer stages meta-analysis are shown in green (P < 0.01); SGBs significant in the meta-analysis for tumor location are shown in blue (q < 0.1); and SGBs not significant in both analyses are shown in gray. Asin-sqrt rel. ab., arcsine square root transformed relative abundance; C, Candidatus; g, group; Intest., ; N.T., not tested in the corresponding analysis.

Because cardiometabolic disorders and CRC share many risk factors35, we quantified the overlap in microbial biomarkers between adenoma and CRC stages with respect to oral species, other human diseases and cardiometabolic markers36 (Fig. 4c and Methods). SGBs characteristic of CRC stages I–IV included ~25% of species associated with cardiometabolic risk; stage 0 CRC shared the highest proportion of oral bacteria compared with the other stages (58%); stage I CRC showed the highest percentage of species in common with poor cardiometabolic health (27%) (Fig. 4c). All CRC stages shared SGBs with Crohn's disease (CD) and immune-mediated diseases (Fig. 4c), while stage IV shared 21% of SGBs with poor cardiometabolic health markers and less with immune-mediated diseases (Fig. 4c). Importantly, the microbial signatures of these three conditions have only two SGBs in common (H. hathewayi SGB4741 and Enterocloster aldensis SGB476). Overall, these results indicate a high proportion of SGBs associated with poor cardiometabolic health in all stages of CRC and in adenomas, and a high degree of oral species during CRC development, which is also shared across inflammatory diseases (intestinal or systemic)37,38, and generalized inflammatory conditions characterizing metastatic tumors.

We found that differences in the mucosal microbiome according to primary tumor location21,22 extend to stool metagenomics (average AUC = 0.66 across cohorts) when using all SGBs (min = 0.58, max = 0.77) and similarly when limited to oral SGBs (average AUC = 0.6) (Fig. 4d). This underscores a difference in microbiome composition that can be relevant for side-specific mechanistic models.

Among the 61 tumor location differential SGBs (q < 0.1), we found that three oral-typical SGBs (Veillonella parvula SGB6939, Veillonella atypica SGB6936 and Trueperella pyogenes SGB17137) were significantly increased in right-sided CRC (Fig. 4e Supplementary Table 6). In addition, seven of the ten SGBs associated with right-sided CRC (q < 0.1) were nonoral SGBs. Among these, we identified Streptococcus parasanguinis SGB8071, which was shown to form biofilms with Veillonella spp.39, suggesting that such interactions may be more characteristic of right-sided CRC22. Importantly, only a few SGBs were found in common when comparing the signature for primary tumor location with CRC stages: Christensenellaceae NSJ_44 SGB7265 and P. micra SGB6653 when considering early versus late stages (Fig. 4f), and Clostridia SGB15390, Clostridium sp. Marseille P3244 SGB29302 and GB45495 SGB63167 when considering nonmetastatic versus metastatic CRC (Fig. 4f). We observed a similar behavior also when considering microbial pathways (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 10), reinforcing the notion that primary tumor location is a subtle but detectable factor to account for when studying gut microbiome alterations in patients with CRC.

We then investigated within-species differential gene carriage and diverging phylogenetic features among strains associated with CRC status and stage. We assessed differential gene family carriage (UniRef90s) for 179 SGBs detectable at sufficient prevalence using generalized linear models (GLMs). This identified 62 species that are typically not differentially abundant between cancer conditions, but rather whose strains differentially carried at least one gene family (UR90) in CRC (GLM false discovery rate (FDR) global q < 0.05 and absolute coefficient estimate >1) (Methods and Supplementary Table 9). Many of the species containing the most genetically differential strains were also identified as nonoral CRC-associated, including species of the genus Klebsiella, E. coli, B. fragilis and H. hathewayi (Fig. 5a). Nine of the 20 species with the highest number of differentially carried genes had genes enriched in both CRC and controls, highlighting the degree to which strains in the same SGB can differ in functional potential during CRC. Intriguingly, several species carrying a subset of genes solely in CRC were more typically quantified as human commensals, such as Odoribacter splanchnicus and Dorea longicatena, suggesting that some strains of these species may be unusually detrimental or CRC-responsive.

a, Top 20 species by the number of significantly differentially carried genes among their strains in CRC (FDR global q < 0.05 and absolute GLM coefficient estimate >1), likely representing species diversity. For the top 20 species, we quantified the number of genes they were differentially carrying along with the dispersion of such genes in CRC and healthy subjects as quantified by Anpan. Tick marks indicate individual genes. b, GO terms identified as having the highest ratio of significantly called UniRef90s (genes) in CRC to total genes defined in the term. GO terms are drawn from biological processes (BP) and molecular functions (MF) and are split across known gene families (annotated directly to GO by HUMAnN and predicted from FUGAsseM, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/fugassem/) using samples with paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to assess the likely function of undescribed gene families. (1) Respiratory electron transport chain; (2) bacterial-type flagellum-dependent cell motility; (3) bacterial-type flagellum organization; (4) amino acid transmembrane transport; (5) site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (adenine-specific) activity; (6) phosphorelay sensor kinase activity; (7) oxidoreductase activity, acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors; and (8) NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) activity. c, Carriage of genes previously known to associate broadly with CRC; colibactin, fragilysin and cutC genes, by specific clades' strains in the CRC ecosystem as quantified by Anpan's gene model. Although these genes did not show significance when assessed in species, they did at the global level (for example, when considering total carriage of the function in CRC metagenomes). d, The significant genes involved in the carbon–nitrogen GO term (b) were expanded and broken down by species carrying the genes. For each species-gene pair, we quantified the prevalence of the gene's carriage in healthy controls and CRC cases. Many of the genes predicted to be in this category were annotated by FUGAsseM and as such are predictions of the potential function but are otherwise genes of unknown function. AA, amino acid; ETC, electron transport chain; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; TMA, trimethylamine.

We then identified pathways specific to CRC-enriched or CRC-depleted strains using a subset of these differential genes that possessed at least some functional characterization. Many molecular functions were altered in CRC-associated microbes. Among the known functions identified using HUMAnN28 (Methods), the SOS response (GO:0009432)—a broad term for cellular response to DNA damage—was more frequently carried by Streptococcus equinus strains in CRC. Gene families from Tyzzerella nexilis and Butyricimonas virosa were also predicted to fall in this GO term (Methods) and be differentially carried in CRC. Consistent with community-wide results, we also found that succinate dehydrogenase activity was more encoded by Parasutterella excrementihominis strains in CRC, which also fits the hypothesis that this fatty acid is more readily available in the CRC-associated ecosystem40 (Fig. 5b).

Although not significant, the carriage of colibactin-producing genes by E. coli and Klebsiella spp. was increased in CRC (Anpan GLM; q > 0.01 and abs(coefficient estimate) < 1 (a measure of effect size)). This could indicate several potential hypotheses including: (1) that we did not capture the correct time point for an impact of pks+ E coli on CRC progression; (2) low levels of this gene are always encoded and activation is required for the toxicity41; or (3) colibactin is responsible for a minority of CRCs (Fig. 5c). We propose similar hypotheses for the B. fragilis toxin fragilysin, for which the gene was not enriched in CRC (Fig. 5c). Finally, no significant enrichment of cutC-related enzymes was observed, suggesting that the increased prevalence of this gene was due to the increased abundance of the species carrying this gene, and not the selection for this gene in a species (Fig. 5c).

Carbon–nitrogen lyase carriage was also of interest (Fig. 5b,d), because genes in this molecular function produce ammonia. Increased ammonia levels have been shown to contribute to T cell exhaustion and suppressed immune activity in CRC, and recently the microbiome was potentially implicated in this process in mice34. Here, we identified five species encoding genes involved in ammonia production in the CRC ecosystem, including Klebsiella oxytoca, O. splanchnicus, Bacteroides intestinalis, P. excrementihominis and Clostridioides difficile (Fig. 5d). These included the argininosuccinate lyase gene, which was carried by P. excrementihominis (Fig. 5d) and has ammonia as a known product of its molecular activity34.

We then expanded the gene carriage model that indicated the likelihood of distinct strain carriage in species in the CRC ecosystem, with a complementary within-species phylogenetic model via dominant strain profiling at single-nucleotide resolution using StrainPhlAn 4 (ref. 25). This identified several species with an expected log point-wise predictive density (ELPD) of 4, thus carrying dominant strains in distinct phylogenetic lineages in CRC (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10), including early–late (Supplementary Table 10) and nonmetastatic–metastatic comparisons (Supplementary Table 10). We considered a clade significant if the phylogenetic model improved ELPD over a base GLM (the same model without phylogenetic information) by more than a factor of 2. Eight species exhibited differential strain carriage in the broad definition of CRC (stages 0–IV) (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Table 10 and Methods), while only two species were associated with primary tumor location (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10), four with early–late (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10) and 27 with metastasis (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10). Of these associations, only three were identified in species that were also overall significantly differentially abundant (SMD q < 0.1) in the same contrast (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Tables 6 and 9), indicating that subspecies phylogenetic differentiation can be driven orthogonally to the enrichment or depletion of species inhabiting these ecosystems.

a, Several species exhibited within-species subclade associations with CRC, late CRC, metastatic CRC and the primary tumor location (right or transverse colon versus left colon or rectum). Only two of the associations were identified in species that were themselves differentially abundant with CRC in the meta-analysis, emphasizing the different pressures on colonization and growth versus phylogeny and evolution. Species are shown if the GLM improvement with phylogeny was greater than an ELPD of 4. Points are colored by the Hedges' g value of the species-level meta-analysis in the given comparison, and the number of tips in the analysis is presented in the barplot, colored by CRC or control, early or late stages of CRC or right- or left-sided. Error bars represent 95% CI. b, Within-species subclade clustering obtained via Anpan analysis with CRC as the outcome of interest. Here, we highlighted two examples of Lachnospira eligens and E. rectale (full model results from Anpan in Supplementary Table 10) exhibiting phylogenetically distinct subclades associated with CRC or healthy individuals. For each cladogram, the inner ring is colored by CRC or control, tips are colored by stage and the outer ring is the mean posterior phylogenetic effect as calculated by Anpan's phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) model with covariates of age, sex and study. c,d, Within-CRC comparisons had more significant hits than global analysis (CRC or control). Here, we present some of the top hits from the model with Collinsella aerofaciens SGB14546, Clostridium fessum SGB4705 and F. prausnitzii 15318 (c) for the metastatic comparisons, and R. bicirculans SGB4262 (d) in late stages. Similar to b, the inner ring is the CRC stage, while tips are metastatic status and early or late, respectively, and the outer ring is the mean posterior phylogenetic effect (full model results from Anpan are given in Supplementary Table 10). e, Significant gene carriage differences by taxon associations in R. bicirculans (Anpan, q < 0.05 and abs(estimate) > 1). Genes differentially carried by R. bicirculans included those in carbohydrate metabolism, DNA mobility, and response to oxidative environments; all genes were found to be more present in late-stage CRC (III–IV) than in early-stage CRC (0–III).

Specifically, after controlling for sex, age and study, we identified both Lachnospira eligens (formerly Eubacterium eligens) and Eubacterium rectale strain phylogenies as differential in CRC (Fig. 6b). Although E. rectale has previously been shown to exhibit distinct genetics by geographic origin42, we did control for study as proxy of geographic location, thus indicating that this species presents further genetic differentiation in CRC in addition to geography. The Eubacterium genus is generally considered health-associated43, although some publications have hypothesized a potential role for Eubacterium spp. in cancer44, and others indicated anti-proliferation activity in culture45. Genetic differentiation among Eubacterium strains may thus help to explain these disagreements. Among other clades, many strains associated with CRC were in uSGBs, including several from Ruminococcaceae (SGB15265, SGB15260, SGB4181) and one from Lachnospiraceae (SGB5089) (Fig. 6a) families, indicating that not yet fully identified species may contribute to the tumor microenvironment.

The strongest signals from this phylogenetic lineage analysis differentiated early and late CRC, as well as metastatic and nonmetastatic CRC (Fig. 6a). All species identified as having subclades associated with early or late CRC were also identified in the metastatic–nonmetastatic comparisons, likely indicating that stage IV is a driver of these differences, which can also be observed across the two highlighted species, R. bicirculans (Fig. 6d) and Clostridium fessum (Fig. 6c). In addition, R. bicirculans was a top hit in both models and was found through the gene carriage model to also carry genes in CRC (Anpan taxon-wise q < 0.1 and abs(estimate) > 1) (Fig. 6d). Of potential interest, we identified several genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism as having higher carriage by R. bicirculans strains in later stages of CRC (Fig. 6e), for which it is known that carbohydrate metabolism is altered, and hypothesized that Firmicutes-specific metabolism could promote tumor differentiation46.

Noninvasive, early CRC screening and the identification of consistent alterations in microbial components of the tumor microenvironment and bowel still have substantial room for improvement. Metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiome was shown to be highly useful for both tasks. Here, we expanded on previous metagenomic work12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,28 to: (1) improve the accuracy and generalizability of metagenomic-based classifiers across populations; (2) identify additional relevant microbial biomarkers of tumor presence; (3) assess how tumor stage and other clinical variables are linked with specific microbiome configurations; and (4) investigate whether and how strain-level microbial features are linked with tumor presence and stage. By leveraging a total of 3,741 samples from 18 cohorts and applying new strain-level computational methodologies, our study has power and resolution to assess these clinically relevant outcomes.

Reproducibility of microbiome signatures in new cohorts and populations is particularly relevant for clinical screening. Based on our results, new cohorts should expect to observe an AUC of ~0.85 in CRC classification based on metagenomics, and this baseline value will further improve as more diverse and larger datasets are incorporated and as uncharacterized species are profiled by sensitive taxonomic profiling approaches25. We found all five SGBs assigned to the F. nucleatum species to be more abundant in CRC than controls, namely F. nucleatum subsp. animalis, vincentii, nucleatum, polymorphum, and a second SGB of vincentii, in decreasing order of association strength. This was in addition to other well-characterized CRC-associated microbes such as P. micra and B. fragilis. We also identified 19 additional uncharacterized SGBs with neither cultivated strains nor taxonomically defined species, highlighting a more complex CRC-associated microbial signature than previously appreciated. Our study also demonstrates that the in situ primary tumor is linked to the usual stool CRC microbiome signature, independent of the sidedness, confirming previous evidence that the primary tumor harbors usual CRC biomarkers, such as F. nucleatum47.

Investigations of the gut microbiome changes during early, late and metastatic CRC are key to better characterizing progression along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence. Although interstage microbiome shifts along with CRC progression are not as strong as those observed between CRC and controls, we found several biomarkers for late and metastatic CRC, as well as several microbial species consistently and monotonically increasing (or decreasing) from control to precursor lesion to bona fide cancer or advanced disease. In particular, late-stage CRC was found to be enriched in oral-derived species, such as P. micra—already involved in stimulation of tissue invasion pathways48—and H. hathewayi, which was shown to promote intestinal cell proliferation in in vitro experiments49. Compared with the other stages, metastatic CRC presented a higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii, supporting previous findings that link methane producers with stage IV CRC15. On primary tumor location, we found that the stool samples derived from patients with CRC originating from the right-sided and transverse colon were also consistently enriched in oral species. Because several oral microorganisms form biofilms when they accumulate in the oral cavity50, they may show the same capacity when they grow in the gut, which is consistent with previous observations of the tumor-free mucosa in patients with right-sided CRC22. Coupled with the observation that left-side originating tumors are more enriched in unclassified Clostridia species, this outcome indicates the potential for small differences in gut microbes based on the location of the primary tumor, which could be related to variation in the tumor microenvironment, and carcinogenic triggers.

Prokaryotic species are remarkably genetically and functionally diverse26, and part of the microbiome–CRC link may be because of differences among strains or lineages in SGBs. This study performed a comprehensive strain-level analysis for CRC and found several relevant associations, including the case of otherwise-typical gut clades exhibiting differential dominant strain genetics in CRC, as well as CRC-associated species showing increased encoding of some accessory genes. Such associations were stronger than those for genes known to be directly involved in carcinogenesis (for example, pks island and fragilysin), suggesting more prevalent shifts in microbiome composition for several genes potentially relevant to adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. Dominant strain carriage was particularly associated with CRC stages, with many species (27 of the 213 tested) having significant phylogenetic associations with metastatic disease, all of which were independent of significant species-level abundance changes during CRC. Although even larger investigations are needed to assess the extent to which these strain associations are clinically relevant, they provide targeted potential mechanisms to be validated.

We found several common patterns across multiple lines of investigation. These included the role of orally derived bacteria in shaping the gut microbiome in CRC, as previously observed at lower resolution18. We not only strengthened the notion that the number and cumulative abundance of orally derived species are significantly higher in CRC samples than controls and adenomas, but also found that later stages of CRC were particularly enriched for oral species. Similarly, to a lesser extent, patients with right-sided CRC presented a higher number of oral-typical commensals in the gut than left-sided CRC individuals. However, many additional nonoral bacteria were also associated with CRC, including those that have been previously associated with high cardiometabolic risk36. Interestingly, both adenoma and later cancer stages were enriched in species linked with poor cardiometabolic health and immune-mediated diseases, possibly indicating a role for such species as proinflammatory risk factors in CRC.

Despite reported evidence that microbiome changes along CRC stages act more like a continuum than as discrete and highly differentiating configurations, we still lack better characterization of the gut microbiome significantly associated with single-stage transition and of its potential impact on the development of distant metastasis. The increased availability of stool-based metagenomic screening tests can be further exploited in new large cohorts to also improve the detection of early-phase microbiome changes occurring in this transition. Our data suggest that translation into clinical application is an option ready to be explored.

Our study has some limitations in respect to being an association-based study, thus limiting our conclusions in determining any causal relationship between microbiome configurations and tumor progression and onset, for which, however, independent evidence has been reported10,11.

Overall, our study reinforces the robust identification of microbiome biomarkers that can be used in stool-based screening strategies and identifies compositional and structural characteristics of the microbiome associated with disease progression to be prioritized for mechanistic studies.

In this study, we performed a pooled analysis expanding the set of publicly available gut microbiome sporadic CRC cohorts with six newly collected and sequenced in house cohorts (cohort 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), for a total of 1,625 new shotgun gut metagenomes. In total, 555 such new microbiome samples were collected, consistently sequenced and profiled under the ONCOBIOME Consortium, a European effort to unravel associations between intestinal microbiome alterations and different cancer types (https://www.oncobiome.eu). Samples from cohort 5 derived from a subpopulation of the NHSII24,51, and cohort 6 includes CRC samples and controls collected at the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital and the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (Istanbul, Turkey).

Cohort 1 includes stool samples from 163 Italian patients with stage IV CRC enrolled in a multicenter phase II clinical trial (AtezoTRIBE, collected in the University Hospital of Pisa, Italy, NCT number: NCT03721653). Cohort 2 and cohort 3 (COLOBIOME and IIGM-CZ) comprise fecal samples from the Czech Republic collected by two different research institutes (Masaryk University in collaboration with Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute in Brno and Institute of Experimental Medicine in Prague; n = 204 and 124, respectively). Cohort 4 expands a previous Italian cohort at IIGM18 with 101 new samples. Cohort 5 includes fecal samples from 448 healthy individuals, 435 patients with adenoma and 14 patients with CRC from NHSII. Cohort 6 includes 18 patients with CRC and 39 control individuals from the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital and the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (Istanbul, Turkey). Public data considered here include four cohorts from China16,52,53,54, and eight cohorts from Austria, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United States12,13,14,15,17,18,19,55, respectively (‘Data Availability').

In total, we considered 1,471 CRC samples, 1,191 of which have detailed information about the stage of the disease. The combined dataset comprises 94 stage 0, 253 stage I, 257 stage II, 286 stage III, 301 stage IV CRC cases (for 280 CRC samples staging was not available). In addition, 344 stool samples derived from patients with right-sided CRC, and 645 from patients with left-sided CRC. A detailed description of the cohorts included in this study is provided in the following sections and in Supplementary Table 1.

Tumor staging was defined based on the TNM and AJCC systems56. The TNM system measures via a three-index method the amount of growth and spreading of a tumor in a patient. In particular, it accounts for growth of the tumor to the intestinal wall or nearby organs, with no invasion of lymph nodes (T), the amount of invasion of regional lymph nodes (N) and metastases (M) in distant sites. When TNM was available, we converted it to stage, namely stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III and stage IV56. We then considered stage 0–II as early-stage CRC and stage III–IV as late-stage CRC. In addition, we refer to stage IV CRC as metastatic CRC. CRC was categorized based on primary tumor location in two main classes: right-sided CRC, namely originating from the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure and transverse colon; and left-sided CRC, namely originating from the splenic flexure, descending or sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid junction and rectum57.

AtezoTRIBE (NCT03721653) is a prospective phase II clinical trial to study upfront systemic regimens in patients with unresectable stage IV CRC. Patients were not subjected to any other treatment at the time of the first stool sample collection. In total, we analyzed 56 patients presenting right-sided CRC and 91 with left-sided CRC. A further 16 samples with uncertain tumor location were considered only to study microbial trends in stages of CRC analysis. Sample collection followed the same procedure as described for cohort 3.

AtezoTRIBE is a multicenter study and the protocol was approved by the ethics committees at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Participants gave written informed consent before enrollment.

Patients were enrolled at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (Brno, Czech Republic) from 2015 to 2019, as reported previously21. Patient inclusion criteria were: (1) scheduled for resection based on preliminary screening (such as a colonoscopy), (2) no neoadjuvant treatment, (3) no previous CRC diagnosis and (4) with confirmed stage 0–IV CRC without multiplicities (single tumor). Stool samples were collected from untreated patients before the scheduled surgery. Patients performed the collection at home, the morning of their hospitalization for the surgery, using DNA-free cotton swabs (Deltalab) and brought the samples to the hospital, where they were immediately frozen at −80 °C until further processing. In total, this cohort comprises 2 adenomas, 8 stage 0, 42 stage I, 66 stage II, 58 stage III, and 27 stage IV CRC samples. Sixty-four samples derived from individuals affected with CRC primary location in the cecum or ascending colon, 21 from individuals with CRC primary location in the transverse colon and 107 from individuals with CRC primary location in the splenic flexure descending, sigmoid, rectosigmoid or rectum. Patients provided written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Stool specimens and clinical and demographic data were collected from 124 Czech individuals recruited in two hospitals in Prague and one in Plzen, Czech Republic58. The individuals included in this study, like those of cohort 4, were not included in a CRC screening program, but because they were considered at risk for CRC and thus recommended to have a colonoscopy test. Based on colonoscopy results, participants were divided into: (1) 59 patients with CRC; (2) 19 patients with colorectal adenoma (13 nonadvanced and 6 advanced adenomas; no serrated lesions were collected); and (3) 38 colonoscopy-negative individuals and with 8 hyperplastic polyps58. All the samples from CRC cases were collected at diagnosis, before any treatment.

Naturally evacuated fecal samples were obtained from all participants previously instructed to self-collect the specimen at home. Stool samples were collected in nucleic acid collection and transport tubes with RNA stabilizing solution (Norgen Biotek) and returned to the endoscopy unit. Patients performed the collection at home before their hospitalization for the surgery and brought the samples to the hospital, where they were immediately frozen at –80 °C until DNA extraction.

This cohort expands our previously published cohort (cohort 1 in ref. 18) and comprises 181 stool samples from Clinica S. Rita, Vercelli, Italy, of which 59 were from controls, 36 were from patients with adenomas and 86 were CRC samples (2 stage 0, 16 stage I, 25 stage II, 30 stage III and 5 stage IV)58. Among the CRC cases, 30 had tumors originating from the right colon, 6 from the transverse and 49 from the left colon or rectum. All the samples were from sporadic CRC cases, collected at diagnosis before any treatment. Samples were collected in the same way as cohort 3.

The local ethics committees of Azienda Ospedaliera SS. Antonio e Biagio e C. Arrigo of Alessandria (Italy, protocol no. Colorectal miRNA CEC2014), AOU Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino (Italy), the Institute of Experimental Medicine of Prague (Czech Republic), Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (protocol no. 2018/865/MOU) and Masaryk University of Brno (Czech Republic, protocol no. EKV2019-044) approved the study (cohorts 2, 3 and 4). All patients gave written informed consent following the Declaration of Helsinki before participating in the study.

NHSII is a cross-sectional, prospective study of CRC-related gut microbial composition. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and those of participating registries as required. Participants provided written informed consent before study enrollment and stool collection. Specifically, this study recruited a subpopulation of NHSII24,51, a long-running prospective cohort from the United States. All participants contributed a stool sample, with the research aiming to investigate the role of the gut microbiome specifically in participants with recent adenomas. The adenoma (n = 435) and CRC cases (n = 14) in the study were one-to-one matched with healthy control samples (n = 448) based on age at stool collection, ethnicity, month of collection, state of residence and total number of, reason for and date of recent endoscopy. For a subset of cases (n = 39) the matching criteria for ethnicity (expanded definition of Caucasian) and age at collection were relaxed. Adenomas were further defined as high or low risk based on the location, number and histology of the cells. The CRC samples ranged from all stages and were limited as only a limited number of participants in NHSII have been diagnosed with CRC and recently contributed a stool sample. Previously stored, Genotek's OMNIgene fixed, and −80 °C frozen stool samples were processed and sequenced for shotgun metagenomics at Diversigen.

Patients with CRC were recruited at the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital while healthy volunteers contributing to science used as controls were recruited at the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (both in Istanbul, Turkey). Naturally evacuated fecal samples were obtained from subjects previously instructed to self-collect the specimen at home. For patients with CRC, collection was performed before surgical resection. Samples from participants who had used antibiotics within 1 month before the sample collection were excluded. Samples were collected in nucleic acid collection and transport tubes with RNA stabilizing solution (Norgen Biotek). Stool aliquots (200 μl) were stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul Turkey (ref no. 351, 19/11/2020).

DNA was extracted from stool samples with the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen), and sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep, (M) Tagmentation kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's guidelines. The library pool was subjected to a cleaning step with 0.7× Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (Illumina) at the University of Trento sequencing facility. Sequenced metagenomes were preprocessed using the pipeline available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing for: (1) removal of low-quality reads (quality <20), too short fragments (length <75 bp), and reads with two or more ambiguous nucleotides; (2) host contaminant DNA removal using Bowtie 2 (ref. 59) (--sensitive-local) for the phiX174 Illumina spike-in and human-associated reads (hg19); and (3) creation of paired forward and reverse and unpaired reads output files. Once preprocessed, ONCOBIOME samples presented an average of 37 million reads.

Stool DNA extraction and library preparation followed the procedure described for the ONCOBIOME cohorts. A final clean-up of the library pool was performed with 0.6× AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter), and then resuspended with one-third of the initial pool volume. Sequencing was performed with a NovaSeq 6000 at the IIGM sequencing facility. Cohort 6 was preprocessed with the same pipeline used for the ONCOBIOME studies.

For DNA extraction and sequencing, samples were sent to Diversigen and all steps were completed according to their standardized DEEPSEQ protocol. Briefly, samples were extracted with the PowerSoil Pro (Qiagen) kit using the automated high-throughput method on the QiaCube HT (Qiagen). This used Powerbead Pro Plates (Qiagen) with 0.5 and 0.1 mm ceramic beads, but otherwise followed the manufacturer's protocol. DNA amount and quality were assessed with a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen) post extraction. Libraries were prepared with a modified protocol from the Nextera Library Prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq using paired-end 2 × 150 reads (Illumina). Sequenced samples were then filtered for host contamination via the KeandData pipeline (https://github.com/biobakery/kneaddata). In particular, this pipeline consists of three main steps: a first trimming of poor-quality reads with trimmomatic60, specifically we applied a sliding window trim removing reads after four subsequent bases had a Phred score of 20 or less, and then reads with fewer than 60 base pairs were removed. Next, we filtered repetitive reads with the tandem repeats finder61, and removed adapters with trimmomatic. Finally, host and common sequencing components decontamination was completed with Bowtie 2 against PhiX and the human genome (hg37).

We applied MetaPhlAn 4 (v.4.0.0, database vJan21, with the ‘--statq 0.1')25 and HUMAnN 3.6 (ref. 28) profiling tools to produce microbial taxonomic and functional profiles, respectively. In addition, StrainPhlAn 4 (v.4.0.3)25 was run to generate dominant single nucleotide variant profiles for any species that passed the filtering steps in StrainPhlAn (213; species are filtered for sufficient markers and samples to run the tool). Newly sequenced samples and public data considered in this study were profiled consistently.

We considered metagenomic samples from 11 public CRC–control studies, 8 of which had already been included in previous meta-analyses18,19. Metadata for these cohorts were available in the curatedMetagenomicData27 package and the metagenomes were available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with the following accession codes: PRJEB7774 for Feng, Q. (2015)12; PRJNA531273, PRJNA397112 for Gupta, A. (2019)13; metagenomic data for Obón-Santacana, M. (2022)55 was requested from the authors of the study; PRJNA447983 for Thomas, A.M. (2019)18; PRJEB12449 for Vogtmann, E. (2016)14; PRJEB27928 for Wirbel, J. (2019)19; DRA006684 and DRA008156 for Yachida, S. (2019)15; PRJEB10878 for Yu, J. (2017)16; and PRJEB6070 for Zeller, G. (2014)17. Metagenomic samples for three additional public studies (Liu, N.N. (2022)54, Yang, J. (2020)52 and Yang, Y. (2021)53) were available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (accession numbers: PRJNA731589, PRJNA429097 and PRJNA763023, respectively).

This cohort12 comprises 154 Austrian individuals (61 controls, 47 adenomas and 46 CRC). Staging was available for 45 CRC (7 stage 0, 17 stage I, 9 stage II, 11 stage III and 1 stage IV), with 8 right-sided CRC and 38 left-sided CRC. Patients did not receive antibiotics in the 3 months before collection of the stool sample.

This cohort13 includes 60 stool samples from the same number of individuals from India (equally distributed between Bhopal and Kerala) divided into 30 controls and 30 CRC cases. All the fecal samples in this cohort were collected from people who were not subject to antibiotics close to the sampling date and had not been diagnosed with other diseases.

This cohort54 comprises 164 stool samples from an equal number of individuals from China (85 controls and 79 CRC cases). The cohort derives from the ‘Chinese cohort in Shanghai (CHN_SH)', whose patients were sampled after CRC diagnosis and before any treatment. All the cases include exclusively sporadic CRC. Control individuals were recruited in the Taizhou Imaging Study. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and case or control condition were retrieved from the original publication and the corresponding ENA portal project (PRJNA731589).

This cohort55 includes a subset of the participants in the COLSCREEN study. In total, 156 participants were selected (51 controls, 54 high-risk lesions and 51 CRC) and stool samples collected. Participants were asked to collect the stool sample 1 week before colonoscopy preparation and participants who reported use of antibiotics or probiotics within 1 month before sample collection were excluded.

This is ‘cohort 2' of the study18 and comprises 60 stool samples, collected from the same number of individuals recruited at the European Oncology Institute in Milan, Italy. In particular, the cohort consisted of 28 controls and 32 CRC cases for which no staging or primary tumor location information was available. No subjects reported antibiotic use in the 6 months before the sampling. For CRC cases, sampling was performed before surgery or any cancer treatment.

In total, 110 stool samples were collected from an equal number of US individuals divided into 58 controls and 52 CRC cases (12 stage II, 21 stage III and 18 stage IV; 15 right-sided CRC, 32 left-sided CRC). CRC samples were collected before surgery or any other cancer treatment14.

This cohort19 comprises 125 stool samples, collected from the same number of German individuals. The cohort included 65 controls and 60 CRC cases (3 stage 0, 15 stage I, 20 stage II, 10 stage III and 12 stage IV; 15 right-sided CRC and 42 left-sided CRC). CRC samples were recruited in the ColoCare study and fecal samples were collected after colonoscopy. Control samples were recruited in the PRÄVENT study.

This cohort52 includes 193 stool samples, collected from the same number of individuals and included 95 controls and 98 CRC cases from China (23 stage I, 36 stage II, 31 stage III and 8 stage IV). Stool samples were excluded if individuals used antibiotics, were subjected to radiotherapy or corticosteroids in the month before the sampling. Age, sex, case or control, TNM, stage and primary location were obtained from the original publication and the corresponding ENA portal project (PRJNA429097).

This cohort53 comprises 200 stool samples from the same number of individuals from the Fudan cohort (China) and includes 100 controls and 100 CRC cases. Only samples from individuals who did not use antibiotics or probiotics for 1 month before recruitment were included in the study. CRC stool samples were collected before colonoscopy or other cancer therapies and surgery. Only sporadic CRC cases were included, with no history of inflammation-associated CRC, intestinal bowel syndrome or other cancers. Disease categories (CRC or control) were retrieved from the original publication; raw metagenomes were obtained from the ENA portal accession number PRJNA763023.

This study15 comprises 616 stool samples from the same number of Japanese individuals subjected to colonoscopy. The cohort included 291 controls, 67 adenomas, and 258 CRC cases (73 Stage 0, 75 Stage I, 36 Stage II, 52 Stage III, and 22 Stage IV; 83 right-sided CRC, and 167 left-sided). Only sporadic CRC cases were considered, with no inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or abdominal surgical history.

This cohort16 comprises 128 samples from the same number of individuals, collected in Hong Kong, China, and included 53 controls and 75 CRC cases (12 Stage I, 24 Stage II, 24 Stage III, and 8 Stage IV; 11 right-sided and 54 left-sided CRC).

This cohort17 includes stool samples from 156 individuals from France, with 61 controls, 42 adenomas, 53 CRC cases (15 Stage I, 7 Stage II, 10 Stage III, and 21 Stage IV; 17 were right-sided CRC and 36 were left-sided CRC). Samples were collected before colonoscopy.

For the definition of the oral signature, we collected the data available from 5 datasets for a total of 495 healthy individuals for whom both stool and oral (either from saliva or tongue dorsum) samples were available for the same subject and time point. The identified datasets are: BritoIL_2016 (116 participants, stool and saliva)62, FerrettiP_2018 (20 participants, stool and tongue dorsum)63, HMP_2012 (85 participants with stool and tongue dorsum samples)31, KartalE_2022 (39 participants, stool and saliva)64 and NagataN_2022 (235 participants, stool and saliva)65. The oral signature was defined based on the distribution of specific microbial species that met the following criteria: (1) present exclusively in the oral cavity of at least 20% of participants; (2) found in both the oral cavity and stool of fewer participants than those that were exclusively oral; and (3) present exclusively in stool in fewer than 5% of participants. These constraints resulted in a signature of 235 oral-typical species (Supplementary Table 3).

To assess alpha-diversity we used the Shannon index (vegan R package) and the richness computed as the number of species present in a sample. Dimensionality reduction was been performed using the Rtsne function from the Rtsne R package, providing the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix as input. PERMANOVA was performed using the adonis2 function from the vegan R package with 999 permutations and blocked for study of origin by the setBlocks function, with and without including age, sex and BMI in the model. The distance matrix used both for the multidimensional scaling and the PERMANOVA is based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix estimated with the vegdist function from the vegan R package. We reported R2 for each test. Comparisons with P ≤ 0.01 were considered significant.

To quantify gut colonization by typically oral commensal species (defined in the previous section), we developed two quantitative scores. The ‘oral-to-gut score' for each stool sample sums the relative abundance of the oral SGBs present. The ‘oral-to-gut richness,' in contrast, counts the number of distinct oral SGBs present in each stool sample.

Because this work is a multicohort study and a batch effect exists in data from different origins, we used the meta-analysis of SMDs computed in each dataset instead of effect sizes computed from batch-effect corrected data as the primary approach for biomarker discovery. Our choice is motivated by the fact that correcting for batch effect is a difficult task, because of both incomplete information on batch effects (not only between cohorts, but also within cohorts), and the lack of a consensus approach for batch correction in microbiome studies. In particular, SMDs were computed with Hedges' method66 which adds a correction for low sample bias to Cohen's d estimator. Meta-analysis was performed using the metacont function from the meta R package. Between-study variance (𝜏2) was estimated via restricted maximum likelihood and CIs of the summary effect were adjusted with the Hartung and Knapp method67. This procedure was applied to all microbiome features with at least 10% prevalence and present in at least five samples in one of the testing sets when at least three studies presented a minimum of ten samples for each class. Adjusted P values (q values, in the text) were computed via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Significance was determined as Benjamini–Hochberg q < 0.1 or P < 0.01. Meta-analysis of standardized linear model estimates was applied to determine the effect sizes corrected for age, sex and BMI. Per-cohort linear models were fitted for each feature relative abundance (arcsine square root transformed) with the additive effect of age, sex and BMI. Once standardized by the standard error, we performed standard meta-analysis as described above.

For the ML analysis, we used the random forest classifier as implemented in the metaml tool (https://github.com/SegataLab/metaml)29. An ensemble of 1,000 trees with a minimum of 5 samples per leaf (grid-search optimal max features per split to consider in CV, and no other normalization performed) was trained and tested in the following settings on the data: (1) per-dataset CV (10-fold CV repeated 20 times); (2) across-study prediction (for each pair of studies the classifier is trained on one and tested on the other); and (3) LODO approach (each cohort becomes the testing set while all the others are used for training). CV comparisons were considered when presenting at least 15 samples for each class in one cohort, whereas between-dataset CV and LODO comparisons were considered when 15 samples were available in each class both in the training and validation sets. NHSII was included in the training set for comparison of controls versus CRC in LODO, but was not considered a validation cohort for the unbalanced sample sizes between the two classes. This setup was extensively applied in previous works18,28, allowing for robust comparison of our results with those in the literature. Relative abundance profiles (values in the [0, 1] range) were previously arcsine square root transformed. When testing for oral-typical or non-oral species, after selection, we rescaled the relative abundance to [0,1], and then transformed via arcsine square root. No other feature selection was performed otherwise.

For the reasons mentioned above, we decided not to integrate the studies in a single large cohort and perform batch-effect correction, previous to ML. Our approach treats each study independently and tests the strength of the trained model in the same study (per-dataset CV), in a different study (across-studies prediction) or in the left-out study when validated in LODO. This ensures that batch-effect correction does not introduce favorable bias in the classification tasks.

Linear mixed models, via the MaAsLin 2 R package68, were iteratively applied fitting each microbial abundance profile (after arcsine square root transformation) with sample condition (control, adenoma, CRC stage 0, I, II, III, IV) as the fixed effect, and originating cohort as the random effect. The MaAsLin 2 ‘LM' model uses the lmer function from the lmerTest R package. Correction of the P values of the coefficients from the models was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, as obtained from MaAsLin 2. For the fitting of each model, species were considered if they were at least 10% prevalent across all controls, adenoma and stages 0–IV. Concordant signature between stages was computed by applying the Jaccard similarity, which consists of the number of elements in the intersection between the signatures deriving from each stage, divided by the number of elements in the union between them. We applied MaAsLin 2 with the same setting to test SGB differential abundant between primary tumor locations in stage IV CRC. In both analyses, only associations with q < 0.1 were considered significant.

To complete subspecies clade-level association analysis with CRC, we used Anpan (v.0.3.0, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/anpan)69, an R package that quantifies the associations between differential gene carriage, subspecies phylogenetic structure and host phenotypic outcomes. The gene model in Anpan addresses two key issues: robust and accurate detection of species whose genes are well-covered in shotgun metagenomes; and sensitive detection of consistently associated genes with phenotypic outcomes. Anpan first filters samples to remove any without enough species-specific gene coverage to accurately assess gene-level effects. A GLM was then used to model each gene's association with the outcome (accounting for metadata covariates), followed by FDR correction. Here, our outcomes of interest were CRC or control, early- or late-stage CRC and primary tumor location (right-sided versus left-sided), adjusted for age, sex and study (which accounts for the geographic location of collection).

From the predicted genes with Anpan, we first quantified the number of significant hits per species, with a significance threshold of an absolute coefficient of 2 and q < 0.05. Next, we regrouped the UniRef90 genes to GO terms by direct matching. We also used annotations from FUGAsseM to add predicted GO term annotations based on metagenomic and metatranscriptomic covariation patterns. Specifically, FUGAsseM predicts the functions of uncharacterized gene products in the context of microbial communities by integrating multiple types of community-wide evidence. It extends ‘guilt by association' approaches by building an individual random forest classifier predicting gene function based on each data type, followed by an ensemble tier that builds an integrated classifier combining the learning results from the first tier. As a result, putative functional annotations are assigned to uncharacterized proteins that achieve high prediction probability.

Next, we assessed the phylogenetic associations with our outcomes of interest. StrainPhlAn trees (http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/strainphlan/) were used as input to phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models to assess phylogenetic associations with the outcomes. Phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models are probabilistic models that account for phylogenetic structure by encoding the tree structure as a correlation matrix. For these models, we also used age and sex as covariates and study as an offset variable. We referred to associations as hits if the phylogenetic model improved the ELPD over a base GLM (the same model except without phylogenetic information) by more than 2. ELPD is a model comparison metric akin to the Akaike information criterion.

We tested whether the inclusion of strain-related microbial features in a PERMANOVA leads to improvement in the model association or prediction. Because phylogenetic information was already tested via anpan, we developed a complementary approach for defining strain-level features based on strain preferences for a given nucleotide in marker genes. In particular, starting from StrainPhlAn 4 reconstructed multiple sequence alignments of the marker genes for the 213 SGBs, we selected genetic positions in marker genes with binary entropy at least 0.5 (to remove positions with little strain-level variability), by selecting those that presented the minimum number of gaps in clusters of 1-ANI (average nucleotide identity) ≤0.05 (to remove features very correlated to each other). We then expanded each position into five features using one-hot encoding, one for each nucleotide and one representing a gap. The value in each of these features can be either 1 when the corresponding nucleotide or gap is present in that position, or 0 otherwise. In this way, we obtained a total of 1,382,825 features across all the SGBs. Given the large number of features produced, we then applied an additional set of thresholds based on prevalence and removing collinear ones. In particular, features with <20% prevalence or prevalence >80% in the controls and CRC samples were removed, ensuring that very rare or too common base preferences were not considered, thus obtaining 42,094 features. We then removed features highly correlated (Pearson correlation >0.5) with any other feature, selecting the first occurrence as the representative and discarding all other features that correlated with it with a higher absolute Pearson coefficient than the threshold selected (0.5). This step produced a set of 2,722 features for the 0.5 Pearson correlation threshold. PERMANOVA tests with this feature set were performed as described earlier in Methods, specifying Jaccard as the distance measure.

The cardiometabolic microbial signature was estimated, as reported in our previous work25,36, as the species most associated with the set of cardiometabolic indices defined in ref. 36. In brief, partial Spearman correlations were computed between each SGB and the set of indices associated with cardiometabolic risk, correcting for sex, age and BMI. Partial correlations were ranked and averaged first in each category and then across categories to derive a global rank. Ranks ranged between 0 and 1 for the most favorable and unfavorable species, respectively, and we considered those SGBs with a rank above the third quartile of the distribution. We identified 115 SGBs representing a higher cardiometabolic risk and that account for 2.97% of the detected SGBs across all analyzed cohorts.

We compared the signatures found for CRC in meta-analysis with signatures for other disease types or groups or diseases. Specifically, we searched in the curatedMetagenomicData 3 repository for case-control studies for T2D (control n = 882, cases n = 750, four cohorts)70,71,72,73, ulcerative colitis (n = 247 and 84), CD (n = 291 and 83, three cohorts in total)38,74,75, inflammatory diseases (including asthma, Behcet syndrome, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and myalgic encephalomyelitis, n = 918 and 827, five cohorts)76,77,78,79,80. IBD was obtained with a quarry of ulcerative colitis and CD. We profiled their reads with MetaPhlAn 4. Then, to compare the microbial signature associated with CRC, we arcsine square root transformed all the MetaPhlAn 4 SGB-level relative abundances, we performed a meta-analysis of SMDs computed starting from a linear regression linking the disease state to the SGB transformed abundance and adjusted by country to take into account potential population effect. SMDs and uncertainty estimations were meta-analyzed via inverse variance weighting using Paule–Mandel heterogeneity. From the resulting tables, signatures for the six disease types were retrieved by selecting those SGBs having an FDR for the meta-analysis P value <0.1 and being found in a minimum of three datasets.

a) Richness of microbial enzymes and pathways in controls, adenomas, the different CRC stages and primary tumor locations. The abbreviations used in this plot follow the ones in Main Fig. 1. In particular, C: control, A: adenoma; 0: CRC Stage 0; I: CRC Stage I; II: CRC Stage II; III: CRC Stage III; IV: CRC Stage IV; R: right-sided CRC; L: left-sided CRC. b) t-SNE based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for taxonomic and functional profiles. The samples are colored according to CRC staging in the first row (light-green for controls, light-blue for adenomas, orange for early-CRC and brown for late-CRC), while they are colored according to primary tumor location in the second row (red for right-sided CRC and blue for left-sided CRC). The cohort derivation (either from ONCOBIOME, NHSII or public studies) is indicated as the shape of each point (triangle for ONCOBIOME, square for NHSII and a circle for public cohorts).

A) CRC sample relative abundance (%) of highly prevalent oral species (at least 10% in CRC). Each column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to an SGB. The upper threshold in the heatmap color scale corresponds to the 99th percentile of oral species relative abundance in CRC samples. Relative abundance values higher than this threshold are represented with the same color. B) Exclusive and common prevalence of SGBs in the oral cavity and in the stool samples of the cohorts used for the definition of the oral SGB list and (C) trend in the number of SGBs in the list at different thresholds of exclusive oral prevalence and exclusive stool prevalence. D) Distribution of the cumulative relative abundances of species categorized as oral or non-oral. E) Meta-analysis effect sizes (Hedges' g) of the oral-to-gut score computed based on different thresholds of the ‘Exclusive oral prevalence'.

A) The left-most phylogenetic tree shows the relationships between F. nucleatum SGBs and previously characterized F. nucleatum subspecies. Each leaf represents either an isolated genome (circle) or a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG, reported as a triangle), as available in the Jun23 release of the MetaPhlAn 4 database. The color of the leaf corresponds to the assigned SGB. Phylogenies were reconstructed using PhyloPhlAn 3. The correspondence between F. nucleatum SGBs and F. nucleatum subspecies is the following: subspecies hwasookii corresponds to SGB5997, subspecies polymorphum to SGB6001, subspecies animalis to SGB6007 (previously Fna C2, in 26), subspecies nucleatum to SGB6011 (Fusobacterium nucleatum sensu stricto), subspecies vincentii to both SGB6013 (previously Fna C1, in 26) and SGB6014, Fusobacterium simiae to SGB6018 and subspecies polymorphum to SGB101482. The right-most tree reports in addition the body site of origin from which the genomes were reconstructed. B) Phylogenetic reconstruction via PhyloPhlAn 3 of isolate and MAGs either derived from oral, stool, or unknown body site for Fusobacterium nucleatum SGB6007 (F. nucleatum subspecies animalis), Veillonella atypica SGB6936, Veillonella rogosae SGB6956, Veillonella dispar SGB6952, Streptococcus mutans SGB8000, and Streptococcus parasanguinis SGB8071. SGBs with ELPD > 8 from the PGLMM with body-site of origin as target variable are marked with an asterisk.

Correlation of the effect sizes estimated via meta-analysis (Hedges' g SMD values, on the x-axis) with the average ranked feature importance derived from the machine learning (LODO, on the y-axis). Significant SGBs detected via the meta-analysis for the comparisons tested in the manuscript (controls vs CRC, early stages CRC vs late stages CRC, non-metastatic vs stage IV CRC and right-sided vs left-sided CRC) are in black (q < 0.1) and red (P < 0.01). The comparison controls vs CRC showed the highest Spearman's correlation coefficient (0.41), with right-CRC vs left-CRC Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.21. This confirms the stronger biomarkers obtained by these comparisons, while the comparisons on stages presented non-significant correlation coefficients (Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.06 and 0.05 for early-stages vs late-stages and non-metastatic vs metastatic CRC, respectively).

A) Differential abundant oral SGBs in the signature of CRC between the oral plaque and tongue dorsum in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) study. We selected 86 participants of the HMP study with matched microbiome samples for the two oral cavity sites. Differential abundance analysis was performed via Wilcoxon signed-rank test and adjusted p-values (q) were computed via Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction. q < 0.001 is indicated with ‘***'. log2 fold-change (FC) between average relative abundances (RA) in the two sites is reported in the heatmap. Positive values of the RA log2 FC indicate increased relative abundance in the plaque, while negative in the tongue dorsum subsite. B-D) Validation of the machine learning and CRC gut microbiome signature between patients with in situ or resected primary tumor in the AtezoTRIBE study.

Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model q < 0.1) between controls and CRC. Associations with CRC present Hedges' g SMD > 0, and associations with controls present Hedges' g SMD < 0. Significant single-dataset comparison (q < 0.1) is reported in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (q ≥ 0.1) is in lighter gray.

A) Meta-analysis of sulfur-related pathways for controls vs CRC. Hedges' g meta-analysis SMD and 95% confidence intervals are reported in the first plot. Significance level is indicated via a color gradient. P-values have been adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling FDR. Single cohort effect size levels are reported in the heatmap, ranging from dark blue for SMD = −1.5 to dark red for SMD = 1.5. Mean difference in abundance with species contribution for each pathway is reported in the stacked barplot on the right. B-C) Overview of histidine-related microbiome pathways and their associations with CRC, staging and primary tumor location. B) Meta-analysis of histidine-related pathways for controls vs CRC, early CRC (Stages 0-II) vs late CRC (Stages III-IV), non-metastatic CRC (Stages 0-III) vs metastatic CRC (Stage IV), and right-sided CRC and left-sided CRC. Hedges' g meta-analysis SMD and 95% confidence intervals are reported in the first plot. Significance level is indicated via a color gradient. P-values have been adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling FDR. Single cohort effect size levels are reported in the heatmap, ranging from dark blue for SMD = −1.5 to dark red for SMD = 1.5. Mean difference in abundance with species contribution for each pathway is reported in the stacked barplot on the right. C) Visual representation of the biochemical mechanisms that lead to L-glutamate production from L-histidine, with the production as a side product of ammonium.

A) Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model P < 0.01) between early (stages 0-II) and late (stages III-IV) CRC. Associations with CRC Stage III-IV present Hedges' g SMD > 0, and associations with CRC Stages 0-II present Hedges' SMD < 0. Significant single-dataset comparison (P < 0.01) is reported in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (P ≥ 0.01) is in lighter gray. B) Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model q < 0.1) between non-metastatic (stages 0-III) and metastatic (stage IV) CRC. Associations with stage IV present SMD > 0, and associations with CRC Stages 0-III present SMD < 0. Significant single-dataset comparison (q < 0.1) is marked in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (q ≥ 0.1) are in lighter gray.

Each line-plot represents the trends of an SGB in adenoma and the different stages of CRC in relation to controls' abundances. Each point in the line is the coefficient from the linear mixed model (MaAsLin2) run to determine the association for each SGB and the different stages. Non-significant coefficients (q ≥ 0.1) are reported with a violet circle, while significant coefficients (either positive or negative, q < 0.1) are reported as a brown diamond. The x-axis of each line plot indicate the control, adenoma or stage: C for control, A for adenoma; 0 for CRC Stage 0; I for CRC Stage I; II for CRC Stage II; III for CRC Stage III; IV for CRC Stage IV.

Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model P < 0.01) between right-sided and left-sided CRC. Pathways associated with right-sided CRC present SMD < 0, and pathways associated with left-sided CRC present SMD > 0. Significant single-dataset comparisons (P < 0.01) are marked in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (P ≥ 0.01) are in lighter gray.

In the bustling Jatinegara market in Jakarta, cages are stacked three metres high, holding creatures from all corners of Indonesia and beyond. Bats, raccoon dogs, macaques and songbirds — sold as pets or food — are crammed together, their musky odours mingling with the stench of urine and faeces in the damp tropical air.

For decades, public-health experts have warned about the risks of infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans in markets such as Jatinegara, which are part of a global industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. These markets remain “the best way of transmitting diseases”, says James Wood, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Jatinegara's location, in an international travel hub with a population of 11 million people, increases that risk considerably.

Will bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising

Will bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising

The world is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which many researchers say probably started, or was at least amplified, at a market selling live animals in Wuhan, China1,2. Yet the wildlife trade still thrives in many parts of the globe. China banned the farming and trading of most wildlife species for food in 2020, but these practices have simply gone underground. “We are back to business as usual,” says Vincent Nijman, a conservation biologist at Oxford Brookes University, UK, with “millions and millions of animals being traded on a daily basis”.

The wildlife trade acts as a vast global network of unregulated natural laboratories, through which potential pathogens freely circulate, evolve and ultimately congregate in urban centres, says Andrew Cunningham, a wildlife epidemiologist at the Institute of Zoology in London. “It's the scariest thing we are doing,” he says.

Before the pandemic, there was a strong emphasis on identifying new viruses in the wild. These efforts were driven by the idea that it might be possible to predict which viruses could spark major disease outbreaks. But many researchers now say that this assumption was flawed.

Increasingly, scientists are looking to human–wildlife interfaces — including markets and the trade networks that supply them — as crucial sites for the study of zoonoses, human diseases caused by pathogens that normally infect other species. A handful of research groups are now working to understand how pathogens jump between species, why some jumps cause outbreaks and others don't, and what kinds of intervention can reduce the risks. But such work is costly, can be dangerous and demands sustained support, which has become increasingly hard to secure.

Without investing in such research, “you're really flying blind”, says Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. “You're making recommendations that may not be the most appropriate.”

In the veterinary room of Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, Tran Nam Trieu carefully lifts a Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) onto an examination table. The creature is curled into a ball, its scales subtly rising and falling with each breath. Confiscated near the border with China in early 2023, it is now in the care of Save Vietnam's Wildlife, a non-profit conservation organization that runs a rescue centre at the park. Delicately unrolling it, Trieu, a veterinary surgeon, reveals its soft pink belly and the wound from an amputation; its left hind leg was damaged in a snare.

The enormous demand in China for pangolin meat and scales — believed, without evidence, to cure a wide range of ailments — has made these creatures the poster child of the illegal wildlife trade. And studies of confiscated pangolins in China have detected several types of coronavirus that share up to 92% of their genome with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-193. Although too distantly related to have given rise to SARS-CoV-2, the viruses sometimes cause COVID-19-like symptoms in these animals and might have the potential to infect humans.

Other coronaviruses found in these pangolins are relatives of those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The virus spike proteins have a feature known as a furin cleavage site4, thought to be crucial for the viruses to replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract. The presence of a similar feature in SARS-CoV-2 has contributed to the suspicion that the virus might have been engineered by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — although it could also have arisen naturally.

Wood recognizes the “small possibility” that research-associated activities could have triggered the pandemic. But that “should not prevent us from focusing on the bigger picture”, he says: the wildlife trade poses a much greater zoonotic risk than do lab accidents.

25 million deaths: what could happen if the US ends global health funding

25 million deaths: what could happen if the US ends global health funding

To gauge those risks, Nguyen Thi Thanh Nga, a researcher at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Hanoi, and her colleagues are working to identify potential pathogens circulating in trafficked pangolins in Vietnam — a major transit hub for moving wildlife into China — and exploring how these microorganisms relate to those found in source and destination countries. Of 246 pangolins confiscated across Vietnam between 2015 and 2018 — many from the rescue centre in Cuc Phuong — 7 were infected with coronaviruses, although none had signs of respiratory or other systemic illnesses5. Partial sequences of these viruses closely resemble those of viruses found in pangolins seized in China.

Pangolins further upstream in the supply chain, however, seemed unaffected: none of the 334 pangolins confiscated from smugglers or rescued from the wild in Malaysia between 2009 and 2019 tested positive for coronaviruses6.

The increasing detection rate of coronaviruses along the supply chain is consistent with another study by WCS researchers, on rats captured and sold for food in Vietnam7. The team found that the proportion of rats that tested positive for coronaviruses was tenfold higher at the markets and restaurants where they're sold than in the fields where they're caught.

Some researchers are working to get a better handle on the human behaviours that help zoonotic viruses to thrive and spread. In 2017, Jusuf Kalengkongan, a behavioural scientist and founder of the Sulawesi Bat Conservation organization in Airmadidi, Indonesia, spent months living among wildlife hunters in villages in the province of Southeast Sulawesi. Capturing and handling bats can be dangerous work, he says, and some hunters develop fevers when wounds from a scratch or bite become infected. Rather than seeking hospital care, they typically take herbs and over-the-counter medications, he says. Village elders recalled a mysterious disease outbreak in which dozens of people died in a few weeks, Kalengkongan says.

Hung Nguyen-Viet, an animal-health specialist at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, is leading a similar project in Vietnam. Researching trade networks, he says, is sensitive work that requires significant trust-building. A key question his team seeks to answer is: what do people do when the wild animals they capture fall ill? Some people choose to eat them, whereas others try to sell them to unsuspecting customers at a market far away, says Nguyen-Viet. Few, he says, would report it to the authorities, for fear of consequences to their livelihoods.

Fur farming a ‘viral highway' that could spark next pandemic, say scientists

Fur farming a ‘viral highway' that could spark next pandemic, say scientists

Medical anthropologist Hannah Brown at the University of Durham, UK, says that attempts to regulate the wildlife trade need to take these fears seriously, or risk pushing the activity further underground. This happened when the consumption of wild-animal meat was banned in West Africa during the 2014–16 Ebola epidemic, which was suspected — but never proved — to have been caused by the eating of bats. Ten years on, says Brown, people there are still negatively affected by the policy and remain suspicious of the authorities and international researchers.

Some scientists have managed to cultivate the trust of wildlife traders in Indonesia. At the Langowan market in North Sulawesi, which sells both wild-animal meat and live animals, Tiltje Ransaleleh asks vendors about their supplies, the species they've sold and their origins. Beneath a canopy of red fabric that wards off the tropical Sun, Ransaleleh, a zoologist at Sam Ratulangi University in Manado, Indonesia, and her colleagues collect swab samples from bats lining the wooden stalls.

Her team has mapped an intricate network of supply chains and identified the intermediaries — who purchase wild animals (including up to one million bats a year) from hunters and transport them to markets — as a potential vehicle for disease transmission8. One insight gleaned, she says, is that festive periods are the riskiest, when sales can surge to 5 times their usual volume, with more than 10,000 bats sold in a single day at Langowan.

These in-depth studies of trade networks and human behaviour are essential for tracking the movement of wild animals and the potential pathogens they carry, says Stephen Luby, a disease ecologist at Stanford University in California.

Metrics details

The concentration of neurotransmitters inside synaptic vesicles (SVs) underlies the quantal nature of synaptic transmission. Uptake of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter, is driven by membrane potential. To prevent nonquantal efflux of glutamate after SV exocytosis, the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are allosterically inhibited by the neutral pH of the synaptic cleft. To elucidate the mechanism, we determined high-resolution structures of rat VGLUT2 with a cyclic analog of glutamate. We propose a mechanism of substrate recognition in which a positively charged cytoplasmic vestibule electrostatically attracts the negatively charged substrate. We also identify modification of VGLUT2 by palmitoylation and find that this promotes retrieval of the transporter after exocytosis. The structure also reveals an extensive network of electrostatic interactions that forms the cytoplasmic gate. Functional analysis of a mutant that disrupts the network shows how this cytoplasmic gate confers the allosteric requirement for lumenal H+ required to restrict VGLUT activity to SVs.

Sequence alignment of selected VGLUT homologs (line 1-5), other human SLC17 family members (line 6-11) and DgoT from E. coli demonstrates conservation across evolution and the SLC17 family of organic anion transporters. The sequences are listed in order of their sequence identity to rat VGLUT2, as in Fig. 4a. Residues are colored based on their sequence conservation, with red the most conserved and no color the least. This figure was generated with ALINE58.

Untransfected (UN) HEK293T cells and HEK293T cells transfected with internalization-defective wild-type (WT) VGLUT2, R88K VGLUT2 and empty vector (EV) were loaded with 3H-aspartate (a) or 3H-glutamate (b) and the efflux monitored at pH 7.4 and 5.5. Neither WT nor R88K VGLUT2 mediate the flux of aspartate. c, Effect of mutations on the surface expression of VGLUT2. HEK cells were transfected with WT, mutant VGLUT2 or empty vector (EV), biotinylated and the total protein (input) or the biotinylated fraction (isolated with streptavidin) immunoblotted for VGLUT2. The quantitation of fluorescent western analysis from 3 biological replicates is shown below as % WT. The data indicate mean ± SEM. **, p<0.01; ****, p<0.0001; ns, not significant by one-way ANOVA.

Source data

a, b, Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and SDS-PAGE of WT (a) and R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2 (b) in complex with an Fab show high purity and homogeneity. Green indicates Fab alone, red VGLUT2 with Fab. c, Glutamate uptake by purified VGLUT2 reconstituted into liposomes with TF0F1 ATP synthase. The R184Q/E191Q mutant shows significantly less glutamate uptake than WT. The activity was measured as ATP-driven 3H-glutamate uptake for 15 min at 29 °C. The ionophores nigericin and valinomycin (100 nM each) were used to dissipate ΔpH and ΔΨ, respectively. d, The assay for efflux from transfected HEK cells shows that the R184Q/E191Q double mutant confers robust glutamate flux. Error bars indicate SEM. n=3 biological replicates.

Source data

a, Details of the data processing strategy are described in the Methods section. Briefly, 3 rounds of 3D classifications were carried out in RELION to select high quality particles in the same conformation. The resulting particle stack was then refined and polished in RELION. To obtain the final map, polished particles were refined using RELION 3D auto-refine with a manually generated mask including only the VGLUT2 and Fab or using the nonuniformal refinement strategy in cryoSPARC with an automatically generated mask. Both maps resulted in similar resolution and quality. Final maps were then sharpened using Phenix Auto-sharpening and used for refinement and model building. Statistics of the final map were calculated using Phenix_comprehensive_validation tool51 and reported in Table 1. b, Sharpened coulombic density map of R184Q/E191Q was of sufficient quality to resolve the side chains of most residues. The coulombic potential density map is shown in gray mesh and model colored as in Fig. 2.

a and b, Docking of ACPD and glutamate. ACPD pose from the solved R184Q/E191Q-ACPD complex is shown in transparent green, interacting sidechains in blue (N domain) or pink (C domain) for R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2 (a), and green (N domain) or orange (C domain) for wild-type VGLUT2 (b). Best ACPD poses from flexible and rigid mode docking into R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2 are overlaid in opaque green and dark green, respectively. These poses are virtually identical, with all three functional groups in the same location as the solved pose (transparent). b, Best glutamate pose from flexible mode docking into WT VGLUT2, shown in opaque gray. The location within the binding pocket is similar to the solved pose of ACPD (transparent green); there is an average distance of 1.5 Å between the corresponding carboxyl groups of glutamate and ACPD near R88 and 2 Å between the corresponding carboxyl groups of glutamate and ACPD near R322. c, Position of aspartate at the beginning of an 800 ns simulation, determined by first placing functional groups in positions similar to the solved ACPD then choosing favorable rotamers. d-g, Tracking substrate recognition by MD simulation. d, Distance between the amine group of the ligand and the ring of F326 (dotted trace) or the sidechain oxygen atom of N450 (solid trace) is shown for the 800 ns R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2-ACPD simulation (green), the 1000 ns WT VGLUT2-glutamate simulation (gray), and the 800 ns WT VGLUT2-aspartate simulation (cyan). Gray bars indicate the time at which the snapshots on the left (e-g) were taken. ACPD adopts two stable poses during the simulation, with the amine pointed either towards the F326 ring (e, top) or away from it and towards N450, which also removed one interaction between the carboxyl and R88 (e, bottom). f, Glutamate adopts a single stable pose during the simulation. g, Aspartate is unable to interact with both arginines simultaneously and does not adopt a single stable pose. h, Root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of each ligand during its simulation. Numbers indicate Å.

a, Details of the data processing strategy are described in the Methods section and similar to that used for VGLUT2-R184Q/E191Q (Extended Data Fig. 4a). b, Sharpened coulombic density map of WT VGLUT2 was of sufficient quality to resolve the side chains of most residues. The coulombic potential density map is shown in gray mesh and model colored as in Fig. 2.

Models of cytoplasmic-open WT (a) and R184Q/E191Q (b) VGLUT2 were produced by overlapping the N and C domains separately with the crystal structure of DgoT in the cytoplasm-open conformation. The sidechains of R88 and R322 in VGLUT2 overlap well with the equivalent residues in DgoT. c, Structure of the binding cavity in DgoT is colored by sequence conservation (Extended Data Fig. 1), as in Fig. 3. d, Electrostatic surface of the inward/cytoplasm-open WT DgoT structure. e, Electrostatic surface of model of WT DgoT in outward-open conformation. The outward-open conformation of DgoT was generated by overlaying N and C domains separately with the structure of WT VGLUT2 in outward/lumen-open conformation.

Excess mass of 238.229 relative to the unmodified sequence, corresponding to a palmitoyl group, was observed in the precursor and in sequence ions including particular cysteine residues. a, Masses of b5 [Roepstorff-Fohlmann-Biemann nomenclature] and higher and y10 and higher indicate palmitoylation at C60 in peptide K56 to R69. b, Masses of b7 and higher and y8 and higher pinpoint palmitoylation at C62 in peptide K56 to R69. c, masses observed for y6 and higher indicate palmitoylation of C64 in peptide K57 to R69. Experimental masses of the most representative sequence ion peaks are labelled in the spectra, further indicating the fragment type. The position of fragmentation events generating these ions are indicated in the sequences over the spectra. A table indicating the theoretical masses of sequence ions according to the proposed modified sequences is shown on the right, with red indicating the observed fragments.

Metrics details

Psychedelic substances exhibit complex interactions with the ‘set and setting' of use, that is, the mental state of the user and the environment in which a psychedelic experience takes place. Despite these contextual variables' known importance, psychedelic research has lacked methodological rigor in reporting extra-pharmacological factors. This study aimed to generate consensus-based guidelines for reporting settings in psychedelic clinical research, according to an international group of psychedelic researchers, clinicians and past trial participants. We conducted a Delphi consensus study composed of four iterative rounds of quasi-anonymous online surveys. A total of 89 experts from 17 countries independently listed potentially important psychedelic setting variables. There were 770 responses, synthesized into 49 distinct items that were subsequently rated, debated and refined. The process yielded 30 extra-pharmacological variables reaching predefined consensus ratings:i.e., ‘important' or ‘very important' for ≥70% of experts. These items compose the Reporting of Setting in Psychedelic Clinical Trials (ReSPCT) guidelines, categorized into physical environment, dosing session procedure, therapeutic framework and protocol, and subjective experiences. Emergent findings reveal significant ambiguities in current conceptualizations of set and setting. The ReSPCT guidelines and accompanying explanatory document provide a new standard for the design and documentation of extra-pharmacological variables in psychedelic clinical research.

A guiding axiom of the psychedelic paradigm is that psychedelics' pharmacological effects interact with extra-pharmacological variables in complex ways to produce their powerful effects on consciousness1,2. Extra-pharmacological contexts, which include physical environments, music, attitudes and social interactions, are typically dichotomized as ‘(mind)set and setting'3. This concept was popularized in the twentieth century to explain how psychedelic drug effects can range from psychotic like to mystical like, from the same drug at the same dose3.

Psychedelic drugs are currently subject to intensive study as potential psychiatric treatments4,5. Despite the critical influence of extra-pharmacological factors on these treatments, there is little known about their relative importance6,7, their scope8 or the temporality of their effects9. There is no consensus regarding which non-pharmacological factors most influence psychedelic drug effects.

These major knowledge gaps are perpetuated by inconsistent reporting practices. A recent systematic review of 33 clinical psychedelic studies found that many trials failed to report basic aspects of their contexts, including study locations and physical environments10. Such omissions limit the transparency and validity of psychedelic research10,11,12; if psychedelic drug effects are indeed the product of drug-context interactions, methodologically rigorous research requires clear and reliable reporting of contextual variables13.

The primary aim of this study was to develop guidelines for reporting extra-pharmacological variables in psychedelic clinical trials, initially focused on settings, as has been done for other complex health interventions14,15,16. We aimed to generate guidelines that were parsimonious, straightforward to implement and reflective of diverse perspectives. To achieve this objective, our study used the Delphi method, an evidence-based approach to deriving expert consensus on complex topics through iterative surveys17. This method was selected for its capacity to integrate diverse forms of academic and experiential knowledge18, to facilitate discourse across vast geographical regions19 and to enable the productive exchange of knowledge across power differentials and hierarchies by preserving anonymity20. To guide future research, the study also aimed to evaluate how set and setting are currently conceptualized in the field.

In this study, ‘experts' were defined as people ‘having, involving, or displaying special skill or knowledge derived from training or lived experience'21. Experts were recruited among psychedelic clinicians, psychedelic researchers and former psychedelic clinical trial participants with significant knowledge or experience in at least one of the following related areas: psychopharmacology, neuroimaging, psychedelic-assisted therapy, clinical trial design and/or harm reduction. Expert panel diversity was established based on self-reported sociodemographic characteristics and professional affiliations.

This global Delphi study produced the Reporting of Setting in Psychedelic Clinical Trials (ReSPCT) guidelines, presented herein. Their 30 items represent the first international consensus regarding which specific non-pharmacological elements exert the most important influences on psychedelic drug effects, and thus warrant routine reporting in psychedelic clinical trials. These guidelines aim to significantly improve the quality of psychedelic research, much like other reporting guidelines have strengthened the evidence base of other clinical interventions.

Personalized email invitations to participate were initially sent to 149 experts, followed by an additional 34 experts identified by snowball recruitment. A total of 89 experts (48.6%) consented to participate, and all fully completed the first round. Thereafter, 73 experts completed round 2, 68 experts completed round 3 and 62 experts completed round 4, yielding a 30% attrition rate (Fig. 1).

Diagram showing the Delphi study flow, from recruitment to the final round. The diagram includes the number of participating experts per round, and the item's progression from inception to being accepted, debated, improved or rejected.

The demographic and professional characteristics of the experts who completed the first and final rounds of this study are presented in Table 1, and affiliations are listed at the end of the article.

Round 1 (n = 89) prompted experts to list up to ten variables that they consider most important to report in psychedelic clinical trials and to provide an optional explanation for their choices. This yielded 770 free-text responses and rationales, which often related to trial participants' senses of safety and comfort under the influence of psychedelic drugs. These responses were then coded and grouped into a list of 49 unique items (Supplementary Table 2). Each item had been independently suggested by at least two experts, with four items mentioned by at least half of respondents: music and sound (n = 74); objects, decorations and artwork (n = 55); number of people present (n = 52); and access to nature (n = 46).

In round 2 (n = 73), 33 of the 49 items (67%) from round 1 reached whole-group consensus thresholds. One of these, pertaining to aspects of the study protocol, was eliminated based on expert feedback that it is already subject to standard reporting practices in clinical trials, and 15 others were flagged for modification to address issues with coherence, uniqueness and/or implementability. At this stage, according to the study's original aims, items that were identified as being largely subjective—that is, pertaining more to set than to setting—were flagged for implementability issues.

Of the 16 items not reaching whole-group consensus, 12 met the consensus threshold in one or more subgroups. Among them, one item was rejected for having a low coherence rating, and another was rejected because of potential privacy concerns for research study personnel. Two items were merged into items that had already reached whole-group consensus, and two other items were combined into a single item to address issues with overlap. The subgroup analyses thus yielded seven items to be debated in round 3.

Overall, during round 2, 17 items were accepted as written, 7 items were rejected and 27 items were combined into 18 based on whole- and/or subgroup feedback.

In round 3 (n = 68), all newly modified items met the 90% coherence threshold, and the proposed combinations of seven items into three new items surpassed 90% acceptance. Re-ratings of the seven debated items, which had previously reached only subgroup consensus (Supplementary Table 3), resulted in two items reaching whole-group consensus and thus being incorporated in the final guidelines (Table 2).

Experts were also asked to vote regarding the potential inclusion of the five items collectively identified as referring more to set than to setting owing to their subjectivity. Despite the study's initial focus on setting variables, only 15% of experts voted to exclude these items from the guidelines. Rather, experts supported keeping these items as a standard component of the guidelines (46%) or as an optional subsection pertaining to ‘participant experience' (39%). On the basis of these responses, these five items examining subjective experiences were included in the final section of the guidelines (Table 3).

Overall, round 3 resulted in 13 additional items meeting criteria for acceptance. Added to the 17 accepted items from round 2, this produced the 30-item ‘Preliminary guidelines for reporting setting in psychedelic clinical trials' (Supplementary Table 4) with an overview of each items' progression from round 1 to round 4 (Supplementary Table 5).

Results from the final round (n = 62) are presented in full in Supplementary Table 6. At least 95% of responding experts reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the preliminary guidelines, and either agreed or strongly agreed that they reflect what is important for reporting in psychedelic clinical trials. At least 74% of responding experts said they would ‘definitely' use the preliminary guidelines, and 25% said they would ‘consider it'; only 1 (2%) expert reported they would not. Feedback provided from the study experts expressing hesitation about using the preliminary guidelines (summarized in Supplementary Table 7) informed further improvements, which subsequently obtained approval from the study experts and culminated in the final guidelines presented below.

Regarding the study methodology and process, at least 95% of experts rated the survey instructions as clear, the study structure as generally satisfactory, and both deadlines and time commitments as reasonable. Similarly, at least 95% evaluated the study as successful in identifying areas of agreement and disagreement, allowing opinions to be comfortably expressed, and ensuring that diverse voices had been adequately heard. Finally, 68% of experts reported that their conceptualization of setting had changed as a result of the study process, mostly in terms of the granularity, scope and depth with which they considered setting-related variables. The rates of reported changes in conceptualization did not differ between subgroups or geographical regions.

The final ReSPCT 2025 guidelines are presented in Table 3 (fillable format in Supplement 1 in the Supplementary Information) and available on the ReSPCT website (https://respctguidelines.com). They were collaboratively refined from the preliminary guidelines by the study leads and experts. The guidelines are accompanied by a comprehensive explanatory document (Supplement 2 in the Supplementary Information), also produced collaboratively, which provides detailed descriptions of each item, suggested reporting prompts, supporting expert responses and a brief summary of the literature on the 30 ReSPCT items.

The ReSPCT guidelines are composed of 30 items divided into 4 sections. The first section describes the physical and sensory environments to which participants are exposed during a dosing session, such as the study location, decorations and sensory reduction devices available to participants. The second section pertains to the dosing procedure, including the people present, music provided and interventions performed. The third section regards the trial's broader therapeutic framework and protocol, including preparatory and integration activities1, and study personnel qualifications. The final section explores key aspects of participants' subjective experiences, including evaluations of therapeutic alliances, comfort, and both physical and psychological safety.

As detailed above, an emergent finding of the study's first three rounds was a lack of clarity and consensus regarding the conceptual boundaries between ‘set' and ‘setting'. Additional questions were thus posed to experts in round 4 to explore perspectives on this influential concept (Fig. 2). When asked to rate their agreement with the statement that set and setting can be studied separately, almost equal proportions agreed or strongly agreed (37%) and disagreed or strongly disagreed (42%). Experts were also asked to estimate the conceptual overlap between set and setting, from 0% to 100%. Responses again ranged widely, with nearly equal proportions of experts estimating conceptual overlap as 20–40%, 40–60% or 60–80%, yielding an average overlap rating of 49%.

a, Experts rated their level of agreement with the statement ‘set and setting can be studied separately' on a 5-point Likert scale. b, Experts rated the conceptual overlap between set and setting on a scale from 0 (no overlap) to 100 (complete overlap). c, Experts indicated the span of setting in the context of a clinical trial according to the following options: from the start to the end of the dosing session, throughout the treatment phase (preparation, dosing and integration), from recruitment to follow-up or other.

In addition, experts were asked to define the temporal boundaries of setting across the standard phases of psychedelic clinical trials. About 68% agreed that setting spans from the start of a clinical trial's recruitment to the end of its follow-up. Only 16% considered setting as limited to the trial's treatment phase—generally entailing preparation, dosing and integration subphases1—and 10% considered setting to be confined to the actual dosing session.

The 30-item ReSPCT guidelines provide a new standard for the reporting of extra-pharmacological variables in psychedelic clinical trials, derived from an international Delphi consensus study of experts from 17 different countries and 50 different institutions. The contributing clinicians, researchers and past trial participants were selected to represent diverse forms of knowledge and perspectives, which were exchanged and debated throughout the iterative Delphi process. The final items span the physical environment of dosing sessions to important aspects of participants' experiences of psychedelic clinical trial settings. The guidelines, downloadable checklist (Supplement 1 in the Supplementary Information) and explanatory document (Supplement 2 in the Supplementary Information) can be found on the ReSPCT Guideline website (https://respctguidelines.com).

The items of the ReSPCT guidelines are intended to be reported in the texts or supplements of future studies alongside a completed checklist (Supplement 1 in the Supplementary Information). In the case of multisite clinical trials, we recommend completing the whole guidelines based on the overarching study protocol and setting, and also specifying distinct features of each site by, for instance, including photographs of each treatment room. This practice aims to strengthen the design and documentation of clinical research on psychedelic drugs and thereby improve the transparency, reproducibility and validity of this rapidly evolving field12,22. The adoption of these guidelines may also facilitate data comparison and aggregation across different groups and institutions23, and inform future dismantling and therapeutic studies6. Indeed, such issues recently prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to describe psychedelic therapies as a ‘black box'24 and contributed to their recent rejection of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder25.

The ReSPCT guidelines were designed specifically for psychedelic clinical trials but may be adapted to other clinical and research contexts. For instance, they may be valuable in research involving other acutely psychoactive substances, given that potent drug-context interactions have been found with multiple non-psychedelic substances—including alcohol, antidepressants and opiates11. In addition, the guidelines may facilitate more observational or pragmatic forms for psychedelic research26. The challenges of blinding in psychedelic research may prove to be insurmountable27; the ReSPCT guidelines could therefore support pragmatic study designs that prioritize the careful curation and systematic reporting of contextual variables over efforts to mask or minimize their influences26,28.

The study revealed diverse initial views regarding the relative importance of various components of settings. Some of the final items, such as music and access to nature, were independently suggested by most experts in the first round and retained high agreement throughout the study. Others, such as narrative framings, and the positioning of people in treatment rooms, were mentioned by few but rapidly reached consensus thresholds thereafter.

Two items that feature in the ReSPCT guidelines initially failed to reach whole-group consensus but were rescued by the debate process. For instance, in round 2, ‘Cultural competence and safety' (item 25) reached consensus only in two subgroups. Cultural competence refers to a study team's ability to care for participants with diverse values, beliefs and behaviors29, while cultural safety focuses on increasing health equity by encouraging healthcare professionals to examine power imbalances in patient-provider interactions30. In round 3, multiple experts supported this item's importance, citing concerns regarding power imbalances and a lack of diversity in psychedelic clinical and research contexts31,32,33,34. As a result, the item's whole-group rating increased from 50% to 73%, leading to its inclusion in the final guidelines.

The study process also identified challenges associated with how set and setting is currently conceptualized. Despite the study's original focus on setting variables, early results and a subsequent vote led to the inclusion of five items that align more closely with the concept of (mind)set in the final guidelines' last section. In contrast to the consensus achieved regarding the relative importance of specific extra-pharmacological variables, expert views on the concept of set and setting itself remained highly heterogenous. For instance, in the final round, expert views were evenly divided regarding the perceived overlap and the separability of set and setting variables.

The discrepant understandings of ‘set and setting' among experts probably contributes to inconsistent reporting practices in psychedelic clinical trials. The ReSPCT guidelines aim to bypass this confusion with an explicit list of 30 key extra-pharmacological factors that are understood as interrelated, rather than as dichotomous. That is, a study's environment and therapeutic approach may interactively shape participant experiences, and those experiences may influence how extra-pharmacological factors are perceived or even adapted. The guidelines thus prioritize specificity over simplicity in the aim of improving psychedelic clinical research practices. Further study is needed to evaluate whether the utility of ‘set and setting' outweighs its conceptual confusion in other contexts.

Despite the study's strengths, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the Delphi process was entirely survey based, which may have reduced the spontaneity and depth of dialog that can occur in face-to-face interactions. Second, the study's sample of experts did not represent the full diversity of perspectives on these drugs. For instance, the study's focus on clinical trials excluded broader, nonclinical perspectives on variables that shape psychedelic experiences. It also resulted in most experts being relatively young and originating from Western countries, where psychedelic clinical research is currently most highly concentrated. Relatedly, the study's definition of expertise reproduced known issues of the psychedelic field32,33, namely, the current lack of racial diversity among psychedelic researchers and trial participants. This limitation was only partially overcome through the study's subgroup process, given that 75–80% of the sample was White. Finally, expertise does not necessarily equate to truth, and opinions of current psychedelic experts must be situated in the current historical moment and body of knowledge. Although this study intentionally enrolled experts with diverse views on psychedelic drugs, there was general agreement that psychedelic experiences and the contextual factors that shape them are clinically and scientifically important. The study did not include, for instance, experts who suggest that psychedelic drug experiences may be more akin to epiphenomena35,36, which may have influenced the study's eventual findings. Further empirical research is needed to evaluate the actual importance of the variables that have been included in, or excluded from, the ReSPCT guidelines, and to discern those most relevant to clinical outcomes.

The ReSPCT guidelines aim to advance the study of psychedelic drugs and therapies just as reporting guidelines have improved the transparency and interpretability of other complex clinical interventions15,16,37. Its 30 items reflect a necessary, if preliminary, expert consensus regarding the most important contextual factors to report in studies of psychedelic drugs. The accompanying explanatory document serves to facilitate reporting and guide future research by synthesizing the current literature regarding contextual influences on psychedelic drug effects. The most up-to-date version of the ReSPCT guidelines and associated documents can be found at https://respctguidelines.com/. Routine utilization of these guidelines could significantly improve the rigor of psychedelic research, mitigate the ambiguities of current understandings of set and setting, advance our understanding of drug-context interactions, and potentially facilitate the future clinical implementation of these promising therapies in safe, transparent and effective ways.

The definition of ‘psychedelics' varies but is herein broadly defined to include the classical serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and dimethyltryptamine (DMT)38; ‘atypical' psychedelics such as ibogaine and salvinorin A; and other acutely psychoactive drugs used as adjuncts to psychotherapy, such as MDMA and ketamine39.

This project was designed and implemented according to the Conducting and Reporting Delphi Studies standards (Supplementary Table 8)40, in addition to other Delphi-specific guidelines available in the literature18,41,42,43. The study consisted of four sequential rounds of surveys, administered electronically in English using the digital platform Qualtrics, from April to August 2023.

The first round consisted of an open-ended question, while subsequent rounds solicited quantitative and qualitative expert feedback on the results of previous rounds. Free-text comments were solicited in each round. Consensus, our primary outcome, was defined a priori as a variable (or ‘item') being rated as ‘important' or ‘very important' for inclusion in reporting guidelines by at least 70% of experts, on a 7-point Likert scale. The 70% threshold was selected as a reasonable intermediate between cut-offs used in similar Delphi studies44, which can range between 51% and 97% (ref. 45).

Summary statistics and qualitative analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel, and plots were generated in both Excel and R (RStudio version 2021.09.0 + 351).

Clinicians and researchers were identified through searches of the academic literature, conference websites, psychedelic-related institutes or organizations, and the authors' academic networks. Snowball sampling was also used after initial invitations were sent46. Expertise was validated based on academic and professional qualifications, years of relevant experience and contributions to the field. Past trial participants were primarily recruited in collaboration with the cofounders of the Psychedelic Participant Advocacy Network (PsyPAN), a nonprofit organization based in the United Kingdom. The PsyPAN cofounders informed members about the study, and those who showed interest were put into contact with the study leads. Expert panel diversity was established based on self-reported sociodemographic characteristics and professional affiliations.

Although there is no standard sample size for Delphi studies, most include up to 25 participants45, and guidelines recommend at least 15–20 experts in any given subgroup for statistical purposes47. Accordingly, we aimed to recruit groups of 20 researchers, clinicians and past trial participants, for a total of 60 experts by round 4. Taking into account attrition, we sought enrollment of 90 experts for round 1 (ref. 48). All experts were recruited by email invitation, with a maximum of two reminders sent for each round. No new experts were sought once round 1 was completed (May 2023).

All participating experts were given the option to contribute as coauthors or be acknowledged in future publications, and former trial participants were additionally remunerated at a rate of £20 per completed survey, based on consultation with PsyPAN. This renumeration was supported with funding from the Imperial College London Societal Engagement Seed Fund, which supports patient and public involvement in research.

Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (reference number 6568054). All study participants provided online written consent at the beginning of the first survey. During data collection, participants were quasi-anonymous, that is, anonymous to other experts but identifiable to the study team43. After data collection, personal identifiers were replaced with unique participant identification numbers, with the identifying key encrypted and stored separately.

The first survey underwent pilot acceptability and fidelity testing with six independent experts, including the two cofounders of PsyPAN. In round 1, all experts were asked to list up to ten setting variables they deemed most important for reporting in psychedelic clinical trials, with the option to provide their rationale for each. The lead author (C.P.-M.) first coded all free-text responses in a nonhierarchical manner. Subsequently, the three lead authors collaboratively grouped these codes into broader themes and iteratively refined them to improve clarity and reduce redundancy. This process yielded a preliminary list of distinct items, organized into preliminary sections, with item descriptions summarizing the details and rationales provided by experts.

In round 2, experts were provided with the list of items and descriptions generated in round 1. For each item, experts were asked to rate the importance of its inclusion in the reporting guidelines and its coherence, that is, the clarity of its formulation and description, and to optionally provide additional feedback.

Importance ratings were analyzed according to the consensus threshold, both for the entire group and within predefined subgroups of experts according to gender, ethnicity, primary type of expertise, field of expertise and previous clinical trial experience (Supplementary Table 1). Subgroup analyses are not universal in Delphi studies47, but were conducted to identify minority opinions that may otherwise have been overlooked.

Items that reached consensus in the entire group or in any subgroup then underwent quality analyses based on coherence, uniqueness and implementability. Coherence was based on experts responding ‘yes', ‘no' or ‘unsure' to the prompt ‘I think this item is coherent/logical'. Uniqueness and implementability were established based on solicited free-text feedback. Items with less than 90% coherence ratings were modified according to expert feedback; items lacking uniqueness were combined with other overlapping items; items identified as having potential implementability issues were flagged for reconsideration.

In round 3, experts were asked to reevaluate the items that had reached consensus but had issues with coherence, uniqueness and/or implementability. For items modified to address coherence issues, experts re-rated the modified item's importance and coherence. For items combined to reduce excessive overlap, experts indicated whether they agreed or disagreed with the proposed combinations. For items with identified implementability issues, experts voted whether to keep them in the core guidelines, move them to a separate optional subsection or remove them altogether.

Experts were also asked to debate items that reached consensus in at least one subgroup but not across the full sample. They were presented with each debated item's importance scores for the entire group and for the subgroup(s) in which the item reached consensus, alongside representative quotes spanning the divergent opinions. They then re-rated the debated item's importance based on this additional information.

Lastly, experts were presented with a table of items that did not reach consensus in any subgroup and invited to voice any final opposition to their rejection from the guidelines.

In round 4, experts were asked to provide feedback on the preliminary reporting guidelines developed over the previous three rounds and to rate the perceived quality of the study process. In addition, based on emergent findings of the previous rounds, experts were asked to rate the conceptual overlap, separability and temporal boundaries of set and setting, and to report whether their understanding of this concept had evolved throughout the study. Quantitative feedback was solicited using various 5-point Likert scales, and qualitative feedback was collected via free-text responses.

Given the partially anonymous nature of Delphi studies and the personal opinions shared by participants, data will not be deposited in a public repository. Rather, deidentified individual-level data, along with additional study materials such as study surveys, will be made available upon reasonable request for a minimum of 5 years following publication. Requests should be directed to corresponding author C.P.-M. and include the following information: a brief proposal including study aims, data requested, planned analysis and credentials of the requestor(s). All requests will be reviewed by the study lead authors based on scientific merit, feasibility and ethical considerations. An initial response will be provided within 2 weeks. For accepted proposals, data sharing will be contingent on an executed data transfer agreement.

New research led by the University of Sydney adds to our understanding of how rapidly rising sea levels due to climate change foreshadow the end of the Great Barrier Reef as we know it.

The findings suggest the reef can withstand rising sea levels in isolation but is vulnerable to associated environmental stressors arising from global climate change.

Led by Professor Jody Webster from the School of Geosciences, the research was published today in Nature Communications. It draws from a geological time capsule of fossil reef cores, extracted from the seabed under the Great Barrier Reef.

The findings suggest rapid sea level rise in isolation did not spell the end of the reef's predecessor, Reef 4. Rather, associated environmental stressors like poor water quality and warming climates led, in combination, to its demise about 10,000 years ago (towards the end of the last ice age).

The ensuing one to two thousand years saw Reef 4 transition. Its shallow reef ecosystem moved landward to reestablish itself as the Great Barrier Reef we know today.

"This research shows us a healthy, active barrier reef can grow well in response to quite fast sea level rises," said Professor Webster. "It's the combination of additional environmental stressors, on top of rapid sea level rise, that lead to its demise.

The findings lend weight to already grave concerns about the Great Barrier Reef.

"The modern reef faces rising sea levels, more heat waves and extensive bleaching, along with increasing sediment and nutrient input. This combination, on top of rising sea levels, is of deep concern. If the current trajectory continues, we should be concerned about whether the Great Barrier Reef will survive the next 50 to 100 years in its current state.

"It won't die but its characteristics may change. We will see a different collection of coral species, perhaps simpler and not as structurally complex."

Learning from the 'proto-Great Barrier Reef'

The 15 to 20-metre cores underpinning this research comprise a mix of fossil coral, algae and sediments. They reveal how the reef's previous incarnations responded to rapid sea level rise. The cores analysed for this research focus on how the reef ecosystem evolved between 13,000 to 10,000 years ago.

Of particular interest to Professor Webster's team was the period known as Meltwater pulse 1B, between 11,450 and 11,100 years ago, when sea levels rose very rapidly.

"This 350-year period is crucial; it covers a time when global sea levels rose very rapidly," Professor Webster said. "It's a period when polar ice sheets are thought to have experienced accelerated melting due to warming temperatures. Based on records from Barbados, we previously thought sea levels were rising by about 40 millimetres a year at this time.

"Our research shows the rise wasn't so large and fast. It was more likely to have been in the order of three to five millimetres a year, comparable to what we're experiencing today."

Extracted by a drilling ship from beneath the Great Barrier Reef's shelf edge at a depth of 40 to 50 metres, the cores offered new insight into how Reef 4, also known as the proto-Great Barrier Reef, was impacted by rising sea levels.

"Reef 4 is very exciting," Professor Webster said. "It had a similar morphology and mix of coral reef communities to the modern Great Barrier Reef. The types of algae and corals, and their growth rates, are comparable.

"Understanding the environmental changes that influenced it, and led to its ultimate demise, therefore offers clues on what might happen to the modern reef."

Professor Webster and colleagues used radiometric dating and reef habitat information to accurately pinpoint core samples pertaining to Meltwater pulse 1B.

The cores underpinning this research were obtained under the International Ocean Discovery Program International Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), an international marine research collaboration involving 21 nations.

Professor Webster said his latest research highlights the importance of IODP and shows the value of these records, obtained by drilling deep beneath the seabed. They provide paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental data, going far further back in time than instrumental records which go back only 50 to 100 years.

"These data allow us to more precisely understand how reef and coastal ecosystems have responded to rapid environmental changes, like the rises in sea level and temperature we face today."

Professor Webster completed this research in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Tokyo, Australian National University, Nagoya University, the University of Granada and Aix-Marseille University.

Every five minutes, 50 people are bitten by a snake worldwide; four will be permanently disabled and one will die. In the time-critical situation following a bite, identifying the snake venom making its way through your system is vital to saving lives and providing the best treatment.

Most approaches to diagnose and treat snake venom, a WHO neglected tropical disease, rely on antibodies. Antibody assays have several challenges associated with them, including high costs, lengthy procedures, and inconsistencies, and yet there are not robust, low-cost, and widely available alternatives to antibody-based approaches.

In this new research paper, published in ACS Biomacromolecules, Warwick researchers have shown the first proof of concept for a cheap and rapid alternative -- a glycopolymer-based ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) test to detect snake venom. They showcase a version of this diagnostic assay in the paper that specifically detects Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom.

Dr. Alex Baker, Assistant Professor at Warwick, lead researcher of the Baker Humanitarian Chemistry Group and senior author of the paper said: "Snake venoms are complex and detecting the toxins at work is challenging but essential to save lives. We've produced an assay using synthetic sugars that mimic the sugars in our bodies that the toxins naturally bind to and an amplification system that makes this rapid test visible. This method lays the foundations for the rapid and cheap detection of snakebite beyond antibody-based techniques, potentially improving improve patient outcomes."

Western Diamondback Rattlesnake venom has evolved to bind to specific sugar molecules on the surface of cells in the body, such as red blood cells and platelets. Specifically, the toxin binds to galactose-terminal glycans (sugar chains ending in galactose). Binding to these glycans allows the venom to disrupt blood clotting or interfere with the immune responses leading to disability and death.

To create the venom assay for Crotalus atrox venom, the team engineered synthetic chains of sugar-like units (glycopolymers), to mimic the natural sugar receptors targeted by venom proteins. The synthetic sugars were attached to gold nanoparticles to amplify the response and make the reaction visible, creating a test that changes colour when venom toxins bind to the synthetic sugars.

Mahdi Hezwani, first author and alumni of Dr Baker's research group said: "This assay could be a real game-changer for snake envenomation. Venoms from other snake species do not interact with glycans in the body. For example, when we tested venom from the Indian Cobra (Naja naja) we did not see binding to the synthetic glycans that bind to C.atrox venom. Hence this assay shows promise to be able to distinguish between different snake venoms based on their sugar-binding properties."

This is the first example of a diagnosis test using sugars for detecting snake venom in a rapid detection system, and builds on the work of this Warwick research group using a glyconanoparticle platform in COVID-19 detection.

This new assay is faster, cheaper, easier to store, is modifiable since the sugars can be custom-made to recognise a specific toxin and is an example of the bold, innovative solutions that will continue to be made possible through The University of Warwick's new STEM Connect programme.

Hundreds of emails and internal documents reviewed by WIRED reveal top lobbyists and representatives of America's agricultural industry led a persistent and often covert campaign to surveil, discredit, and suppress animal rights organizations for nearly a decade, while relying on corporate spies to infiltrate meetings and functionally serve as an informant for the FBI.

The documents, mostly obtained through public records requests by the nonprofit Property of the People, detail a secretive and long-running collaboration between the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate (WMDD)—whose scope today includes Palestinian rights activists and the recent wave of arson targeting Teslas—and the Animal Agriculture Alliance (AAA), a nonprofit trade group representing the interests of US farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, and others across America's food supply chain.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

Since at least 2018, documents show, the AAA has been supplying federal agents with intelligence on the activities of animal rights groups such as Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), with records of emails and meetings reflecting the industry's broader mission to convince authorities that activists are the preeminent “bioterrorism” threat to the United States. Spies working for the AAA during its collaboration with the FBI went undercover at activism meetings, obtaining photographs, audio recordings, and other strategic material. The group's ties with law enforcement were leveraged to help shield industry actors from public scrutiny, to press for investigations into its most powerful critics, and to reframe the purpose and efforts of animal rights protesters as a singular national security threat.

The records further show that state authorities have cited protests as a reason to conceal information about disease outbreaks at factory farms from the public.

Zoe Rosenberg, a UC Berkeley student and animal cruelty investigator at DxE, says she's hardly surprised that powerful private-sector groups are working to surveil the organization, but she finds their work with the police paradoxical. “If anyone should have the ear of law enforcement, it's animal cruelty investigators exposing rampant violations of the law leading to real animals suffering and dying horrific deaths,” she tells WIRED.

Profiled by WIRED in 2019, DxE is a grassroots animal rights organization dedicated to nonviolent direct actions, including covert operations that often involve rescuing animals and documenting practices at factory farms that the group considers inhumane.

Rosenberg, 22, is facing charges in California for removing four chickens from a slaughterhouse in Sonoma County in 2023. In addition to minor charges such as trespassing, she was also hit with a felony count of conspiracy to commit those misdemeanors—a discretionary charge that Sonoma County's prosecutor justified by portraying Rosenberg as a “biosecurity risk” in light of avian flu.

According to Rosenberg, DxE relies on biosecurity protocols that go “above and beyond” industry standards, including quarantining its investigators from birds for a full week before and after entering farms. “All of our investigators before entering a facility shower with hot water and soap and put on freshly washed clothes that have been washed thoroughly and dried on high heat to kill viruses and bacteria,” she says. “Everything is sanitized and then sanitized again upon leaving the facility.”

Rosenberg does not deny removing the chickens, which she named Poppy, Aster, Ivy, and Azalea. “Generally, if we feel an animal is going to die from neglect or maltreatment if we don't remove them from the facility, then we feel that it is justified and necessary to step in to save their life,” she says. Her attorney, Chris Carraway, says that DxE tried reporting allegations of health violations at the facility to “the point of futility.” Rosenberg says reporting alleged violations often leads to getting bounced between offices; a “never-ending loop of no one agency wanting to take responsibility and enforce animal welfare laws.”

The birds Rosenberg removed, she says, were all smaller and weaker than their flockmates, showing signs of what she believed to be infection and dehydration, along with open wounds and other visible injuries. Under veterinary care, Rosenberg says, Poppy was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, while Aster's feet were found to be “full of pus.” Each of the birds had contracted coccidiosis, she says, referring to a parasite that causes diarrhea, inflammation, and bleeding.

To gather intelligence on DxE, records show, the Animal Agriculture Alliance has surveilled the group for years. Confidential documents obtained separately by WIRED reveal undercover operators for the AAA embedded within the animal rights group and fed the trade organization daily reports about protests and meetings, as well as photographs, audio recordings, and other documentation.

During a November 2018 meeting, AAA board members discussed attending DxE events to develop “protective information,” adding they were already in contact with a “security company” that had previously attended DxE's training. At a manager's meeting the following April, the group disclosed that it wanted to “hire someone” to attend a DxE conference in Berkeley, California. Minutes from that meeting show the “total price would be about $4,500.” A confidential report, authored several months later by an undercover on assignment from private intelligence firm Afimac Global, reveals the results of the operation. (Another confidential report—not attributed to a specific intelligence firm—shows the AAA would again infiltrate a DxE conference in 2021. The report identifies members of DxE and other attendees, including Rosenberg, and describes interviews with activists and observations about their protest activities.)

Afimac did not respond to a request for comment.

At a regulatory conference in early 2018, the AAA had delivered a talk on “Bioterrorism and activist groups.” Internal AAA documents show that, within a few months, the FBI contacted AAA with a request. “They reached out to us a few weeks ago and asked for records of activist incidents on farms,” say notes from a meeting that May. At the same meeting, members discussed their difficulty getting prosecutors to charge activists with crimes, with one industry representative saying the issue was their lack of legal standing.

The rep suggested calling on law enforcement to deploy “terrorism” charges instead—as one national pork producer had reportedly considered. The AAA had already “been in contact with the FBI about this situation,” the notes claim.

In an email to WIRED, AAA spokesperson Emily Ellis denied the organization has a formal relationship with the FBI. “In the course of our work to support a secure food system, we have occasionally communicated with authorities to flag concerns where there is a potential risk to people, animals, or critical infrastructure.” The nonprofit declined to answer questions about its hiring of undercovers and did not respond when asked whether it had any specific evidence showing activists have caused outbreaks.

“The Alliance cannot speak to how law enforcement officials choose to communicate or act on information,” Ellis wrote. “We do not direct the actions of any government agency, and we categorically reject the suggestion that the Alliance instructs or influences the FBI or any such organization.”

Records show that in the spring of 2019, the AAA moved to establish a firmer connection with the FBI. In an email to the bureau that May, the group's then-president and CEO, Kay Johnson Smith, noted having met with Stephen Goldsmith, a veterinarian at the FBI's WMDD, a month earlier at a conference aimed at strengthening ties between the government and agriculture sector. The email goes on to remind Goldsmith of her presentation at the event concerning DxE; an “extremist group,” she wrote, “that has executed several mass protests on farms, in retail stores and in restaurants.” Smith then called on the WMDD to help the AAA share information about DxE “with law enforcement officials nationwide,” claiming the group is planning an “extremist campaign.”

Smith passed along an alert about an upcoming DxE protest, a march from a local police station to a nearby grocery store, asking if the FBI would connect the group “with law enforcement officials nationwide.” Goldsmith forwarded the alert to another FBI official who forwarded it along to several more, before it eventually reached a counterterrorism center in Washington and a federal investigator with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The WMDD issued an intelligence memo roughly three months later titled “Animal Rights Extremists Likely Increase the Spread of Virulent Newcastle Disease [vND] in California,” citing with “high confidence” claims that violent extremists were “likely” to “spread vND”—a highly contagious and often fatal disease that affects birds—“in the near term” by neglecting biosafety procedures. The FBI highlighted two instances in which it claimed there was “no evidence” of activists following proper protocols.”

Analysts at the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC), a multi-agency hub that supports law enforcement, soon threw cold water on the FBI's claims. “Animal rights activists are probably not responsible for any of the identified vND incidents” in the state, the NCRIC said less than four months later, citing federal scientific research. The agency further noted that despite law enforcement's claims that DxE “almost certainly” violated biosecurity protocols, police reports showed activists had taken “biosecurity precautions to prevent contamination or spread of disease.”

If the activists were to engage in criminal activity, the NCRIC decided, the crimes were likely to be “non-violent” and “low level.”

That same fall, Goldsmith's chemical-biological countermeasure unit within the WMDD quietly circulated a presentation to state law enforcement officials pointing to “unsubstantiated reports” that PETA, the animal rights nonprofit, had played some sort of role in the 2015 avian flu outbreak—allegedly collecting “contaminated carcasses” in an effort to spread the virus. Goldsmith had already previously dismissed a similar claim while working for the same unit four years prior. (A trade publication paraphrased the FBI official in 2015 telling a crowd “there is no evidence of that actually happening.”)

Goldsmith did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment about any specific groups but noted it frequently shares information with members of the private sector. “Our goal is to protect our communities from unlawful activity while at the same time upholding the Constitution,” the agency said in an emailed statement. “The FBI focuses on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. The FBI can never open an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity.”

By the end of 2019, the Animal Agriculture Alliance was relying heavily on “bioterrorism” claims to justify further calls for law enforcement intervention. To gain the attention of local police in California and the state's Rural Crimes Task Force, the AAA contacted Michael Payne, an outreach coordinator at the Western Institute for Food Safety and Security at UC Davis. One of its members, they said, had heard from an unidentified trucker who was growing increasingly frustrated with animal rights activists. And the driver's concerns extended to “bioterrorism.”

The activists were taking photos of the driver's truck, the AAA said, and “feeding his pigs grapes.”

Payne had previously attended a presentation by the AAA on “dealing with animal rights activists,” according to emails between them. He'd later invited the AAA to collaborate on a range of dairy-farm proposals in California, alongside multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.

Neither Payne nor UC Davis responded to requests for comment. Nor did the California Rural Crime Prevention Task Force. Attempts to reach Payne by phone were unsuccessful.

Months after the FBI circulated its now-disputed assessment of activists spreading the virulent Newcastle disease, Payne issued a memo under the rural taskforce's letterhead encouraging his “FBI colleagues” to read an article translated and amplified by a Beijing-based podcast host. The article concerns Chinese “swine stir-fry syndicates” purportedly using drones to spread African swine flu in an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of pork.

Payne suggests weaponizing the allegations to achieve specific policy goals here in the US, such as allowing farmers to declare livestock facilities “no fly zones.” “Combined with the assessment from the FBI indicating activist trespass is a real and present biosecurity threat,” he writes, the Chinese pig-gang claims hand the industry “ammunition” to ensure sheriffs do a “proper job” when responding to complaints.

Significantly, the podcast host (whose blog was shared by Payne) openly rejected the pig-gang allegations, drawing attention to the Chinese government's ownership of the news outlet that originally reported the story, as well as counter-reporting by a “respected” independent outlet.

Payne's email notes that he forwarded the article to a slew of local sheriffs' departments, as well as the state's WMDD office, “which in turn passed it on to FBI HQ ‘for their situational awareness.'”

Information gathered on DxE's activities by the AAA was widely disseminated to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies around the US, as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In a February 2021 email, the group provided the WMDD office information on three events that DxE and other activist groups had planned, including a Zoom class and a vigil at a pork processing plant for Regan Russell, an activist killed in 2020 by a livestock transport truck outside an Ontario slaughterhouse.

Goldsmith circulated the AAA's tips to several FBI agents, as well as a supervising special inspector in the animal health branch of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Several federal agencies and at least 27 state and local police departments received the email. At least 10 agricultural trade groups and lobbyists were copied.

Ryan Shapiro, executive director at Property of the People, says the hundreds of records amassed by his organization offer an unprecedented look at how Big Ag lobbyists allegedly vied to conceal incidents of animal cruelty and disease and targeted law enforcement agencies specifically for capture. “This is a shameless assault on civil liberties, human health, and basic decency,” he says.

“There's an inherent relationship between cruelty and disease on factory farms,” says Shapiro, whose MIT doctoral dissertation explored the intersections of national security and controversies over animals. “When you have that many animals packed in so tightly they can't stand up, can't turn around, can't spread their limbs, and are pressed up against each other in their own filth, in their own sickness, of course disease is going to be rampant.”

The furor over DxE's activism within the animal agriculture industry reached a fever pitch two months later with the launch of Project Counterglow, an online interactive map of more than 27,500 farms and animal-ag facilities drawn from public regulatory and business records, reporting by individual activists, and artificial intelligence that scanned satellite imagery to reveal previously unknown facilities.

Citing Project Counterglow the following month, the Food Protection and Defense Institute, a university-based consortium working alongside the Department of Homeland Security, disclosed in a memo that the FBI and AAA had jointly “profiled the current risk environment” at an industry-government coordinating event within days of the map's launch. According to the memo, the FBI was in the process of supplying the AAA with a list of WMDD coordinators with whom members were encouraged to share knowledge about activists.

The FBI would eventually provide the group with a dedicated inbox to inform on DxE and other animal rights groups. In a 2023 email, the alliance reminded members to report “animal rights activity” directly to the FBI using the group's own “Activist Activity Notification Form” and the email address NF_ARVE_INTAKE@fbi.gov.

The Food Protection and Defense Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

Preventing animal rights activists from learning about outbreaks has at times taken priority over notifying the public about them.

Emails from 2023 show officials at the USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture discussing how best to delay news about a highly pathogenic avian flu detected at two Sonoma County farms; a state official having previously warned that “protesters” were likely to be in the area. The solution, put forth by a USDA official, was to simply not enter the information into the state's emergency management response system, delaying the alert for at least another three days.

“Much longer than that and it raises too many questions,” they said.

At least a quarter of a million birds were culled around the same time as the emails. And a year later, the CDFA released a report that pointed the finger at the protesters, alleging it was “plausible” they may have spread the virus.

Steve Lyle, a CDFA spokesperson, says the possibility of people showing up to a farm without proper biosecurity training always raises concerns about virus spread. “In any animal disease incident, more movement of people and equipment brings a greater risk of spread,” he says.

A “crisis response plan” crafted by Washington State livestock and agricultural groups, obtained through a public records request, notes that the federal government's policy is “to assume that any animal disease outbreak or large-scale food contamination incident is an intentional act until proven otherwise.”

When rumors about cattle being poisoned or intentionally infected with a virus began circulating around the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and other agencies, the claims were put to rest by the head of an field dairy investigative unit out of Washington State University, whose team had discovered a “serious outbreak” among several herds of yearling cattle.

The investigator noted that while a cattle owner was convinced the outbreak was “sabotage from animal rights activists,” other probable sources were clearly present. The investigator said his team had “spent a lot of time trying to convince [the ranchers] that the disease outbreak most likely had nothing to do with bioterrorism, and is most likely due to husbandry and management issues which we laid out very clearly for them.”

But ranchers, he said, seemed to “prefer to follow conspiracy.” After reading this, a WSDA official told others in the email chain to “keep this information private and not forward [it] on.”

Pressed by a reporter in 2021 as to why the WSDA kept no tally of livestock in the state, officials noted internally that, while the short answer was it's never been directed to, “privacy is very important to producers, especially with ongoing threats associated with agro-terrorism and activist groups.”

The AAA, meanwhile, has worked for years to keep its communications with the government secret from the public, moving documents subject to public records requests behind a “password protected link” in 2018, records show. That same year, it joined a coalition of food industry groups in filing an amicus brief with the US Supreme Court aimed at limiting public access to corporate records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)—expressing enthusiasm at the time that the court's conservative majority would back its play. “Animal activist groups routinely use FOIA to obtain confidential information submitted to the government,” a meeting agenda from the time reads.

The case, ultimately decided in the food industry's favor, redefined the meaning of “confidential” under FOIA to include information that the industry itself decided should be private.

In October 2024, Goldsmith attempted to intercede against a state-level records request by Property of the People, incorrectly informing the Washington State Department of Agriculture that the requester—Shapiro—was a member of a known criminal group.

Records later obtained by Shapiro under the state's public records act show Goldsmith telling the WSDA that the “timing” of his request was suspicious because it coincided with a recent bird flu outbreak. That outbreak occurred in an “unusual location in the building,” he said, and did not match the virus's “expected epidemiological pattern.” While stressing that there'd been a report of a simultaneous outbreak at another farm owned by the same company, Goldsmith also cited the AAA in his email as an organization monitoring “animal rights violent extremists.”

“Transparency is not terrorism,” says Shapiro, “and the FBI should not be taking marching orders from industry flacks.”

WSDA officials, while correcting Goldsmith's allegation that Shapiro is a member of a criminal group, advised the FBI not to mention the infected farm by name, providing Goldsmith and other FBI officials with a code word in case their communications were discovered through a public records request. A WSDA spokesperson tells WIRED that it is customary to do so when a farm is placed under quarantine, “to protect the identity of the operation, consistent with confidentiality provisions.” The FBI was later waived off by the WSDA entirely in an email emphasizing that the two cases Goldsmith thought potentially connected were “completely unrelated.”

“WSDA responded to the inquiry,” a spokesperson tells WIRED, adding that the strains of disease at the two locations were “genetically different” and “did not raise concerns.”

Hundreds of emails and internal documents reviewed by WIRED reveal top lobbyists and representatives of America's agricultural industry led a persistent and often covert campaign to surveil, discredit, and suppress animal rights organizations for nearly a decade, while relying on corporate spies to infiltrate meetings and functionally serve as an informant for the FBI.

The documents, mostly obtained through public records requests by the nonprofit Property of the People, detail a secretive and long-running collaboration between the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate (WMDD)—whose scope today includes Palestinian rights activists and the recent wave of arson targeting Teslas—and the Animal Agriculture Alliance (AAA), a nonprofit trade group representing the interests of US farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, and others across America's food supply chain.

Since at least 2018, documents show, the AAA has been supplying federal agents with intelligence on the activities of animal rights groups such as Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), with records of emails and meetings reflecting the industry's broader mission to convince authorities that activists are the preeminent “bioterrorism” threat to the United States. Spies working for the AAA during its collaboration with the FBI went undercover at activism meetings, obtaining photographs, audio recordings, and other strategic material. The group's ties with law enforcement were leveraged to help shield industry actors from public scrutiny, to press for investigations into its most powerful critics, and to reframe the purpose and efforts of animal rights protesters as a singular national security threat.

The records further show that state authorities have cited protests as a reason to conceal information about disease outbreaks at factory farms from the public.

Zoe Rosenberg, a UC Berkeley student and animal cruelty investigator at DxE, says she's hardly surprised that powerful private-sector groups are working to surveil the organization, but she finds their work with the police paradoxical. “If anyone should have the ear of law enforcement, it's animal cruelty investigators exposing rampant violations of the law leading to real animals suffering and dying horrific deaths,” she tells WIRED.

Profiled by WIRED in 2019, DxE is a grassroots animal rights organization dedicated to nonviolent direct actions, including covert operations that often involve rescuing animals and documenting practices at factory farms that the group considers inhumane.

Rosenberg, 22, is facing charges in California for removing four chickens from a slaughterhouse in Sonoma County in 2023. In addition to minor charges such as trespassing, she was also hit with a felony count of conspiracy to commit those misdemeanors—a discretionary charge that Sonoma County's prosecutor justified by portraying Rosenberg as a “biosecurity risk” in light of avian flu.

According to Rosenberg, DxE relies on biosecurity protocols that go “above and beyond” industry standards, including quarantining its investigators from birds for a full week before and after entering farms. “All of our investigators before entering a facility shower with hot water and soap and put on freshly washed clothes that have been washed thoroughly and dried on high heat to kill viruses and bacteria,” she says. “Everything is sanitized and then sanitized again upon leaving the facility.”

Her attorney, Chris Carraway, says that DxE tried reporting allegations of health violations at the facility to “the point of futility.” Rosenberg says reporting alleged violations often leads to getting bounced between offices; a “never-ending loop of no one agency wanting to take responsibility and enforce animal welfare laws.”

The birds Rosenberg removed, she says, were all smaller and weaker than their flockmates, showing signs of what she believed to be infection and dehydration, along with open wounds and other visible injuries. Under veterinary care, Rosenberg says, Poppy was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, while Aster's feet were found to be “full of pus.” Each of the birds had contracted coccidiosis, she says, referring to a parasite that causes diarrhea, inflammation, and bleeding.

In a 2023 email, the alliance reminded members to report “animal rights activity” directly to the FBI using the group's own “Activist Activity Notification Form” and the email address NF_ARVE_INTAKE@fbi.gov.

The Food Protection and Defense Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

Preventing animal rights activists from learning about outbreaks has at times taken priority over notifying the public about them.

Emails from 2023 show officials at the USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture discussing how best to delay news about a highly pathogenic avian flu detected at two Sonoma County farms; a state official having previously warned that “protesters” were likely to be in the area. The solution, put forth by a USDA official, was to simply not enter the information into the state's emergency management response system, delaying the alert for at least another three days.

“Much longer than that and it raises too many questions,” they said.

At least a quarter of a million birds were culled around the same time as the emails. And a year later, the CDFA released a report that pointed the finger at the protesters, alleging it was “plausible” they may have spread the virus.

Steve Lyle, a CDFA spokesperson, says the possibility of people showing up to a farm without proper biosecurity training always raises concerns about virus spread. “In any animal disease incident, more movement of people and equipment brings a greater risk of spread,” he says.

A “crisis response plan” crafted by Washington State livestock and agricultural groups, obtained through a public records request, notes that the federal government's policy is “to assume that any animal disease outbreak or large-scale food contamination incident is an intentional act until proven otherwise.”

When rumors about cattle being poisoned or intentionally infected with a virus began circulating around the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and other agencies, the claims were put to rest by the head of an field dairy investigative unit out of Washington State University, whose team had discovered a “serious outbreak” among several herds of yearling cattle.

The investigator noted that while a cattle owner was convinced the outbreak was “sabotage from animal rights activists,” other probable sources were clearly present. The investigator said his team had “spent a lot of time trying to convince [the ranchers] that the disease outbreak most likely had nothing to do with bioterrorism, and is most likely due to husbandry and management issues which we laid out very clearly for them.”

But ranchers, he said, seemed to “prefer to follow conspiracy.” After reading this, a WSDA official told others in the email chain to “keep this information private and not forward [it] on.”

Pressed by a reporter in 2021 as to why the WSDA kept no tally of livestock in the state, officials noted internally that, while the short answer was it's never been directed to, “privacy is very important to producers, especially with ongoing threats associated with agro-terrorism and activist groups.”

The AAA, meanwhile, has worked for years to keep its communications with the government secret from the public, moving documents subject to public records requests behind a “password protected link” in 2018, records show. That same year, it joined a coalition of food industry groups in filing an amicus brief with the US Supreme Court aimed at limiting public access to corporate records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)—expressing enthusiasm at the time that the court's conservative majority would back its play. “Animal activist groups routinely use FOIA to obtain confidential information submitted to the government,” a meeting agenda from the time reads.

The case, ultimately decided in the food industry's favor, redefined the meaning of “confidential” under FOIA to include information that the industry itself decided should be private.

In October 2024, Goldsmith attempted to intercede against a state-level records request by Property of the People, incorrectly informing the Washington State Department of Agriculture that the requester—Shapiro—was a member of a known criminal group.

Records later obtained by Shapiro under the state's public records act show Goldsmith telling the WSDA that the “timing” of his request was suspicious because it coincided with a recent bird flu outbreak. That outbreak occurred in an “unusual location in the building,” he said, and did not match the virus's “expected epidemiological pattern.

T-Mobile Fiber Home Internet joins the 5G-based T-Mobile Home Internet service

You've likely heard of T-Mobile Home Internet by now. We've discussed the ups and downs of the 5G-based cellular broadband service on these pages several times over the years. After some initial headaches during the rollout of the broadband service, T-Mobile Home Internet has, for the most part, become a viable alternative to traditional cable internet providers, with over 7 million customers. However, chances are that you haven't heard of T-Mobile Fiber Home Internet. Until recently, the internet service was only available in a few dozen markets across the United States. T-Mobile is making some big moves today with the announcement that T-Mobile Fiber is moving past its trial phase to an official launch in the U.S.

So, what sparked the official rollout of T-Mobile Fiber? In April, T-Mobile announced that it had acquired Lumos, a fiber-to-the-home internet provider serving 475,000 households. That acquisition provided T-Mobile with the additional capacity to expand T-Mobile Fiber, which is now accessible to over 500,000 households in the U.S.

T-Mobile Fiber is available in four tiers, starting with Fiber 500. Fiber 500, as you would expect, provides symmetrical data speeds of up to 500 Mbps for $75/month with Autopay. Fiber 1 Gig boosts data speeds to 1 Gbps for $90/month, and Fiber 2 Gig gives you 2 Gbps speeds for $105/month. The Fiber 500 plan comes with a basic Wi-Fi 6 router, while the Fiber 1 Gig and 2 Gig plans come standard with “whole home” Wi-Fi 6 mesh hardware. T-Mobile customers who also have a qualifying voice line can get $15 off the above pricing each month with Autopay, and all plans come with a 5-year price guarantee.



The fourth plan, called Fiber Founders Club, is available for a limited time in “select locations nationwide.” The Fiber Founders Club costs just $70 per month with Autopay for 2 Gbps symmetrical data speeds. T-Mobile also doubles the price guarantee from 5 years to 10 years for these customers, and you don't need a voice line to qualify for the lowest available pricing.

It should be noted that all four plans qualify for T-Mobile Tuesdays, which offer various perks available through the T-Life app, including promotions such as a free season of MLB.TV, discount codes from local eateries, and discounts on gas (among other offers).

“With the official launch of T-Mobile Fiber, we're delivering on our promise to bring better broadband to more people — the Un-carrier way,” said T-Mobile Chief Broadband Officer Allan Samson. “Our new plans, backed by long-term price guarantees, are designed to give customers more choice and peace of mind. And, we're just getting started. As the fastest growing broadband provider in the country, we'll keep expanding T-Mobile Fiber to reach more communities and find ways to pack more value into our plans.”

T-Mobile, which is currently the fifth-largest broadband provider in the U.S., states that its pending acquisition of Metronet and future partnerships will enable it to offer fiber internet to approximately 15 million households by the end of 2030.

If you want to keep up with all the big game releases of the year, you're not going to be able to do that without either immediately deleting them after playing or by expanding your storage capacity. When new titles clock in at over 100GB, you need to make some tough choices in terms of what gets to stay around. The easy solution it to just get yourself a much bigger solid state drive.

The Samsung 9100 Pro SSD heavily discounted at the moment over at Amazon: The savings range from $30 to $100 off depending on the exact version you get, be it 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB. For instance, the 2TB model is available for $240 on Amazon, which is a 20% discount from its regular price of $300, while the 4TB version has dropped to $450 from $550. The 1TB model is also on sale for $170, down 15% from its $200 original price.

Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play: The Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. It has read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,400 MB/s. This SSD from Samsung will help you achieve this high performance while using less power overall. Great for not just gaming, but any intensive workflows like video editing or working with large datasets.

Gaming consoles need the extra space just as much as gaming PCs do. The original PlayStation 5 comes with only 825 GB of internal storage. With the ballooning size of AAA games on the market, you'll be lucky if you can have more than 3 games downloaded onto your system at a time.

We have good news: The PS5's storage can be expanded by installing a compatible M.2 solid state drive. The Samsung 9100 Pro is compatible, but with a catch. You're going to want the heatsink option to prevent overheating. It's fairly straightforward to install, you can do it yourself following along with a video on YouTube. Right now, you can get the 1TB version of the 9100 Pro with a heatsink for $180. The 2TB version goes for $260 while the 4TB version goes for $470.

That's just for the console players though. If you yourself or the loved one you're buying for is gaming on PC, then the non-heatsink version will work out just fine. Get the Samsung 9100 Pro starting at $170 for the 1TB version ($30 off), $240 for the 2TB version ($60 off), or $450 for the 4TB version ($100 off).

Typical AIDA64 preliminary support cadence points to a possible Computex 2026 launch.

There are some new signs of life in the next-gen AMD Ryzen development cycle. On Monday, Finalwire added “preliminary support for next-generation AMD desktop, server and mobile processors.” Yes, that means the system utilities development software team will have received some early information morsels about 'Ryzen 10000 series' processors, if AMD follows the expected naming convention that is. Twitter/X user HXL spotted the update, but at the time of writing, there has been yet another update to the latest beta mentioning processors such as the Intel Core Ultra 3 (AKA Arrow Lake-H/S) series.

As you can see, the first beta of the next-gen AIDA64 is graced by the preliminary support for AMD's next-gen chips. However, before we go on, readers should be warned to rein in any excitement. Looking back at AIDA64's history, such an announcement typically comes around a year ahead of any product launch. Therefore, if this plays out as expected, 'Ryzen 10000' chips will likely be central to AMD's product launch plans at Computex 2026.

Even though it may be a year off, we have a few leaks-based information morsels about the 'Ryzen 10000' lineup that are worth summarizing here. On the desktop side of things, probably of greatest interest to our PC enthusiast audience, leaked info from March suggests upcoming Zen 6 architecture processors will remain compatible with the AM5 socket. These CPUs are apparently codenamed Medusa Ridge.

It would indeed be a great nugget of news for AM5 platform adoptees if it were to be confirmed that 'Ryzen 10000' chips would be compatible with the existing socket. Moreover, the potential move to 12-core chiplet dies (CCDs) with the next generation could be a major step for consumers.

We think it is likely that AMD will use TSMC's N3P (3 nm-class) process for its Zen 6-based products in 2026. With AMD's 3D V-Cache packing processors proving to be a powerful lure to gamers, it is also expected to deliver Zen 6-based Ryzens into the X3D subfamily.

Will the 'Ryzen 7 10800X3D' be the next ‘gaming legend' from AMD's stables? Check out our Ryzen 7 9800X3D review to see the devastating mix of price and (gaming) performance it will have to eclipse.



Recently, we also reported on some tantalizing next-gen AMD 'Ryzen 10000' mobile processor leaks. The so-called Medusa Point processors will reportedly carry up to 22 hybrid cores, based on Zen 6. However, these are likely even further away than the desktop chips based on Zen 6, with a launch window of late 2026 / early 2027 expected. Pushing Medusa Point back are AMD's plans for Gorgon Point (a Strix Point refresh) family, which will launch in the interim.

Indian grocery delivery startup KiranaPro has been hacked and all its data has been wiped, the company's founder confirmed to TechCrunch.

The destroyed data included the company's app code and its servers containing banks of sensitive customer information, including their names, mailing addresses, and payment details, KiranaPro co-founder and CEO Deepak Ravindran told TechCrunch.

The company's app is online but cannot process orders, TechCrunch has found.

Launched in December 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government's Open Network for Digital Commerce, allowing customers to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets.

KiranaPro has 55,000 customers, with 30,000-35,000 active buyers across 50 cities, who collectively place 2,000 orders daily, according to the company. Unlike a typical grocery delivery app, KiranaPro offers a voice-based interface that allows users to place orders from local shops using voice commands in languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, and English.

The startup planned to expand to 100 cities in the next 100 days before the incident happened, Ravindran said.

On May 26, KiranaPro executives became aware of the incident while logging into their Amazon Web Services account. Hackers had gained access to KiranaPro's root accounts on AWS and GitHub, Ravindran told TechCrunch.

Ravindran shared a couple of screenshots of the GitHub security logs and a file containing a sample of activity logs around the time of the incident, suggesting that the hacking happened after someone gained access to their systems via a former employee's account.

KiranaPro's chief technology officer Saurav Kumar told TechCrunch that the hack happened around May 24-25.

The startup said it used Google Authenticator for multi-factor authentication on its AWS account. Kumar told TechCrunch that the multi-factor code had changed when they tried to log into their AWS account last week, and all their Electric Compute Cloud (EC2) services, which let clients access virtual computers to run their applications, were deleted.

“We can only log in through the IAM [Identity and Access Management] account, through which we can see that the EC2 instances don't exist anymore, but we are not able to get any logs or anything because we don't have the root account,” he said.

KiranaPro has reached out to GitHub's support team to help identify the hacker's IP addresses and other traces of the incident, said Ravindran.

Similarly, Ravindran told TechCrunch that the startup is filing cases against its former employees, who he said had not submitted their credentials for accessing their GitHub accounts to check their logs.

It is unclear how the attack happened. Some of the biggest cyberattacks in recent years, such as LastPass, Change Healthcare, and Snowflake, were caused by credential theft, such as through password-stealing malware installed on an employee's laptop, and missing or unenforced multi-factor authentication. 

The companies were ultimately responsible for enforcing the security of their own systems, including whether their employees must use multi-factor authentication, and terminating accounts of former employees who no longer work at their company.

KiranaPro counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and BCG MD Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. The company has a team of 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala.

When it comes to city-living, there's a number of ways you can get around. You've got the subways, maybe call an Uber or a cab, or perhaps even get yourself a bike. There's always walking, but that can take forever. The best option that's often forgotten is staring right in front of you—an electric scooter. Cruise around town like six times as fast as you can walk with the HiBoy electric scooter. Right now, Best Buy has it for $200 off (-40%). That brings it down from its usual price of $500 to just $300 for a limited time.

See at Best Buy

Perfect for city life, you can commute to and from work on the HiBoy electric scooter. You can cruise along up to a max speed of 19 mph (I'd like to see you even try to walk that fast) and the scooter folds up so you can carry it easily when going inside or transferring onto a train or bus. Plus, that makes it easy to store in a small apartment. The scooter itself weights 31.7 pounds and has a maximum carrying capacity of 220 pounds.

Not only are they just plain fun to ride, an electric scooter is a terrific way to help reduce your carbon footprint. On a single charge, you'll be able to reach an operating range of over 17 miles from your starting point. If you need to commute further than that, I'd probably recommend a car anyway.

The scooter is safe for city commuting. It has front, middle, and rear lights to ensure those you're sharing the road with can see you easily. And if you need to stop in somewhere that won't allow you to bring it in, you can lock your scooter outside. The HiBoy S2 app for both iPhone and Android can connect to your scooter and be used to lock it when not in use. You can also adjust settings like customized speed and cruise control.

The scooter comes in a slick, gray finish — appropriate for arriving at even the most professional office environments. The throttle on the right-hand side of the handle bars is easy to use and allows the rider to smoothly glide across any paved road or sidewalk.

Best Buy normally has this particular electric scooter — the HiBoy S2 — for an even $500. Right now, the price has been cut by a solid 40%, bringing it down to just $300. That makes for a total savings of $200. Do summer right this year by getting to where you need to be on a HiBoy electric scooter.

As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, an entirely new design inspired by the Vision Pro, and more.  

Here's a roundup of the most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Apple plans to rename its operating systems to reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple's entire ecosystem with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience.

Apple is also rumored to be releasing a gaming app that will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store's game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends.

Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake.

Apple could improve iPhone battery health with AI-powered battery management. This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged.

Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone.

One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The company stated in March that the new features are delayed. 

While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions.

Jensen Huang highlights "breakthroughs" that make the new console possible.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is touting the processor in the Nintendo Switch 2 ahead of the new console's launch on June 5, stating that it delivers "performance, intelligence, and beauty in the palm of your hand."He appeared in a "special edition" of Nintendo's "Creator's Voice" series. The appearance marks a rare discussion of technical specs and a rare inclusion of other partners in the discussion of Nintendo's hardware.

Huang said that the new Nvidia chip "brings together three breakthroughs: the most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device, full hardware ray-tracing, high dynamic range for brighter highlights and deeper shadows, and an architecture that supports backward compatibility."

Nintendo's hardware developers had already confirmed the use of DLSS, and Nvidia didn't delve too deeply into specs when discussing the chip in a blog post, focusing on RT cores and noting that the new chip offers "10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch." Huang also said the Switch 2 features dedicated AI processors to "sharpen, animate, and enhance gameplay in real-time."In May, Digital Foundry reported the official specs, including eight ARM Cortex A78C cores featuring the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set, a GPU based on Nvidia's two-generation-old Ampere architecture, and a memory subsystem powered by two 6GB LPDDR5X memory modules (12GB total) operating on a 128-bit memory interface. The console also has 256GB of UFS storage and has a microSD Express card slot that supports additional storage up to 2TB.

Much of the video is actually about Nvidia's part in building the original Switch and honoring Satoru Iwata, the fourth president of Nintendo, who oversaw the console's development but passed away before its launch.The Switch 2 is launching at $449.99 when it releases on Thursday (a bundle with Mario Kart World will cost $499.99 for a limited time). Pre-orders went quickly, though some brick-and-mortar stores may have stock on launch day.

We're down to the final two days before TechCrunch Sessions: AI unites the broader AI community at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall on Thursday, June 5! Expect a packed agenda with top speakers, expert panels, top-tier networking, and Side Events from our partners.

One of our speakers is Andrei Papancea, CEO and co-founder of NLX, who will share insights from the company's successful partnership with Toyota — focused on building AI-powered conversational experiences for car repair.

With the event just days away, now's your last chance to lock in serious savings. Here's how:

So, without further ado, meet Papancea and get to know his insightful session on the main stage.

Papancea is currently the CEO of NLX, a company that has raised more than $25 million in funding to fuel its mission of providing automated customer service experiences to companies ranging from United Airlines to Red Bull. Its efforts are built on Papancea's prior experiences building American Express's Conversational AI platform, which has become a primary point of contact for customer experiences with the company.

For his session, Papancea will dive into NLX's partnership with Toyota, which centers on AI-powered conversational experiences tailored specifically for car repair. The initiative gives technicians instant access to a vast knowledge base — drawn from millions of pages of repair guides, manuals, diagrams, and other highly specific resources — to help them diagnose and complete repairs more efficiently.

In doing so, Toyota has already been able to improve a core KPI: the productivity of its technicians. And that's exactly the kind of topic we're looking to dive into at TC Sessions: AI, one that demonstrates the real-world impact of AI implementation and partnerships.

Join our full lineup of insightful AI sessions featuring leaders from Google Cloud, Amazon, TwelveLabs, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many more. Check out the full speaker list and agenda.

TechCrunch Sessions: AI is just days away — don't miss your chance to explore practical AI solutions, real-world applications, and top-tier networking with fellow experts and innovators.

Take advantage of last-minute deals: Save up to $300 on single tickets, bring a guest with our 2-for-1 offer, or win a special promo code through our AI Trivia Challenge to get two tickets for just $200.

The resurgence of the big-ticket romcom is well and truly under way amidst the wax and wane of the box office spectacle we usually cover here at io9. But sometimes a little movie magic comes along and makes even the most simple of meet-cute premises something surreal and mind bending–and that's definitely the case in Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie‘s new movie, Big Bold Beautiful Journey.

Directed by Kogonda, Big Bold Beautiful Journey follows two strangers, Sarah and David, who cross paths at a mutual friend's wedding. Moving on from their brief connection, they suddenly find themselves thrust back into each other's lives when the GPS system in David's car suddenly gets a bit 2001: A Space Odyssey and asks David if, well, he wants to go on a big, bold, beautiful journey.

But this isn't a more whimsical Her situation going on here–a suddenly sentient car system is the least surreal thing David and Sarah find themselves facing, when they find a magical doorway that lets them journey through time and space, and into pockets of their own histories alongside each other.

It's certainly makes for a trippy visual, and a fascinating way for Sarah and David's blossoming relationship to unfold as their histories, and all the joy and grief that comes with discovering someone's past, begin to replay out in front of them. That gag about the car exploding at the end being a bit too dramatic for two people who've just fallen through a gateway in time and space to play out the love story of a life-times is pretty good, too.

Big Bold Beautiful Journey hits theaters September 19.

There's something oddly satisfying about snapping your phone onto a magnetic charger and watching it power up. There's no cable to fumble with, no ports to wear down, and no having to worry about whether your device is actually charging or not. You can just drop your device and go. And you can hurry about doing whatever it is you need to do for the day while your phone works its way back up to 100%.

See at Amazon

But if one charger is nice, how about two? Does that sweeten the deal? Sure, you might have to pay a little extra, but you could keep one in storage and one with you while you use it, just in case. And you can save some money by buying in bulk, too.

If you're ready to save, check out Amazon to get the Anker Zolo Magnetic Wireless Charger 2-Pack for just $27, down from its usual price of $40. That's $13 off and a discount of 33%.

If you're anything like the rest of us, your phone is your lifeline. They're like that for all of us. They're our alarm clocks, our calendars, our maps, and sometimes even our wallets. So when it's time to recharge, you want to do it as quickly as possible. Anker's magnetic chargers deliver 15W fast charging for MagSafe-compatible iPhones, which means you can top off your battery while you work, stream, or scroll without needing to babysit your phone. They stay in place, even if you pick your phone up mid-charge for a quick check-in. And let's face it, we all do that at one point or another.

The set includes two chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, which is already a pretty solid value before you even factor in the deal. Keep one on your desk and one by the bed, or toss one in your bag for travel. They're slim, low-profile, and play nicely with iPhone 12 through 16 models. Plus, they come backed by Anker's ActiveShield 2.0 tech, which constantly monitors temperature to help protect battery health over time.

If you're still plugging in a Lightning cable every night or juggling slow wireless chargers that overheat and disconnect, this is your sign to level up. With two high-speed magnetic chargers at this price, it's an easy and affordable win for your daily routine. For just less than $30, you can have as much additional power as you need, so make sure you jump on this deal while you can.

Conkdor, an ostrich-like enemy that made its debut in Super Mario 3D World, should not be able to drive. First, it is a bird. Second, it has no hands. But in Mario Kart World, Conkdor can race alongside Mario on bikes, cars, and magic carpets, just like everyone else.

This newfound ability of dozens of new characters to compete in the game is a first for the series, and a change that required the developers to rethink how they approached playable characters.

“I have to say that in previous Mario Kart titles, we had to consider whether or not that character would be able to drive,” producer Kosuke Yabuki told WIRED during a translated interview. “My old way of thinking was, well, surely they would need to have hands and feet to be able to drive.”

As a Switch 2 launch title, Mario Kart World heralds the next generation of the series, and it does so with a huge cast of playable racers. At least 50 characters have been confirmed so far, and many variations of those characters exist with costume changes. Yabuki says that when deciding on the game's cast, the team first had to consider if players would like new characters and, more importantly, if they'd use them. Nintendo wants players to be surprised by who they can play as, but that's not all: “If you're playing a match, would it be fun to see that character alongside you,” Yabuki says.

That may explain much of the game's new cast, which includes several characters lacking feet, hands, or both. Yabuki mentions Goomba, the series' iconic, grumpy fanged foes, or Pokey, a cacti character made of stacked spikey balls: “OK, sure, they can drive,” Yabuki says.

“I probably wouldn't be able to even explain how they drive exactly in this setting,” Yabuki adds, “but so long as we're surprising and delighting people, I think that's the important part.” The game's cow character is already a huge hit with players since her reveal. Yabuki expects that other new characters will be popular as well.

“I'm sure that we'll see a lot of players that are choosing to race as the cow or the penguin,” Yabuki says, “but this is still a Mario Kart game. I hope that everyone remembers to play Peach and Mario as well.”

Mario Kart World's huge cast is necessary now that its races can accommodate up to 24 players; the most recent Switch version of the game, Mario Kart 8, allowed only 12 players per round. Yabuki says the team decided early on that it would be doubling the number of racers for this game. “We knew that with a vast world that is interconnected and covered in all of these different routes, we needed a large number of simultaneous players to give a populated and fun feeling to that big a space,” he says.

That required some additional balancing. A race with 24 people can quickly go off the rails. “If we didn't adjust anything else, you'd be receiving too many attacks and it would be too stressful of a gameplay experience,” Yabuki says. The same goes for crashes or spinouts, which have been adjusted so when players lose speed, they're different depending on the event. “Certainly, we have to think about the chaos element as well,” Yabuki says. “Sometimes, a free for all is a really fun experience too.”

This will make it harder for Chinese tech companies to design their own chips for manufacturing at TSMC.

Washington cracked down on semiconductor design software exports to China, banning companies like Synopsys and Cadence from issuing licenses to tech companies that use their software to build advanced chips. While this ban is unlikely to stop these companies from using the electronic design automation (EDA) software they already have, it will prevent them from getting updates and the required technical support needed to continue designing chips for manufacture in Taiwan, says the Financial Times.

Xiaomi is one of the bigger companies to be affected by this move, especially as it just launched the XRing 01 SoC, which uses a 3nm process node from TSMC. Lenovo, which took over IBM's Consumer PC business, and crypto mining hardware specialist Bitmain, also use American EDA software, so they're expected to be affected by this ban as well.

This will only impact the most advanced chips, especially those used for AI processing. Less advanced semiconductors, like those used for smartphones and other mobile devices, will likely be exempted, but we will only know for sure when the White House releases the document containing all the details of the ban.

Aside from that, China has also been working on its own EDA tools to reduce its reliance on American tech. Huawei is one of those, especially as it was one of the first major Chinese companies that received a blanket ban from the U.S..

Empyrean and Primarius Technologies also make their own respective EDA systems, while Semitronix focuses on electrical testing and semiconductor yield improvement. Chinese EDA systems still aren't on the cutting-edge of chip development, but sources say that they're good enough to work with older 7nm nodes and up.

The Financial Times also reported that smaller companies use pirated versions of EDA software from Synopsys and other U.S.-based companies. One analyst told the publication that it's easy to hack into the software to use and support it without a license, which is one of the reasons why the demand for these apps is lower compared to industry growth in China.

This ban will negatively affect China's capability to design and manufacture the most advanced chips in the short term, especially when paired with the various other sanctions that the U.S. has applied to the country. However, this will also provide Chinese companies with greater reason to push forward with their own innovations, potentially making them a threat to American technological supremacy in the long run.

Demanding new Unreal Engine 5 game demo is causing problems for players on the green team.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The developers behind the demanding new open-world adventure game Hell Is Us have issued a workaround for Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 and RTX 40 users experiencing start-up crashes with their freshly released PC demo. In an update on the Steam page for Hell is Us, the devs suggest ratcheting down the graphics quality settings in the main menu of the demo to get past the cinematic intro, as well as turning off all forms of upscaling. Meanwhile, the Hell is Us team at Rogue Factor promises to continue investigating the problem.

🚨 Some players may experience crashes during the intro cinematic of the Hell is Us demo, especially on NVIDIA 4000/5000 series cards.🛠️ We're working on a fix, but in the meantime, a temporary workaround is available.👉 Details & steps here: https://t.co/vXOLPWEuqK pic.twitter.com/jw4D7NbFydJune 2, 2025

Hell is Us already has something of a hardware hog reputation, even though it won't be released until September 4, 2025. Germany's PCGH.de notes that the Unreal Engine 5-powered title “requires at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 for 4K/UHD at 30 frames per second” (machine translation).

We looked at the official recommended specs and, in terms of GPU muscle and VRAM, gamers are advised to equip an Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti (11GB) or AMD RX 6750 XT (12GB) to enjoy this title, some more fuel for the 8GB VRAM GPU fire. 32GB of system RAM is also a recommended requirement.



The temporary workaround for those facing crashing issues, shared by the Hell is Us team, is to first reduce all your graphics settings from the main menu and then deactivate all the upscaling features supported by the demo. That means turning off DLSS, XeSS, FSR, and more. See the screenshot above.

Once you have successfully navigated that menu configuration click-fest, seen the cinematic intro, and reached the point where you are in control of main character Rémi, feel free to crank your quality settings back up, say the devs.

Hell Is Us is a single-player action-adventure in a semi-open world with both melee combat and investigatory elements to enjoy. Check out the above video for a few minutes of ‘investigation gameplay.'

Available to pre-order on Steam/PC now, with the title unlocking on September 4, 2025, the game will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Hopefully, glaring issues like crashing in the intro when played on the PC's most popular, and some would say the best graphics cards, will be a distant memory by then.

TikTok announced on Tuesday that it's officially launching TikTok for Artists, a new music insights platform that is designed to help artists build their careers. The official launch comes two months after TikTok was spotted testing the platform in select countries. 

The tool is built to help artists and their teams better connect with fans, improve their promotional efforts, and inform content creation on TikTok. The platform gives artists, their labels, and their teams access to data about the performance of the artist's music and posts and TikTok. 

These metrics include the number of views, posts, and creator engagements per song, along with similar insights into post performance. Other insights include information about an artist's followers, such as their age, language, and gender.

TikTok for Artists also includes step-by-step guides to TikTok's tools and features, and additional support and resources, the company says.

In addition, TikTok announced that it's launching a new “Pre-Release” tool that allows artists to promote upcoming album releases on TikTok. The feature lets fans pre-save albums directly to their Spotify or Apple Music library, where they will become instantly available to listen to upon release.

TikTok plays a big part in driving music trends and viral songs, so it makes sense for the company to introduce a dedicated space to help artists better promote their content and drive fan engagement. TikTok for Artists could help artists expand their reach and grow their audience.

It's worth noting that the launch of TikTok for Artists comes eight months after ByteDance decided to shut down TikTok Music, a music-streaming service that was being tested in a handful of countries. At the time, the company said it decided to retire the service in order to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok's role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services.”

The events of the past year show that TikTok is no longer trying to compete with services like Spotify and Apple Music, and is instead going to focus on being a platform for music discovery and promotion.

TikTok for Artists is now available in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Morocco, United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. The platform will be rolling out in other countries soon, TikTok says.

CEO C.C. Wei says AI demand is consistently outpacing supply

Just days after TSMC was reported to be in talks with Washington over a planned fab expansion in the Middle East, company CEO C.C. Wei has quashed those rumors at the company's annual shareholders meeting. As noted by Reuters' Wen-Yee Lee on X, Wei said the company had no plans to set up fabs in the Middle East. He also addressed the issue of tariff impact, but said that while TSMC had some exposure to waning demand, AI demand was consistently outpacing supply.

Wei's comments on the Middle East follow a Bloomberg report that claimed TSMC was evaluating the possibility of opening a chip fab in the UAE. It was claimed TSMC had met with U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and a state-owned investment firm several times. The fab would have reportedly been the size of Fab 21 in Arizona.

Concerns cited included national security, given the significant influence of China and Iran in the region, as well as talent drain from other locations required to build the plant. Turns out, those concerns were academic, with TMSC clearly having ruled out the possibility, at least for now. According to ComputerBase, Wei stated a UAE fab would not fit the company's strategy, given that there are no large clients in the local region.

Reuters further reports that Wei addressed the impact of tariffs on the company, noting small but limited exposure he believes is likely to be offset by AI demand.

"Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly. That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters," he said. "TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down."

Wei went on to say that TSMC's business could be affected if demand drops, but claimed AI demand "has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply."

A report in May claimed that tariffs could increase tech prices by up to 70% across the globe. As Wei notes, TSMC faces no immediate exposure because its chips are exported to manufacturers, which incorporate them into their products. However, import duties on those could stifle demand, which could have a knock-on effect on TSMC, a problem that could take months to show up on the chipmaker's bottom line.

Despite Wei's assurances, the company did recently address the U.S. Commerce Department, following a call for public comments regarding tariffs on semiconductors arriving on U.S. shores. TSMC warned import duties on chips would significantly reduce demand for the electronic products sold by TSMC's customers, causing revenue decline and impacting investment on U.S. shores, notably its Arizona plant.

“Lower market demand for our leading U.S. customers' products may consequently reduce demand for TSMC's manufacturing capacity and service onshore," the company said, warning diminished demand could create uncertainty around the timeline and operation of the Arizona fab.

TSMC said "tariffs that raise the cost of end consumer products will lower demand for such products and the semiconductor components they contain" and called on the administration to avoid imposing any tariffs or restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside the U.S..

With the help of the James Webb Space Telescope, a team of astronomers has broken the record for the oldest, most distant galaxy detected to date by humans.

In a preprint study, still awaiting peer review and publication in a journal, astronomers describe this primitive galaxy, giving it the name MoM z14. According to the researchers' calculations, this “cosmic miracle” originated 280 million years after the Big Bang, beating the record set by the discovery just last year of JADES-GS-Z14-0, a galaxy created 290 million years after the origin of the universe.

To put these measurements in context, the current age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. Earth has an approximate age of 4.543 billion years. No one expected the James Webb Space Telescope to have the potential to observe things so close in age to the Big Bang just three and a half years after launch.

A brief reminder about distances relative to space-time. Because light travels at a finite speed of 300,000 meters per second, and because space is expanding, observing light from very distant objects is equivalent to seeing what they were like long ago. For example, when we say that MoM z14 is roughly 13.5 billion years old, that means you would have to travel 13.5 billion years at the speed of light to reach it. So far, there is no point detected by a scientific instrument farther away, and at the same time, older, than this one.

The James Webb Space Telescope, with its ability to peer deep into distant space, allows us to study some aspects of the universe in its early stages. How does it do this? By infrared sensors. Due to the expansion of the universe, almost all the galaxies we see from Earth are moving away from us. So, from our point of view, their light appears to have a longer wavelength because it is stretched by this movement. We call this “redshift”: Their wavelengths are redder because they are longer, and so shift towards the red end of the light spectrum. The earlier an object was created, and therefore the farther away it is, having expanded outwards for a longer period of time, the greater the redshift.

The James Webb Space Telescope was able to determine that MoM z14 is 50 times smaller than the Milky Way, and also detected the presence of nitrogen and carbon in the galaxy. This is significant because, despite being only 280 million years older than the Big Bang, this shows that MoM z14 does not belong to the first generation of galaxies formed, since stars in these galaxies would be made up only of hydrogen and helium, the elements that predominantly made up the early universe. Heavier elements only arrived later, after being produced in stars.

Can the James Webb cross that threshold and find the first generation of galaxies? Such discoveries could be a long way off, but we have to keep looking.

Researchers have found that greenspace exposure is associated with widespread patterns of structural brain development during early adolescence, which in turn are associated with better academic and mental outcomes. The findings of the study in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier, emphasize the need to integrate natural environments into urban and educational settings and provide key insights for policymakers, parents, and educators to support adolescent well-being.

Previous research has shown that exposure to green spaces positively influences mental health and cognition. However, there is limited understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of brain development and its potential role in supporting mental well-being in children.

This is the first study to examine the influence of greenspace exposure on structural neurodevelopmental trajectories and which tests whether these trajectories mediate the relationship between greenspace exposure and positive academic or mental health outcomes.

John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, comments, "We tend to focus on the detrimental effects and negative aspects of our environment. It is equally important to highlight exposure to green spaces and other positive environments and their contributions to human thriving and resilience."

Investigators analyzed data from more than 7,000 ethnically diverse adolescents in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study from 21 sites across the United States to test the relationship between greenspace exposure at age 9-10 and brain structure two years later as well as change over time. Additionally, they tested whether brain structural development statistically mediated the associations of greenspace exposure with mental health and academic performance.

Co-lead investigator Qingyang Li, MSc, Neuroimaging Department, Institute of Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, King's College London, explains, "We found greenspace exposure to be associated with brain structural changes at both whole-brain and regional-brain levels. We also found an indirect effect of greenspace exposure on better academic and mental outcomes through both total and regional cortical structure independent of household and neighborhood disadvantage."

They found that greenspace exposure was associated with greater total surface area (SA) and cortical volume (CV), greater cortical thickness (CT) in temporal regions and the insula, lower thickness in the caudal middle frontal and superior frontal gyri, greater SA across several regions, and greater volume of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. In analyses studying change in brain structure over time, higher greenspace exposure was associated with greater growth of total SA, lower average thickness reduction, and reduced total CV growth as well as changes at the regional level.

Adolescence is typified by rapid structural brain development and heightened susceptibility to environmental influences. By 2050, approximately 68% of the global population is expected to reside in cities. Rapid urbanization reduces opportunities for individuals to interact with natural environments and green space.

Co-lead investigator Divyangana Rakesh, PhD, Neuroimaging Department, Institute of Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, King's College London, concludes, "Children's and adolescents' mental health issues have become a global concern. At the same time, urbanization is rapidly changing the environment and often reducing access to green spaces. This study offers insights for policymakers on how urban planning can help address the growing mental health challenges faced by children and highlights the importance of integrating green spaces into school settings and urban environments."

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) on May 1, 2025, as the cover of Volume 17, Issue 5, titled "Defining the hypoxic thresholds that trigger blood-brain barrier disruption: the effect of age."

In this study, researchers Arjun Sapkota, Sebok K. Halder, and Richard Milner from San Diego Biomedical Research Institute investigated how aging affects the brain's vulnerability to low oxygen, or hypoxia. Using C57BL/6J mice ranging from 2 to 23 months of age, they identified specific oxygen levels that disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-a critical structure that protects brain tissue from harmful substances. The findings are important for understanding age-related cognitive decline and the potential risks faced by individuals with chronic oxygen-limiting conditions such as asthma, sleep apnea, emphysema, and heart disease.

The BBB is essential for maintaining brain health. In this study, mild and prolonged hypoxia-called chronic mild hypoxia-was found to compromise the BBB in mice. Older mice showed significantly more BBB disruption than younger ones. Notably, barrier weakening and blood vessel changes occurred at oxygen levels of just 15% in aged mice, compared to 13% in young mice. These data suggest that the aging brain is more sensitive to oxygen deprivation, even at levels that may be considered only mildly hypoxic.

The researchers also determined when this vulnerability emerged. The BBB showed increased sensitivity to low oxygen not only in aged mice but also in mice as young as 2 to 6 months, with a second spike occurring between 12 and 15 months-equivalent to middle age in mice. These findings may reflect age-dependent changes in brain vascular function and remodeling capacity.

"Hypoxia-induced endothelial proliferation was relatively constant across the age range, but advanced age strongly enhanced the degree of BBB disruption (4-6-fold greater in 23 months vs. 2 months old)."

Another key focus was microglial activation, a sign of brain inflammation. Aged mice exhibited higher microglial activation across all oxygen levels, including normal conditions. Chronic microglial activation is closely linked to neuroinflammation and has been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's. While the rate of blood vessel formation was constant across ages, the degree of BBB disruption increased sharply with age, suggesting that repair mechanisms may weaken over time.

These results may help explain why older adults with chronic hypoxia-related diseases are at higher risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The study also draws attention to the risks of high-altitude exposure for aging populations, where oxygen levels naturally drop.

Altogether, these findings underscore the importance of protecting brain health in older individuals by managing oxygen exposure and reducing hypoxia-related risks. The researchers emphasize the need to develop new therapies that support blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly in aging populations exposed to chronic or intermittent low-oxygen conditions.

Certain medications used in the treatment of bone conditions, particularly when combined with corticosteroids, may significantly increase the risk of a rare but serious jaw disease. This finding comes from a study by the University of Oulu, which analyzed data from Finnish adult patients who began bone medication between 2013 and 2015. The researchers recommend more careful monitoring and consideration in the use of such medications.

The condition in question is so-called osteonecrosis of the jaw, in which the jawbone weakens and deteriorates as a result of the medication. The incidence of osteonecrosis was 0.3% among low-dose antiresorptive drug (AR) users and as high as 9% among those receiving high doses. Antiresorptive drugs are commonly used in Finland, particularly in the treatment of osteoporosis and in the prevention of bone metastases in patients with breast or prostate cancer. The most commonly used AR drugs are denosumab and bisphosphonates.

According to the study, the risk of jaw osteonecrosis was significantly higher in patients using denosumab. These users were up to five times more likely to suffer serious jaw damage than those taking bisphosphonates. When corticosteroids were also involved, the risk increased further: simultaneous use of corticosteroids in addition to AR drug increased the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw by 2 times in high-dose AR recipients and 6 times in low-dose AR recipients. Other significant risk factors for jaw osteonecrosis included male sex and a cancer diagnosis.

This is the first population-level study conducted in Finland on the incidence and risk factors of medication-related jaw osteonecrosis. The analysis covered data from nearly 60,000 Finnish patients.

Our study confirms that denosumab is associated with a significantly higher risk of jaw osteonecrosis compared to bisphosphonates, but the difference in risk between the two was surprisingly large. It was also particularly surprising how strongly the simultaneous use of corticosteroids increased the risk in patients on low-dose bone medication.”

Miika Kujanpää, doctoral researcher, University of Oulu and dentist

The researchers recommend that patient treatment plans be reviewed more carefully when multiple medications are in use, particularly denosumab and corticosteroids together. They also emphasise the role of oral health care in reducing risks – for example, the condition of teeth and gums should be checked both before and during bone medication treatment.

A new type of mRNA vaccine is more scalable and adaptable to continuously evolving viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1, according to a study by researchers at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health and the Pennsylvania State University. The study was published today in npj Vaccines.

Though highly effective at inducing an immune response, current mRNA vaccines, such as those used to prevent COVID-19, present two significant challenges: the high amount of mRNA needed to produce them and the constantly evolving nature of the pathogen.

The virus changes, moving the goal post, and updating the vaccine takes some time."

Suresh Kuchipudi, Ph.D., senior author, chair of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Pitt Public Health

To address these challenges, the researchers created a proof-of-concept COVID-19 vaccine using what's known as a "trans-amplifying" mRNA platform. In this approach, the mRNA is separated into two fragments-the antigen sequence and the replicase sequence-the latter of which can be produced in advance, saving crucial time in the event a new vaccine must be developed urgently and produced at scale.

Additionally, the researchers analyzed the spike-protein sequences of all known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 for commonalities, rendering what's known as a "consensus spike protein" as the basis for the vaccine's antigen.

In mice, the vaccine induced a robust immune response against many strains of SARS-CoV-2.

"This has the potential for more lasting immunity that would not require updating, because the vaccine has the potential to provide broad protection," said Kuchipudi. "Additionally, this format requires an mRNA dose 40 times less than conventional vaccines, so this new approach significantly reduces the overall cost of the vaccine."

The lessons learned from this study could inform more efficient vaccine development for other constantly evolving RNA viruses with pandemic potential, Kuchipudi said. "We hope to apply the principles of this lower-cost, broad-protection antigen design to pressing challenges like bird flu."

Other authors on the study were Abhinay Gontu, Padmaja Jakka, Ph.D., Maurice Byukusenge, D.V.M., Ph.D., D.A.C.V.M., Meera Surendran Nair, Bhushan M. Jayarao, M.V.Sc., Ph.D., M.P.H., Marco Archetti, Ph.D., and Ruth H. Nissly, Ph.D., all of Pennsylvania State University; and Sougat Misra, Ph.D., Shubhada K. Chothe, Ph.D., M.V.Sc., B.V.Sc., Santhamani Ramasamy, Ph.D., D.A.C.V.M., and Lindsey C. LaBella, all of Pitt.

This research was supported by chair funds from the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences and Interdisciplinary Innovation Fellowship at the One Health Microbiome Center at Pennsylvania State University.

A recent 12-week study involving participants with prediabetes found that a simple dietary change may have significant benefits.

The researchers found that, compared with consuming white rice, eating black beans or chickpeas was associated with reduced markers of inflammation, and consuming chickpeas was linked to reduced blood cholesterol.

Because the study was relatively small and of short duration, scientists need to carry out more research to replicate the results. The findings have also yet to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal but were recently presented at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, in Orlando, Florida.

However, because black beans and chickpeas are relatively cheap and considered healthy by experts, this type of intervention is worth exploring further.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes affects an estimated 1 in 10 people in the United States, the majority of whom have type 2 diabetes. 

This condition is marked by an inability to control levels of glucose in the blood. When blood glucose is elevated, it damages healthy tissues. Treatment can successfully manage type 2 diabetes and reduce the risk of damage, but there is no cure.

Prediabetes, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is when an individual has “blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.”

Prediabetes is not a guarantee that an individual will go on to develop type 2 diabetes, but the risk is elevated. 

Unlike type 2 diabetes, however, prediabetes can be reversed, so scientists are exploring interventions that could help this population. Because nutrition plays a pivotal role in the development of type 2 diabetes, many scientists are focused on dietary interventions 

For their recent study, the researchers recruited individuals with prediabetes. They wanted to understand whether black beans and chickpeas, consumed daily, could influence biomarkers of health after 6 and 12 weeks.

In total, the study involved 72 people. They randomized them to one of three groups, consuming 1 cup of white rice, chickpeas, or black beans each day.

At the start of the study, and at weeks 6 and 12, the researchers took blood samples to measure levels of: 

They also measured glucose metabolism and blood glucose levels.

At week 12, those consuming chickpeas had a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, those eating black beans had reduced levels of the inflammatory marker, IL-6. 

However, the scientists did not identify any significant changes in glucose metabolism.

Alongside the positive results linked to legume intake, there was also a more surprising finding: At the 12-week mark, the group consuming white rice had significantly lower levels of LDL “bad” cholesterol than at the start of the study.

This was a small, relatively brief study, so researchers need to carry out more work to understand the full benefits of these legumes on people with prediabetes. 

According to the authors of the study, they plan to continue this line of investigation. In particular, they want to focus on the links between metabolic health and the gut microbiome.

Chickpeas and black beans are in the legume family, alongside peas, lentils, and other beans, like pinto, kidney, and lima beans. 

Rich in protein and fiber, research has found associations between legume consumption and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. There's also some evidence that consuming legumes may be associated with a reduction in cancer risk.

Medical News Today reached out to Maddie Gallivan, RD, a registered dietitian who was not involved in the recent study. We asked how legumes might reduce cholesterol. “The soluble fiber in these legumes helps to lower cholesterol by reducing how much is absorbed into the bloodstream,” she explained.

Soluble fiber helps reduce cholesterol in a number of ways. For instance, it binds to cholesterol in the gut, carrying it through the intestines and out of the body in stool.

According to Gallivan, “Beans and chickpeas are excellent examples of plant-based protein sources that are also packed with fibre. They also help you keep fuller for longer.” 

“When eaten as part of a diverse, plant-rich diet,” she continued, “beans and chickpeas can support a healthy gut microbiome. A variety of fibres from whole plant foods — like vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, pulses, legumes, nuts, and seeds — will feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, encouraging them to flourish and support overall health.” 

Legumes like chickpeas and black beans are an important staple in many parts of the world, but they are relatively unpopular in the West.

Although widely available and low cost, research suggests that the average U.S. adult spends less than $5 per year on legumes. 

“There are a lot of ways to incorporate beans into your regular diet as a cost-effective way to support overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases,” explained author Morganne Smith, a doctoral candidate at Illinois Institute of Technology, and presenting author for this study.

“You can blend them to add some thickness to a soup base, add them as a salad topping, or pair them with other grains like rice or quinoa,” says Smith.

According to Gallivan, they're also “a great alternative to red and processed meats, because they can easily be added to meals like curries, stews, and casseroles.”

However, she also adds a note of caution for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): “It's important to take a gradual approach to increasing legume intake and seek personalized advice from a dietitian to manage symptoms effectively.”

MNT reached out to Federica Amati, PhD, MPH, head nutritionist at ZOE, a science and nutrition company. Amati, who was not involved in the study, was not surprised that eating chickpeas and beans “helps with cardiometabolic health markers.” 

“They are also good for the environment,” she told us. “Eat more of them.”

In a new JNeurosci paper, Adrian Rothenfluh and colleagues from the University of Utah developed a fruit fly model of cocaine self-administration that can be used to explore the genetic underpinnings of cocaine addiction. 

To model voluntary cocaine intake in fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, the researchers first assessed cocaine consumption and preferences of this insect. Cocaine was innately aversive to fruit flies because it activated their bitter-sensing receptors. In other words, the fruit flies did not like cocaine's bitter taste. When the researchers mutated a gene for these receptors to reduce bitter perception, this made cocaine less aversive to the flies, and they began to approach a solution containing cocaine. Eventually, fruit flies with mutated receptors even preferred the cocaine solution over a sucrose solution. 

We have previously modeled alcohol self-administration in fruit flies, and this has revealed that humans and fruit flies share many of the same genes that drive alcohol consumption and addiction. So, it is reasonable to think that the genes involved with cocaine addiction in humans may also be involved in this fruit fly model."

Clairity, Inc., a digital health innovator advancing AI-driven healthcare solutions, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) De Novo authorization for CLAIRITY BREAST, a novel, image-based prognostic platform designed to predict five-year breast cancer risk from a routine screening mammogram. With this authorization, Clairity is planning to launch among leading health systems through 2025 – propelling a new era of precision medicine in breast cancer.

Each year, more than 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide, including over 370,000 cases in women in the United States. Early detection and risk reduction are powerful tools to save lives, but their most effective deployment depends on accurate risk assessment. Most risk assessment models rely heavily on age and family history to predict risk. However, 85% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history, and nearly half have no identifiable risk factors. In addition, traditional risk models, built on data from predominantly European Caucasian women, have not generalized well to women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

CLAIRITY BREAST analyzes subtle imaging features on screening mammograms that correlate with future breast cancer risk, making early risk prediction feasible based on a screening mammogram alone. The result is a validated five-year risk score delivered to healthcare providers through existing clinical infrastructures, supporting more personalized follow up care.

For more than 60 years, mammograms have saved lives by detecting early-stage cancers. Now, advancements in AI and computer vision can uncover hidden clues in the mammograms – invisible to the human eye – to help predict future risk. By delivering validated, equitable risk assessments, we can help expand access to life-saving early detection and prevention for women everywhere."

"Personalized, risk-based screening is critical to improving breast cancer outcomes, and AI tools offer us the best opportunity to fulfill that potential," said Dr. Robert A. Smith, Senior Vice President of Early Cancer Detection Science at the American Cancer Society. "By integrating AI models that assess individual risk, we can better identify women at higher risk, and those who may benefit from supplemental screening methods, such as MRI, improving early detection and more effective prevention strategies."

"Clairity's FDA authorization is a turning point for more women to access the scientific advances of AI-driven cancer risk prediction," said Larry Norton, Founding Scientific Director of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. "Breast cancer is rising, especially among younger women, yet most risk models often miss those who will develop the disease. Now we can ensure more women get the right care at the right time."

"What makes the availability of CLAIRITY BREAST a true sea change is that we're now predicting risk of future cancer from patterns in breast tissue, in an otherwise normal screening, before it's even there," said Jeff Luber, CEO of Clairity. "CLAIRITY BREAST is designed to fit seamlessly into the current clinical infrastructure to help providers scale precision prevention – with the goal of reducing late-stage diagnoses, lowering costs, and saving more lives."

The FDA De Novo authorization positions CLAIRITY BREAST as a first-in-class platform within the $63 billion global breast cancer prediction market, ushering in a new standard for personalized, risk-based screening and cancer prevention.

 June 03, 2025  

As a young child in the 1980s, Jiwa Farrell earned the moniker “Little Apple Cheeks” because her face was always so “cute and pink.” But by the time she was 6 years old, she had already begun recognizing that something else distinguished her from other kids besides her bright pink complexion.

“I had flu-like symptoms all throughout my childhood and always felt very fatigued,” Farrell told Medscape Medical News. “My muscles ached, my joints ached, and I remember thinking as a kid to myself, ‘If I feel this way and other people don't feel this way, what's wrong with me?'”

The answer to that question would take a decade for Farrell and her family to discover, and for most of those years, Farrell's mother, Sharon, had grown so frustrated with doctors that she started letting them know at the start of each appointment the word that would cause her to turn around and walk right back out. “Don't you dare say the word ‘hypochondria' to me,” Sharon would tell the doctors. “She was so angry,” Farrell said, with her mother nodding beside her, “because she knew something was wrong.” 

And yet, “hypochondria” became the refrain that Farrell and her mother would hear over and over — despite a petite mal seizure at ages 7, 9, and 10, despite frequent fatigue and pain, despite swelling in her knee after a karate tournament that drained blood and scared her pediatrician so much that he sent them to the hospital. Farrell did receive a diagnosis of childhood epilepsy, and the swollen knee was labeled an “unknown infection” as she spent 3 days on intravenous antibiotics in the hospital. “And through all these things, the doctors still continued to tell my mom I was a hypochondriac,” Farrell said.

The breakthrough came when she was 16 years old after several events that were difficult to dismiss, although some doctors still did. First her feet, ankles, and lower legs became so hot and swollen that she couldn't walk — initially diagnosed again as an infection. Then while teaching a karate class, her entire right side went numb and she passed out. Farrell had suffered a stroke. Her doctor took her off oral birth control pills, suspecting a blood clot, but her mother, still desperate for answers, showed her medical records to her husband's primary care provider. He ran a few more tests, noted a low platelet count, and sent her to a specific pediatric hematologist-oncologist at the children's hospital.

“As soon as we went in there, she saw my blood work and didn't even examine me before she snapped her fingers and said, ‘I know what this is,'” Farrell recalled. She ran tests to be certain, and sure enough, Farrell's antinuclear antibody test came back positive. Farrell finally received a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.

Today, the 47-year-old from Lakeland, Florida, is a professional lupus patient advocate who helps others advocate for themselves in the way she wished she had known to do.

Farrell's experience is frustratingly common — and slowly being recognized as leading to lasting harm to those who live through it. “Symptom invalidation,” or “medical gaslighting,” as many patients call it, occurs when doctors dismiss, minimize, or simply ignore patients' symptoms, and it can contribute to depression, anxiety, suicidality, self-doubt, shame, healthcare avoidance, loss of trust in clinicians, and diagnostic delays, according to a recent systematic review.

The study, published in the April issue of Psychological Bulletin, involved a review of 151 qualitative reports of 11,307 patients with 13 conditions known to “generate clinical uncertainty,” Allyson Bontempo, PhD, of the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey, and her colleagues wrote. A recent “upsurge in the prevalence of contested, ambiguous, and difficult-to-diagnose illnesses” has made healthcare interactions with no known diagnosis the fastest growing type of medical visit, they noted. Rheumatologic and autoimmune conditions like lupus, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome are among the conditions Bontempo's group studied, but so were conditions that have only more recently been medically accepted as valid, from long COVID to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

The researchers identified four broad categories of harm that clinicians' symptom invalidation can lead to: 

The findings from the new systematic review echo many of those reported recently in a study in Rheumatology that looked specifically at rheumatologic conditions that are often hard to diagnosis, including lupus, inflammatory arthritis, Sjögren disease, systemic sclerosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, or other inflammatory rheumatic disease. That mixed-methods study not only included participants whose symptoms were dismissed as psychosomatic but also many who received an inaccurate psychiatric diagnosis before their proper rheumatologic one. Patients with either experience had a higher incidence of anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem as well as reduced trust in clinicians and the medical system.

“A key point is for clinicians to always consider autoimmunity when they are faced with a patient with many symptoms which initially don't seem to be linked or have an obvious cause, and not to reach for a psychosomatic or mental health diagnosis before they have ruled this out,” lead author Melanie Sloan, PhD, head of the Long-Term Conditions Group at the Cambridge University Department of Public Health, Cambridge, England, told Medscape Medical News. “And if they take on a patient who has been misdiagnosed previously, be very aware of how deep and pervasive the damage from these types of misdiagnoses can be.” 

More than 80% of patients given a psychosomatic or psychiatric misdiagnosis reported that the misdiagnosis had caused them to distrust doctors at the time and had damaged their self-worth. A little over half reported it had led to long-term distrust in doctors, and 72% continued to feel upset about the misdiagnosis today (P < .001). Patients who were misdiagnosed with psychiatric/psychosomatic symptoms also reported lower levels of confidence, trust, and satisfaction related to medical care than those who had been misdiagnosed with a different physical condition.

Sloan's study similarly found higher rates of healthcare avoidance and of underreporting symptoms “from distrust and fear that symptoms would be disbelieved and misattributed again,” the researchers wrote.

Paula Zimbrean, MD, a professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, was not surprised by the findings in the Rheumatology study and told Medscape Medical News that they confirmed much of what is seen in psychiatric consultations regarding the impact on patients' quality of life and healthcare behaviors of medically unexplained symptoms and the difficulties of getting accurate diagnoses.

However, acknowledging the validity of patients' experiences, asking patients how they would like to move forward as a team after an accurate diagnosis, and continuing to check in and support the patient can be valuable steps in building the clinician-patient relationship.

Sareth Walton, a 40-year-old in Seattle, knows exactly what it feels like to get an incorrect psychiatric diagnosis before finally getting appropriately diagnosed with lupus. After slamming her head into the window during a car accident in 2007, she suffered blurred vision for 3 months. But then other symptoms began: First fatigue, then “bizarre behavior,” as her husband described it — a “complete change in personality,” Walton said.

“I was pretty much like a zombie staring at the wall, and I wouldn't respond when spoken to,” Walton said. “It just went downhill really fast.” She began developing auditory hallucinations and became paranoid that light fixtures were actually cameras from the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigating her life. “We watched football games, and I thought the commentator was sending me subliminal messages that I'm in danger,” Walton recalled.

When put on a psychiatric hold in a facility over an hour away from her home, her symptoms worsened. Despite being placed in a padded room, she was determined to break free and rammed her body against the walls so hard that the doctors eventually had to tranquilize her. She was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder “not otherwise specified” and prescribed antipsychotics.

Once stable, Walton checked herself out, but a few months later, she developed ongoing joint pain, then a fever that wouldn't go away. When it climbed to 103 ºF after 3 days, her primary care provider sent her to the hospital. Her thyroid and kidney labs were abnormal, and her lymph nodes were enlarged. A team of multiple specialists began piecing together the clinical picture and as they were noting three hallmark symptoms of lupus, she developed the butterfly-shaped malar rash that clinched the diagnosis.

“Looking back now, I wish I didn't get the [psychiatric] diagnosis so quickly because they could have looked outside the box of just mental health,” Walton said. She wished they had done more bloodwork and looked at her “fresh, like a blank slate.” Yet even after the lupus diagnosis, Walton experienced dismissal of her symptoms. The day after she was discharged with a proper diagnosis, her pain became so extreme that she called an ambulance — and was told by the emergency medical technicians that she was likely just experiencing menstrual pain. Even a nurse at the hospital disregarded her symptoms and treated her as though she was drug-seeking, Walton said.

Sloan said that “medical gaslighting” is a common term and that she empathizes with patients who say they have experienced it because their symptoms have been disbelieved, dismissed, or misattributed to another cause. But it's unfair to apply the term to clinicians as it “implies purposeful intent to cause harm, and it is a very rare clinician that is intentionally trying to harm or distress a patient,” she said.

Her team also interviewed 50 clinicians from a wide range of countries, 64% of whom were from the United Kingdom and 40% of whom were rheumatologists.

“Almost all of the clinicians interviewed in our study were shocked and saddened by the level of long-term distress from these misdiagnoses and highly motivated to improve their patients' experiences,” Sloan said.

“Interestingly, several clinicians explained that they thought they were being reassuring by telling patients that their symptoms were most likely to be psychological or stress-related,” Sloan said. “They thought this would be preferable to patients worrying about having a disease. Yet for patients who knew there was something seriously wrong with their bodies and felt disbelieved, this ‘reassurance,' although usually well-intentioned, was found to often be deeply damaging with life-long and life-changing repercussions.” 

In their review, Bontempo and her colleagues suggested that symptom validation happens so often because the training clinicians receive hasn't maintained pace with growing uncertainty about new conditions.

“I don't recommend reassurance about it ‘probably being nothing serious' to patients who have a lot of distress about their symptoms,” Bontempo said in a press release. “Patients appreciate clinicians communicating their uncertainty and admitting they don't know something.”

Sheila Lahijani, MD, a clinical professor of medical psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, told Medscape Medical News that “communication is critical” to providing support to patients and attempting to restore their trust in providers.

“Naming what has happened and aiming to have a shared understanding of what has contributed to the misdiagnosis and its consequences are the first steps,” Lahijani said. “Then, it's about building trust and taking on the approach that the provider and the patient are a team.”

Fotios Koumpouras, MD, an associate professor of rheumatology and director of the Yale Lupus Program at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, told Medscape Medical News that this topic “unfortunately has plagued patients with rheumatic diseases,” partly because many of their symptoms can sound bizarre when described by patients, potentially resulting in early disbelief. These findings could therefore be “impactful to both patients and physicians,” he said.

Koumpouras also noted that some rheumatic diseases, such as lupus, have been found to be associated with anxiety and other psychiatric illnesses, an issue Sloan explored in a previous study. Walton's experience of neuropsychiatric lupus before other symptoms appeared is an example of how this manifestation is often overlooked.

Research has also suggested that a history of trauma or adverse childhood experiences has been linked to development of lupus, Koumpouras said, which could increase the vulnerability of patients with lupus receiving an initial misdiagnosis. Further, many US patients with lupus are African American individuals and may already face barriers to access and healthcare disparities.

Lahijani noted that some patients may develop trauma and stressor-related disorders because of their medical illness, so it can be helpful to acknowledge the potential involvement of a sympathetic nervous system “in overdrive.” That can then “cause the ‘fight, flight, freeze, fawn' response” that “may help explain how patients engage in the medical system thereafter,” she said.

“Patients need to be validated about what they have experienced and what residual distress they may have that can manifest as fear, worry, nervousness, hypervigilance, avoidance, or low mood,” Lahijani said. “Providers also can be more effective in their care of these patients when they are aware of their own conscious and unconscious biases.”

Sloan acknowledged the time pressures that clinicians face, which makes it all the more important to “empower and educate patients to be confident in knowing their own bodies,” such as tracking their symptoms and accessing peer support, she said.

“We should not underestimate the power of doctors saying ‘I believe you' to patients with multiple invisible symptoms, and ‘I am sorry for what has happened in the past' if they had a difficult road to diagnosis. It doesn't create a medico-legal issue, just demonstrates human empathy and a positive start of rebuilding trust and a patient's self-worth.”

The Psychological Bulletin study was funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the authors did not note any disclosures. The Rheumatology study was funded by LUPUS UK and The Lupus Trust. Two authors reported receiving consulting, speaker, or advisory fees from Alumis, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, GSK, Sanofi, Vifor, and UCB. Another author is CEO of The Wren project, and another is a trustee of LUPUS UK. Sloan and Lahijani had no disclosures. Zimbrean reported consulting for Ultragenyx, Vivet Therapeutics, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Koumpouras reported disclosures with AstraZeneca, Aurinia, Cabaletta Bio, Atara Bio, and Adicet Bio.

Today's launch of the BioResolve Protein A Affinity Columns will help to bring lifesaving therapies to patients, faster. One of the main bottlenecks in the development of biotherapeutics like monoclonal antibodies is the time required to identify and optimize a suitable cell line for antibody production,

We have solved for this by designing a novel, highly efficient particle with an immobilized Protein A surface, and combined this with MaxPeak Premier Hardware, resulting in the most sensitive protein A column on the market.”

Dr. Udit Batra, President and Chief Executive Officer, Waters Corporation

The BioResolve Protein A Affinity Columns have been designed to provide up to 7x improvements in sensitivity compared to the market leader. The novel, non-porous 3.5 μm particles allow accurate quantitation of antibody titers at lower concentrations and with less sample. In addition, the columns have been designed to couple with size exclusion chromatography columns to measure titer concentrations and aggregate analysis in a single run on any LC system.

"The new column will enhance our ability to support our clients in developing new medicines,” said Arnaud Delobel, R&D and Innovation Director, Quality Assistance. “It simplifies two-dimensional workflows for simultaneous titer and aggregate analysis, and can be readily integrated into new LC/MS setups to analyze in-process antibody samples without prior purification. By streamlining workflows and enabling simultaneous assessment of multiple critical quality attributes, it helps cut project turnaround times and ultimately supports faster time to market for biologics.”

This innovation furthers the Company's commitment to enhancing the analytical toolbox for biomolecule characterization, allowing scientists to speed up the development of safe, efficacious, and accessible biotherapeutics.

The columns are available in 2.1 x 20 mm and 3.9 x 5 mm formats and are available to order now.

Patients with Stage II and III (early-stage) HER2+ breast cancer usually undergo pre-operative therapy with multi-agent chemotherapy in combination with anti-HER2 antibodies, followed by surgery. A less intensive, reduced chemotherapy treatment approach is currently being evaluated in the CompassHER2 pCR trial (EA1181, NCT04266249) by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN). While longer follow-up is needed to assess long-term outcomes, pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and predictors of pCR are being shared at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, detailing which patients may benefit most from the new approach.

Neoadjuvant treatment with 12 weeks of THP led to a pCR rate of 64% in patients with early-stage HER2-positive, ER-negative breast cancer at the time of surgery, compared to 33% for those with ER-positive tumors. We also found that among ER-positive breast cancers, lower level of ER expression resulted in higher pCR rates."

Nadine M. Tung, MD, lead investigator, medical oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston

THP combines one chemotherapy drug (a taxane) with the HER2-targeting drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab. THP is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. Previous small studies have shown that patients with early-stage disease can also reach a pCR with less intensive therapies like THP.

CompassHER2 pCR (EA1181) is the first large-scale trial to evaluate this approach and its ultimate impact on survival. The regimen being assessed in this single-arm, non-randomized trial is 12 weeks of pre-operative THP (4 cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HP)) with weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) or docetaxel (q3w x 4), followed by surgery.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, patient enrollment in the trial was rapid, with 2175 participants joining between February 2020 and October 2023. Among them, 2141 started THP. Disease progression during THP occurred in only 16 patients (0.7%).

"If patients achieved a pCR, they did not receive any more chemotherapy, only HER2-directed antibodies after surgery, as well as radiation and endocrine therapy if indicated," said Dr. Tung. "Ultimately, this trial should establish if patients who have no residual cancer at surgery after THP can forgo further chemotherapy."

The primary endpoint is 3-year recurrence-free survival, which requires longer follow-up.

The pCR rates presented at ASCO (Abstract 501) are categorized by estrogen receptor (ER) status and other characteristics. A subset of 569 patients underwent biopsies for analysis using the HER2DX® pCR-score (Reveal Genomics®). This laboratory test assigns a low, medium, or high score based on tumor gene expression and clinical features.

It is already known that among HER2+ breast cancer tumors, those that are ER-negative have a higher pCR rate compared to those that are ER-positive. This study reveals several other predictors of pCR in patients with Stage II and III HER2+ breast cancer. These include:

The analysis did not find an association with the baseline clinical stage of disease.

While THP can cause a range of side effects, it is less toxic than regimens that contain multiple chemotherapy drugs.

"The findings from this trial may ultimately help clinicians identify which patients with HER2+ breast cancer could be spared from the toxicity of more intensive chemotherapy," said Dr. Tung.

The first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) pivekimab sunirine (PVEK) demonstrated promising efficacy and high response rates for patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendric cell neoplasm (BPDCN), according to data from a Phase I/II study led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

These results suggest that PVEK should be considered a potential new standard treatment option for patients with BPDCN, a rare, aggressive blood cancer that involves the skin, bone marrow and lymph nodes.

Findings from the CADENZA study were presented today at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting by Naveen Pemmaraju, M.D., professor of Leukemia, who led the trial together with Naval Daver, M.D., professor of Leukemia.

As a frontline treatment in 33 newly diagnosed patients with BPDCN, researchers observed an overall response rate of 85%, including a complete response rate of 70% with a median overall survival of 16.6 months.

Patients with BPDCN are in need of improved frontline therapies to treat their disease, so we're very excited to see this trial going extremely well in terms of safety and efficacy. The responses we have observed make PVEK a strong candidate as a standard-of-care treatment."

Naveen Pemmaraju, M.D., professor of Leukemia

The current standard-of-care treatment for patients with BPDCN is tagraxofusp-erzs, which targets CD123 found at high levels on certain cancer cells, including BPDCN. MD Anderson researchers helped advance tagraxofusp-erzs toward Food and Drug Administration approval in 2018.

PVEK represents a next generation of CD123-targeted treatment. As an ADC, it works by delivering a drug directly to cancer cells by targeting CD123 on the surface of BPDCN cells, resulting in death of the cancer cells.

The global multi-center trial enrolled a total of 84 adult patients with CD123-positive BPDCN. Of these patients, 33 patients were newly diagnosed, and 51 patients had relapsed or refractory BPDCN with one, two or three prior lines of therapy. Participants received the therapy intravenously on day one of a 21-day cycle in an outpatient setting.

The most common side effects included peripheral edema, which was reversible and found to be manageable.

Given the results of this trial, there is potential for investigating combination therapies of CD123-targeted agent PVEK with other treatments active in BPDCN in future clinical trials, Pemmaraju explained.

The clinical trial was funded by AbbVie. Pemmaraju has served on the advisory board and as a consultant for AbbVie. Daver has received research support and has served on the advisory board and as a consultant for AbbVie.

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, "What the Health?" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition.

Cuts to health programs made by the second Trump administration in its first 100 days are already having an impact at the state and local level. And additional reductions under consideration in Congress could have even more far-reaching effects on the nation's health care system writ large.

In this special episode of "KFF Health News' ‘What the Health?'" national and local experts join host Julie Rovner for a live conversation at the Association of Health Care Journalists' annual meeting in Los Angeles. This conversation was taped on Friday, May 30.

Joining Rovner are Rachel Nuzum, senior vice president for policy at The Commonwealth Fund; Berenice Núñez Constant, senior vice president of government relations and civic engagement at AltaMed Health Services; and Anish Mahajan, chief deputy director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

This article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

A new county-level dataset from Johns Hopkins University researchers reveals a national decline in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among U.S. children since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Out of 2,066 studied counties, 1,614 counties, 78%, reported drops in vaccinations and the average county-level vaccination rate fell 93.92% pre-pandemic to 91.26% post-pandemic-an average decline of 2.67%, moving further away from the 95% herd immunity threshold to predict or limit the spread of measles.

Only four of the 33 states in studied-California, Connecticut, Maine, and New York-reported an increase in the median county-level vaccination rate.

The data is published today in JAMA.

The data is released as more than one thousand measles cases have been reported this year in the United States. With the exception of 2019, this is the most cases reported in the U.S. in a single year in over three decades, with the vast majority of cases occurring in unvaccinated children.

"This open, high resolution dataset provides a critical resource to explore and better understand the country's vaccination landscape and its implications for the risk of measles spread," said senior author Lauren Gardner, director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering, an expert in using data and modeling to better understand the spread of disease. This work draws on her experience leading the data collection efforts behind the Johns Hopkins' COVID-19 dashboard that was relied upon globally during the pandemic.

Gardner created Johns Hopkins' COVID-19 dashboard that was relied upon globally to track cases during the pandemic.

The county-level vaccination data complements the state and national-level from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirming a widespread decline in MMR vaccination rates in the U.S. following the COVID-19 pandemic, while also revealing the significant heterogeneity of vaccination patterns within and across states.

The team collected county-level 2-dose MMR vaccination rates for kindergarteners from each state's department of health website from 2017 to 2024, where available. The dataset includes at least one year of vaccination data for 2,237 counties across 38 states.

A protein that gives fleas their bounce has been used to boot out bacteria cells, with lab results demonstrating the material's potential for preventing medical implant infection. 

The collaborative study led by researchers at RMIT University in Australia is the first reported use of antibacterial coatings made from resilin-mimetic proteins to fully block bacteria from attaching to a surface. 

Study lead author Professor Namita Roy Choudhury said the finding is a critical step towards their goal of creating smart surfaces that stop dangerous bacteria, especially antibiotic-resistant ones like MRSA, from growing on medical implants. 

This work shows how these coatings can be adjusted to effectively fight bacteria - not just in the short term, but possibly over a long period." 

Professor Namita Roy Choudhury, lead author

Bacteria are often found on implants following surgery, despite sterilisation and infection controls. These can lead to infections requiring antibiotics, but with antibiotic resistance becoming more common, new preventative measures are needed. 

"Antibiotic resistance has prompted greater interest in the area of self-sterilising materials and easy preparation of antibacterial surfaces," Choudhury said. 

"Therefore, we designed this surface to completely prevent the initial attachment of the bacteria and biofilm formation to decrease the infection rates." 

Choudhury said potential applications could include spray coatings for surgical tools, medical implants, catheters and wound dressings. 

Resilin, a protein found in insects, is known for its remarkable elasticity – it enables fleas to jump more than a hundred times their own height in microseconds – but it's also extremely resilient and biocompatible. 

"These exceptional properties and non-toxic nature make resilin and resilin-mimetic proteins ideal for many applications requiring flexible, durable materials and coatings," Choudhury said. 

"These applications range from tissue engineering and drug delivery to flexible electronics and sports equipment, but this is the first work published on its performance as an antibacterial coating." 

The team created several forms of coating from altered forms of resilin, then tested their interactions with E.coli bacteria and human skin cells in lab conditions. 

The study showed how the altered proteins in nano droplet form known as coacervates were 100% effective at repelling the bacteria, while still integrating well with healthy human cells, a critical part of medical implant success. 

Study lead author from RMIT Dr Nisal Wanasingha said the nano droplets' high surface area made them especially good at interacting with and repelling bacteria. 

"Once they come in contact, the coating interacts with the negatively charged bacterial cell membranes through electrostatic forces, disrupting their integrity, leading to leakage of cellular contents and eventual cell death," he said. 

Wanasingha said the resilin-based coatings not only showed 100% effectiveness in stopping bacteria from attaching to the surface but also offered several advantages compared to traditional approaches. 

"Unlike antibiotics, which can lead to resistance, the mechanical disruption caused by the resilin coatings may prevent bacteria from establishing resistance mechanisms," he said. 

"Meanwhile, resilin's natural origin and biocompatibility reduce the risk of adverse reactions in human tissues and, being protein-based, are more environmentally friendly than alternatives based on silver nanoparticles." 

Study co-author Professor Naba Dutta said resilin-mimetic protein is highly responsive to stimuli and changes in its environment, making it potentially tuneable for many functions. 

"These early results are very promising as a new way to help improve infection control in hospitals and other medical settings, but now more testing is needed to see how these coatings work against a wider range of harmful bacteria," Dutta said. 

"Future work includes attaching antimicrobial peptide segments during recombinant synthesis of resilin-mimics and incorporating additional antimicrobial agents to broaden the spectrum of activity." 

Transitioning from lab research to clinical use will require ensuring the formula's stability and scalability, conducting extensive safety and efficacy trials, while developing affordable production methods for widespread distribution, he added. 

The study was in collaboration with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). 

The team used ANSTO's Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering facilities, and RMIT University's Micro Nano Research Facility and Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility. 

The work was funded by the Australia India Strategic Research Fund, Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering top-up Postgraduate Research Award (PGRA) and supported by the Australian Research Council.

Tibetan activists protested for a “Free Tibet” during a women's soccer friendly between the United States and China at the weekend — and won the support of other spectators who booed when they were briefly evicted from their seats by security.

The Chinese team members and support staff confronted the eight activists who were seated close to them during Saturday's friendly international match at the Allianz stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota, that the U.S. won 3-0.

The activists, dressed in white T-shirts, had been shouting slogans and holding up white banners that read “Free Tibet” during the second half of the game. 

Members of the Chinese team sought their removal from the stands, and the activists were asked to leave the stadium by security guards. That prompted boos from other spectators who shouted, “Let them stay!” and chanted “Free speech!” 

Soon after, stadium officials allowed the activists to return to their seats but confiscated their white banners. The activists watched the rest of the game holding up the Tibetan national flag that is banned by China inside Tibet. They also still wore their “Free Tibet” T-shirts.

“The biggest takeaway (from this campaign) is that if Tibetans stand up, raise our voices, and take action for our own cause, then the people of the world automatically rise up in support,” one of the protesters, Tenzin Palsang, told Radio Free Asia on Tuesday. 

“China doesn't just play soccer. They also play games with human rights,” said Palsang, who is president of the Minnesota chapter of the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress.

She cited harsh conditions inside Tibet, where she said children are suffering “colonial boarding school policies,” referring to the Chinese government-run schools where Tibetan children, aged 6-17, have reportedly been held in “prison-like” conditions and forced to study a Mandarin-heavy curriculum that promotes party loyalty or a state-approved “patriotic education.” 

According to Freedom House's annual 2025 Freedom in the World report, Tibet was given a score of 0, based on an analysis of political and civil freedoms, making it one of the least-free places in the world. China annexed Tibet in 1950 and has since governed the territory with an oppressively heavy-hand while seeking to erase Tibetan culture and identity. 

Beijing denies it represses Tibet or seeks to erase its cultural traditions, instead pointing to economic development in the region as evidence of its positive impacts on the population of about 6 million Tibetans.

While some USMNT players know their World Cup status, others will be locked in chaotic competition for a roster spot

While every player on the U.S. men's national team heads into this summer with different individual circumstances, every player also shares a common goal: be a part of this team next summer, too.

Those are the stakes as the U.S. prepares for the Gold Cup, a tournament that will feel massive with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon. Positions are up for grabs and, particularly when assessing myriad absences during this camp, there are more than a few players who will be viewing the Gold Cup - and the two friendlies that precede it - as their potential big break.

Some will already know their status for the World Cup, barring an injury absence, while others will be aiming for a starting spot amid chaotic competition that could last until the first match kicks off next year. This is the chance to impress coach Mauricio Pochettino, either to vie for or lock down a World Cup spot.

Where do the players currently on the Gold Cup squad - not including absentees such as Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Gio Reyna, Ricardo Pepi, Folarin Balogun and Weston McKennie - stand? Who will feel good about their World Cup chances heading into this summer and who will have a point to prove? GOAL US breaks it all down.

A critical period is approaching for the U.S. Men's National Team. 

With the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup taking place this summer and the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaching next year on home soil, time is of the essence for the club to find its groove. At the helm of that effort is Mauricio Pochettino, who succeeded Gregg Berhalter as USMNT manager in September 2024. 

While some have doubted Pochettino's ability to lift the USMNT to its potential, U.S. soccer great Landon Donovan is confident the manager has what it takes to lead the team to success come the World Cup.

“I don't have any doubt he'll get the most out of the players,” Donovan said to Sports Illustrated. 

For the USMNT to break through on the international stage, Donovan says the power lies in the players' hands. 

“I've been vocal about the players making sure they get the most out of themselves, but it shouldn't be a coach's job to coach effort,” Donovan said. “That should never be a coach's job. Clearly you can motivate and help, but when you're playing for the national team, you shouldn't need motivation externally. That should be inside you. 

“I think Pochettino will do a great job making sure they're prepared and then the players have to show up and do the job.” 

The U.S. is hosting the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1994 and after bowing out of the 2022 tournament in the Round of 16 to Netherlands. The result was considered a disappointment, but many looked ahead to the youth of the team—including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Gio Reyna—coming into form in time for 2026. 

When asked to define what a successful World Cup would look like for the U.S., Donovan was cautious to set the bar high. 

“I think at a minimum advancing out of our group,” Donovan said. “In many World Cups now, we've advanced out of our group and then lost the next game. And I think at home with momentum, hopefully a lot of players playing well in the prime of their career, we have a team that's right in the prime of its career. 

“You can win another game, and then from there you go on and you see who you're facing, but playing at home should be a massive advantage.” 

Donovan added that the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is “absolutely crucial” to best set up the USMNT leading into next year's World Cup. 

“We don't have any other meaningful games after this summer,” Donovan said. “It is, in my opinion, all eggs into that basket. We need to play well, we need to win the tournament, and gain some momentum and some confidence going into next summer.” 

The USMNT kicks off its Concacaf Gold Cup play against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15, while the FIFA World Cup begins June 2026 across the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

World Cup

U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said this week he hopes to instill in his team the type of urgency and desire to play for the national team that exists in other countries.

Speaking on the Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard podcast, Pochettino cited some of the biggest names he has coached — Argentine legend Lionel Messi, French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe and Brazilian star Neymar — as examples of top players who remain “desperate” to play for their respective national teams.

“The people need to prioritize the national team,” Pochettino said. “We were talking about Argentine players, or Brazilian players or English players or Spanish players, they are desperate. Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappé for France, these guys are desperate to go to the national team. For them, when they go, they don't see if it's a friendly game, if it's an official game, it's a World Cup, it doesn't matter, because the possibility to defend one time more your flag, your shirt. It's about to feel proud. And that is the responsibility to us to translate.”

The comments are striking after Christian Pulisic made the decision, in conjunction with U.S. Soccer, to skip this summer's Gold Cup. Citing his heavy workload with AC Milan and the U.S. — Pulisic is one of just 10 outfield players in the top five European leagues to appear in 50 games in each of the past two seasons — Pulisic felt he needed the rest in order to be healthy for next summer's World Cup.

Donovan compared Pulisic to Messi in that he has the most eyeballs on him of any American player and asked how the staff could handle competing in the tournament this summer without Pulisic. Pochettino praised his team's top player and said he does not question Pulisic's commitment to the group or the country.

“I think Christian in the last year showed a great quality,” Pochettino said. “He's performing in Europe, also he's performing with the national team. He's a very talented player that can help us to win. You say people compare Messi with Christian Pulisic. I don't want to be disrespectful with Messi or Pulisic, but I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi, because he's an iconic player, the kids on the street for sure if you ask one soccer player in this country, it's Pulisic.

“We have very good communication with our players. Christian is a very nice guy, is very committed to the national team and he wants to help and of course is desperate to play in the World Cup and arrive in the best condition. All these conversations that we were taking with the players, I think that was the best decision to help him because every player are in different circumstances, and even if I want Christian here or another player here – Antonee (Robinson, injured Fulham left back) or like this – I think no one or another teammate is going to see badly about if I'm saying that, because I think … sometimes you need to put the interest in the medium and long term than in the present.

“Because for me after the March camp, if I say, ‘OK I don't care about [anything], I want to win tomorrow,' [there] is [a] consequence after, because I think we are all preparing and focused on the World Cup. And sometimes we need to be open and flexible in some decisions. When we talk about these types of decisions for us, it was a tough decision  … It was our decision in the end, because if you say you need to come — you cannot force the player to come — but I think I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision to try to find the best for the national team and the best for the player.”

“We are building something and always when you are building something, always there are up and downs in this period. It's true that we are a little bit disappointed. We were really excited after January. not because of the two (games) … but how the players, how the team showed the responsibility that we wanted to translate. Then with all the circumstances in March, it didn't help us to show that.”

The Gold Cup was meant to be an important team-building month for the U.S. under Pochettino, his first extended camp with the U.S. since taking over after last summer's Copa América failure. Now it takes on new meaning as Pochettino evaluates his wider national team pool. That being said, Pochettino insisted the goal was still to win.

Ultimately, even without Pulisic and other starters — Robinson, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun and Gio Reyna are also missing the tournament via injury, FIFA Club World Cup duty, or, in Musah's case, personal reasons — the tournament serves as a step toward next summer's World Cup.

That is true for MLS players trying to break into the squad, but also for others, including World Cup starter Matt Turner. Pochettino said on the podcast he told Turner that the goalkeeper had to start finding minutes in order to be ready for the World Cup.

“We are very open,” Pochettino said. “We don't have fears to talk with the player. Sometimes it's painful because you need to tell some players: ‘Look, you need to play.' At the moment OK, so far it's good, because we are checking your character, your personality, your capacity to be a leader, the leadership that you have, but at some point to be a leader you need to compete.”

Pochettino also praised players like Diego Luna, who have started to show they bring value to the squad simply with their mentality and approach. Pochettino noted that Luna didn't want to come out of the game after being elbowed in the nose during a January-camp friendly, then bloodied and taped up, assisted on a goal.

Asked about who the leaders are on the team, Pochettino alluded to giving everyone a chance to prove their role — whether as a squad player, a starter or a leader.

“When we arrived in October I think the picture changed in the national team. In the way that we like to translate the message and the way that we are open to give the opportunity to all the players to step up and show the character,” Pochettino said. “Because we don't want to assume that because four years ago someone was captain now should be the captain, because the circumstance changed. I think we are very open and giving the opportunity to the group and the players that are involved to say, ‘Come on, show me.' For me, it's a natural process. Sometimes some players can surprise you and can step up.

“The most important thing is to see in a spontaneous way who will step up when things are wrong, when the stress is there, when the pressure is there, who is going to say ‘Hey, I am here.'”

There is, of course, an enormous amount of pressure on the team to perform in next summer's tournament. The U.S. advanced to the knockout round in the 2022 World Cup with one of the youngest squads in the tournament, behind the belief that the payoff would come in 2026. Struggles in last summer's Copa América, where the U.S. was eliminated in the group stage, and in this spring's Concacaf Nations League, where it lost to Panama and Canada, have upped the stakes.

“I feel the responsibility. We all feel the responsibility,” Pochettino said. “Knowing that it's soccer or football, it's about the joy, it's about not to put too much pressure on the players, because the players need to perform. … But yes of course it's a massive pressure. The mentality and the culture of this country is to win.

“The size of this country puts you in a position that you need to deliver. You need to show that you are brave, that you are a winner, but not talking like I am now. It's easy to talk. The most important is go and to show. Show on the pitch when you need to defend your flag there, fighting and being a team, that is a moment to say, ‘Yes we have quality, I am a good player, but now it's about to defend your country.'”

Christian Pulisic has had to carry the burden of being the poster boy for the U.S. Men's National Team since making his debut aged just 17.

Now 26 years old and a star performer for AC Milan in Serie A, expectations are sky high whenever he takes to the stage for the USMNT, especially with a home FIFA World Cup just over 12 months away.

In fact, some hold Pulisic in such high regard back in the U.S. that he often finds himself compared to arguably the greatest player of all time, Lionel Messi. This comparison may seem laughable to some, but USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino appears to understand the thinking behind it.

“I don't want to be disrespectful with Messi or with Pulisic or with Messi, but I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi,” the Argentine, who coaches Messi at Paris Saint-Germain, told Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast.

“He's an iconic player and the kid on the street, for sure, if you ask one soccer player in this country, it's Pulisic,” Pochettino added.

Pulisic may not quite have Messi's trophy cabinet, which includes eight Ballon d'Ors, four UEFA Champions Leagues, 10 La Liga titles, and a World Cup among many others, but the Pennsylvanian is enjoying an excellent career in Europe.

After breaking through with Borussia Dortmund, where he won the German Cup, he made the move to Premier League side Chelsea, winning the Champions League, Super Cup, and Club World Cup. However, after failing to hit the heights expected in London, Pulisic swapped the U.K. for Italy in 2023.

Pulisic's two seasons with the Rossoneri have seen him return to the top of his game, scoring 32 goals in 100 games in all competitions, helping his side lift the Supercoppa Italiana in January. Not that it's all been rosy in Italy, with Milan having recently concluded a torrid season domestically, failing to qualify for European soccer next year, despite Pulisic's best efforts.

After two packed seasons with Milan, Pulisic subsequently opted out of being called up by Pochettino for the USMNT's upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, as well as the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

This has proven extremely controversial, dividing the opinions of soccer fans and ex-players alike, with some left questioning his desire to play for the USMNT.

As for Pochettino, he assured Donovan and Howard that, in his opinion, opting out was “best” for him.

“When you talk about if I feel disappointed or not, I think we have very good communication with our players,” he explained. “And Christian is a very nice guy and he's very committed with the national team and he wants to help. And of course, he's desperate to play the World Cup and arrive in the best condition.

“In all the conversations that we [had] with the player, I think that was the best maybe decision to help him because every player is in different circumstances.”

Pochettino added that on occasion, he believes it's best to focus on the long term rather than the present, noting that “we are all preparing to focus on the World Cup.”

“And sometimes we need to be open and flexible in some decisions,” he said. “When we talk about this type of decision, for us, I think it was a tough decision because I think we agreed, because also it was our idea, it was our decision.

“And then, because in the end, if you say you need to come, but I think we cannot force the player to come. But I think I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision, to try to find the best for the national team and for the best for the players.”

DAZN believes the FIFA Club World Cup could become the most live streamed event in sports history.

The Club World Cup begins June 14 with Lionel Messi and Inter Miami playing in the opening match in Miami, and ends with the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium on July 13. The Club World Cup winner will take home at least $125 million of a $1 billion prize pool on the line for the tournament.

All 63 matches of the Club World Cup will be available to live stream for free worldwide on DAZN.com, while TNT will broadcast select matches on TV in the United States in English. Univision, TUDN and ViX will broadcast matches in Spanish in the U.S.

"If you take a global point of view, soccer is the biggest sport in the world. We think this will easily become the highest streamed live sports event ever because we're going to have audiences not just in the U.S, but in South America, across Europe, across the Middle East, and so on," DAZN's CEO of Growth Markets Pete Oliver told USA TODAY Sports.

"It's a really big moment to have a truly global sporting event available on one streaming platform. This is going to be an opportunity to bring in a big, new audience of fans onto DAZN, and for them to experience all of the things we do."

Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid, Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, Champions League runner-up Inter Milan, Chelsea, Manchester City, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are among standout clubs participating in the tournament.

Along with Inter Miami, the Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC will represent Major League Soccer and the U.S. in the field. Club World Cup matches will also be played in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Orlando, Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C.

Consider the Club World Cup a precursor to the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19, 2026.

"Well, it's a very big moment. It's a big moment for America, first of all, because it's the first time this tournament (this size) has ever happened," Oliver said. "The biggest teams in the world are going to come and play in the U.S., which we think is hugely exciting. We think it's going to be a very big cultural moment ahead of next year's World Cup."

Oliver expects viewership to be in the "hundreds of millions" and believes DAZN has the infrastructure in place to handle streaming the tournament worldwide.

DAZN streams over 90,000 live events annually and is available in more than 200 markets worldwide – showcasing soccer matches from LaLiga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), Bundesliga (Germany), Ligue 1 (France), women's football, boxing and MMA, the NFL and NBA internationally, and auto racing from Formula One and Moto GP.

"We're planning for hundreds of millions of people because, of course, it's free. And that makes a big difference. No one has to buy a subscription to watch it. They can just download the app and watch," Oliver said.

"It's going to be very big for us globally. As proving ourselves as a global platform, this is going to be very important for us from a technology point of view as well as a customer point of view."

DAZN plans to make the soccer-viewing experience unique for fans.

The Fan Zone within the DAZN app will allow viewers to participate in polls, chat with each other, and talk to influencers while watching the action.

DAZN also will have a referee camera in a FIFA tournament for the first time.

DAZN also will broadcast the tournament in 15 different languages so respective regions across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and South America will be able to experience the tournament like they would any other soccer broadcast by the company. 

More than 100 popular social media influencers and creators with a combined reach of more than 32 million followers from countries like the U.S., England, Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Libya, France, Venezuela, Italy, Norway, Brazil, and Portugal will bring a wide range of perspectives and cultural energy for the tournament.

There also will be alternative watch-along streams, and daily wrap-up shows to recap the tournament.

"The coverage we're going to bring is going to be very focused on bringing influencers, younger players who've retired recently and got a more contemporary view, players and pundits who represent all the different countries involved," Oliver said.

"We think fans will see a very different premium experience, plus all of those interactive features through the app, making it a much more social and interactive viewing experience than maybe they've had before."

St. Louis, Missouri, is a city steeped in soccer history and Becky Sauerbrunn soaked in every bit she could growing up in the Gateway City, which many locals refer to as “Soccer City, USA.” 

The culture of soccer in the city dates back decades and through osmosis, Sauerbrunn became a soccer devotee. She'd hear stories of the first soccer teams formed in the 1800s, the legendary indoor leagues, and when Pelé once played at Buch Stadium in 1968. At every soccer game on the weekend, whether it was at the prep level, indoor games or college games, she'd always make it an event with friends.

“I just felt really fortunate because soccer was kind of all around,” Sauerbrunn told ussoccer.com. “I think that just helped me grow my love and passion for the game.”

Following in line with the city's history – all hail the St. Louis Steamers —Sauerbrunn mostly played indoor soccer growing up. She formed an indoor team of her own where she was the only girl playing on an all-boys team. Looking back, Sauerbrunn realizes it was a rare gift to have grown up with such a rich history of the sport. Now, her 16-year USWNT career will be commemorated in the city that shaped her.

Before the USWNT kicks off against Jamaica on June 3, Sauerbrunn will be honored with a retirement ceremony. The legendary defender retired from the NWSL and the U.S. National Team at the end of 2024 after one final professional season in a career chock-full of accolades.

Sauerbrunn, a center back, was a force in the backline for 219 caps, including two FIFA Women's World Cup victories and an Olympic gold medal in 2012. Finally bringing the U.S. back to glory in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup was one of the greatest moments for Sauerbrunn.

“Having it been 16 years since the 1999 team had won, and for me, that 1999 team was my inspiration. They were my motivation to get onto the Women's National Team, to make it to a World Cup,” Sauerbrunn said. “So, looking back and knowing that on the crest, that third star is right next to their star in 1999, that is something that I'm going to always think of so fondly.”

Then she helped add another one in 2019. Sauerbrunn played every minute in the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Finals, beating Japan and the Netherlands, respectively.

Current U.S. head coach Emma Hayes didn't have a chance get to coach Sauerbrunn for the USA when she took over the coaching reins in May 2024, but when she was working briefly for the Washington Freedom, which played in pro leagues that were precursors to the NWSL, she watched Sauerbrunn play. She asked then-Freedom head coach Jim Gabarra, “Why the hell is she not on the National Team? She's got everything the country's looking for.”

Hayes was right. Sauerbrunn earned her first cap in January 2008 and became a cornerstone for the National Team between 2014-2021. Hayes said she continually sees the effect Sauerbrunn left on players who played with her and even young players who didn't get the chance.

That's the legacy Sauerbrunn wanted to leave. She didn't need to be the biggest name, but if her teammates remembered her as a player that they could ask for advice or come to with concerns, that was more than enough.

“That was probably the greatest honor, is that the players felt like they could come to me with things,” Sauerbrunn said.

Naomi Girma, one of the top center backs in the world who wears the same No. 4 jersey as Sauerbrunn, is one of the players whom the renowned defender has impacted.

“I think Becky was one of the best leaders this team has ever had,” Girma said. “Sometimes you see leaders look out for the superstars, the starters, but she was definitely someone who made sure that everyone was looked after ... she would make sure to be that voice for them.”

Sauerbrunn wasn't the loudest in the room, but she was still a leader on the team. She developed that quiet leadership style by watching her veterans. Early in her time with the USA, she remembered being pulled into players' only meetings with the captains to discuss important topics like the Players' Association matters and an upcoming Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 Sauerbrunn immediately remembered feeling the weight of the situation and becoming enthralled with the idea of becoming a leader and galvanizing a group. She learned quickly that while she wasn't a loud leader like Abby Wambach — she'd leave that role for teammates like Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Kelly O'Hara — she'd instead take an approach more like former defensive midfielder Shannon Boxx and lead in her own style. Boxx is now even more of a role model to Sauerbrunn as they're both broadcast teammates for TNT Sports.

 

Her broadcast crew, the current USWNT, former coaches, former teammates and family will all be at Energizer Park to celebrate her brilliant soccer career. While Sauerbrunn originally planned on a quiet goodbye, only a match in St. Louis in front of the city and the people who helped her become a two-time World Cup champion would feel right.

“Anytime you can celebrate your career with the people that helped build that career with you,” Sauerbrunn said, “I think it's pretty special.”

Chelsea are preparing to get rid of over a dozen players upon their return to the Champions League.

The Blues are back in Europe's elite competition having finished fourth last term, capping off a successful season with a Conference League triumph in Poland and becoming the first club to win UEFA's three current competitions.

But with Chelsea looking ahead to the Club World Cup in the United States later this month, business is beginning for the Blues, as they look to revamp their huge squad.

A report from the Guardian has detailed the current state of Chelsea's squad ahead of a possible £50 million move for Borussia Dortmund starlet Jamie Gittens.

The English winger would be a direct replacement for fellow BVB alumnus Jadon Sancho, who the West Londoners don't want to keep beyond this season following a loan spell from Manchester United – while fellow attackers Raheem Sterling and Joao Felix, who both went on loan last season, are expected to leave.

The report also names Noni Madueke as a star that the Blues are willing to listen to offers for, after manager Enzo Maresca claimed in December that the winger could “do much more” to earn a place in his side – while Christopher Nkunku could leave, too, after spending the season on the fringes of the squad.

With Chelsea's midfield one of the more stable aspects of the team this season, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has been named as another to leave, having failed to displace either Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo after winning FourFourTwo's award for the Best Player in the EFL in 2023/24 under Maresca.

The former Leicester City star could be followed out the club by fellow no.8s, Carney Chukwuemeka and Lesley Ugochukwu, who spent last season on loan at Dortmund and Southampton, respectively.

Maresca's backline, meanwhile, could well see the biggest changes with Chelsea prepared to let two goalkeepers leave in Robert Sanchez and Djordje Petrovic, along with a handful of defenders, including the injury-prone Wesley Fofana.

Renato Veiga, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi – who spent the season half of last season out on loan at Juventus, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa – are expected to exit, while Trevoh Chalobah is the final name mentioned, having been recalled from Palace.

FourFourTwo understands that Chelsea are primarily still in the market for new attackers and would like to bring in a new leader in defence, with Dean Huijsen eyed prior to his Real Madrid move.

The U.S. Women's National Team may be just days removed from a 3-0 win against China, but head coach Emma Hayes is already looking for more from her side.

Ahead of their friendly against Jamaica, former Chelsea boss Hayes brushed aside a suggestion that she is now in a position where she has to instruct her players less, telling reporters, “I don't think that will ever stop in terms of testing both our group against the variety of opponents.”

Hayes added that she believed this camp has been “very different” from their previous camp in April, where they split a pair of friendlies against Brazil, which itself was different from their SheBelieves Cup camp, where they ultimately finished runners-up behind Japan.

“I think for me the big challenge now is we've demonstrated we can do our first game really well in camp,” she explained. “The challenge is sustaining that level over a 90-minute period in the second game.

“Now granted, I've made lots of changes from game one to game two as we develop an accumulation of experience for a bigger depth, larger playing pool. But that will be the challenge I set for the team is I want to see another level in us again over a 90-minute period, knowing that from an attacking perspective, anyway, the key principles we've been instilling in the group and the areas of the pitch we're asking them to get into.

“We're doing that at a high level, but doing it again and doing it better is the challenge.”

As eluded to by Hayes, she later elaborated on plans to adjust the lineup come kickoff at Energizer Park on Tuesday, with her focus being on “developing experiences for the individuals, but within a framework that we want our players to work towards.

“So nothing's changed in terms of our objectives. There'll be changes tomorrow and I'm taking this camp and next camp to do all of those things and I've just watched an Under-23 game,” she added.

This focus on depth has been a focal point of Hayes' first year in charge, with the ultimate goal of ensuring they have a plethora of impactful players experienced and prepared to go, come the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.

“I want to make sure that whether you start, whether you come into the game, it shouldn't alter our level,” she said. “If anything, we should keep finding other levels in us. So it'd be a good challenge for all of us.”

The regeneration of the Under-23s has been of particular importance to Hayes since arriving, with the Briton keen to bridge the gap between age groups and allow for a smooth pathway of talent development leading to the senior team.

Having not played since February 2023, the Under-23s finally returned on May 30, losing 2-1 away to Germany. The second leg of their doubleheader in Germany is scheduled for Tuesday.

USMNT star joins community to dedicate second of three mini-pitches aimed at fostering youth participation

PHILADELPHIA, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allstate, in partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation, unveiled a new mini-pitch on Saturday, May 31, at Bell Avenue Elementary School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania. The initiative, part of a multi-year collaboration with U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Tyler Adams, aims to increase access to safe, engaging play spaces for youth in underserved communities.

 

More than 75 children, ages 9 to 12, participated in a youth clinic led by grassroots partner Black Star, a national community platform focused on accelerating the growth and visibility of Black soccer players, coaches and fans.

"As part of our ongoing commitment to youth empowerment, Allstate is proud to support initiatives that create safer spaces and more opportunities for young athletes to thrive," said Elizabeth Brady, executive vice president and chief marketing, customer and communications officer at Allstate. "This mini-pitch is more than just a place to play, it's a foundation for building stronger, more connected communities."

The event featured a block party with local food trucks, a DJ, inflatable soccer games and an appearance by Adams, who participated in the unveiling and engaged with youth and families throughout the day. The Philadelphia-area pitch is the second installation in a three-year partnership between Allstate and Adams, who are donating one mini-pitch annually to underserved communities across the country. The first was unveiled in 2024 at Fisher Academy in Detroit.

Mini-pitches are hard-court surfaces designed for both pickup and organized play and have proven to be powerful tools in helping kids stay active, improving public safety and providing accessible, permanent spaces to grow the game.

"Partnering with Allstate to create this mini-pitch means a lot to me, not just because it's about soccer, but because it's about access," said Adams. "Growing up, I didn't always have facilities like this. So being able to give kids in communities like Yeadon a safe place to play, grow and dream — that's what it's all about."

"We are thrilled to continue our work with Tyler and Allstate to bring mini-pitches to more communities across the country," said Ed Foster-Simeon, president and CEO of the U.S. Soccer Foundation. "Tyler is committed to ensuring that more young people have safe places to play the game. We are delighted to help bring this project to fruition and we know that it will have a positive impact on children for years to come."

Black Star, a national community platform focused on accelerating the growth and visibility of Black soccer players, coaches and fans, helped lead the clinic and community outreach for the event.

"This partnership with Allstate and Tyler is a step forward in ensuring soccer is accessible, inclusive and inspiring for all youth, no matter where they come from," said Patrick Rose, director, Black Star and cultural marketing at For Soccer. "By activating in communities like Yeadon, we're investing in long-term development and opportunity for generations to come."

IFAB has introduced a new penalty regulation after a high-profile incident in the Champions League game between Madrid and Atlético. 

Ahead of the upcoming 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) has clarified that there was no direct regulation for the double touch by Atlético Madrid's Julián Álvarez in his team's penalty shootout defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16. IFAB has now ruled that starting from July 2025 (potentially including the Club World Cup), if such an incident occurs, the penalty must be retaken if it results in a goal.

IFAB, which sets the laws of soccer, explained that referees tend to penalize the player for a double touch, which was not previously directly regulated. Polish referee Szymon Marciniak did exactly that to Álvarez, whose penalty ‘miss' was crucial in helping Real Madrid eliminate Atlético from the tournament.

However, IFAB also notes that “not penalising an accidental double touch would nevertheless be unfair, as the goalkeeper can be disadvantaged by the altered trajectory of the ball”. This is explained in a circular released on Tuesday.

The IFAB have sought to clarify Rule 10 - Determining the Outcome of a Match and Rule 14 - The Penalty Kick regarding situations where the kicker accidentally strikes the ball with both feet simultaneously or when the ball touches the kicker's non-kicking foot or leg immediately after the kick. This is what happened with Álvarez's penalty. 

Alejandro Balde: "Julián Álvarez was unlucky with his penalty—he slipped and hit the ball with his other foot. The rule may seem strange to some, but it's a rule that must be followed." pic.twitter.com/EitN05AsSC

“This situation is rare, and as it is not directly covered in Law 14, referees have understandably tended to penalise the kicker for having touched the ball again before it has touched another player, thus awarding an indirect free kick to the opposition or, in the case of penalties (penalty shoot-out), recording the kick as missed,” reads the Circular.

“However, this part of Law 14 is primarily intended for situations where the penalty taker deliberately touches the ball a second time before it has touched another player (e.g. when it rebounds from the goalpost(s) or crossbar without touching the goalkeeper),” the Circular continues. “This is very different from the penalty taker accidentally kicking the ball with both feet simultaneously or touching the ball with their non-kicking foot or leg immediately after they have taken the kick, which usually occurs because they have slipped when taking it”.

IFAB has therefore decided that, starting from July 2025, “if penalty taker accidentally kicks the ball with both feet simultaneously or the ball touches their non-kicking foot or leg immediately after the kick”, the penalty will be retaken if it is scored. 

If the penalty is missed, an indirect free-kick will be awarded to the defending team (unless the referee decides to play advantage), while it will be recorded as a miss in a penalty shoot-out. 

The law that saw Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez's penalty controversially disallowed in March's Champions League shootout against Real Madrid has been officially amended — so that if such a ‘double touch' happens in future the kick would be retaken rather than ruled out.… pic.twitter.com/hHZTndYBV1

That will also be the case should the penalty taker be deemed to “deliberately” touch the ball with both feet (which would be highly unusual). 

The new laws are “effective for competitions starting on or after 1 July 2025 and may be used by competitions starting before that date”. With the FIFA Club World Cup running from June 14 to July 13, the change could come into effect for the tournament, which means there would be no repeat of Álvarez's bizarre penalty and Atlético's controversial elimination.

It's not cheap to plant grass.

When the FIFA Men's World Cup comes to Seattle next year, Lumen Field will play host to six games, all of which will be played on a natural grass field.

It'll be the first time the stadium will have grass as its primary playing surface and the cost of installing and maintaining the field was the bulk of $19.4 million approved by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson late last month.

The money from the state also included funding toward infrastructure improvements at the stadium, security around the venue and for transportation to help get fans to and from the games.

“We're very pleased with the cooperation. The representatives around the state all saw value in bringing the World Cup to Seattle and the state of Washington,” said Peter Tomozawa, the CEO of Seattle's World Cup organizing committee. “We did numbers of presentations as to what this could mean for the state, what this could mean for our city, and we're super pleased, especially in this incredibly tough budget environment, that we got the funding that we needed to put in the grass to get the stadium ready and sort of the capital requirements that were necessary.”

Nearly 30 years ago, the language in the public referendum that approved the funding mechanism for the construction of Lumen Field stipulated that local officials would pursue the opportunity for the stadium to host World Cup games should there become the chance.

That opportunity will come next summer when Seattle is slated to host four group-stage games — including one game featuring the United States — one game in the round of 32 and one game in the round of 16.

But it's not a cheap endeavor and one of the biggest expenditures is the installation of the grass field that will take place after the completion of the 2025 NFL season. It will temporarily replace the artificial surface used for games involving the Seahawks, Sounders and Reign, but will only be used for the World Cup matches. That cost includes installation, irrigation and additional equipment to help maintain the health of a grass field at a venue that's never had grass as the primary surface in its history.

After the tournament, an artificial surface is expected to be reinstalled before the start of the 2026 NFL season.

Some of the funding will also help with the replacement of seats in the Hawks Nest in the north end of the stadium as FIFA requires all seats include a seat back. Those will remain after the tournament leaves along with other infrastructure improvements around the stadium.

“Everything the state is funding in capital for the stadium are all things that meet FIFA requirements, but also serve a broader purpose for the stadium ongoing,” said April Putney, chief strategy officer for the local organizing committee. “None of it is just something that is beneficial for the tournament itself. It's all things that will provide ongoing benefit and help the stadium, either with attracting future events or solving the ongoing needs that they have.”

There was also funding from the state for $1.7 million in upgrades to the soccer facilities at the University of Washington and another $100,000 for upgrades at Gonzaga. Seattle U and UW will be used as practice fields for teams while they are in town. Gonzaga is under consideration as a potential base camp for a country who could end up playing the majority of its matches on the West Coast with games set to be played in Seattle, Vancouver, B.C., the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles.

There is also expected to be additional funding coming from the federal level eventually. Seattle and the rest of the host cities in the U.S. were part of a unified request from the federal government for funding related to security around the games. Seattle's portion of the federal request was $31.5 million to go along with $2.75 million already allocated from the state, Putney said.

The U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes will mark one year on the job as the squad closes out the international window against Jamaica on Tuesday. 

Originally slated as a two-game series against China, the change in opponent reintroduces a familiar Concacaf neighbor with the Reggae Girlz. The Stars and Stripes will square off against Jamaica at Energizer Park in St. Louis. The United States is coming off a 3-0 win over China on Saturday, and Jamaica is coming off an April window with two losses against regional rivals Mexico.

Hayes and her squad will aim for a two-game shutout after splitting the April series against Brazil with a 2-0 win and a 2-1 loss. With one win against China already in the books to ring in the summer, the coaching staff is still evaluating the roster pool, and players are still earning first caps with the squad. Midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta made her debut at 32 years old on Saturday, while defender Kerry Abello and goalkeeper Claudia Dickey could get their first caps on Tuesday evening. 

Jamaica's difficult April window saw the team concede seven goals over two losses to Mexico. Head coach Hubert Busby Jr. will be without top striker Bunny Shaw, midfielder Drew Spence, and veteran goalkeeper Rebeca Spencer. The manager has not put a timeline for Shaw's return as she continues her recovery from a foot injury. 

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

Tuesday's meeting will be the sixth all time fixture between the two teams. The USWNT has won all five previous matches against the Reggae Girls. Most recently, the two sides faced each other during the 2022 Concacaf W Championship, which served as the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualifier. The U.S. national team dominated the match and won 5-0 with goals scored by Sophia Wilson, Rose Lavelle, Kristie Mewis, and Trinity Rodman.

The group was tested in the opening five minutes of their match against China, but eventually found the breakthrough just ahead of the half-hour mark. The USWNT won the match convincingly, 3-0, with lots more glimpses of in-game awareness and quicker decision making when they were presented with a higher pressing China side instead of a more structured and defensive formation. 

Still, ever the high-performance machine, some of the players were already demanding more of themselves during the postgame mixed zones, and for Hayes, it's a reflection of the group's tactical evolution. The more they're in scenarios where they've got to find solutions, the better. 

"When you're trying to put together so many new players, as a coach, you want to make sure that every time you're with them, you're making less and less tactical corrections, and this week, we've made less than we've ever had to make. Because Avery Patterson knows where to be [on] both sides of the ball. So does Lily [Yohannes], so does Michelle Cooper, so that in return, means the group as a whole can go up higher level, because they're getting better at their understanding of that." Hayes said after the match against China.

"But I'm asking them to deliver a performance with a level of patience, so, I'm not going to criticize them for that. I feel like tactically, we've gone up another level. I really feel that way. I feel that there's so many more players that are so much more in control that we're able to do more."

As Jamaica works on its build-up to the next World Cup cycle, head coach Hubert Busby Jr. is in a similar position of trying to evaluate the talent pool while multiple experienced players are unavailable this window. The program has been through many ups and downs, as it tries to capitalize on the success of the two previous World Cup appearances. 

A two-game losing streak against Mexico sent some concerns across faithful supporters of the island, but Busby is insistent that the group is heading in the right direction with fixtures against Concacaf rivals and a game in England against the Lionesses at the end of the month. 

"As we kind of moved from that game into this one, we looked at a couple of things, and some different players into different positions, you know, and we had conversations about players and looking to try things. It's what these games are about. We know we have our strengths, we have our deficiencies, but we have to be able to utilize these games. I know everyone wants to win every single match. That's what we're here for ... but these games are for us to be able to experiment and try things. We can't do them in World Cup qualifiers, right? So we have to be able to have this full picture of what it is," he said after announcing the Raggae Girls roster.

"There's all these little puzzle pieces that we have to be able to little jigsaw pieces that we have to be able to put together, that allows for us to seal this finished product. And again, it's not, we're not anywhere close to where it should be, yet, I think we're on the process of getting done ... It is always about progression. Even in that progression, it might not seem like it, because the results might not show, but we take the information and we extract it, and we have a better understanding of where we are, and we can put it in our toolbox, and we can file it away."

USWNT: Claudia Dickey; Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sams, Kerry Abello; Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Lindsey Heaps; Catatrina Macario, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson

Jamaica: Sydney Schneider; Naya Cardoza, Chantelle Swaby, Allyson Swaby, Konya Plummer; Deneisha Blackwood, Olufolasade Adamolekun, Amelia Van Zanten, Atlanta Primus; Tiffany Cameron, Jody Brown

Claire Hutton, USWNT: The deep-lying midfielder has been involved in USWNT camps throughout 2025 and has already made two appearances. The 19-year-old Kansas City Current player has been a crucial cog in the middle third for the club, functioning as collaborator and disruptor, while notching two assists and creating five chances. Yohannes is developing good chemistry in her matches this year, and the U.S. coaching staff might want to see more games between the two teenagers.

The USWNT prepared for a an organized defense against China and were presented with something else. They might be over prepped for a Jamaica side that typically faces them in a mid to low block. It might be another lopsided match with so many of Jamaica's key players unavailable. Pick: USWNT 3, Jamaica 0

GARY LINEKER has agreed a deal with a new broadcaster after leaving the BBC.

The presenter stepped back from hosting Match of the Day after 26 years in the hotseat at the end of the Premier League season just over a week ago.

He has now agreed a deal with DAZN that will see his The Rest Is Football Podcast broadcast highlights of the Club World Cup.

The show, which features Alan Shearer and Micah Richards as co-hosts, will show the best bits from matches in the video version of the podcast.

DAZN chief Pete Oliver said: "The Rest Is Football is essential viewing and listening for fans who want insight, entertainment, and personality.

"This partnership is a brilliant way to bring the Fifa Club World Cup even closer to that audience.

“It's about connecting global football with the voices fans trust and love, and showing the tournament in a fresh, exciting, and authentically British way.”

The Club World Cup begins on June 15 and it is being held in the US.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has revamped the tournament to include 32 teams, with Chelsea and Manchester City flying the flag for England. 

Streaming giants DAZN are the event's global rights holder and will broadcast all 63 matches for free.

Channel 5 will also show 23 live games after striking a sub-licencing agreement.

Lineker's Rest Is Football Podcast was removed from the BBC's streaming service last week following the former England striker's departure from the company.

It comes amid a bitter end to his time at the Beeb as Match of the Day chiefs dealt him a final snub just hours before his farewell show.

The Sun exclusively revealed that they decided to axe his last interview with Liverpool star Mo Salah without warning due to fears he would say something controversial about Gaza.

Lineker issued an apology last month after sharing a pro-Gaza video that likened supporters of Israel to rats.

He has since been enjoying some time off in Ibiza, attending his son Harry's wedding and appearing to put his feud with brother Wayne aside during celebrations.

It has always been Lineker's plan to expand his podcast empire after his BBC departure, saying: "Professionally, I've got a big podcast company and I think it takes up quite a bit of my time and it will probably take up a bit more now.

“It's really exciting and it's a lot of fun. We're doing really well. I don't think I'll do much television."

TOPICS:

With roughly one year to go before the United States (along with Mexico and Canada) hosts the 2026 FIFA World Cup, questions have emerged about the state of the U.S. Men's Soccer Team.  A poor performance in last summer's Copa America tournament followed by a 4th place finish this past March in the CONCACAF Nations League has injected seeds of doubt over this group's readiness to take on the world's best in what will perhaps be the most important tournament in American soccer history.

This summer's Gold Cup (being played in the U.S. from June 14th through July 6th) was supposed to serve as a final opportunity for the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) to come together and right the ship prior to 2026.  But several key absences from first team regulars means uncertainty around the squad will linger well beyond the tournament's conclusion.  The most high profile of those absences is star attacker Christian Pulisic who plays his club soccer for Italy's AC Milan.  Coming off back-to-back seasons of 50 games played, Pulisic asked for this summer off so as to rest and recuperate with the hope of maximizing his chances of being healthy for next summer's World Cup.



On the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the two former American soccer stars sat down with current USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino who said the decision for Pulisic not to come was a collective one.

“We cannot force the player to come. But I think I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision, you know, to try to find the best for the national team and for the best for the player.

“Sometimes, you need to put the interests (of the team) in a maybe medium-long term than in the present.”

Despite Pochettino's insistence that the decision for Pulisic to miss the Gold Cup was collective, he made clear that it is his job to ensure the players are prioritizing the national team.

“That is a responsibility of us (the staff), that the (players) need to prioritize the national team. We were talking about Argentine player, or Brazilian player, or English player, or Spanish player. They are desperate – even (Lionel) Messi, even Neymar, even (Kylian) Mbappe for France; we were working with these guys, Harry Kane (as well). These guys are desperate to go to the national team.”

With Pulisic and other projected starters like Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun all unavailable for the tournament, is the goal still to win or is it simply to use this as a period of player evaluation?

“We need to win,” said Pochettino.  “We need to win because... I was... I feel so bad, so [expletive], that is the word, when we lose against Panama (in the Nations League). And then the second game (against Canada) was how it was, no? But in the same time, in a parallel way, I think it's a great opportunity for many players to show we are here and we want to fight for a place in the World Cup.”

The United States' first Gold Cup match occurs on June 15th against Trinidad & Tobago in San Jose, California.

Lionel Messi has scored another Michelob Ultra commercial – this one timed to the FIFA Club World Cup.

If you are a fan of football or fútbol, you likely remember the Michelob Ultra commercial from 2024's Super Bowl featuring the Argentina and Inter Miami superstar, Jason Sudeikis and NFL great Dan Marino in which Messi joins a game of beach soccer when the Michelob Ultra tap goes dry.

In this new commercial, titled "Superior Hotel," Messi competes in a one-on-one soccer match for the lone Michelob Ultra in the hotel bar refrigerator. The 30-second ad will appear on social media – including on YouTube – and air during broadcasts throughout the FIFA Club World Cup. The international tournament starts June 14 with Messi and Inter Miami taking on Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

Messi is perfect fit for Michelob Ultra, said Ricardo Marques, senior vice president of marketing for Michelob Ultra.

"A global soccer icon like Messi helps fuel the significant momentum and growth both soccer and Michelob Ultra have been experiencing across the U.S.," he said in a statement to USA TODAY. "Messi is the biggest soccer star of our time and is the perfect embodiment of our brand's point of view and brings excitement to some of soccer's most passionate fans during some of the sport's most competitive tournaments."

As the official beer sponsor of the FIFA Club World Cup, Michelob Ultra will also present the Superior Player of the Match Trophy, awarded after each game – the brand sponsored the award during last year's Copa America 2024. Michelob Ultra will also sponsor the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Michelob Ultra pop-up beer gardens and pitchside clubs will be found at the 12 host stadiums, too. Fans can enter online to win a chance to sit in the Michelob Ultra Pitchside Club in New York City for the semifinals and final.

"The FIFA Club World Cup is an opportunity to continue to make our brand synonymous with one of the world's most beloved sports by elevating the fan experience this summer and into 2026," Marques said.

"The FIFA Club World Cup is an opportunity to continue to make our brand synonymous with one of the world's most beloved sports by elevating the fan experience this summer and into 2026," Marques said.

Real Madrid is working to finalize several important signings before the Club World Cup. Huijsen and Alexander Arnold are already confirmed and they're negotiating for Álvaro Carreras with Benfica. However, it seems that things won't stop at just these three names.

Josep Pedrerol has spoken and pointed out two more signings that Real Madrid will make. In this case, though, it will be after this summer's Club World Cup. But there will be two more additions joining the three defenders he already takes for granted.

"Real Madrid is considering signing a midfielder and a forward" the journalist stated. Although Pedrerol wanted to make it clear that "it won't be before the Club World Cup, it'll be afterwards". Those are the moves they're already preparing in the halls of Bernabéu.

Pedrerol has indicated that the first moves have taken place in defense out of necessity. The three signings before the Club World Cup have been in the back line because it was the most weakened. Within the white club, they believed that in order to win the title this summer, it was the priority they needed to address.

Xabi Alonso has been clear about the signings he wants brought in this summer for next season. Beyond the defense, where they've strengthened in every position. A midfielder and a forward were also other positions he considers important.

A playmaker has been one of his major demands for next season. With Kroos's retirement last summer and Modric's departure this year, they've lost quality in the midfield. Angelo Stiller is the name that stands out the most to solve this problem.

In attack, a forward like Joselu has been missed for matches that became complicated. A "tank" in the box, able to bring down balls and with the opposing goal always in mind. Maybe this isn't the priority right now, but Xabi Alonso has also requested it.

ATLANTA - The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is preparing to play a central role in hosting soccer fans from around the world during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with expanded service and enhanced customer support for the six matches scheduled at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

What they're saying:

"MARTA is one of the only transit systems in the world that offers direct access to the airport, with a train station inside the concourse," said MARTA General Manager and CEO Collie Greenwood. "Soccer fans can go from the plane to the train to their hotel seamlessly and let MARTA drive them easily to and from the matches and other Club World Cup festivities around the city."

By the numbers:

MARTA will increase service before and after each match, including running a pre-game shuttle train between Five Points and GWCC stations. Transit Ambassadors, Load and Go teams, and MARTA Police officers will be positioned throughout the system to assist riders and ensure safety.

Match Schedule at Mercedes-Benz Stadium:

Despite ongoing construction at Five Points Station, all rail service and transfers will operate as scheduled, with street-level access via Forsyth Street.

What's next:

Looking ahead to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, MARTA is coordinating with FIFA, the Atlanta Sports Council, and other agencies to expand service for the eight matches Atlanta will host. The agency is also preparing to launch an upgraded Breeze payment system, allowing customers to use credit cards, smartphones, or smartwatches to pay fares.

Fan events will extend beyond the stadium, including the City of Decatur's monthlong "WatchFest26" located above Decatur Station. MARTA encourages fans to take transit to reach both the stadium and surrounding celebrations.

The three-time defending champion meets her biggest rival and world No. 1: who will reach the final in Paris?BySteve TignorPublished Jun 03, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 03, 2025

Before this past weekend, Swiatek-Sabalenka was in danger of becoming the great tennis rivalry that wasn't.They've been the two best women players since 2022, but that's also the last time they faced off at a major. As dominant as each has been during different sections of the season, they couldn't put it all together at the same time at a Slam. Iga would win in Paris, Aryna would win in Melbourne and/or New York, and never their twains would meet. The way things were going as Roland Garros began, the drought didn't look like it was going to end any time soon.Swiatek, a four-time RG champion, had been the reigning Queen of Clay for most of this decade, but she appeared to have dethroned herself this spring. She failed to win any titles on dirt, or any titles at all through the first half of 2025. Instead of rounding into form as she approached Roland Garros, she had rounded farther and farther away from it. By the time Iga played in Rome three weeks ago, it felt like she was struggling to put two balls in a row into the court, and she wasn't getting any closer to figuring out why. For the first time, Sabalenka, who has never reached a final in Paris, had replaced her as the favorite there.

Swiatek leads their head-to-head 8-4 (5-1 on clay) but Sabalenka won their most recent meeting last summer in Cincinnati.

As they say, though, there's no place like home. And for a tennis player, there's no place like a home away from home. That's what Court Philippe Chatrier is for Swiatek. Even after all of her recent head-scratching defeats, when it came down to the nitty-gritty, to losing the title and the trophy that matter most, she found her game at the last possible moment on that court.Down 6-1, 2-0 to Elena Rybakina in the fourth round, Swiatek took a full-cut rip at an important backhand, and it won her the point. She did the same on the next rally, and it won her another point. That was all she needed. From there, her topspin bombs finally stopped sailing over the lines, and started detonating in the corners again.Swiatek says her history in Chatrier helps her self-belief.“I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything, because there's more probably that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places,” she says. “I just maybe believe it a little bit more.”

Sabalenka's journey to the semis hasn't been as dramatic, but it has probably been just what she wanted. She hasn't dropped a set, yet she did get two useful tests in her last two matches, from hard-hitting players who have beaten her in the past. Amanda Anisimova pushed her to 7-5 in the first set in the fourth round, and Zheng Qinwen, who just beat Sabalenka in Rome, played well early and pushed her to a first-set tiebreaker. Both times, the top seed responded and reasserted control of the baseline.“I expected her to play a great match,” Sabalenka said of Zheng. “I enjoyed this battle. I enjoyed that I had to come back in that first set, and the first set was, like, really tight. It could go either way.”So who's the favorite now? I'm going to see say it's even at the moment. Swiatek leads their head-to-head 8-4, and is 5-1 on clay. Sabalenka won their most recent meeting, on hard courts in Cincinnati last summer, and has been the better player since. Sabalenka will be highly motivated to earn a chance at her first Roland Garros title, but Swiatek will likely be equally motivated to keep her crown, and redeem her game after her recent fall-off.

I love tough challenges. I think this is the matches where you actually improve as a player and where you get much stronger. I'm always excited to face someone strong and then someone who can challenge me. Aryna Sabalenka on facing Swiatek

This will also be their first meeting since Sabalenka engineered a thaw in their personal relationship—not that one seemed to exist—when she asked Swiatek to do a Tik-Tok video with her last fall. They've been friendlier since. Will it make make any difference on Thursday? I doubt it. They'll probably be happy to be rivals again.“I love it,” Sabalenka says of getting a chance to Swiatek again at a Slam. “I love tough challenges. I think this is the matches where you actually improve as a player and where you get much stronger. I'm always excited to face someone strong and then someone who can challenge me.”The two appear to be at even strength at the moment, but I'll take the one who has been at her best all along this season. Winner: Sabalenka

Musetti was issued a warning for kicking a ball that unintentionally hit a line judge.ByDavid KanePublished Jun 03, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 03, 2025

After exiting his first Roland Garros quarterfinal, Frances Tiafoe took no prisoners when asked about the warning opponent Lorenzo Musetti was issued for kicking a ball—and accidentally hitting a line judge:Q. I just wanted to ask you about the incident in the second set when Musetti kicked a ball, and it hit a line judge. These are always strange incidents in tennis. I wondered what your view was on that and what it's like for you on the other side of the court. Maybe it's going through your head that this could be a potential default situation? It must be strange.FRANCES TIAFOE: Yeah, I mean, obviously he did that and nothing happened. I think that's comical, but it is what it is. Nothing happened, so there's nothing really to talk about. Obviously it's not consistent, so it is what it is.Tiafoe was down a set when the incident occurred, and the American was able to level the match and keep things close deep into a third set before Musetti nabbed a crucial break to reclaim momentum and win, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2.

It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that, and that's why probably just, you know, let me continue my game. Lorenzo Musetti

“Yeah, honestly it was really unlucky coincidence,” Musetti said in his own post-match press conference. “Yeah, I was a little bit, honestly, scared, because I really didn't want to harm nobody, of course. So, I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said, Sorry, I apologize to everyone.”The incident comes two years after doubles player Miyu Kato was defaulted from a Roland Garros match after hitting a ball girl, a decision that caused controversy given the apparently accidental nature of the hit.“It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that,” Musetti explained, “and that's why probably just, you know, let me continue my game.”For his part, Tiafoe didn't blame the incident for his loss, and comes away from a career-best Roland Garros result with a new attitude towards what has traditionally been his least favorite surface—and a boosted motivation as he heads into the grass- and hard-court swings.

“Last bunch of clay court seasons have kind of just been an eye-roll situation,” Tiafoe said. “Like, ‘Oh, man, this is like just kind of watching paint dry. Can't wait for the season to pass.'“Now, to be able to make quarterfinal slams, gonna probably change the way I approach it next year, this season in general. And obviously, I'll be coming here ready to play, for sure, next year. So, I'm really happy about that.“I still haven't scratched the surface generally. I've had some good runs and that's cool, but I really feel like I can really be at the end of these type tournaments. I haven't done it yet, and that's what's going to keep me going and keep me excited to do more.”

Lorenzo Musetti advanced to his first semifinals appearance at the French Open Tuesday with a four-set win over Frances Tiafoe. Musetti held off Tiafoe despite receiving an unsportsmanlike conduct warning in the second set after inadvertently hitting a line judge with a ball he kicked toward the back wall at Roland-Garros out of frustration.

The eighth-seeded Musetti drew an instant reaction from the chair umpire for a code violation, but was not penalized further. Musetti finished off Tiafoe in the fourth set after a series of close line calls went his way in the final games.

Many questioned after match if Musetti should've received a default and been ousted from the tournament after the play. Tiafoe looked at the chair umpire as if he was expecting a ruling, but only a warning was delivered.

"That's the judgement of the chair umpire and eventually the tournament referee, and it quickly was wiped away," tennis analyst Jim Courier said during live coverage of the event. "You could see (Musetti) was frustrated, but it wasn't as if he took a full throttle kicking the ball."

Novak Djokovic was disqualified from the 2020 U.S. Open following a similar incident, though a bit more violent in retrospect. Djokovic defaulted in the fourth round after hitting a lineswoman with a ball out of frustration, inadvertently placing a ball in the throat area.

The lineswoman received medical attention and was fine, but play had to be stopped and Djokovic's hit out of frustration was reviewed.

Musetti was victorious 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 over Tiafoe inside the same venue he won the bronze medal in the 2024 Olympics. He'll play the winner of the last remaining American, Tommy Paul, and Carlos Alcaraz on Friday for a spot in the championship.

Tiafoe and Paul became the first American men to reach the French Open quarterfinals since Andre Agassi in 2003. Tiafoe won Tuesday's second set against Musetti with a blazing cross-court forehand on set point, but a loss in third-set tiebreak was when his opponent took the upper hand in the match.

Musetti coasted in the final set, overpowering Tiafoe with his serve while taking advantage of a few ill-timed unforced errors from his opponent.

PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz lost in the first round of the French Open as the tournament's No. 4 seed on Monday, eliminated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by 66th-ranked Daniel Altmaier of Germany.

Altmaier broke Fritz's big serve five times at Court Simonne-Mathieu and ended the Californian's 15-match Grand Slam winning streak against players ranked outside the top 50.

Fritz's exit followed another by a top-10 American: No. 9 Emma Navarro was bounced from the women's bracket earlier Monday.

In September, Fritz lost the U.S. Open trophy to Jannik Sinner, becoming the first U.S. man to reach a major final since Andy Roddick in 2009. In Paris, Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Roddick was No. 3 in 2007.

While hard courts are Fritz's preferred surface, he did have a run to the second week on the red clay of Roland-Garros a year ago, making it into the fourth round before losing to Casper Ruud.

This is not Altmaier's first big win at the French Open. He beat No. 8 seed Matteo Berrettini there in 2020, and Sinner in 2023.

The USTA announced last week the participants who will be competing in the U.S. Open Wild Card Playoffs later this month.

Three former New Jersey high school stars are set to take part in a four-player singles field and a four-pair bracket for doubles.

Delbarton alum Michael Zheng of Columbia headlines the action.

The 2021 NJSIAA state singles tournament champion and last fall's NCAA men's singles tournament winner will compete in both the singles and doubles playoffs.

His doubles partner is teammate Nicolas Kotzen, a Newark Academy alum who Zheng defeated in the NJSIAA singles final.

Zheng was named an Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division-I All-American this spring.

Also competing in the doubles bracket is Alex Kotzen, another Newark Academy alum and NJSIAA state singles champion from 2019.

Kotzen spent his last year of college at Tennessee after previously playing at Columbia. He is the older brother of Nicolas.

The playoffs are set to be held at the USTA National Campus in Orlando. FL. from June 16-18. The new event, featuring the top American collegiate players, is expected to more than double the average number of U.S. Open wild card berths earned by American collegiate players with six.

The winners of the men's and women's singles and doubles competitions will earn U.S. Open main draw wild cards in their respective categories. The finalists, meanwhile, will receive U.S. Open qualifying wild cards.

Zheng earned an automatic spot into the playoffs after winning the NCAA singles title in November. The rest of the field, listed below, were selected by a committee comprising USTA staff, college coaches, and an ITA representative.

The singles semifinals will take place on June 16, the doubles semifinals on June 17 and the finals on June 18.

The event is free and matches will begin at 5 p.m. each day. Streams of the matches will be available on the USTA National Campus website.

PARIS (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka is the top-ranked player in women's tennis. Yet even that status didn't spare her from competing in front of empty seats at Roland-Garros, something she says isn't fair.

The three-time Grand Slam champion faced China's Zheng Qinwen in the first quarterfinal match on Tuesday, beginning at 11 a.m. on Court Philippe-Chatrier. When play began, large sections of the 15,000-seat stadium were still unoccupied — a common sight in the early hours at the French Open, when many ticket holders opt for lunch or arrive later in the day.

“It was a big match and probably would make more sense to put us a little bit later just so more people could watch it,” Sabalenka said after her 7-6 (3), 6-3 win. “ I definitely think that would make more sense to kind of like move our match for a little bit later.”

But scheduling more night sessions for women is proving a tough issue to resolve for French Open tournament director Amélie Mauresmo.

Since the introduction of night sessions in 2021, only four women's singles matches have been featured in that marquee time slot. Serena Williams played in the first-ever night match at Roland-Garros, but pandemic restrictions meant the stands were empty.

No women's matches have been scheduled for the evening session this year, something Sabalenka said should change. Asked about her views on the fact that women haven't played a single night match this year, the player from Belarus said they deserve “equal treatment.”

“There was a lot of ... great battles, a lot of great matches which would be cool to see as night sessions,” she said. “Just more people in the stands watching these incredible battles. And just to show ourselves to more people. I definitely agree that we deserve to be put on a bigger stage. Like better timing, more people watching.”

There was, however, one upside to the early start for Sabalenka ahead of her semifinal against four-time champion Iga Swiatek.

“I'm happy to finish earlier and then I have a half day off and I can just enjoy the city and do all the things that I have to do,” she said.

Bublik, a 6-foot-5, 27-year-old native of Russia with world-class hands and an even better serve, may have Top 10 talent. He has the height, he has the mix of power and touch, and few players can match him for shot-making creativity. If you like to watch front-facing tweeners, underhand serves, and drop shot returns, Bublik is your man.

The immensely talented but often mercurial Bublik has locked in at Roland Garros, scoring Top 10 wins over Alex de Minaur and Jack Draper to reach his first Grand Slam quarterfinal.

But we may never know how far his talents could take him, because he has seen what it takes to stay in the Top 10, and he doesn't any part of it. Bublik, who is married and has a three-year-old son, doesn't want to devote every thought and minute to training, and doesn't want punish his body to the point where he has pain for the rest of his life.“Will I put my life and health on the line to have a 'might?' Maybe? No,” Bublik said this week when he was asked whether his good results at Roland Garros might tempt him to change his philosophy and push himself more.“If I can't walk at the age of 40, it's OK?” he asks.“No, it's not,” is his answer.“It's finding the balance,” he continues. “It's doing necessarily what I have to do in order to be able to compete against the top of the game…I think I prioritize tennis and life in equal ways. For me it's a 50/50 relationship.”

I got to No. 17 in the world, which was a big thing for me. I'm, like, ‘OK, I have to do this and that, I have to practice harder.' I mean, work on my diet, stop drinking, stop partying. Have to be a more professional soldier. Then...I just burned out waiting for the results to come. Alexander Bublik

Bublik's unconventional take on his career hasn't led him to the top of the sport, but it does make him one of the most refreshing and jarringly funny interviews in tennis. He can be pigeonholed and criticized as a slacker, but he's a slacker with a thought process.After coming back from two sets down to beat Alex de Minaur in the second round, he was asked a standard question: “Where did your belief come from?” Most players, even smart and interesting ones, would have replied with something along the lines of, “I just kept telling myself to hang in.”Instead, Bublik told us this:“I was not thinking this way. I was checking the [plane] tickets already in my head. I didn't really care, in a way. I was like, I'll accept the loss. Being second round here, it's [already] an achievement for me…I told my team, they know it, so it was not like if I lose, I would be upset. No, I would be happy and I would be home today in Monaco at 9:00 in the evening.”“At the end I said, OK, I stayed there, I hit the ball. Then I had a slight chance. I used this chance.”

For most of his career, Bublik has achieved his goals. From 2021 to 2024, he finished each season ranked in the 30s. Being that consistent seems to show that he really does have a plan for what he wants to accomplish, despite his seat-of-his-pants approach on court. And while Bublik admits he's “not the most professional guy on the planet,” he has always said that he does work hard on his game, because it takes a lot of work to stay in the Top 40.In 2025, though, his lack of total dedication finally seemed to have caught up with him. Bublik came to Paris with a 7-13 record, and a ranking in the 60s.Characteristically, he says that his demise came because, after cracking the Top 20 for the first time last year, he started working too hard.“I got to No. 17 in the world, which was a big thing for me,” Bublik said. “I'm, like, ‘OK, I have to do this and that, I have to practice harder.' I mean, work on my diet, stop drinking, stop partying. Have to be a more professional soldier.”“Then I did it,” he says. But his ranking didn't keep rising. “I just burned out waiting for the results to come.”

Bublik credits advice from fellow pro Gaël Monfils with changing his perspective and inspiring his run at Roland Garros.

Now Bublik thinks he has found an approach that works for him. Perhaps not surprisingly, it came from the patron saint of talented free-spirits, Gael Monfils. When Bublik complained to the Frenchman earlier this year that he was on a losing streak, Monfils said that everyone on tour is much more professional these days, but most of the time, they'll still give you a chance in a match.“He said you wait for your chances. You have your chance, you use it. If you waste it, it's your problem,” Bublik said. “This changed my perspective.”That new perspective, he says, is what launched him into his stunning performance against Jack Draper on Monday, in which he took a young player on the rise, and a possible future Grand Slam winner, and dismantled him. Bublik, who hit 69 winners against 38 errors, called it “the best day of my life.” Now he'll need to have an even better one, against an even better young opponent, Jannik Sinner.“How high can Bublik climb?” could become an intriguing question again. But his philosophy has always posed a more interesting quandary: What should we make of a professional athlete who prioritizes work-life balance over single-minded, 24/7 dedication? Should we ask more of him than we ask of ourselves?

It's finding the balance. It's doing necessarily what I have to do in order to be able to compete against the top of the game…I think I prioritize tennis and life in equal ways. For me it's a 50/50 relationship. Alexander Bublik

It may depend on which Bublik we see. When he's on, and into it, he's one of the most exciting performers in tennis, and his willingness to try high-risk shots only adds to the fun. When he's off and not into it, his lack of seriousness can make for random tennis and a disappointing contest. He can also be a loose cannon; he has challenged opponents to fights, and two years ago he was criticized for calling a formerly injured opponent an “invalid.”We want to see explosive shot-making, but we want to see players who are emotionally invested in their own success, too, and who play to win.I also wonder if part of Bublik's ambivalence comes from an aversion to pressure. When he served for the match against Draper, this normally insouciant athlete was clearly nervous; he rushed from one point to the next, and struggled to put a second serve in the court.Hopefully, we'll get to watch the good Bublik, the fighting Bublik, the wand-wielding Bublik see his chance against Sinner and do his best to take it.

PARIS (AP) — Lorenzo Musetti used his sleek one-handed backhand and sprint-then-slide court coverage to reach his first semifinal at the French Open, and second at a Grand Slam tournament, by beating Frances Tiafoe 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 Tuesday in the same stadium where he won a bronze medal at last year's Olympics.The eighth-seeded Musetti, a 23-year-old Italian, improved to 19-3 this season on red clay. When the match ended, he rolled up the right sleeve of his green shirt and flexed his biceps.He'll face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Tommy Paul on Friday for a berth in the championship match.Musetti and No. 1 Jannik Sinner — who faces unseeded Alexander Bublik in the quarterfinals Wednesday — gave Italy two male quarterfinalists at Roland-Garros for the first time since 1973.Tiafoe also was part of a rare duo: He and Paul were the first American men to get to the round of eight in Paris since Andre Agassi in 2003 — and the first duo to do it in the same year since Jim Courier and Pete Sampras in 1996.

And the 15th-seeded Tiafoe, a 27-year-old from Maryland, made it all the way to the quarterfinals without dropping a single set. But he was not quite up to the task against Musetti, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon in 2024, and it showed right away.Wearing a chain around his neck with a pendant reading “Big Foe” in capital letters, Tiafoe missed all eight first serves in his initial service game and sent a backhand wide to give Musetti a break and a 2-0 lead. He looked up at his coach, David Witt — who's worked with Venus Williams and Jessica Pegula in the past — and complained about the wind.The deficit was 3-0 after 13 minutes. By the time that set was over, 21 of Musetti's 30 points had arrived via mistakes by Tiafoe, nine forced and 12 unforced.Two-time U.S. Open semifinalist Tiafoe's first break delivered a 2-1 lead in the second, and when he smacked a forehand winner to even the match at a set apiece, he let out a roar and shouted, “Let's go! Let's go!”

During that set, Musetti was warned for unsportsmanlike conduct for kicking a tennis ball that inadvertently hit a linesperson. Unlike most top-level tennis tournaments, which rely on electronic line-calling, there are still humans on court at Roland-Garros to decide whether shots land in or out.The point of the match came in the third set's sixth game.Musetti stretched wide of the doubles alley near the net to reach a shot at a seemingly impossible angle. Tiafoe then did the same in response, sending his near the baseline. Musetti ran and, with his back to the net, twisted his body to somehow flick a low ball back with a half-swing. It worked, though, and Tiafoe — perhaps startled to see the point wasn't over — netted an awkward, shoulder-high volley.That set swung Musetti's way when he broke in its last game. On a 12-stroke exchange, Tiafoe tried an ill-advised and ill-struck drop shot that the speedy Musetti got to, conjuring up a down-the-line backhand winner. Now it was his turn to celebrate, punching the air and yelling.

Musetti broke again to lead 2-0 in the fourth, and soon it was over.He is now 13-4 in his French Open career, and three of those losses came against an opponent ranked No. 1 — Novak Djokovic twice, Alcaraz once. The only way he'll need to deal with the top-ranked man again in Paris is if it's his pal Sinner standing across the net on Sunday with the trophy in the offing.

Defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominance at Roland Garros by securing her 26th consecutive victory at the event, defeating Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. Swiatek will now face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals.

Defending champion Iga Swiatek extended her Paris superlatives on Tuesday, reaching her fourth straight Roland Garros semifinal and earning her 26th consecutive victory at this event.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

No. 5 seed Swiatek of Poland defeated No. 13 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine 6-1, 7-5 in their quarterfinal meeting on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Svitolina needed 1 hour and 41 minutes to collect her fourth win in five matches against Svitolina.

Despite holding her lowest ranking since 2022 and nearly falling to Elena Rybakina in the previous round, Swiatek pulled out some of her peak play to dismiss Svitolina, who was seeking an appearance in her fourth career Grand Slam semifinal.

"Even though first set, the score looks pretty straightforward, it wasn't like that in any other games," Swiatek said to the press. "I had to fight for every point. I'm happy that I also stepped up when she broke me in the second set, and that I kept my intensity until the end."

Semifinal showdown vs. Sabalenka: The stage is now set for a semifinal clash between the two players who have locked down the No. 1 ranking since April of 2022.

Swiatek, who has spent 125 weeks at World No. 1, will face current World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final four on Thursday. Sabalenka is enjoying her 41st week at the top of the rankings and ousted reigning Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in their quarterfinal.

Swiatek leads the overall head-to-head 8-4, and the clay-court head-to-head 5-1. Sabalenka, though, beat Swiatek 6-3, 6-3 in their most recent meeting, on the hard courts of Cincinnati last year. This will be their first-ever meeting at Roland Garros. 

"For sure our rivalry is pushing both of us, I think, but it's not only about the level of tennis," Swiatek said. "It's about like everything, how we work, and how professional we are."

Clay-court queens: Svitolina started the day as this year's clay-court match-win leader, with 16 victories on the dirt in 2025. She won an indoor-clay title in Rouen, made the semifinals in Madrid and the quarterfinals in Rome.

Swiatek, meanwhile, entered Roland Garros without a clay-court title for the first time since 2020. However, she won that 2020 Roland Garros championship anyway, and she still has a chance to take the crown for a fifth time after closing out Svitolina's stellar clay-court swing.

Swiatek is the fifth player in the Open Era, including women and men, to win 25 or more consecutive singles matches at Roland Garros. The rest of that list: Rafael Nadal, Chris Evert, Bjorn Borg and Monica Seles.

"I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything," Swiatek said. "Because there's more [probability] that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places. I just maybe believe it a little bit more."

Match moments: Tuesday's first-set scoreline looks routine, but Svitolina did have three chances to break in the opening frame. Swiatek had to grind out a particularly tough hold for 4-1 to maintain her break advantage.

Once she got through that game, Swiatek and her signature forehand took control. In the next game, Swiatek used that wing to convert her fifth break point of another lengthy tussle and lead 5-1. She eased to the one-set lead from there.

As windy conditions intensified in the second set, Svitolina made her presence felt. The Ukrainian jumped out to a 3-1 lead before Swiatek regrouped, slamming rally forehands crosscourt to pull back on serve.

Still, Svitolina was two points away from taking the second set after a forehand winner gave her deuce at 5-4. Swiatek, though, was not to be denied, holding on for 5-5, then cranking a forehand return winner off of a second serve to break for 6-5.

Serving for the match, Swiatek summoned her second ace of the day to queue up double match point. Her third ace of the day followed immediately thereafter, and the Polish player was back in the Roland Garros semifinals, a place she is very familiar with.

Defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominance at Roland Garros by securing her 26th consecutive victory at the event, defeating Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. Swiatek will now face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals.

PARIS (AP) — Lorenzo Musetti was warned for unsportsmanlike conduct for kicking a tennis ball that inadvertently hit a linesperson during his Roland Garros quarterfinal against Frances Tiafoe on Tuesday.Unlike most top-level tennis tournaments, which rely on electronic line-calling, there are still humans on court at Roland-Garros to make rulings on whether shots land in or out.The eighth-seeded Musetti, who won a bronze medal for Italy at the Paris Olympics and was a semifinalist at Wimbledon last year, had just dropped a game to trail Tiafoe 5-3 in the second set of their match at Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Carlos Alcaraz's meteoric rise to tennis stardom continues as he blazes through Roland Garros, matching up to the legendary Rafael Nadal in a spectacular 300-match journey. The young Spanish sensation has triumphed over four opponents, setting the stage for three crucial showdowns in Paris.

Having recently clinched his seventh Masters 1000 title in Rome, Alcaraz's dominance on the clay courts is undeniable. His victory over Jannik Sinner marked his 300th ATP match, solidifying his position among the tennis greats. At just 22 years old, Alcaraz boasts an impressive 239-61 record, placing him in elite company alongside iconic players like Rod Laver, Arthur Ashe, and John McEnroe.

Surpassing even his compatriot Nadal at the 300-match milestone, Alcaraz's remarkable achievement speaks volumes about his talent and determination. With 19 ATP titles under his belt, including 11 from 13 finals, the young prodigy's consistency and skill are unparalleled. Alcaraz's ability to excel on all surfaces and against any opponent showcases his versatility and unwavering focus on improvement.

Since bursting onto the scene in 2021, Alcaraz has shattered records and expectations, becoming the youngest world number one in 2022 and the youngest Major champion across all surfaces. Drawing inevitable comparisons to Nadal, Alcaraz is carving his own path to tennis immortality, captivating fans and experts alike with his exceptional talent and maturity on the court.

As Alcaraz crosses the 300-match mark, the tennis world eagerly anticipates just how far this rising star will soar. With each victory, he cements his status as a force to be reckoned with in the tennis realm, leaving spectators in awe of his unprecedented success and boundless potential.

World No 5 looked crushed after his transformative clay swing ended in defeat to Alexander Bublik but grass is the perfect surface to make amends

Alexander Bublik reacted to the most significant victory of his career by collapsing on to the Parisian soil with his arms aloft, his face transmitting joy and disbelief. Although his jubilation was an apt reaction to breaking new ground by reaching his first grand slam quarter-final, it also said much about his beaten opponent.

Jack Draper's rise over the past 12 months has been one of the most significant developments on the ATP Tour. As he has established himself as one of the best in the world and earned respect within the locker room, the target on his back has grown accordingly. Now ranked No 5, Draper is one of the elite opponents that others lomeasure themselves against. When they face him, they will try to swing freely and use the occasion to take their games to levels they normally cannot sustain. As was the case with Bublik on Monday, this will sometimes work.

One of the great challenges of being at the top is learning how to hold off the bloodthirsty masses, to find a way through tough matches by making life difficult for those opponents and seizing the most important points. Draper is still new to these situations; this is his second grand slam tournament as a top 20 player and his first inside the top five. A year ago, he could barely trust his body over five sets. Facing more of these experiences will teach him how to overcome them.

Despite his own disappointment, Draper ends his clay season having made transformative progress on the surface, which he previously had minimal experience on. Less than two months ago, in his third-round defeat to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the Monte Carlo Masters, the British No 1 was still struggling badly with his movement on the surface and his confidence was shot. His growth since then is reflected in his results as he reached his first clay-court final at the Madrid Open, a Masters 1000 event, and following it up with a quarter-final in Rome. He arrived in Paris seeking his first match win here and finished the tournament in the second week. He could still reach a new high world ranking of No 4 on Monday.

While some players tend to handle defeats better with age, Draper says that his losses are more painful. Now he knows what he is capable of, falling short of his lofty goals hurts even more. In the hours after his defeat to Bublik, he looked utterly crushed. Not only did he miss a big opportunity to build a deeper run, Draper squandered the chance to test himself against Jannik Sinner, the best in the world, in the quarter-finals.

One of Draper's most admirable qualities is the perspective he maintains in difficult moments. Even as he processed a crushing defeat, he was still able to recognise how it could propel him forward. Since he has arrived on the circuit, navigating physical problems, anxiety and doubt, few things have come easily for him. This is no different.

“It's a really, really tough loss to take,” he said. “My journey, even though I've come up quickly this year, I've got myself to a high ranking, it's always been a steep learning curve for me. There's always been a lot of adversity, a lot of injuries, a lot of setbacks. This is another one of those tough matches. I'll learn from it and I'll get better and I'll use it to my advantage.”

Once Draper has finished stewing over this loss, he will shift his sights on the coming storm. Until now, he has had the benefit of developing his game and building his career in the shadows. While British athletes are often burdened by hype and expectations, Draper is still somewhat under the radar. He has immense respect within tennis, and there is a consensus that he is a genuine contender at the biggest events, but his profile at home does not match his growing list of achievements.

This will surely change when he heads to Wimbledon as one of the best in the world and on grass, a surface that perfectly suits his game, he will be a top contender. This will be Draper's first experience of the attention and scrutiny that comes with his new lofty status. How he handles those challenges will be fascinating and instructive.

Among the many highs for Serena Williams, there were also some infrequent lows.

And one of those less glamorous moments came at the French Open in 2019, where a surprise early exit would lead to a chain of consequences that would leave another tennis star rather unhappy.

When Williams was sent home after a third round defeat to then 20-year-old Sofia Kenin, she was unsurprisingly not in the best of moods.

The 23-time Grand Slam champion made 34 unforced errors during her loss to unseeded Kenin as she struggled to get to grips with the game.

Williams, who has the most majors in the open era, was also chasing the chance to equal Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slams. 

After the defeat, a dejected Williams had to fulfil her media obligations and was desperate to get them done as soon as possible.

According to French newspaper L'Equipe, Williams told a tournament official, "Put me in another room, smaller, but now" referring to the press conference theaters.

It led to the official at Roland Garros telling Dominic Thiem, who was fulfilling his media obligations in one room, to end his press conference early to make way for Williams.

The Swiss had just beaten Pablo Cuevas in the third round and was preparing for his opponent, Gael Monfils in the fourth round.

Thiem hit back at the official at the time of the incident. 

"What the hell? But it's a joke, really. What's the point of that, that I have to leave the room because she's coming?" he said.

Guy Forget, the tournament director at the time, issued an apology to Thiem, who won the US Open in 2020.

"Every player has to wait. It shows a bad personality, in my opinion," Thiem later told reporters.

"I wasn't angry or frustrated. Maybe for a couple of minutes or so. It is just the principle. 

"It doesn't matter if it is me who sits in there, even if a junior is in there.

"I am 100% sure Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal would never do something like that."

"I don't know if it was her mistake or only the mistake of the officials," Thiem later added. "I don't know if she saw me, or saw someone was in the room. If she'd seen me, it would have been nicer for her to wait.

"I had an apology [from tournament director Guy Forget]. I don't know whose fault it is exactly. It was just a very strange thing, I never had something like that before. I'm easy-going. Of course it was strange, but I've forgotten it now."

The then fourth-seeded Thiem said he understood Williams' desire to get her media responsibilities done as fast as she could.

"She lost and everything," the Austrian said. "So I think it was a little bit mistake of her, mistake of the officials, but as I said, it's forgotten.

"It was a funny thing, strange thing, which made a big round in all the social networks, but now I don't put any attention on it anymore."

Roger Federer offered his opinion on the situation at the time, aiming blame at those who allowed this situation to even occur.

"I don't know what went wrong but something went wrong for this to happen," the Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion said.

"If I would have lost today against Leonardo Mayer, I would let him go first or decide when he wants to go to press as he's got a next match. My next match is far, far away. So that's just the way you go about it.

"There must have been a misunderstanding, or maybe they should have kept Serena still in the locker room, not waiting here in the press centre."

Annabelle Croft, a former world No.24 and now tennis commentator, slammed Williams at the time, claiming that she should have just waited.

“She should be made to wait an extra five minutes until finished. Had it been a role reversal, there would have been absolute uproar," she said on EuroSport at the time.

“It's just appalling. I think he's owed an apology to be honest.”

“I asked them to put me in the small room,” Williams said of the incident. 

“I begged them to put me in the small room, and they didn't.

“I said, ‘Listen, I can come back. I'm just going to go back'. They were like, ‘No, stay here'.

“They pulled him out. I was like, ‘You guys are so rude to do that', quote-unquote, that's what I said. The next day I had a bad personality. Literally that's what happened.

“I actually stuck up for the guy, so I don't understand how I got a bad personality for telling them what they did was wrong to him.

“But we spoke about it. I've always liked him. I still like him. He's a great player. I mean, he's unbelievable.

“I'm really, quite frankly, too old to be in controversy. That's why I just wanted to clear the air.

“I'm like, ‘Dude, I told them that it wasn't right what they did'. He said he didn't say ‘bad personality', that the media mixed up his words. It's all good.”

Later, Thiem would actually extend an olive branch to Williams, making it clear that it was likely not her fault but the fault of the organisers.

“Probably it was not Serena's mistake,” he told reporters a month later

“I find her achievements unbelievable, sensational. I would like to make amends with her in Wimbledon or the US Open mixed doubles.

“In retrospect, it was funny that such an organisational mistake happened at a Grand Slam tournament. What I do not understand is that it blew up so much.”

So no hard feelings in the end.

The 30-year-old Australian has played very little tennis over the last two years because of various injuries, notably a wrist problem that required surgery.

In March at the Miami Open, he won his first singles match since 2022, but he pulled out of the ongoing French Open, where he had been down to play men's doubles, with a knee injury.

"I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year," he wrote on Instagram.

"I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint."

Kyrgios, whose undoubted talent has often been overshadowed by his fragile temperament, added: "This is just a bump in the road though and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever."

Kyrgios reached the final at Wimbledon three years ago before going down in four sets to Novak Djokovic.

The third Grand Slam of the year starts on June 30th.

Nick Kyrgios has won seven ATP singles titles

Australian Nick Kyrgios says he will miss this year's Wimbledon after suffering a "small setback" on his latest return from injury.

Kyrgios, who was beaten in the 2022 final at the All England Club by Novak Djokovic, has played very little tennis over the past two years because of a troublesome wrist that required surgery.

In March at the Miami Open, the 30-year-old won his first singles match since 2022 but later pulled out of the French Open with a knee injury, where he had been scheduled to play men's doubles.

The Australian wrote on Instagram: "I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately I won't make it back for grass season this year. 

"I know how much you've been looking forward to seeing me out there and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever."

Oscar Piastri delivered a masterclass from pole position to win the Spanish Grand Prix from his McLaren team mate Lando Norris. But while those two sailed towards the line, there was plenty going on behind.

A late Safety Car caused chaos, with Max Verstappen left on the hard tyre at the restart. That led to a chain of events that saw him collide with George Russell in what has become one of the biggest talking points of the season so far.

After the race, F1 journalists Jesús Balseiro and Julianne Cerasoli joined joined Tom Clarkson in the Barcelona paddock to discuss an eventful Spanish Grand Prix in this week's F1 Nation podcast.

There was joy for Nico Hulkenberg though, who climbed from P15 on the grid all the way to fifth – which was not just his best result of the season, but jumped Kick Sauber up to eighth in the standings.

But joy for some meant woe for others, and one team keen to see the back of Spain are Williams, who had a torrid time with both drivers suffering front wing damage.

As the 42nd season of “Wheel of Fortune” comes to a close on June 6, 2025, it will mark the end of Ryan Seacrest's first season as host of the beloved game show. The longtime “American Idol” host took over for Pat Sajak in September, but the transition was far from easy. 

In an interview with Los Angeles station ABC7 on June 3, Seacrest admitted that he felt a “tremendous amount of pressure” taking over the iconic show and still doesn't feel fully comfortable after taping 195 episodes. 

A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune)

“Wheel of Fortune” legend Vanna White told ABC7 that the transition from co-starring with Sajak to Seacrest has been “seamless” and that he “makes it look easy.” 

But Seacrest said uneasily, “Most of the time. I still have to remember what I'm doing out there.”

“Let me be honest,” he told the outlet. “There was a tremendous amount of pressure that I felt coming into this. It's been built with Pat and Vanna for so many years, I just wanted people to feel comfortable and watch, and if we got a few more along the way, then bonus round, right? I'm thrilled that the loyal audience has accepted what we get to do together.” 

Seacrest's debut on the show was a slam dunk, according to Variety, which reported that it was “most-watched entertainment series in September across broadcast, cable and syndication.” By January, the Los Angeles Times had called Seacrest “ratings gold” on the game show. In March, “WOF” moved to second place behind “Jeopardy,” according to the U.S. Sun, but was still bringing in even more viewers than it did in September. 

A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune)

Among Seacrest's fans is White, who told ABC7, “This whole season, I have been smiling from day one. He's so easy to work with. He's fun. He's easygoing and he makes my job easy. You come to work and you make people happy. What could be better?” 

Seacrest also acknowledged that he's relieved he and White are comfortable enough with each other that they can ad-lib during the show, telling the outlet, “”We don't often know what we're going to say at the end of the show. It's 3-2-1 go! For me, that makes it fun and I think we get genuine laughter out of each other. We got to this stage, where at times we can read each other's minds.”

In April, White told TV Insider that she felt Seacrest came into the show with the best attitude, knowing he could never truly replace Sajak. 

“Ryan did his homework,” White she said. “He rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed. He also said to me, ‘I am not replacing Pat Sajak because no one could – ever. I am just stepping in.' That made me feel good because, as Ryan said, he's just stepping in – he's not trying to prove anything.” 

Seacrest and White will both return for season 43 of “Wheel of Fortune,” likely to start filming this summer. And although his return is not official, Seacrest is expected to host his 24th season of “American Idol” in early 2026.

Luca Guadagnino has added another project to his always-packed slate. IndieWire can confirm that Guadagnino is attached to direct “Artificial,” a comedic film set in the world of AI, for Amazon MGM. 

While plot details and cast info have been kept under wraps, The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline have reported that the film is set at OpenAI and follows the tumultuous period in 2023 in which founder Sam Altman was ousted before immediately returning to the company. Those outlets have also reported that Andrew Garfield and “Anora” star Yuri Borisov are circling roles in the project. 

 










Whether “Artificial” ends up being a literal take on the Altman saga or a fictional project that takes inspiration from it, the lucrative world of AI startups should offer Guadagnino plenty of material to work with. As virtually every industry on the planet prepares to be disrupted by AI in some capacity, companies are racing to find the products that will place them ahead of their competitors, which has created a gold rush for entrepreneurs developing those products.

But no AI company has been subject to more scrutiny or palace intrigue than OpenAI. Founded as a nonprofit in 2015 by a team of tech executives including Altman and Elon Musk, it was originally intended as an open source company that shared all of its research and technology with the public. But as the company developed potentially lucrative properties like ChatGPT, it transitioned to a for profit endeavor in 2019, prompting some founders (including Musk) to leave over a disagreement about the company's vision.

The transition created a highly complicated corporate structure in which the OpenAI board of directors controls a nonprofit foundation that controls the for-profit entity, in which Microsoft also owns a minority stake. That structure laid the foundation for Altman to be pushed out as CEO by the board in November 2023, only to be re-hired three days later after a massive employee mutiny that saw many OpenAI workers threaten to leave for equivalent positions at Microsoft. 

In addition to “Artificial,” Guadagnino is currently attached to direct a reimagining of “American Psycho” for Lionsgate. And while his DC Comics film “Sgt. Rock” was recently placed on hold, his next film, the campus thriller “After the Hunt,” opens in October.

Kurier, the Austrian newspaper that last week published an interview with Clint Eastwood that the director and actor on Monday called “entirely phony,” has retracted the article and said it will no longer work with the author of the piece.

The author, Elisabeth Sereda, is a freelance entertainment journalist for Kurier and was a member of the now-dissolved Hollywood Foreign Press Association. She is also currently a voter for the Golden Globes (the Golden Globes are co-owned by PMC, which is the parent company of IndieWire), though she is not a Golden Globes employee. In written remarks to IndieWire, Sereda explained that the quotes from Eastwood, while factual, were all compiled as part of a “Best Of” story for the occasion of his 95th birthday.

Sereda said the quotes were drawn from 14 different interviews Eastwood gave to the HFPA as part of various panel discussions with HFPA members, and for which Sereda has spoken to Eastwood several times over the years. Transcripts of those interviews historically have been free to be used by HFPA members in articles, and Sereda said that while Eastwood may not have heard of Kurier, “he is certainly familiar with the HFPA — having given more than 20 interviews to the group dating back to 1976.”

 










However, the original article was presented as though it were a fresh conversation given for his 95th birthday. Kurier on Tuesday replaced the link to the original article with a statement from the editor, explaining that it had no reason to doubt Sereda had spoken with Eastwood and that the article was formatted “as an interview, not a portrait,” ultimately agreeing that the article didn't meet Kurier's standards. 

“According to Sereda, she wrote the current article based on these conversations. This means that all of Eastwood's statements were made exactly as they were, and this is documented. Using multiple interviews for a birthday portrait is common practice,” the Kurier statement reads (translated via Google). “The article was formatted as an interview, not a portrait. This was intended to create the impression that it was a new interview. The fact that this wasn't the case is not in keeping with the quality standards the Kurier maintains.”

The original Kurier article written by Sereda quoted Eastwood as saying “I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote movies like ‘Casablanca' in small bungalows on the studio lot,” and that “we live in an era of remakes and franchises.” The article also suggested that Eastwood told the publication he was in pre-production on another movie. Sereda told IndieWire the mention of him directing another movie is based on her research via IMDB Pro, which lists an upcoming project of his as “in development,” and “the project is never mentioned in a direct quote, only in the intro to the article.”

 










Kurier's statement concludes saying it will no longer work with Sereda “because transparency and our strict editorial standards are paramount to us.”

Sereda disputed the publication's explanation slightly, saying she “was asked” by Kurier to write a “Best of” compilation with prior quotes she had done. She also added that she was a freelance contributor, not an employee of Kurier, and over the past six months has “phased out her contributions” following the publication of her recent historical fiction novel. 

A rep for the Golden Globes said that Sereda is not an employee of the awards body and clarifies that the HFPA has not been affiliated with the Globes since 2023 when it was dissolved after being acquired by Penske Media and Dick Clark Productions.

All is fair in love and war, but what if you're at war with the one you love? First time director Josalynn Smith‘s debut “Ride or Die” challenges the idealization of a long-festering crush with a queer thriller twist. Jamie Foxx‘s Foxxhole Productions produces the feature, which will premiere at Tribeca in the U.S. Narrative Competition.

“Ride or Die” centers on Paula (Briana Middleton), who is unexpectedly reunited with her not-quite-ex Sloane (Stella Everett). Together, they decide to drive across the country to start a new life…but little do they know there is a darkness on the horizon. The below clip hints at some of the turmoil the duo will endure.

 








Related Stories Pedro Pascal Is Now Such a Massive Star, He's Narrating Actual Planetarium Films Sean Baker Says His First Movie After ‘Anora' Will Be ‘100 Percent Independent': ‘Don't Expect a Marvel Film' 

The synopsis reads: “When Paula (Middleton), a young Midwesterner who dreams of a fresh start in California, runs into Sloane (Everett), her secret high school crush, who has her demons, the chemistry is electric. What starts as a casual reunion between two high school classmates quickly evolves into something deeper when they make a spontaneous decision to road-trip across the country together. However, unforeseen consequences make their journey more perilous, transforming their whirlwind romance into a tense thriller.” 

 










Cody Kostro, Eisa Davis, Guinevere Turner, and Ella Jay Basco also star.

Foxx told IndieWire that writer/director Smith is already a force. “Josalynn Smith is an exciting new voice in film, and we are proud to be a part of her feature debut,” Foxx and fellow Foxxhole Productions producer Datari Turner said in a statement. “We can't wait for audiences to see the film.”

Smith, Foxx, Turner, and Matthew Keene Smith all produce the film, with Keely Weiss, Lois Drabkin, Jason McLagan, and Alicia Louzoun-Heisler co-producing. The cinematographer is Lee Muller. 

Foxx recently made his return to the screen with the 2024 film “Back in Action.” Foxx reunited with his “Annie” and “Any Given Sunday” co-star Cameron Diaz for the action-comedy. Foxx and Turner also executive produced. “Back in Action” was a turning point for both lead stars: Diaz had announced her retirement in 2018 and had not appeared onscreen since “Annie” in 2014 with Foxx. Production on the Netflix feature “Back in Action” was paused when Foxx suffered from a medical complication in April 2023; Foxx later said that he went “to hell and back” with his health at the time.

“Ride or Die” premieres at June 8 at the Tribeca Festival as a sales title from CAA. Check out the first look clip from the film below.

Sofia Alvarez, best known for tackling 'To All the Boys I've Loved Before,' will pen the script adapting the Rebecca Ross best-seller.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Following a highly competitive, multi-studio bidding war, Paramount Pictures has acquired the rights to fantasy romance novel Divine Rivals, the first novel in the bestselling Letters of Enchantment series by Rebecca Ross. 


	The studio has set Sofia Alvarez, best known for writing the adaptation of Netflix's To All the Boys I've Loved Before, to pen the script. Lorenzo di Bonaventura is producing under his first-look deal with the studio, as well as Pouya Shahbazian, a player in the book-to-screen world whose credits include the Divergent movie series.

	The story is set in the shadow of an ancient war between dueling gods and tells of a pair of young rival journalists that fall in love while writing each other anonymous letters on an enchanted typewriter. The story has influences of You've Got Mail, World War One, and magic.  




			Popular on THR		







Rivals captured the attention of BookTok, where passionate fan engagement and viral content helped propel the novel to breakout success across social platforms. 


	The Letters of Enchantment series has spent more 125 weeks on The New York Times bestsellers list and were a Goodreads Choice Awards winner. The books have sold over one million copies, per the publisher. Ross, who is known for her YA fantasy works, has had her books translated into 27 languages.


	The author, who has Rivals prequel Wild Reverence hitting shelves Sept. 2, will act as an executive producer on the project.

	











	Alvarez wrote two of the popular To All the Boys movies for Netflix, adapting the novels by Jenny Han. She made her directorial debut with Netflix's Along for the Ride, an adaptation of the novel by Sarah Dessen, which she also co-wrote. Alvarez is also a playwright, penning a musical adaptation of William Steig's classic children's book Amos & Boris, which premiered at South Coast Rep in 2018, among her works.


	Ross is repped by Suzie Townsend and New Leaf Literary & Media. The latter also repped the film and TV rights on her behalf. Alvarez is repped by UTA and Jackoway Austen.

The ruling follows a dispute over whether the actress has to turn over medical records. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



Blake Lively is no longer pursuing claims for emotional distress in her lawsuit against It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni. 


	The move comes after the judge overseeing the case on Tuesday turned down the actress' bid to refile the claim at a later stage if she chooses to abandon them.




	Lively's motion is “denied based on [her] representation that the relevant claims will be withdrawn,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in an order issued on Tuesday.


	In a statement, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, lawyers for Lively, said their client is dropping certain claims because “they are no longer necessary” and that she will “continue to pursue emotional distress damages through other claims in her lawsuit,” including sexual harassment and retaliation. They added that the “Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive damages under California law.”

	On Friday, Lively voluntarily agreed to withdraw her claim for infliction of emotional distress, with the aim of streamlining the litigation. She moved to drop the claim “without prejudice,” meaning she can refile it down the road.


	Baldoni challenged the move, arguing that Lively's lawyers should be forced to completely abandon the claim. He stressed that the actress is refusing to turn over her medical records, preventing him from disputing arguments that his alleged misconduct caused her emotional harm.


	Tuesday's order forecloses the possibility of Lively refiling emotional distress claims and providing her medical records unless Baldoni allows her to do so. 

	











	The actress can also file a formal motion for the court to dismiss the claims without prejudice, which the court will assess if she chooses to go down that path. If she chooses to proceed with those claims, she won't be able to present evidence of emotional distress.


	A spokesperson for Baldoni declined to comment.

The track will follow February's Short n' Sweet deluxe edition.

	Hannah Dailey



Sabrina Carpenter topped a lot of people's song of the summer lists with “Espresso” in 2024, and now, she's gunning to do it for the second year in a row. After a day of teasing that she had a new project in the works, the pop star has announced that she has a new song titled “Manchild” on the way.

	











	Breaking the news to fans on social media, Carpenter shared the track's cover art — a grainy photo of the singer sticking up her thumb on the side of the road, hitchhiking in a white button-down tied up to show off her stomach — and revealed that “Manchild” will drop at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday (June 5). “this one's about you!!” she wrote in her caption, adding that a 7-inch vinyl for the single is now available to order.


	The announcement comes shortly after fans noticed that a number of mysterious billboards had gone up beside Interstate 69 displaying messages such as “Amen” and “Hey men!” One of them read, “I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Before that, the Grammy winner also shared a teaser video of herself trying — and failing — to hitchhike. The clip finds her wearing the same outfit she sports on the “Manchild” artwork, and ends with her saying in a voice-over, “Oh boy.”


	The new track will follow a whirlwind year of success for Carpenter, who earned her first top 10 hit last summer with “Espresso.” The song eventually reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 2024, setting the stage for album Short n' Sweet to become the Girl Meets World alum's first-ever No. 1 LP on the Billboard 200. 

	











	“Manchild” will also mark the first new music from Carpenter since she dropped the deluxe edition of Short n' Sweet in February, adding bonus tracks “15 Minutes,” “Couldn't Make It Any Harder,” “Busy Woman” and “Bad Reviews.” She's currently on a short break from her Short n' Sweet Tour, which kicked off with a North American leg in the fall followed by a slew of European dates this spring.

Sean Baker isn't looking to follow his fellow Academy Award-winning directors Chloe Zhao and Barry Jenkins and swap indie films for big IPs. Instead, the “Anora” writer/director is determined to stay “100 percent independent” and outside of the studio system. 

Baker said during THR's “It Happened in Hollywood” podcast that he most likely will never sell out for a franchise blockbuster. “Don't expect a Marvel film,” he said. “It's not going to happen. I'm intentionally going to stay in the same wheelhouse and with the approximate same budget. I think that I enjoy working in this space of 100 percent independent.”

Baker teased that while he's “not sure yet” about his next project after “Anora” (“I'm still exploring some ideas”), he knows he will have to have full autonomy of the production no matter what. “I'm not working for even a mini studio. I'm making my film independently and then going the old school route of hopefully a bidding war or somebody licensing the movie,” he said. “I think that's the only way to have full autonomy and control over your vision. So it'll be that. Expect more of the same.”

“Anora” won five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Baker made Oscars history by earning four Academy Awards himself for aforementioned Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing. Mikey Madison also won for Best Actress. 

Like Baker, Madison made it clear that she was looking to stay in the indie space. She was rumored to have turned down “Star Wars: Starfighter,” the Shawn Levy-directed franchise installment with Ryan Gosling in the lead. Madison also was believed to be in talks for Luca Guadagnino's now-shelved DC Studios Film “Sgt. Rock.” The actress has voiced her desire to collaborate with prolific auteur Guadagnino soon.

Madison later announced that her first project post-“Anora” will be Alejandro Landes Echavarría's “Reptilia.” The feature is billed as being about “a dental hygienist who is seduced by a mysterious mermaid into the dark and wet underworld of Florida's exotic animal trade.” Kirsten Dunst co-stars, and Barry Jenkins' Pastel produces. Principal photography is expected to begin in fall 2025.

Andrew Garfield, "A Complete Unknown" scene-stealer Monica Barbaro, and "Anora" actor Yura Borisov are circling lead roles in the story of Sam Altman's firing and rehiring. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	With DC's Sgt. Rock no longer on his schedule, Luca Guadagnino has now lined up a brand-new movie project to direct.


	Guadagnino is in talks to direct Artificial, a recounting of the tumultuous period at artificial intelligence company OpenAI in 2023 that saw CEO Sam Altman fired and rehired in a matter of days.




	Heyday Films' David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford are producing the feature that is being put together at lightning speed at Amazon MGM Studios. Simon Rich wrote the script and will also produce, with Jennifer Fox also in talks to produce.

	How fast is this moving? Sources say Amazon is looking to get production going this summer, with an eye to shoot in San Francisco and Italy.

	Actors are being lined up, although no deals are made and much is contingent on Guadagnino's deal being closed. Andrew Garfield, A Complete Unknown scene-stealer Monica Barbaro, and Anora actor Yura Borisov are among those said to be circling.  


	Altman co-founded OpenAI, but in the fall of 2023, after mounting safety concerns regarding AI, and reports of abusive behavior, was ousted as the head of the company by his board. Five days later, after a revolt, he was reinstated. Sources say that if all goes as planned, Garfield would play Altman, Barbaro would play chief technology office Mira Murati, and Borisov would play Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder who led the movement to get rid of Altman.


Artificial will unite Guadagnino and Amazon MGM for the third time. He directed After the Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield, and Ayo Edebiri, which the studio is releasing in theaters Oct. 10. He also directed Challengers, starring Zendaya, which the studio released theatrically last year.

	











	Luca had been previously on track to shoot Rock, a World War Two action movie that would have starred Colin Farrell, for DC. That project had been eying a late summer start of production before DC reconsidered its plans, citing “daylight issues.” Now, ironically, Guadagnino's new project will likely begin before Rock's original start.

	After his DC Studios pic Sgt. Rock got pushed a full year, Luca Guadagnino has moved fast to find his next movie. The director in talks to helm Artificial at Amazon MGM Studios. While deals are still not closed, he looks to have found a strong ensemble as insiders say Andrew Garfield, Monica Barbaro and Anora breakout Yura Borisov are in early talks to star.


	While not confirmed, sources say the film revolves around the period at the artificial intelligence company OpenAI in 2023 that saw CEO Sam Altman fired and rehired in a matter of days. Simon Rich wrote the script and will produce alongside Heyday Films' David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford. Jennifer Fox is also in talks to produce.

	Guadagnino is someone who always likes to work and was getting ready to shoot Sgt. Rock later this summer with Colin Farrell set to star. When the film had to push a full year, Guadagnino moved quickly to find something he could get up and running this year and mulled several options before landing on Artificial.


			Watch on Deadline		







	While technically the film is in development until everyone has a closed deal, the idea would be to shoot this year once those deals have closed.


	The film reunites Guadagnino and Amazon MGM Studios. He directed After the Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which the studio is releasing in theaters October 10, and Challengers, starring Zendaya, which the studio released theatrically last year.


	Heyman is also already in business with the studio as he gears up to produce the next James Bond film alongside Amy Pascal. Additionally, he produced all eight film adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, as well as the three Fantastic Beasts films.

	











	Guadagnino is repped by CAA and Range Media Partners, Garfield is repped by CAA, Barbaro is repped by UTA and Range, and Borisov is repped by UTA and ColorCreative.

	The trial over Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's bitter dispute on what really happened on It Ends With Us and in the aftermath of the Sony released film doesn't start until March next year, but sometimes justice picks up the pace in the slow moving and sprawling multi-million dollar battle.


	As both sides took to the court docket and the media Monday to fight over how Lively would or would not withdraw her intentional emotional distress claims from her New Year's Eve filed suit against Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, execs and publicists, the judge shut the whole thing down Tuesday lickety-split with a rebuke of Lively's side.

	“The motion to compel at …is denied based on Plaintiff's representation that the relevant claims will be withdrawn,” wrote Judge Lewis J, Liman this morning in a fairly brisk order.


			Watch on Deadline		







	“Lively's request that ‘because the parties have agreed to dismiss Ms. Lively's tenth and eleventh causes of action… the Court exercise its inherent authority and authority under Rule 15 to dismiss them without prejudice' is denied without prejudice to renewal,” the NYC-based federal official (and brother of director Doug Liman) added. “The parties shall stipulate to whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice, or Lively shall renew her request by formal motion.”


	As a kicker, a day after Lively's lawyers exclaimed their client in not completely abandoning her emotional distress claims, Judge Liman made where he sits on all this perfectly clear: “For avoidance of doubt, if the claims are not dismissed, the Court will preclude Lively from offering any evidence of emotional distress. SO ORDERED”

	











	After all the hoopla of yesterday's letters to the judge and weekend email exchanges between attorneys for Lively and Baldoni, lawyers and representatives for the latter were mum Tuesday, offering a telling “no comment” on Judge Liman's move in their favor. For Lively, who now has no window to shift strategy and release her requested medical and therapy records, there was a sidestepping of her loss and a repeat of what her team put out on Monday. 


	“The court denied Wayfarer's motion,” said Lively lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb in a statement Tuesday. “He told the parties to continue their discussions about the technicalities of how 2 of the 15 claims will be voluntarily dismissed. Ms. Lively has offered to dismiss those claims because they are no longer necessary, and she will continue to pursue emotional distress damages through other claims in her lawsuit, including sexual harassment and retaliation. In addition, the Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive damages under California law. This is exactly where both parties were before the Baldoni-Wayfarer Parties rushed to file this utterly pointless motion to compel, all searching for yet another press moment.”


	With whispers of all not being well on the domestic violence themed IEWU, even though the pic scored at the box office, and press tour and premiere snubs, this all went public and wide when Lively on December 20 filed her sexual harassment and retaliation complaint against Baldoni and his inner circle with California's Civil Rights Department. A formal suit by her followed on December 31 with a $400 million defamation and extorsion action from the Jane the Virgin actor against Lively, her hubby Ryan Reynolds and their PR team was not long behind.


	In the months since, the case has ballooned to around half a dozen lawsuits, everyone trying to get dismissed from the cases and the likes of Taylor Swift, Disney, Marvel, the New York Times and others getting dragged in.


	Sources on both sides have repeatedly and vehemently insisted to Deadline and the courts that there is no chance of a settlement now, with the high profile Lively and Reynolds hauled way out of their carefully created comfort zone and WME-dumped Baldoni's career now dead in the water in Hollywood.


	The trial is set to start in NYC on March 9, 2026 in the same courthouse where the Sean “Diddy” Combs sex-trafficking trial is taking place right now.

EXCLUSIVE: Here's a pairing you might not have seen coming.


	In a highly competitive situation, involving offers from both studios and streamers, Netflix has landed the pitch for a two-hander action comedy to star A Minecraft Movie‘s Jason Momoa and SNL alum Andy Samberg.


	We hear the currently untitled film is set in Momoa's native Hawaii, though further details as to the plot are under wraps. Samberg's Party Over Here and Momoa's On The Roam will produce. The script will be written by a pair of highly decorated SNL alums: 11x Emmy nominee Rob Klein and eight-time nominee John Solomon. No word yet on who will direct.

	











	Momoa is riding high on the success of A Minecraft Movie, the Warner Bros/Legendary film which secured the biggest opening ever for a video game adaptation, breathing life into the global box office with a worldwide gross exceeding $948 million. Highly in demand as ever, his upcoming slate includes Amazon's action comedy The Wrecking Crew, where he stars opposite Dave Bautista, as well as Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, where he fulfills his longtime ambition to play intergalactic alien Lobo. On August 1, he unveils Chief of War, the Apple historical epic he co-created with Thomas Pa'a Sibbett, in which he also stars. Then, there's Animal Friends, a live-action/animated road trip action comedy, where he stars alongside Ryan Reynolds, Aubrey Plaza, and Vince Vaughn. We were first to report on the Warner Bros/Legendary title, which opens October 10. Next up, Momoa will reprise his role as Duncan Idaho in Dune 3, which rolls cameras in July.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	An Emmy and Golden Globe winner, Samberg will next be seen starring alongside Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch in Jay Roach's The Roses, a remake of the classic 1989 dark comedy The War of the Roses that Searchlight releases August 29. This past fall, he returned to Studio 8H for SNL‘s 50th season, portraying Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff opposite Maya Rudolph's Kamala Harris. He also starred in three new The Lonely Island digital shorts, and performed alongside Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny and Eddie Vedder in a musical medley for SNL50: The Homecoming Concert. He starred opposite Kate Winslet in the recent war correspondent drama Lee and launched a new podcast with Seth Meyers, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, The Lonely Island & Seth Meyers Podcast, last spring.


	Momoa is represented by WME and Edelstein, Laird & Sobel; Samberg by UTA and Johson, Shapiro, Slewett & Kole; Klein by CAA and Myman Greenspan Fox; and Solomon by UTA and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.

The superstar wants an appellate court to overturn a ruling last year that allowed the blockbuster harassment lawsuit from her backup dancers to move forward.

Lizzo is launching an appeal aimed at ending a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by her former backup dancers, calling it an “attack” on her “First Amendment right to perform her music and advocate for body positivity.”


	The blockbuster case, filed in 2023, accuses the star (Melissa Jefferson) of sexual harassment and discrimination. Though a judge dismissed some claims last year – including a headline-grabbing claim about fat-shaming – he allowed the overall lawsuit to move ahead toward a jury trial.

	In an opening brief filed last month, her attorneys urged an appeals court overturn that ruling and toss out the entire case. They say Lizzo's behavior toward the dancers was clearly part of her artistic approach — and thus shielded by constitutional protections for free speech.

	“Plaintiffs' suit [is] an attack on Lizzo's First Amendment right to perform her music and advocate for body positivity,” writes Lizzo's attorneys, who include prominent Hollywood defense attorney Marty Singer. “Rather than accept personal accountability, plaintiffs filed this shotgun action, taking aim at nearly every facet of Lizzo's creative process.”


	One key claim in the case against Lizzo is that she pushed the dancers to attend a sex show in Amsterdam's Red Light District at a venue called Bananenbar, then pressured them to touch and engage with nude performers. But her lawyers say that incident – which they stress was entirely optional — was directly tied to the creation of her art and thus cannot form the basis of legal liablity.


	“There's no disagreement that Lizzo held these outings as a necessary part of her creative process,” Singer writes. “Early social gatherings during international tours (like the Bananenbar) are critical to teambuilding and fostering cohesion.”


	The case against Lizzo, filed by Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez, accused the singer and her Big Grrrl Big Touring Inc. of creating a hostile work environment via sexual harassment, religious and racial discrimination. It also accused her of disability discrimination based on weight-shaming – a loaded allegation against a star who had made body positivity a key part of her personal brand.


	Lizzo quickly denied any wrongdoing, calling the claims “false” and “sensationalized” and vowing to fight back: “I am very open with my sexuality and expressing myself but I cannot accept or allow people to use that openness to make me out to be something I am not.”


	The star's legal defense centered on California's so-called anti-SLAPP law — a special statute that makes it easier to quickly end lawsuits that threaten free speech. In seeking to dismiss the case under that law, Lizzo's lawyers argued the dancers wanted to “silence” Lizzo and “weaponize” her creative expression against her.


	In early 2024, Judge Mark H. Epstein partly endorsed that argument and tossed out several allegations, including the discrimination claims about fat-shaming. But he allowed numerous accusations to move ahead toward a potential trial, including those over the Amsterdam sex show.


	“It is dangerous for the court to weigh in, ham-fisted, into constitutionally protected activity,” the judge wrote. “But it is equally dangerous to turn a blind eye to allegations of discrimination or other forms of misconduct merely because they take place in a speech-related environment.”


	In appealing that ruling, Lizzo's lawyers argue that it's dangerous for judges to wade into an artist's creative process. They cite earlier court rulings that say such work includes discussion of “many bizarre and potentially offensive ideas” and can be “unpredictable.”


	“Judges must not dissect the creative process to determine what was necessary to achieve the final product and what was not,” Lizzo's lawyers write. “By rejecting the artist's proven experience for what is necessary to, and best enhances, her own art, the trial court stepped far outside its role.”


	In a response statement to Billboard, Ron Zambrano — lead counsel for Davis, Williams and Rodriguez — said he and his clients “stand by the claims in the lawsuit and look forward to proving everything in court.”


	“Lizzo has been trying and failing repeatedly to get this case dismissed because she does not want to face a jury of her peers explaining how she created such an egregious and unlawful work environment for our clients,” Zambrano said.


	Attorneys for the plaintiffs will file their own appellate brief later this month aimed at rebutting Lizzo's arguments. The two sides will then argue the case before the court at some point in the coming months. If the appeals court sides with Lizzo, the case will be dismissed. If the court sides with Davis, Williams and Rodriguez, the case will return to Epstein's court and move toward an eventual jury trial.

Neil Young is a little over two weeks away from the launch of his Love Earth world tour. And in a new post on the Neil Young Archives, he's inviting longtime fan Donald Trump to come and check it out.


	“When I tour the USA this summer, if there is not martial law by then which would make it impossible, let's all come together and stand for American values,” he wrote. “We will not be doing a political show. We will be playing the music we love for all of us to enjoy together. President Trump, you are invited. Come and hear our music just as you did for decades.”


	He's alluding to the fact that Trump is a longtime fan of his work. Rolling Stone even rang up Trump in 2008 to discuss his fandom after noticing him at several New York shows, including the front row of a CSNY concert at the Theater at MSG where he was seated next to Patti Smith and Salman Rushdie.


	“He's got something very special,” Trump said. “He's performed for me at my casinos over the years, and he just brings it down. I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	He couldn't, however, name any of his songs when pressed. “It's sort of all favorite,” he says. “I like the older stuff better, which is typical with a lot of artists — hence the famous Ricky Nelson song ‘Garden Party.' I like all his songs, you know, ‘Rock and Roll' — just great stuff.”


	Trump and Young met up at Trump Tower a little over ten years ago when the singer was looking for investors for his Pono music service. But their relationship soured once Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency, and began blasting “Rockin' In The Free World” at his events.

	











	“You are a disgrace to my country,” Young wrote in a long, scathing letter to Trump on his website. “Your mindless destruction of our shared natural resources, our environment, and our relationships with friends around the world is unforgivable.… Our first black president was a better man than you are…Every time ‘Rockin' in the Free World' or one of my songs is played at your rallies, I hope you hear my voice. Remember it is the voice of a tax-paying U.S. citizen who does not support you. Me.”

	Last month, Young reacted to Trump's vicious campaign against Bruce Springsteen. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America,” he wrote. “You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That's your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce. You know how I feel.”


	In this new post, where Young invites Trump to his shows, he strikes a somewhat softer tone. “Bruce Springsteen and many others will be in our country this summer, there for you,” he writes, “playing our favorite music, songs like ‘Born in the USA.' We are proud of who we are, and must never let our government forget it.”

After Pusha T refused to change a guest verse from Kendrick Lamar on the upcoming Clipse album, he bought his way out of his record deal, manager Victor explains.

	Elias Leight



Early in 2024, Clipse prepared to play a new album for their label, Def Jam. While these types of playbacks can be routine, this one was freighted with extra significance: The rap duo composed of brothers Pusha T and Malice had not released an album together since 2009.


	Their comeback soon hit a speed bump. One song on the new album featured a guest verse from Kendrick Lamar, who spent part of 2024 in a venomous back-and-forth with Drake. And, as Pusha T recently told GQ, Lamar's presence on the Clipse track made Def Jam's parent company, Universal Music Group, uncomfortable. 


	“They wanted me to ask Kendrick to censor his verse, which of course I was never doing,” Pusha T told the publication. “And then they wanted me to take the record off [the album].” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Clipse refused to make the requested changes, leading to the unravelling of Pusha T's association with Def Jam — his label home for over a decade. Even though the rapper still owed Def Jam albums, he paid a seven-figure sum to get out of the deal, according to longtime manager Steven Victor. “If you're an artist, your whole life is to create art and put it out,” Victor says. “If someone's telling you that you can't do that, or you have to do it within the confines of whatever box they put you in, that's like creative jail.” (Reps for Universal Music and Def Jam did not respond to requests for comment.)


	Pusha T has his own antagonistic history with Drake, which culminated in the scathing 2018 diss record “The Story of Adidon”; Victor says Pusha T's verses have been facing strict label scrutiny ever since. Meanwhile, the fallout from Lamar's battle with Drake is still ongoing: The latter has sued Universal Music Group, accusing the company of defamation over Lamar's track “Not Like Us.”


	Victor spoke with Billboard about the end of Pusha T's relationship with Def Jam, and finding a new home for the rapper — and the Clipse album — at Roc Nation. 


When you started to hear objections to the Lamar verse on the Clipse album, where were they coming from?


	UMG has this department where they review lyrics. So it was that department. The real reason [that department] is there is to protect the artists and the label from lawsuits for copyright infringement. They do it for all the labels. Some labels adhere to it closer than others.


	Let's say you interpolate somebody else's song. [That department] is there to make sure that the song is properly cleared. It's not meant to be like, “You said XYZ about XYZ artist, so we're not going to release this music.” 


While you've been working with Pusha, have you ever had challenges with that department before?


	In the beginning, no. But starting in 2018, yeah.


That's the year Pusha released “The Story of Adidon.” He put that on SoundCloud, and it's never been officially released on streaming services. Was that a way of getting around any internal objections?


	Part of the reason, yeah, to avoid that. [Also] we never actually properly cleared it. 


Pusha T mentioned two songs in his interview with GQ, Rick Ross' “Maybach Music VI” and Pop Smoke's “Paranoia,” where his verses were ultimately cut. Was that because of the same department's scrutiny?


	Yes. What happened on the Pop Smoke song is that UMG thought that he was dissing Drake on that song. He wasn't, but they thought he was. Pop Smoke was released on my label [Victor Victor], and obviously I managed Pusha. So they came to me and said, “We're not going to put this out now, unless you get Pusha to change these lyrics.” Even though it has nothing to do with Pop Smoke, they're like, “Either he changes these lyrics, or we're not putting the album out.” 


	What happened to freedom of speech? First of all, he's not dissing Drake. But how do you get to tell him to just change his lyrics or you're not putting this album out?


From what Pusha told GQ, this Kendrick verse they're concerned about on the new record is not dissing Drake, either.


	Yeah, I don't know what their concern is. But they were like, “There's a line here; we think it's controversial; [Kendrick] needs to change it, or we're not putting it out.” We're not going to ask him to change the verse. You guys are wrong. Stop looking at this this way. None of this makes any sense. 


	It got to the point where the conversation became, “You can't keep stopping this guy from being able to put out his art.” He's a rapper. Every time he puts out an album or a song, you can't listen to it to make sure that he's not dissing somebody before you put it out. He has to think about what he's saying before he's saying it in the hopes that you might not think that he's saying the wrong thing? Who could live their life like that?


	I went to them and I said, “Let us put the song out somewhere else since you guys have an issue with it. You guys won't have to stand behind whatever complications come from it. We'll put the song out somewhere else, and we'll license it back to you guys when the album comes out.” Their response was, “How about you just find somewhere else to put out Clipse? Just pay something to us and put it out somewhere else.” 


	My thing was, we can't do that — Pusha and the Clipse are one thing. [At this point], he clearly doesn't trust you guys. You guys haven't been good stewards of his career. 


	So they said, “Find another deal, and let's figure out a business.” They didn't drop us. They were like, “Pay us this money” — which was an exorbitant amount of money, a s—t ton of money — “and we'll let you out the deal.” That's what happened. We paid them the money, an insane amount of money. It wasn't, like, $200,000. It was a lot of money for an artist to come up with. They bought themselves out of the deal.


How many solo albums did Pusha have left on his deal with Def Jam? 


	I don't really want to talk about that part. He had like three albums left. 


So you had to pay seven figures to get out of the deal?


	Yeah. 


How quickly were you able to get another deal in place?


	It happened simultaneously [with getting out of the previous deal]. It took a couple of weeks for us to figure out the paperwork. Again, it was a lot of money — we kept on going back and saying, “Can we pay you this amount of money and a part of the profit? Can we figure out a deal where we pay you as the guys make money from the new release, instead of coming up with this large sum of money [right now]?” They said no. They were like, “We want our money, and we want some of the profits.” 


	Once I knew that we had, in principle, a deal in place with Def Jam [to leave], I got on the phone with Jay-Z. I was like, “Look, this is what's happening. We've been talking about doing X, Y, Z, together. There's an opportunity here to do this album. What do you think?” 


	He hit me back right away, like, “You just made my day. Let's figure it out. What do we need to get it done?” I went back to Pusha, and said, “Listen, Jay's gonna give us a very artist-friendly deal, we get to own the masters, and they'll put the marketing power of Roc Nation behind it. You guys are friends. It's a great outcome.” We worked out the deal in less than 24 hours. 


You had to pay Def Jam a lump sum to get out and also give a cut of what you make off the new record?


	Yeah, we had to give them a cut also, which is insane. But the good thing about it is that Pusha is in control of his future. Now he has three deals in three different places. At the beginning of his solo career, we put out records independently with Mass Appeal; he owns those records. Then we did the deal with G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam; when Kanye left Def Jam, we worked out an agreement with him where he gave Pusha his masters back on the G.O.O.D. Music side. And now we did this deal with Jay. 


	Pusha is having way more success creatively, financially and professionally, than he did at the peak of his career, which was when [Clipse's] “Grindin'” came out. Smart and steady wins the race. 


What appeals to you about taking the independent route?


	I still think there's a place for major record labels. But if you can get away with being at a place that understands the culture that you're in a lot more, moves more nimbly, and you can get the same resources that you would from a major, why would you go to a major, especially with the way the deals are structured? 


	You can get everything and more from somebody that not only looks like you, but behaves like you, has the same mindset as you. You're not dealing with layers and layers of corporate bureaucracy and nonsense. And all artists are not treated equally in the major record label system.


One thing you still hear about the majors is that, to the extent that radio matters, they have the muscle there, and they also have an international presence that's hard to replicate.


	Cap. I call cap. I've done it on a smaller scale and on the larger scale. All you need is a team. You can hire and you can outsource a great international team, a great radio team. For some artists it's definitely more beneficial to be part of a major record label. But you don't need to be on a major record label to find success. 


Obviously Pusha T and Def Jam had a long relationship. Is it tough to see it end this way?


	Pusha has been signed to Def Jam for almost 15 years. We've been there for a long time; we've seen different regimes come and go. But at the end of the day, if a relationship is not working, for whatever reason, it doesn't make any sense to stay there, regardless of how much you might like it or might feel comfortable. And I don't know if the amount of attention, focus and detail that we were looking for [on this album rollout] would have happened there anyway. 


Is this the start of a potentially closer relationship between Victor Victor and Roc Nation?


	I'd say so. There's a lot going on, a lot of moving parts. But the focus right now is definitely this Clipse album.

Parks and Recreation ended more than a decade ago, but its seven seasons left behind countless meme formats to be recycled in perpetuity. Still, members of the cast are protective of how their most memorable scenes are repurposed online. Nick Offerman recently came to the defense of his stoic character Ron Swanson after Michael Flynn Jr., son of Donald Trump's former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, shared a homophobic post on X using a Parks and Recreation meme.


	“Just wanted to post how I feel about ‘pride' month,” Flynn captioned a GIF that edited a Pride flag over the computer Swanson tossed into a dumpster in the Season Four episode “The Trial of Leslie Knope.” He replied to his own post doubling down on his rage bait, writing: “I love how triggered the ABC Mafia crowd is by this meme.”

Ron was best man at a gay wedding you dumb fuck. #HappyPride https://t.co/mSlELkUvDY


	Offerman took the post as an opportunity to set the record straight about Swanson, who would have never agreed with Flynn using him to boost homophobia. “Ron was best man at a gay wedding you dumb fuck,” the actor wrote in response. After making the reference to “One Last Ride,” Parks and Recreation's series finale where Ron joins his hairdresser's wedding, he added: “#Happy Pride.”

	











	Offerman recently portrayed a queer character in The Last of Us. His character Bill shaped a romance plot line with Murray Bartlett's Frank. “Thanks to HBO for having the guts to participate in this storytelling tradition that is truly independent,” Offerman said at the 2024 Independent Spirit Awards. “Stories with guts that when homophobic hate comes my way and says, ‘Why did you have to make it a gay story?' We say, ‘Because you ask questions like that. It's not a gay story, it's a love story, you asshole!'”

Michael B. Jordan may have a decade-long creative partnership with Ryan Coogler, but it's another one of Jordan's past directors who has influenced his relationship to fans the most: Denzel Washington.  

Washington directed Jordan in 2021 film “A Journal for Jordan.” According to “Sinners” actor Jordan, Washington imparted wisdom about how to navigate fame in the social media era. Washington advised Jordan to stay offline as a way to entice audiences to go to theaters, telling Jordan, “Why would they pay to see you on a weekend if they see you all week for free?”

 










Jordan told Vulture the story, adding that between his hectic shooting schedule — Jordan is set to direct, produce, and star in “The Thomas Crown Affair” remake as well as “I Am Legend 2” — he hasn't “really been out in the world” anyway.

Jordan did, however, anticipate his own personal desire to document his life: The star hired a videographer in 2018 to capture his journey both onscreen and off. That videographer later was Jordan's assistant on his directorial debut “Creed III” and will be an associate producer on “Thomas Crown.”

 










“The intent was me feeling like I don't take in the moments,” Jordan said. “Because I'm always on the go, always working and grinding. One day I wanted to have something to reflect on outside of the memories in my head. … I've missed out on a lot of life. I'm not complaining — but that balance is something I've always struggled with, of the personal and professional stuff.”

Jordan might reunite with his mentor Washington soon, too, as Washington teased his involvement in “Black Panther 3.” The film has not yet been announced but Coogler is expected to return to helm the MCU film. It's unclear if Jordan would reprise his role, though, as his character died in the first film and was briefly resurrected for a dream sequence in the sequel. 

Jordan reflected to Vulture about how Coogler believing in him and his talent changed his career after being cast in Coogler's directorial debut “Fruitvale Station.” 

“He told me he thought I was a movie star,” Jordan said. “He thought I was a great actor, and he wanted to show the rest of the world that, and he wanted to make the movie with me.”

As fans get ready to watch Ribeiro and Hough's third season hosting “Dancing With the Stars” together, former host Erin Andrews is gearing up to start her first hosting gig since leaving the show. 

After her unceremonious dismissal from the show after Season 28, Andrews focused on her job in sports journalism, as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox, and started her WEAR clothing line and “Calm Down with Erin and Charissa” podcast. Now that she's made her way back into reality TV to co-host the new game show “99 To Beat,” Andrews is, understandably, nervous.

“I'm going on a trip, I'm going on a work trip on Friday,” Andrews told producer Ryan Musick on her podcast. “And I'm leaving for a while to film a new game show for FOX.”

“And I'm very nervous, I have a ton of anxiety. But I'm excited,” Andrews added. “I am excited to get back into that world. Obviously, it's been a minute since I got the boot from “Dancing With the Stars” with Tom Bergeron. I affectionately love to tell that story. My agent is like, ‘Don't say that, you weren't fired, you were replaced.' I was fired. I was fired.”

She went on to reveal that she'd been trying to find a game show to host for a while. “I was on “Pyramid” one time with [Michael] Strahan, up against Aaron Rodgers. Had a blast doing that. I love that whole vibe, and had been really, you know, taking meetings, and trying to get back into that world.”

“I like playing off people, I like playing off contestants,” she continued. But she couldn't resist one swipe at “DWTS,” cheekily telling listeners. “Super pumped I don't have to wear a ballroom gown. I'm very excited about that.”

Andrews' new show, “99 To Beat,” first debuted in Belgium in 2018. Initially, 100 contestants compete against each other in mental, physical, and just plain ridiculous challenges. In one challenge, “pairs of contestants were blindfolded and had to identify the sound of squeaky toys,” Deadline reported.

“We were looking for a show about normal people,” the show's creator, Jo Dehennin, said. “We wanted to do something for everyone that everyone could participate in. And it is out of the ordinary in that usually gameshows have winners and there has to be some extraordinary quality to the contestants, but in this show it is all about not losing.”

Whoever finishes last in each challenge is out, and whoever makes it to the end as the final contestant standing takes home a jackpot of $100,000. 

Following the tremendous success of the Belgian format, other countries adopted it. The United States will be the 11th country to create its own version of 99 To Beat. According to TV Insider, Andrews will co-host with Ken Jeong, which is scheduled to air Wednesdays at 9 ET/8 CT in the fall.

Big Thief have announced a new album. Double Infinity is the band's sixth studio LP and follow-up to 2022's Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You. Out September 5 via 4AD, the record was made with a rotating cast of collaborators, among them Alena Spanger, Ginla's Jon Nellen, Natural Information Society's Mikel Patrick Avery, and Laraaji. Listen to lead single “Incomprehensible” below.

Now a trio, following the departure of bassist Max Oleartchik, Big Thief recorded Double Infinity live over the span of three weeks at New York's Power Station, with longtime collaborator Dom Monks handling production, engineering, and mixing duties. Following the album's release, Big Thief will kick off their Somersault Slide 360 Tour of North America.

Since 2022, all three members of Big Thief have kept busy with their solo projects. Adrianne Lenker shared Bright Future in 2024 and the live album Live at Revolution Hall earlier this year; Buck Meek put out Haunted Mountain in 2023; and James Krivchenia's Performing Belief arrived just last month. In February, the band dropped an EP of previously unheard material to support relief efforts for the California wildfires.

What's your type?


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Mariah Carey is stepping into a new era. After going nearly seven years without dropping a proper album, the pop superstar appeared to tease on social media that she has a new LP in the works — and the first taste of it may be coming sooner than you think.  


	In one video posted Monday (June 2), Mimi looks as glamorous as ever while sitting in a car, listening to a single with a groovy club beat on the radio. The video then cuts to a shot of the screen displaying an untitled track — “T:D_MC16.mp3.” “To show my appreciation for your support, thank you DJs,” Carey's smoky voice says as the track heats up.  

	











	The clip then pans to the car's license plate, which displays the following: “MC16.” The caption reads, “What's your type?” — the same message that the video ends with. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Based on the license plate, it looks like the Songbird Supreme is finally following up 2018's Caution, which was the 15th album in her discography — as in, her next LP will be her 16th, or “MC16.” It would also appear that the first single could arrive Friday (June 6), based on another video Carey posted on Instagram one day after the first one. In the second clip, she sits again in a car while music plays on the stereo system, the engine loudly running before the shot cuts to a message reading, “June 6.” 

	











Billboard has reached out to Carey's reps for comment.


	Though the “Obsessed” singer has been active over the years with her yearly “All I Want for Christmas” pushes, fans have been growing increasingly impatient for fresh music. Carey's last album, Caution, reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200, one of 18 top 10 entries she's scored on the chart over the course of her career.  


	The new teasers come just a few days after Carey celebrated the 20th anniversary of one of her most iconic albums, The Emancipation of Mimi, which spent two weeks at No. 1 in 2005.

	We heard back on the Croisette that Netflix was very excited about acquiring this movie.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	“The original story comes from something my grandfather told me when I was young,” Tsou told Deadline's Melanie Goodfellow in our Cannes Studio. “He told me the left is the devil's hand, do not use it. At the time I was already ‘corrected' as I was originally left-handed, so I didn't really understand, but it stayed in my mind for a long, long time.”


	“The story was in my heart for so long, and I really, really want to show how the world how beautiful my country is. This is like a love letter to Taiwan,” Tsou said.


	Deadline Chief Film Critic Pete Hammond exclaimed, “Shih-Ching shows strong command of storytelling and shifting tones with high dramatics that could careen out of control but never do, instead keeping us on the edge of our seats. Baker's tight editing really comes into play here and proves worthy of Douglas Sirk at his height. Ultimately what holds it all together are the strong performances all around.”

	











	Coming out of the fest, Left-Handed Girl stands at 95% fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes. 


Shih-Ching Tsou is a longtime collaborator of Baker's who worked as a producer on his earlier films including Starlet, Tangerine, The Florida Project and Red Rocket. The duo also co-directed a film called Take Out 21 years ago. 


	Both them of co-wrote the movie. Producers are Shih-Ching Tsou, Baker, Mike Goodridge, Jean Labadie and Alice Labadie. Production companies are Left-Handed Girl Film Production, LHG Films LTD, Good Chaos and Le Pacte. 


	Netflix has rights for the majority of the world except for the Baltics, Benelux, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Scandinavia, Poland and Taiwan.

Scarlett Johansson didn't hold back when showing her “Jurassic Park” fandom to producer Steven Spielberg. The actress, who will now lead franchise installment “Jurassic World: Rebirth,” recalled first meeting with Spielberg about the role. 

“I had a meeting with him and I don't actually know if he knew the depths of my ‘Jurassic' fandom, but I'm hoping that no one explained it to him too thoroughly because it maybe would've come off as being a little too much,” Johansson told THR. “Although knowing Steven now, he was excited when I shared how much it would mean to me to play any part in ‘Jurassic.' I could've played it cooler and maybe I wouldn't have gotten it.”

She added of the experience,  “It taught me that if you are enthusiastic about a project, it is actually good to share your enthusiasm. You don't have to dumb it down or play it cool.”

Johansson first learned about the potential “Jurassic World: Rebirth” casting while on set for her own directorial debut “Eleanor the Great.” Johansson had to juggle her enthusiasm for both projects. 

 










“When I first heard that there was a new ‘Jurassic' movie coming, that it was written with a female lead who was the age that I could fit into, and that it was happening during a time period that I could shoot, it was particularly surreal,” Johansson said. “I was actually in the middle of making ‘Eleanor' — we were filming it at the time — so there was a lot happening at the time. I had to compartmentalize my nervous excitement for the job in front of me while also focusing on making it work. I would have these really geeked out, fangirl moments and then be, like, ‘OK, put that away for a second.'”

She continued that working on “Jurassic World: Rebirth” was “unbelievable” especially due to her love of the original “Jurassic Park” film. 

“I've been trying to get into a ‘Jurassic' movie for, I don't know, 15 years or something,” Johansson said. “I was so stoked that it all came together.” Johansson reflected on how watching “Jurassic Park” in theaters was a monumental “collective experience” for her at the time too. 

“It was so thrilling and has stayed with me forever. Those kinds of movies are rare, and I'm here for them. I'm here to be carried away, entertained and thrilled,” she said.”

“It's somewhere lost in the space-time continuum, or it's in some teamster's garage," Michael J. Fox said in a video, as Gibson will detail the search in the upcoming doc "Lost to the Future."

	The guitar that Marty McFly famously played at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance in Back to the Future has been missing for decades, and hopefully it won't take a DeLorean and a flux capacitor to find it.  


	Gibson — the guitar brand behind the iconic cherry red ES-345 Michael J. Fox wielded in the movie — announced that it's on the hunt for the guitar, with the company sharing a callout Tuesday asking for anyone who may have details on its location to reach out with tips. “Have You Seen This Guitar?” Gibson's poster reads, accompanied by a still from the movie of Fox playing the instrument. The search — and if all goes the way Gibson would like, the re-discovery — will be featured in an upcoming documentary the company is producing called Lost to the Future.

	Gibson posted a video Tuesday with Back to the Future stars Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd — along with Huey Lewis, who cameoed in the film and whose “The Power of Love” was famously featured in the movie — all calling on the public to send information to their website, or to call the 800-line Gibson has set up.

	“We need your help, we're trying to find the guitar I played in Back to the Future,” Fox said in the video. “It's somewhere lost in the space-time continuum, or it's in some teamster's garage.” 


	The company initiated the search and documentary this year to tie the efforts to Back to the Future's 40th anniversary, and Gibson is also featuring an interview with Michael J. Fox on Oct. 21 (“Back to the Future Day”) and will release custom guitars modeled after the original Gibson they're searching for, Gibson said. 

	











	“We've been looking into leads and rumors for a long time, and as you can imagine, we're talking 40 years ago, so memories fade,” Lost to the Future director Doc Crotzer tells The Hollywood Reporter. “We weren't in the era of digital trails, or of receipts and things like that. There are conflicting reports too. You can find about as many different rumors as you can people.” 


	Indeed, there are several different stories about what happened to the guitar. The Back to the Future team first rented the instrument from Norman's Rare Guitars, a famous guitar shop in Los Angeles, when they were filming the first movie. They'd returned the guitar after they finished shooting, and per Crotzer and Mark Agnesi — Gibson's director of brand experience and Norman's former GM from 2009 to 2019, that's where their trail currently goes cold. 


	Crotzer first asked Agnesi about the guitar around a decade ago when Agnesi was still working at Norm's, and several years ago, after Crotzer first spoke with Back to the Future co-creator Bob Gale, he'd approached Agnesi again at Gibson. Agnesi and Crotzer list off several rumors, like that the guitar was headed to auction in the ‘80s but never made it there for a sale. 


	A likely scenario, they say, is that someone simply bought it from Norm's and the origins of the sale have been lost. Norman's owner, Norman Harris, has given several interviews in the past, suggesting he sold it to a friend, who eventually sold it to a woman who came back to his store years later and offered $1 million to sell it back. But Harris had also suggested in the past that it'd been sold to someone in Japan. Needless to say, so far Gibson and Crotzer haven't tracked the guitar yet. Aside from the public inquiry, Crotzer says the film is taking them through prop houses and guitar shops as well. 

	











	“I knew that guitar came from Norm's, the first day on the job, I was looking in cases,” Agnesi says. “Every time I'd go to storage to Norm's warehouse, I was checking ES-cases to see if he still had it. I've been looking since 2009, 15 years of looking for this thing. It's cool we're going to let the world know we're looking for it and everyone gets to join in.”


	Gale tells THR that he “never gave it that much thought” on what happened to the guitar before he was told it was missing in around 2019, but that since then he's become more invested in tracking it down. 


	“It's like we want to put it on milk cartons, ‘have you seen me,'” Gale says with a slight chuckle, describing the search efforts. “We rented the guitar again for Part 2, but I've learned that guitar might not have been the one we used in the first film. So the question is, what happened to the original?”


Back to the Future's high school dance scene is one of the most memorable guitar scenes in the history of the film business, as Marty McFly unintentionally inspires the creation of Chuck Berry's “Johnny B. Goode” by performing the song with the band on stage, eventually losing the crowd as his performance devolves into a Van Halen-style guitar solo. Artists, including John Mayer and Coldplay's Chris Martin, have called that scene in the movie instrumental in inspiring them to pursue music. 


	The scene almost never happened, as Robert Zemeckis contemplated going straight from the kiss to the scene at the clock tower, but it stayed in after testing at a preview when the audience reacted positively to it. 

	











	“We had no idea it would be part of the film's legacy, the Johnny B. Goode scene is the only scene in the entire movie which doesn't really advance the character or plot. We were basically doing what they do in India, where we stopped the movie for a musical number,” Gale says. “It's been amazing over the years to discover how important that particular scene was to people. It inspired so many people to pick up a guitar and be a rock and roller.”


	Gibson says the guitar in the movie was likely a 1960 or 1961 ES-345 (Its use in the film was a historical inaccuracy, given most of the movie was supposed to take place in 1955 and the 345 didn't hit shelves until three years later). An early ‘60s 345 on its own could already fetch $25,000 to $50,000 given how sought-after vintage Gibsons are, but its place as one of film's most iconic guitars makes it priceless. 


	Gibson and the doc team don't have the guitar's serial number, which would be the easiest way to identify a specific instrument. Luckily, they say, the guitar has a key identifier that makes it stand out. Usually, the ES-345 models would have a split parallelogram inlay going completely down the fretboard, but on the guitar in the movie, the 12th fret had a single sold bar marker on  it instead, a rare anomaly that would make the guitar more unmistakable. 


	“That's the smoking gun if we're being honest,” Agnesi says. “It's that inlay on the 12th fret that's really going to let us know that we found it.”

	











	Overall, the team feels confident their search will be successful, even if the search has to go well outside the country. Agnesi has a “Japan theory” for the guitar's whereabouts, given a vintage guitar boom that hit the country in the ‘80s. He said Gibson's international teams in Japan, China and Europe will help spread the word as well. 


	As for what they'll do if they actually do find it? That's still to be determined, though Crotzer said, “there's something poetic about the idea of reuniting this guitar with Michael J. Fox, whether it's for an hour, or forever.”


	“My hope would be whoever has this guitar is enough of a fan of the movies to allow that to happen. There are a lot of possible scenarios. Does the person who has it want to be found? Do they want to, say, lend us the guitar?”


	Agnesi says he'd like to get the guitar in a place it can be showcased for “as many people to have a chance to see it as possible.” 


	“If that means Gibson buys it for their collection and puts it in the vault, I am absolutely 100 percent ready to start talking with anybody who comes forward who might have the guitar about potentially buying it,” Agnesi says. 


	Still, as Gale says, the focus remains on finding the guitar right now. 


	“At this point, we just kind of want to know it's in good hands and is being well taken care of,” he says. “Everything else you figure out after that, but let's solve that mystery first.”

SPOILER ALERT: This post contains details about Pillion.


	As Jake Shears was recently between stops in Glasgow and Bournemouth on a UK/Ireland arena tour, moviegoers were watching his titillating onscreen debut in the South of France.


	Deadline caught up with the Scissor Sisters frontman following the Cannes premiere of Pillion, writer-director Harry Lighton‘s feature debut that sets a heartbreaking love story within a queer BDSM biker gang, featuring a supporting performance from Shears as sexual submissive Kevin.


	“I'm wiped, but I'm happy,” said Shears over Zoom from his UK home, one day after wrapping up the tour that reunited the band after a 13-year hiatus. Meanwhile, Scissor Sisters is preparing to embark on The Tits Out Tour on July 1 in support of co-headliner Kesha's album Period.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	After co-founding the pop rock group 25 years ago and releasing solo music during the hiatus, Shears made his Broadway debut in Kinky Boots back in 2017 and recently played the Emcee in the West End's revival of Cabaret in 2023, paving the way for his onscreen acting career.


	But nothing could prepare him for the NSFW nature of his first film role, which culminates in a picnic tabletop orgy scene with Alexander Skarsgård‘s Ray, the elusive dom and romantic opposite of Harry Melling‘s timid sub, Colin. Although Lighton has teased more explicit shots were left on the cutting-room floor, audiences got an eyeful and Shears got a mouthful with Ray's pierced prosthetic phallus.

	











	“Well, my jaw was kind of on the floor, reading it,” said Shears of the scene. “I sort of couldn't believe it, but it was really exciting for me when I was reading the script. It's a movie about sex and sexual dynamics and dynamics of love. When I read it, I was really expecting it to be something dark, and what I was so pleasantly surprised by is the warmth and the humor that's in the movie. And to me, that sort of blended with the more explicit stuff in the film. I loved that combination when I was reading it. And when I read the script for the first time, it really made me smile, it made me sad, it's heartbreaking. It's got all of these different feelings in it, and it just was not what I expected. And when I read the orgy scene in the script, I was just like, ‘Oh my God.'”


	Although Shears' acting debut is quite the unconventional role, he takes every inch of it like a champ (pun fully intended). Explicit sex scenes and piercings aside, the Grammy-nominated artist seamlessly loses himself in the film's tense relationship dynamics while shedding light on the BDSM culture captured in the source material, Adam Mars-Jones' 2020 novel Box Hill.


	“All the guys in the movie are the real deal,” he noted of the film's biker gang. “So I was reading The Leatherman's Handbook and all the sort of training and processes and the sort of formalities that are involved. … And I'm pretty well-versed in faggotry [laughs] and a lot of different things in the queer world, but other than a moment when I was about 19 years old, I hadn't really had any experiences in this world, so it was interesting to learn about it and be with all the guys.”


	Ahead of Pillion‘s world premiere at Cannes on May 18, which earned an eight-minute ovation and the Un Certain Regard Best Screenplay for Lighton (as well as the Palm Dog for canine supporting actor Hippo), the film was acquired by A24 for US distribution rights in October.


	Read on about Jake Shears' experience making his acting debut in Pillion, as well as his sex scene with Skarsgård and whether his co-star's piercing was in the script.


DEADLINE: Tell me how the part in Pillion came about.


JAKE SHEARS: I met this woman named Kahleen Crawford, who was the casting director for it, and she had seen me in Cabaret. We ended up meeting at a house party over Christmas a couple years ago and became acquainted and friends, and she told me about this movie. And then, when I finished Cabaret — I'm trying to get the timeline right — but I was at my place in New Orleans, and she called me and she's like, “Are you sitting down? I really think that this would be a great thing for you to do” that would be not biting off more than I could chew, I think, even though I still feel like I bit off more than I could chew.


DEADLINE: No pun intended.


SHEARS: No pun intended. But then I talked with Harry [Lighton], we had a great conversation. That's sort of how I got into the project. I've been acquainted with Skarsgård from years before, through friends and whatnot, so I was really stoked to see him. I was excited, it was really interesting. I feel like it was definitely an education for me in a lot of different ways. 


DEADLINE: What was the research like, as far as the whole BDSM culture? Did I read that you were acting with an actual biker gang? 












SHEARS: Yeah, all the guys in the movie are the real deal. So I was reading The Leatherman's Handbook and all the sort of training and processes and the sort of formalities that are involved. I mean, it's a lot of stuff. You could have three college courses on it. It was a bit overwhelming, but I feel like I got a much better picture of what that scene is, that I didn't know before. And I'm pretty well-versed in faggotry [laughs] and a lot of different things in the queer world, but other than a moment when I was about 19 years old, I hadn't really had any experiences in this world, so it was interesting to learn about it and be with all the guys. So it was both warm — the experience — and it was also incredibly intimidating in certain ways, just for me personally, not that anything, not that anybody specifically made it that way. It was intimidating for me for for a lot of different reasons, the whole experience. 


DEADLINE: I can imagine. Obviously, you just did Cabaret, and you've been touring, and you're not a stranger to scantily clad performance. So was it daunting being in gear on camera? 


SHEARS: No, I mean, the intimacy coordination was so thorough and so good. It really was like, I found that stuff to be the easiest. The sex in the movie to me, that wasn't sort of what was intimidating to me. The process of filming and being in a film is what I found to be really jarring, and I learned a lot from it. I knew it would be vastly different from theater, and I knew it would be vastly different from performing on stage and and singing music. It really was like a different ballgame. And I'm a big film head; all the nonfiction I read is basically film history, and that's what I consume. I watch a lot of movies, I watch a lot of old movies, it's just a deep passion of mine. So it's really fascinating for me to be on the other side of it a bit and actually seeing how a machine like that works, and being in front of the camera in that sort of machine. I didn't feel like — and this was my own insecurities, and this isn't about the sex in the movie — but I just didn't feel like I had the tools for it. Just in general, just the process of being in a movie, I was like, “I think I'm in like over my head.” But I also at the same time, I've always really pushed myself to do things that are new, that are not necessarily something that's comfortable for you, and by comfortable I just mean, as far as your skill set. There's so many facets to this process, and it made me have a whole other kind of respect for film actors. It really did, it's just so strange how it all works and how people turn it on, And to the film and TV actors I know, it's just sort of given me like a much deeper insight into what they do. But it was exciting for me to be a part of a project that I thought was something really different and interesting, and something that I could really be proud of being in, and being a part of, that was really exciting for me in that way. So there was a whole bunch of feelings that I was just going through internally. Doing this movie, I love the people I was doing it with. Harry was amazing, both Harrys were awesome. I had a a couple scenes with Harry Melling, one of them made it into the movie. He really was just very sweet with me about my sort of insecurities or fears about doing it. And he really, I think, had quite a bit of patience with me that I really, really appreciated, that made me comfortable. And Skarsgård is somebody that I've already felt really comfortable with, and just somebody who is really nice to have a laugh with. They're both wonderful human beings. 

	











DEADLINE: I enjoyed the the one scene that you had with Harry that was kind of the low-key subtly bitchy exchange, and it's funny that you're saying you were insecure in that moment because it's like your character was more playing on his insecurities. So tell me about bringing that dynamic about. 


SHEARS: ‘Cause that's not me, you know what I mean? It was really not in my nature, so just that scene, I had to work on really, really hard to find the spot, and I hope it works. Does it work? 


DEADLINE: I loved it. It builds the tension leading up to that whole orgy scene, and then there's real emotional weight when you and Alexander Skarsgård are together and Harry's just sitting there like a wounded little boy. 


SHEARS: I feel like I just had to turn part of my brain off and turn part of myself off, and I found it incredibly challenging. You just walk away from that, and you just don't know if it works, And that's the thing about films that really blows my mind is that, anybody could make a movie and you can think it's the most incredible thing in the world, and you think that you've done the most amazing job in the world, but unless all the parts are operating together, you could really end up in something that stinks. Which is different from theater because in theater, you've got an audience there, you can kind of feel that out a little bit better. I feel like with film, I just don't see how you can see the forest for the trees. It really is some real faith. 


DEADLINE: Well, I think it turned out great, to be honest. But I have to ask, what was your initial reaction to reading the whole picnic table scene, and then what has been the reaction from everyone else since it premiered at Cannes? 


SHEARS: Well, my jaw was kind of on the floor, reading it. I sort of couldn't believe it, but it was really exciting for me when I was reading the script. It's a movie about sex and sexual dynamics= and dynamics of love. When I read it, I was really expecting it to be something dark, and what I was so pleasantly surprised by is the warmth and the humor that's in the movie. And to me, that sort of blended with the more explicit stuff in the film. I loved that combination when I was reading it. And when I read the script for the first time, it really made me smile, it made me sad. It's heartbreaking. It's got all of these different feelings in it, and it just was not what I expected. And when I read the orgy scene in the script, I was just like, “Oh my God.”


DEADLINE: Was the Prince Albert in the script? 


SHEARS: [Laughs] No, and I didn't know about the Prince Albert until the moment it was in front of my face. It might have been in the script, but it wasn't something that I even thought about until It was right in front of me, and it was so realistic that in the moment, when it's happening and being filmed, it was kind of shocking in a really great way. 


DEADLINE: Well, it's good to know that was a real reaction.


SHEARS: It was a real reaction! [Laughs]


DEADLINE: But it also just feels so true to his character for some reason, like he's such a dom that he has this penis accessory. It just feels right to me. 


SHEARS: Yes, I gotta say that prosthetic was really realistic. To me, in real life, it felt very real. Literally and figuratively.


DEADLINE: Did you get to keep any of the gear that you wore? Did you take any souvenirs? 


SHEARS: No, but the costumes were fantastic. I love what I got to wear in the movie. I just loved the stuff that was made for me. There was that really cool apron thing that was made for me. I just loved what I got to wear. I thought the costumes were amazing. And I felt sexy. It's funny because I'd gotten out of Cabaret in like really good shape, and as the summer had gone on, I felt like I was getting more and more out of shape. And I was like, “I just don't know, I'm not feeling like I'm fully, like, snatched. And Harry [Lighton] was like, “Please don't. I want you to have a more natural body in this.” And so I sort of had to get comfortable with that too, And I did feel sexy when we were doing it, it felt sexy to me. I wasn't too worried about that, even though I don't feel like I was my normal stage shape or whatever, I still felt good doing it. And I loved my hairdo. They gave me a great haircut. But the experience was a real eye-opener for me. It was just one of those things in my life that I'm really happy that I just took a chance with myself and did. I just think doing things that are out of your wheelhouse can be really good for you. And I think it was really good for me in that way, and I'm very thankful to everybody on the project for being as warm and patient and understanding and fun as they were. 

	











DEADLINE: Is there anything else coming up for you onscreen or is there any kind of role you want to take on next? 


SHEARS: My world has been Scissors, and it's gonna really be for the rest of the summer. We just put loads of work into — we just did an arena tour in the UK. And I think it was the best show we've ever made. It really was a dream show, and we put so much work into it. And it was the longest show we did, it was like a two-hour, it was a big show. So I'm just really happy with what we accomplished with that. We're touring, we're doing the Tits Out Tour — Kesha, Scissor Sisters, all summer basically, finishing it off with a show with the Pet Shop Boys in mid-August. And then I'm gonna take a little bit of a break. But it just doesn't stop. You know what I mean? I work a lot. I would love to definitely do more theater, and I'd be interested in doing more film, but I still feel like I've got a lot to learn in that regard. And I think I definitely need to keep building a toolkit for it, and I feel like I feel like I got a couple tools with this movie. But I definitely think it would be amazing to keep building that toolkit with the right stuff cause I really did enjoy the process. And I'm so happy that people seem to really love the movie. I'm just really happy how it already sort of feels sort of beloved in a way. So I'm really about that, because like I said before, you just never know what you're making, when you're making it.

	It's been eight years since the last time a Mario Kart game was released for a Nintendo console, but the wait is nearly over. And while 2017's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe may have missed the exact launch of the original Nintendo Switch, fans worldwide can rev their engine's right at the starting line this time around as Mario Kart World arrives day one for the upcoming Switch 2.


	Unlike the 2017 iteration (dubbed Deluxe), Mario Kart World (out June 5) isn't just an upgrade to a previous title, but an all-new entry in the beloved racing franchise built from the ground up for Nintendo's next generation console. With high-definition graphics, 24-player races, and sprawling environments to explore, Mario Kart World aims to leap the series forward into the modern era of gaming.


	But, in true Nintendo fashion, creating a sequel to a classic gaming staple doesn't just boil down to adding more. For the developers at Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development Division (Nintendo EPD, for short), overhauling a concept like Mario Kart requires a delicate tightrope walk of staying true to the spirit of the franchise while making good on new ideas — many of which are also old ones that were once cut due to the technical limitations of previous hardware.

	











Rolling Stone caught up with Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki to discuss the challenges of reinventing the series for a new generation of players, designing its interconnected world, and how balance becomes a key phrase in more ways than one.

	











	Since joining Nintendo in 2005, Yabuki has become a veteran at the company whose experience has spanned multiple console generations. He first worked as a planner on Mario Kart Wii (2008) before becoming the director of Mario Kart 7 (2011) and 8 (2014). Now serving as the producer of World, he brings a wealth of knowledge to the process.


	That knowledge means that Yabuki and his team knew very early on exactly what they wanted to do to differentiate the new game as more than just Mario Kart 9: make it an interconnected world and allow for 24 players rather than the standard 12.

	Both concepts have been at the top of his list for years but could never be implemented due to hardware restrictions of earlier consoles. “What actually ends up being in the product itself is only that small tip of the iceberg,” Yabuki tells Rolling Stone via translator. “But we think of the rest of the iceberg as a future treasure that we're storing for later use.”


	In Free Roam, players can drive around at their own pace getting to know the different geographical regions of the map, which are broken down into areas Mario fans will find familiar, from the grasslands and rolling hills of the Mushroom Kingdom to the fiery volcanic mountains around Bowser's Castle. Each of the games' few dozen courses (the exact number is a secret) are scattered around the map and can be driven through stop-by-stop and dissected outside the trials of a race before diving into a prix.


	The term interconnected is important to Yabuki, who doesn't view the game as being the same as other open-ended games like Breath of the Wild or Microsoft's racing sim Forza Horizon. “When it comes to Mario Kart World, we naturally didn't use the phrase ‘open world,' because, for me, sometimes that definition can be a little bit unclear, ambiguous, and we want it to stay very specific,” Yabuki says.


	“The beginning of this project really was thinking about that vast interconnected world, and how do we layer on top of that all of the experiences that you're accustomed to having in a Mario Kart game,” he says. “[There was] a lot that we had to think about in terms of changing away from what been, up to that point, traditional elements of the Mario Kart series.”

	Whereas traditional open world games might lack a distinct focus on any one distinct region or town, the creators of Mario Kart World view their environment more like a series of elaborate locales that branch out across its overworld map. That design choice demanded that the developers think methodically about every course's placement.

	











	“When you're creating a vast interconnected world where you can drive anywhere, there first thing that we had to think about was how to build in all of these racing routes all over that world like a network that overlays it,” Yabuki says. “In thinking of that network of all these connected routes, we had to consider them one by one and make sure that each one was pleasurable and interesting, and that it would offer a lot of value and fun for the player no matter which way they went.”


	In the Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes, players will travel to their next destination in between races, making each circuit feel less like a sequential series of levels and more like one larger gauntlet comprised of smaller legs. In Versus mode, users can select the tracks they want to play by choosing courses geographically adjacent to each other to chart a path around the overworld.


	But it's not just the game's world that's expanded in size, but the number of active racers too. Doubling the number of participants in each race doesn't just require making stages larger or widening the roads; it demands a total rethinking of how each of the game's systems work in harmony to keep the action from becoming overwhelming.


	“[In terms of balancing], we had to think not of this in terms of just the linear increase up to 24 players because, if we didn't adjust anything else, you'd be receiving too many attacks and it would be too stressful of a gameplay experience,” Yabuki says. “So, because of this kind of balance, we had to think about redesigning all elements from the ground up. When we think about a crash or a spin or a collision, for example, each of those is going to have a different amount of speed that the racer loses. And these have to be adjusted very carefully to make sure that it matches all of these new conditions of the game.”


	But as any player knows, the inherent stress of a Mario Kart match is also part of the core appeal. In practice, the 24-player races may not feel entire untenable, but there's definitely another layer of insanity. Whereas races once felt like candy-colored relays and juiced up soap box derbies, the increased scope and potential for unforeseen upsets is more potent than ever, feeling closer to the nail biting climax of a Mad Max movie. For the designers, the surprises remain essential to the spirit of the franchise.

	











	“We have to think about the chaos element, as well. Sometimes, a free-for-all is a really fun experience, too,” Yabuki says. “So, we need to make sure that's coming across as a fun element where it feels like anything could happen at any time.”


	The surprises don't just include the moment-to-moment action, but who is doing the action, too. While it initially launched with 42 playable characters, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe now has 50 racers to choose from including those added in downloadable expansions. Based on pre-release previews, Mario Kart World looks to be rivaling that base number (although, like the course count, the final tally remains unknown), on top of tons of different unlockable outfits that change the look of each racer.


	But among the pack, some noticeable favorites have already emerged. After the game's full reveal earlier this year, fans were instantly enamored by the inclusion of previous side characters like Pokey, Pianta, and Penguin (the last one most older fans fondly remember throwing off mountainsides in 1996's Super Mario 64). The most viral hit, however, was a nameless cow (simply called Cow) who previously served as an obstacle in Mario Kart levels like Moo Moo Meadows.


	Yabuki himself is amused by the fervor around the new character, although he hadn't expected the veracity of the fan response. “Yes, that was a very big reaction to the cow. We were certainly surprised,” he says. “The reaction really went beyond our imagination in terms of how happy people were and how excited.”


	It took some convincing, however, to get the character added to the roster. “I have to say that, in previous Mario Kart titles, we [had] to consider whether or not that character would be able to drive,” Yabuki says. “Perhaps my old way of thinking was, ‘Well, surely they would need to have hands and feet to be able to drive.' But I'll say that's come a long way for me, and maybe I've changed my thinking. So, now even characters like Goomba or Pokey, I think, ‘Okay, sure. They can drive.'”


	When it comes to evolving the gameplay of Mario Kart for a new era, the team has been careful not to change too much, while still adding new layers of depth to the base mechanics. Part of that comes from the lack of restrictions the new interconnected world provides, but it can also be felt in how the game controls in action. Yabuki and the developers were adamant that new systems be woven into the game's design, with the caveat that they're not mandatory for everyone to learn — especially newcomers.

	











	“Mario Kart, as a series, is one of those games where you do expect that the player will play the game quite a lot, so we have to think about all of the different kinds of play styles that players will bring to the game, and also their chance to learn as they see other people doing interesting things,” Yabuki says. “Some people might learn even from doing random actions themselves. They may have jumped at just the right moment to avoid a shell and suddenly, for the first time, realize that's a technique.”


	The new abilities in question mostly stem from a move called the Charge Jump. By holding the right shoulder button (normally used for drifting around curves) during a straight away, the player character will crouch into their karts and, upon release, can jump straight up into the air, or flip in whatever direction the joystick is held. This opens up a few options: players can flip into a rail grind or drive along walls — or, as teased by Nintendo staff at preview events, the move can be used to deflect items when mastered (think: blue shell).


	It's the mastery bit that's key. Although the game is intended to be readily accessible to anyone, the seasoned developer knows that it's going to become a major time sink for more dedicated fans. “I think there's a great opportunity for the way they view the world itself to change, Yabuki says. “They may see a guardrail as an obstacle in the beginning, but as they play more and they become more experienced and learn different moves, they will learn that they can use it to rail slide and all of the things that they can do using those obstacles in new ways.”


	As with most Nintendo games, the Mario Kart series offers an open-ended experience that often belies its difficulty. To gauge how best to create new challenges, Yabuki says that he looks to the franchise's past as a frame of reference rather than what else is being created in the gaming landscape (“I don't really look to other games for ideas”). For Mario Kart, specifically, that means pinpointing what the game's purest form is and making it easier from there for newcomers, rather than starting easy and ratcheting it up from there.

	“With the original Super Mario Kart, the idea of having 50cc, 100cc, 150cc [engines], for us, was sort having different difficulty levels,” Yabuki explains. “During development, the way that we developers approach the game is we try to think of 150cc as being the standard. We try to use 150cc to experience these newly designed courses first and make sure that they work at that engine size.”

	











	When asked whether he plans to implement a higher, 200cc difficulty like the one previously added to Mario Kart 8 post-launch, Yabuki stays mum. “Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes likes this,” he says coyly. “However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet.”

Shame have announced a new album. Cutthroat, which was produced by John Congleton, arrives September 5 via Dead Oceans. The English post-punk group has also shared the album's lead single, “Cutthroat,” alongside a video, directed by Ja Humby, that features lead singer Charlie Steen riding a motorcycle in a wall of death stunt at a carnival, dancing in gold lamé shorts, and more. Check it out below.

Steen, in a press release, cited Oscar Wilde as an influence on the new song. “I was reading a lot of Oscar Wilde plays where everything was about paradox,” he said. “In ‘Cutthroat,' it's that whole idea from Lady Windermere's Fan, ‘Life's far too important to be taken seriously.'”

Cutthroat is the follow-up to 2023's Food for Worms. Shame—featuring vocalist Charlie Steen, guitarists Sean Coyle-Smith and Eddie Green, bassist Josh Finerty, and drummer Charlie Forbes—recorded the new album, which they describe as “a joyride,” at Salvation Studios in Brighton, England.

“This is about who we are,” Steen said. “Our live shows aren't performance art—they're direct, confrontational, and raw. That's always been the root of us. We live in crazy times. But it's not about ‘Poor me.' It's about ‘Fuck you.'” He added: “It's about the cowards, the cunts, the hypocrites. Let's face it, there's a lot of them around right now.”

If you could go back in time and change the most pivotal moments of your life, would you? Director Kogonada helms heartfelt romance-drama “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” that stars Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell as two strangers who become caught in the folds of fate.

The synopsis reads: “What if you could open a doorway and walk through it to re-live a defining moment from your past? Sarah (Robbie) and David (Farrell) are single strangers who meet at a mutual friend's wedding and soon, through a surprising twist of fate, find themselves on A Big Bold Beautiful Journey – a funny, fantastical, sweeping adventure together where they get to re-live important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present…and possibly getting a chance to alter their futures.” Kevin Kline and Phoebe Waller-Bridge also star.

“A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” is written by Seth Reiss, who also produces along with Bradley Thomas, Ryan Friedkin, and Youree Henley. Kogonada executive produces with Ilene Feldman, Gino Falsetto, Ori Eisen, Paul Mezey, Micah Green, Dan Steinman, and John Atwood. 

 










Farrell reunites with director Kogonada after starring in 2022 film “After Yang.” Recent IndieWire Honors recipient Farrell is rumored to return for “The Penguin” Season 2, as well as Matt Reeves' “The Batman” sequel, next. Both are WBD projects. 

His “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” co-star Robbie is also at Warner Bros. with Emerald Fennell‘s adaptation of the Emily Brontë novel “Wuthering Heights.” Robbie produced Fennell's prior two films through her LuckyChap banner; she'll star as Catherine alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff. Elordi is back with his “Saltburn” writer/director Fennell for the feature, which has already caused a stir online due to its casting choices and first look images.

And Kogonada announced in 2022 that he was going to helm a limited series about the murder of Vincent Chin. Chloé Zhao was set to serve as an executive producer on the series. The project since has been shelved.

Sony will release “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” in theaters September 19. Check out the trailer below.

	As Elon Musk departs the Trump White House — at least officially — a new Senate report examines how the world's richest man leveraged his access to the levers of federal power to boost his myriad personal businesses, including his electric vehicle company Tesla, aerospace contractor SpaceX, social media platform X, and brain-chip firm Neuralink.


	Musk is leaving his post as a “special government employee” — a status that limited his stint in the executive branch to 130 days. As Donald Trump made clear in a press conference, where he gave Musk a “key” to the White House, the billionaire's influence will live on, as will his crusade against his own regulators.


	Issued by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the report is titled “Special Interests Over the Public Interest: Elon Musk's 130 Days in the Trump Administration” and features a list of 130 actions by Musk, his companies, and family members that “raise questions about corruption, ethics, and conflicts of interest.”Musk, of course, was Trump's biggest benefactor in the 2024 campaign, spending nearly $300 million to put Trump and Republican candidates into office. He then camped out at Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition and moved to Washington with the 47th president. At times appearing to be the nation's true chief executive, Musk commanded the forces of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and sent critical agencies like USAID (the U.S. Agency for International Development) through the “woodchipper,” likely condemning millions of vulnerable people across the globe to death by preventable diseases.

	











	The Warren report is focused on Musk's use of political power to boost his businesses, or secure special benefits — from regulatory relief to rich new contracts — that favor his fortunes and his family.

	











	The report clarifies that “Not every action listed … represents a violation of federal law,” but argues instead that “Musk has violated norms at an astonishing pace” while engaging in and supporting actions that are “hurting the American public.” It labels this “scandalous behavior regardless of whether it subjects him to criminal prosecution.”


	The Warren report divides its list into 15 categories, which Rolling Stone can exclusively preview below:

					The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time		
	









	The report highlights the time, when Tesla showrooms were increasingly beset by public protests, that Trump turned the White House lawn into a Tesla lot.


	The report highlights more than 20 instances of Musk or DOGE helping Musk's enterprises secure new contracts on an inside track on rich lines of business. For example, it highlights Rolling Stone's report about how staff at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were instructed to find “tens of millions” of dollars for a rich new Starlink contract, as well as a new $100 million NASA contract for SpaceX to launch an asteroid monitoring space telescope.


	When Trump took office, Musk companies faced federal penalties and enforcement actions totalling up to $2.4 billion, according to the report. Warren highlights CNBC reporting that the federal government has allowed nearly 40 cases against Musk companies to effectively go dormant, while others, including a Department of Justice case against SpaceX for alleged anti-immigrant discrimination in hiring, have been dropped.


	The report describes how Musk and the administration have targeted agencies with powers to regulate Musk businesses — including “gutting their staff, throwing sand in the gears of their operations, and embedding DOGE staff loyal to Musk.” A key example of this is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has authority to police Musk as he turns X into a payment platform. “Delete CFPB,” Musk has posted, and the administration has tried to bring the agency to its knees. (Read Rolling Stone's interview with Warren on this topic.)

	Musk operates in many highly regulated areas, from launching rockets to biomedical brain implants. The FAA has, under Trump, become a service agency for SpaceX, clearing the way for rocket launches despite frequent catastrophic failures. In Trump's auto tariff battles, the administration announced that cars with 85 percent domestic content were spared the levy — a category that reportedly only includes Teslas.


	Never before has a presidential megadonor had so much unfettered access to government data, insight, and decision-makers. The report highlights Musk's role as a dominant participant at Trump Cabinet meetings, despite having no Cabinet-level post, who was “privy to upcoming policy changes at the highest level of government,” many of which could boost his bottom line.

	











	Musk has been deeply enmeshed, through DOGE, in the HR decisions of the federal government — firing tens of thousands of employees while installing loyalists throughout the bureaucracy. Many of these lackeys now have permanent government gigs, and will be able to carry out Musk-aligned policy without his active direction, including the head of the Federal Communications Commission, which has oversight of radio spectrum needed by Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet business.


	The report links Musk to the Trump administration's sudden, curious interest in the cause of white Afrikaaners from South Africa, who have been granted refugee status amid Musk's trumped-up allegations that they face a “genocide” — even as other truly vulnerable people from around the world are being denied admission to the United States.


	The report highlights a Wall Street Journal investigation into perceived threats from X execs who intimated that a planned merger between ad conglomerates might face trouble if ad clients didn't ramp up their spending on the social media platform.


	The report links Musk to the Trump Federal Trade Commission's “seemingly baseless” investigation into whether Media Matters colluded with advertisers. X sued the watchdog in late 2023, after Media Matters reported that ads on the platform were being served up against “pro-Nazi” content, leading large brands to suspend campaigns on the platform.


	The report links Musk's White House influence to favorable provisions of the House budget bill, including funding for the “Golden Dome,” a space-based missile defense program that seems ready-made for Starlink. 


	Warren's report highlights dozens of deals that Musk companies have inked with countries that are under tariff threat from the administration, as well as Musk accompanying Trump's tour of Persian Gulf countries, where the DOGE chief announced deals of his own — including that Neuralink had inked a deal to begin clinical trials in the United Arab Emirates.


	The report highlights how Musk's power is translating to deals for family members, including his brother recently inking a deal with Persian Gulf states to mount drone light shows, while his dad is reportedly in talks to build a Musk Tower in Dubai.

	











	Musk's fruitless effort to finance a conservative takeover of the Wisconsin state Supreme Court is highlighted in the report, as is his call for judges who oppose Trump to be impeached.

L
ast spring, Lily Seabird was walking through downtown Burlington, Vermont, around 1 a.m., singing to herself. Still a little buzzed from a night out, her phone long past dead, she sang the words out loud as they came to her: “We walk these streets we've come to know/Memories live on in them, after the snow…”


	“I got through the whole thing, and I got home and I wrote it down really quickly,” Seabird says.


	She wanted to make sure she held on to those newly written verses before they vanished, but the truth is, her songs are unforgettable. Each lyric hits with crystal clarity, locking you into her wavelength whether you're listening to her album Trash Mountain — named after the “hippie house” where she lives, overlooking the former site of a town dump — or attending one of her shows. It turns out many of the songs on the album started similarly, arriving like bolts from the blue and sending her racing to jot them down ASAP. “I have a good memory,” she adds with a smile.

	











	When she wrote that late-night meditation, which she dubbed “Trash Mountain (1am),” she'd just gotten home to Burlington after SXSW 2024, where she played bass in singer-songwriter Greg Freeman's band, as well as leading a band of her own. Freeman was one of the most-talked-about acts at the festival that year; 12 months later, in March 2025, it was Seabird's turn to floor audiences in Austin with some of the week's most rave-worthy performances.


	Released this spring as Seabird's third album, Trash Mountain is an exquisitely bittersweet alt-country song cycle about love, loss, and friendship. “I just turned 26, so I feel like I'm pretty young still,” she says when I meet her at a diner in Manhattan, en route to a show in Philadelphia. She sees the album's autumnal tone as reflecting her stage of life, as she and the friends she's made in Burlington over the last eight years — a wildly creative bunch that includes Freeman and the cool, arty indie/psych acts Robber Robber and Dari Bay, among others — enter the second half of their twenties.

	“When we started all playing in bands, it was purely for fun, just getting drunk and playing a house show,” she says. “And I still do it for fun, but there was a sadness that I started to feel. A sadness of growing up and things changing…. It's something I've maybe always wanted, but there's this nostalgia.”


	Growing up in rural Pennsylvania, Seabird taught herself guitar at age 11 and played in an all-girl punk band in her teens. After graduating high school in 2017, she moved to New York to study at the New School, bringing with her the same two guitars she plays now, an acoustic Seagull and a blue Telecaster.


	A self-described huge fan of Leonard Cohen, she was deeply affected by his death the previous year. As we talk, she takes off her denim jacket to reveal two arms full of tattoos, including her second-ever: a sketch of a woman's contemplative face on her left bicep, based on a line drawing called “Montreal Visitor #2” from Cohen's poetry volume Book of Longing, which she picked up from a free table in Tompkins Square Park her first year of college.


	Seabird found life in New York overwhelming — “I was working so many jobs and going to school and it was way too intense” — and when she heard that some friends were taking a road trip north in the spring, she tagged along, thinking she could see an exhibit on Cohen at a Montreal museum. “I grabbed my backpack: ‘Can I come?' It was very last-minute, and that one little decision changed my life.”

	After her pilgrimage to Quebec, she ran out of money for a bus ticket home, so she ended up crashing with a friend in Burlington. On her first night in town, she performed some of her songs at a University of Vermont open mic, where she met Freeman, another artist her age on the bill. “I think we were both just like, ‘Wow, who was that? Who is that songwriter who was so much better than everyone else?'” Freeman tells me.


	Drawn by the creative community she'd found in Burlington, Seabird soon transferred to UVM. She spent her summers working at an environmental nonprofit — she went door-to-door drumming up support for the state's 2020 single-use plastics ban (“Lily Seabird is partially responsible for banning the straw in Vermont!” she jokes) — and kept writing songs on the side, with Freeman as her biggest cheerleader. “Greg was the main encouraging person to me, as a young girl playing music,” says Seabird. “We'd go to shows and he'd be like, ‘Why aren't we making a band and playing your songs?'”


	The two old friends have continued to make music together since then; though they no longer play in each other's bands full-time, he added guitar to several songs on Trash Mountain, and she's listed in the credits of his upcoming album Burnover. “She's just really raw,” Freeman says. “When you're at a Lily show, you're totally experiencing her — there's not even a tiny bit of trying to be anything other than what she is.”


	That's just as true of Trash Mountain, a remarkably lucid document of Seabird's interior life. After gathering last summer at the southern Vermont studio of her friend Kevin Copeland with a few musicians she knows well — also including her partner, guitarist Rick Soszynski, and Robber Robber's Nina Cates and Zack James on bass and drums — she stripped away the stormy arrangements of her past releases to let her words speak for themselves. “It's softer than my other albums,” she says. “I was feeling really quiet and soft.”


	One of the most stunning songs on the new LP is “Arrow,” where she explores complex feelings of love and grief. Her words have a directness that Cohen would be proud of: “There exists this fine line, on either side of it pain and beauty…”

	











	Those words, she says, reflect the loss of a close friend to suicide three years ago. “My world was really rocked when my friend died,” she says. “There's now this fear of things going away, but also, that's just life. Things change. And that chorus is saying, ‘I wish that everything could just be the same forever.”


	The album opens with a spare, moving ballad called “Harmonoia”: “I wonder where you are, what puts a smile on your face/I wonder if you've changed or if you'd know me just the same.”


	She explains that she titled the song after a word she found in a book called The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows. “It's a feeling of feeling paranoid when things are too good, that they're going to end,” she says. “That transience and impermanence of everything.”

Slow Horses will return to Apple TV+ for Season 5 this fall.


	The streamer revealed Tuesday that the fifth installment of the espionage drama will debut with the first two episodes on September 24, followed by one episode weekly until October 22. Luckily, there's already a Season 6 incoming, too, as the series was renewed in October.


	Along with the premiere date, Apple TV+ also gave a glimpse at the new season in a series of photos. They don't give away much, but there is a glimpse of Nick Mohammed will also guest star in Season 5. See those below.


Slow Horses is a darkly humorous espionage drama that follows a dysfunctional team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 known unaffectionately as Slough House. Gary Oldman stars as Jackson Lamb, the brilliant but cantankerous leader of the spies, who end up in Slough House due to their career-ending mistakes as they frequently find themselves blundering around the smoke and mirrors of the espionage world.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In Season 5, everyone is suspicious when resident tech nerd Roddy Ho has a glamorous new girlfriend, but when a series of increasingly bizarre events occur across the city, it falls to the Slow Horses to work out how everything is connected. After all, Lamb knows that in the world of espionage, the London Rules — cover your back — always apply.


	The cast also includes Kristin Scott Thomas, Jack Lowden, Saskia Reeves, Rosalind Eleazar, Christopher Chung, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Ruth Bradley, James Callis, Tom Brooke, and Jonathan Pryce. 

	











Slow Horses is produced for Apple TV+ by Heartstopper maker See-Saw Films, with Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Julian Stevens, Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, Adam Randall, Gail Mutrux, Douglas Urbanski and Oldman serving as executive producers. Saul Metzstein, who earned an Emmy nomination for Season 3, returns to helm Season 5.

The tour in the U.K. and Europe will be his first dates in the region since 2019.

Drake has expanded his upcoming summer tour with his newly-announced $ome $pecial $hows 4 UK run through the United Kingdom and Europe with PARTYNEXTDOOR.


	Earlier this year it was announced that Drake would headline Wireless Festival in London on all three nights (July 11-13), and the Canadian superstar will now expand his run to include shows at Birmingham's Utilita Arena (July 20, 21) and Manchester's Co-op Live (July 25, 26) alongside PARTYNEXTDOOR.

	











	The tour will then continue through Europe over the ensuing months with dates in Amsterdam, Stockholm, Paris, Berlin, Milan and concludes in Hamburg, Germany on Sep. 23. See the pair's full run of shows below.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Tickets for the shows will first be available on presale on Wednesday (Jun. 4) before a general sale begins on Friday (Jun. 6) on Drake's official website.


	The upcoming dates will be Drake's first run of shows in the U.K. and Europe in six years since his 2019 Assassination Vacation Tour. Earlier this year, he toured throughout Australia on his Anita Max Win jaunt, though a number of dates in Sydney and Auckland, New Zealand were cancelled with short notice due “scheduling conflicts.”


	Earlier this year Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR released their collaborative album $ome $exy $ongs 4 U which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and No. 3 on the U.K. Official Albums Chart. The LP was Drake's 14th No. 1 atop the Billboard 200 and PARTYNEXTDOOR's first chart-topper.

	











	In May, Drake also teased the return of his OVO Fest in his hometown in Toronto, Canada. Appearing at Central Cee's show, he confirmed the star-studded event would “be back this year.” It will be his first time hosting the event since his high-profile beef with Kendrick Lamar and his ongoing lawsuit with his label Universal Music Group.

	Following his exit from the White House, ending his run as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk left the government with a haphazard mess of devastating budget cuts and backlash from his shareholders and the public.


	On Monday's The Daily Show episode, Jon Stewart quickly chronicled Musk's fall from “tech titan given a mandate to move fast and crush the deep state” to “guy who had a bad night in a Nashville bar he can't remember.”


	“DOGE has finally rooted out one of America's least efficient government workers,” declared Stewart, celebrating the finale of Musk's 130 days as a “special employee” in the White House last week. “He's leaving his job to make more family with his time,” joked the host, referencing Musk's obsession with having as many children as humanly possible.

	“Look at this poor bastard,” said Stewart, directing the audience to a photo of Musk jumping onstage during a campaign event for Donald Trump to a photo of the billionaire with a black eye during a press conference with the president. “He's looking beaten down. He's got that look on his face that I imagine his employees normally have — black eye, 1,000-yards stare. This dude has seen some shit,” said Stewart before cutting to a clip of Musk dubiously claiming his five-year-old son X punched him in the face.

	











	“Elon spent $300 million of his own money to get Trump elected, irreparably damaged his personal brand and almost all of his business, and is clearly suffering some kind of issue,” said Stewart, who then segued into a New York Times report that Musk allegedly took ketamine, Ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms during the 2024 campaign trail, and that reportedly he took so much ketamine he couldn't pee right. (Musk has vehemently denied the report.)Stewart mocked the SpaceX CEO rerouting a conversation to talk about “spaceships” instead of “presidential policy” during his exit interview on CBS News' Sunday Morning. Trump has “broken this poor man,” observed Stewart. “But let this be a lesson to Elon and anybody in Trump's orbit: Whatever your passionate political belief or whatever your ideology is, you will go from reaching for mine stars to dissolving in a puddle of your own urine and shame and starting a fight club with your kid just to be able to feel because Trump … Trump doesn't believe in anything, man.”

"I think it's one of my favorite episodes," Joe Jonas says of South Park's season 13 premiere. 


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



Joe Jonas has taken a look back at South Park‘s famous spotlight of the Jonas Brothers, admitting that he views it as a personal “claim to fame.”


	Joe's comments appear in the new episode of Mythical Kitchen's Last Meals (via Entertainment Weekly), where he explained to host Josh Scherer that his opinions were not shared by his brothers at the time.


	“I think I was the only brother that loved it,” Joe explained. “Our skin was not as thick back then, and I thought it was hilarious, because I watched South Park, and I was like, ‘This is so funny, I know what they're doing, they make fun of everyone!'

	“To be made fun of by a comic is usually a sign that they give a s–t, and they care, and it's funny,” he added. “They really went for us.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Joe, along with brothers Kevin and Nick, were spotlighted as part of The Ring, the premiere episode of South Park's 13th season in March 2009. The episode, which was inspired by the release of Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience just weeks earlier, sees the fictionalized trio convincing their fans to wear purity rings at the behest of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse.


	However, Jonas agreed that he was able to see the humor in the South Park parody, noting that the band weren't the specific focus, but rather it was “Boss Mickey” that was in the sights of the creators.


	“I mean, what an honor to get my ass kicked by Mickey,” Jonas added. “I think it's one of my favorite episodes. And later on, now, we just laugh. We love that. I think it's so great. Definitely a claim to fame for me.”

	











	The recent comments from Joe align with Nick's own from 2016, in which he addressed the episode in a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything' session.


	“When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time and so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on,” he explained. “But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times.”


	Joe himself reflected on the episode just months later in his own AMA session, stating he was “so pumped” when it first aired, but conceded that “Nick was really kind of not into watching it.”


	“I thought it was the funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously if you go to a comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it,” he explained. “And for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. 


	“Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse.”


	Joe's comments also come just days after the release of his second studio album, Music for People Who Believe in Love, which will be followed in August by the Jonas Brothers' seventh album, Greetings from Your Hometown.

Season 12 of “Below Deck” debuted on June 2, and the episode was filled with drama, which had fans talking. 

Captain Kerry Titheradge returned as the head of the boat, and he immediately told the crew, “The way I manage, is that I'm very firm, but I'm fair with everybody. But don't take my kindness for weakness.”

Despite his warning, the first big mistake that the crew made was forgetting to bring the charter guests' luggage on board, which had Titheradge scrambling to retrieve them.

“They left the charters luggage on the dock?!?! It's the FIRST charter!” a fan tweeted. Another posted a photo of “Below Deck” veteran Eddie Lucas and wrote, “You know who wouldn't have left the luggage behind?!”

Another point of contention was Chef Lawrence Snowden, who was new to the “Below Deck” franchise, and despite his initial calm demeanor, started stressing out over being filmed.

“Chef is already freaking out. And he's done. Hope Captain has some other chefs lined up,” a viewer wrote. Another shared, “I'm OBSESSED with how much Cheffy hates the cameras.”

Later in the episode, the primary charter guest showed up with a black light and checked the cabin for germs.

“These charter guests have a long list of complaints. They should just go to bed,” a fan quipped. 

A post shared by Fraser (@fraserolender)

According to chief stew Fraser Olender, “Below Deck” season 12 will be full of lots of ups and downs. “There are firings. There are hirings. There are disasters left, right and center. But I cannot tell you enough how dramatic and how fun this season is. It is nonstop,” he told Us Weekly on June 2.

“I was so excited to get into this season. I think I've grown so much since I first started out on the show — and you never know what you're going to get as a crew,” Olender shared.

He continued, “But I just wanted to make sure that out of any season, this one is where I wanted to bring my crew to the best of their ability. I wanted harmony and I wanted love and friendship and peace amongst all the madness. I think we succeeded.”

There's also an incident during season 12 where the authorities get involved. “You haven't seen this yet, but I had to go speak to the local police in French to deal with the situation. It was a lot,” Olender told Decider.

“It was nuts. I was almost embarrassed to discuss the issue we were having with the police. But you've got to do what you've got to do to make it work in these waters,” the reality star shared.

However, Olender added, “I'm very grateful and happy to be here. I know what's required of me and the rest I just roll with. There's always going to be drama, but at least I know, or I feel like I know, how to do the job.”

Former New York concert promoter Heath Miller says he's working with Billy McFarland to stage a Fyre pop-up at his family resort on the Honduran island of Utila.

A Honduras-based hotel owner says he's reviving the Fyre Festival brand alongside Billy McFarland as a pop-up experience at his island resort, marking the latest twist in a bizarre saga. 


Heath Miller, a former New York concert promoter and one-time vp and talent buyer at Webster Hall in Manhattan, says he reached an agreement with McFarland to stage a 300-to-400-person Fyre Resort Pop-Up at his hotel, Coral View Beach Resort, located on the island of Utila, one of Honduras' famed Bay Islands in the Caribbean. The event will run from Sept. 3-10.


	Tickets are cheap: Just book a room at Miller's 25-room resort, and a pass for Fyre is included. Rooms start at $198 per night for singles, $329 for couples, $399 for triples and $449 for the hotel's four-bed room.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Miller is quick to point out that the September event is not being billed as Fyre Festival II, adding that tickets from that event won't get you access to the Fyre Resort Pop-Up, which he says will be more low key than what had been planned for Fyre's comeback festival in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. There will be live entertainment, although Miller notes that he hasn't secured any talent yet and says the festival won't have a large budget or a splashy lineup.


	“This event isn't for an artist looking for a $100,000 fee,” he says. “Honestly, for me, this is a promotional vehicle for my hotel and it plays into my grand plan — I'm working on writing a book on my music career, and the book was supposed to end last June [with a story about] Jack Antonoff in Asbury Park. But instead, I guess Fyre is going to be the final chapter of the book.”


	In Miller's estimation, the controversy around the disastrous 2018 festival — which garnered international headlines when ticketholders arrived on a Bahamian island to find that the promised luxury event had not been realized — may ultimately be the biggest draw.


	“Fyre Festival is a tainted brand that obviously has a horrible reputation, but at the end of the day, this brand can create press and awareness better than Coachella can,” he says.


	Miller has been managing the hotel since 2019 for his late father, who bought the island resort in the 1990s. He says his idea for the Fyre pop-up is partially inspired by Sixthman, the concert and cruise ships company owned by Norwegian Cruise Lines that stages music-themed cruises for artists like Lindsey Stirling, Joe Bonamassa and comedian Nate Bargatze.


	“Originally, I wanted to do fan club and events here,” on Utila, says Miller, who hoped to match music with scuba diving and water excursions. He adds, “Fans want to engage with the artist in unique and different ways and see them play in unique settings,” noting that the Fyre pop-up presented a rare opportunity to build proof of concept. 


	Under the terms of their agreement, McFarland maintains full ownership of Fyre, and Miller will serve as venue manager and site host.


	Miller says he's already secured permits and local approval for the Fyre Resort Pop-Up and said he hopes the famed festival brand creates some positive buzz for Utila. The island is popular year-round with scuba divers and snorkelers who visit the island to swim with sharks and explore the 600-mile-long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, but it isn't as well-known as other Caribbean destinations like Barbados, St. Lucia, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.


	Miller adds he's well aware of McFarland's past failures with Fyre Festival, most famously with the disastrous first edition in 2018, which left hundreds of fans temporarily trapped on Grand Exuma island. McFarland masterminded the event, according to the FBI, convincing fans to shell out thousands for luxury accommodations that turned out to be emergency tents and gourmet meals that were little more than cheese sandwiches.


	McFarland went to prison after admitting to stealing $26 million from investors for the event and has been working to repay them since being released from prison in 2022 after serving four years of his six-year sentence. While serving in solitary confinement, McFarland came up with the idea for a sequel to Fyre, which he had hoped would repair his image, and bounced around different sites in the Bahamas and Mexico before landing on Playa del Carmen near Cancun. McFarland ultimately hired Mexican firm Lost Nights to produce the event and staged a press conference on March 27 with local officials to highlight it.


	However, things went south in April when city leaders from Playa del Carmen announced that no permits for Fyre Festival had been issued in the seaside town. McFarland responded by releasing images of permits that he said proved Fyre was happening, but he later pulled the plug on the event and refunded ticket holders. On April 24, McFarland announced he was selling Fyre's assets and intellectual property and had reached an agreement with a streaming service to license the name.


	Miller says McFarland retains the name for Fyre and has a core team of a half-dozen individuals working with him, including his long-time partner, Michael Falb.


	“I'm well aware of Billy's past and I think it's important that we are transparent about what happened. I personally met with the mayor of Utila when securing the permits for this event and even showed him the documentaries about Fyre Festival,” Miller said of the films FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened and Fyre Fraud, both of which were released in 2019 and chronicled the festival's rise and fall.


	“Billy has issues and one of his biggest flaws is that he tends to trust people more than he should,” Miller says, noting that McFarland reminds him of himself when he was a young promoter working New York's nightlife circuit as an independent concert promoter, both for himself and for John Scher's Metropolitan Concerts and later Webster Hall. Miller notes he worked with McFarland prior to Fyre Festival, when McFarland was running millennial VIP company Magnises.


	“He never stiffed me on a bill — we always got paid what we were owed,” Miller says. “I look at Billy's mistakes and I ask myself what I would have done if I was controlling millions of dollars for a huge party. I don't know. What I can tell you about Billy is that he a big kid at heart that really just wants to throw the world's greatest party.”

Jennie Garth and ex-husband Peter Facinelli recently came together to celebrate a major family milestone: their youngest daughter Fiona's high school graduation. The event was documented on Garth's Instagram, where the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum and Hallmark star posted, “She did it!! My baby girl graduated high school! I am so beyond proud of her!! My heart is filled with so much excitement to see her fly! I love you so much @fionaeveee.”

A post shared by Jennie 🤍 (@jenniegarth)

In the carousel of photos, Garth, 53, posed alongside Fiona, 18, as well as her older daughters Luca, 27, and Lola, 22. Also in the family group was Garth's current husband, David Abrams, whom she married in 2015. The sweet family moment was highlighted by a video showing the family firing confetti as Fiona's name was called at the ceremony.

For Garth and Facinelli, this celebration was about more than just Fiona's academic achievement. The former couple, who were married from 2001 to 2013, have made headlines in recent months for their openly improved post-divorce relationship. Garth told E! News earlier this year, “For so many years, it wasn't as fun as it could have been. We made it seem like it was great and it was all rainbows and ponies, but it was not at times.”

Their relationship saw a turning point when Facinelli appeared on Garth's podcast, “I Choose Me,” in November. Reflecting on their history, Garth said, “We were together for 17 years, and I love his fiancée and his new son. It's just nice to be open and be easy.” Facinelli, 51, who also shares a young son named Jack with fiancée Lily Anne Harrison, echoed these sentiments in a separate interview, telling E! News, “I love her. She's the mother of my kids. I consider her a friend. I consider her husband a friend.”

The graduation celebration marked a joyful moment after a challenging year for the family. In January, Garth and her daughters had to evacuate their home due to Los Angeles wildfires. Facinelli stepped in and offered them refuge, which Garth described in a tearful video as an example of their family's resilience and support. “My family and I are safe, our home made it through the night and we are feeling so blessed, so fortunate, and so lucky,” Garth said at the time. 

Fans were delighted to see the family united for Fiona's big day. Among the many Instagram moments,  she echoed one of her famous lines from “Beverly Hills, 90210,” writing in the caption, “She chose herself!”

The 'Wicked' star will take on the titular role for three nights at the Hollywood Bowl.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Cynthia Erivo has responded to the backlash she received for her upcoming lead role in Jesus Christ Superstar at the Hollywood Bowl.


	After it was announced earlier this year that the Wicked star would be playing Jesus in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's musical, some conservatives were quick to criticize her for taking the role as a Black queer woman. However, during a recent interview with Billboard, Erivo couldn't help but laugh at the negative response.




	“Why not?” she said of her casting. “You can't please everyone. It is legitimately a three-day performance at the Hollywood Bowl where I get to sing my face off. So hopefully they will come and realize, ‘Oh, it's a musical, the gayest place on Earth.'”

	The actress will take to the stage at the famed Hollywood venue from Aug. 1-3, alongside Adam Lambert, who is set to play Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar. The musical is a rock opera that follows the final days of Jesus Christ, leading up to his crucifixion, seen through the eyes of his betrayer, Judas. The musical was initially a concept album before making its Broadway debut in 1971. It has also received several revivals over the years, as well as a film adaptation, directed by Norman Jewison, in 1973.


	Erivo, who won a Tony for her performance in Broadway's The Color Purple, has previously played Mary Magdalene in Morgan James' all-female version of the musical's concept album.


	The Grammy and Emmy winner came out publicly in 2022 on the cover of British Vogue.

¡HOLA! SPECIAL FEATURE

With two major films on the horizon, the horror-thriller 'The Ritual' and the intimate drama 'At the Sea,' Maria Camila Giraldo is stepping into the spotlight with power, purpose, and authenticity. In this exclusive interview with ¡HOLA!, the Colombian actress opens up about her profound spiritual preparation that shaped her performance in the former film, shares what it was like to share the screen with the legendary Al Pacino, and reveals the deeper mission behind her burgeoning production company and holistic wellness brand.

"Realizing I was acting with Al Pacino. That was surreal."

The upcoming movie tells the story of the 1928 exorcism of Emma Schmidt, one of the few cases officially recognized by the Catholic Church. The real-life exorcism took place over 23 days in a secluded Iowa convent, and paranormal activity was documented, including levitation, unearthly voices, and supernatural situations.

It was really hard. I'm very spiritual and very sensitive energetically, and preparing for this required a lot of openness — because you have to be open for emotions and everything that happens. But it also required a lot of spiritual preparation. I remember being very grounded in my meditations and praying and protection because there was definitely something going on around. We were saying the actual prayers of the exorcisms. So yeah, I felt like there was something in the air.

I think that was the trickiest part because everything was so real. Even though it's a story that's far from my reality, and it's based in the 1920s, it felt real. We were filming on this convent… it just felt very palpable. 

And for a lot of us, things were translating outside of the set. Natchez, Mississippi, where we filmed, is one of the most haunted towns in America. I remember one of the first days of rehearsal, Ashley [Greene] — one of my scene partners — asked me, ‘Are you feeling anything?' I was like, ‘Yeah, I am.' Everyone could feel something.

Patricia Heaton, one of the actresses, her sister is a nun. She created these protection medals for exorcisms and gave them to all of us. I believe in that a lot, so I carried it with me all the time.



Then when I'd come home, I would just ground myself in meditation and ask for protection and groundedness. Just to stay connected to something that was very important to me.

Realizing I was acting with Al Pacino. That was surreal. We were doing the table read, and he was doing his lines, and the next line was mine — but I just sat there, staring at him. I got lost in thought. I was like, ‘Oh wait, where were we?'

And spooky… so many things. Things were falling, things were disappearing. I came back to my house and the water kept turning on. I was closing it really strongly, and it kept opening. Just little things.

Very [surprised]. Sometimes I can say the names of big American stars and my parents won't really know them. But Al Pacino? My dad loved 'The Godfather.' He was obsessed with that movie. So when I told him, he was like, ‘Really?!' I think it was shocking for my family. They were happy but like, ‘Whoa — are you serious?' I was like, ‘Yeah guys, I've been doing this a long time.'”

It's two different universes. The preparation for 'At the Sea' felt more grounded, just connecting to the moment and to the humanness of it.

Whereas with 'The Ritual,' I had to learn what it was like in the 1920s, what it meant to be a nun, what it's like to go through an exorcism. It required more research. With 'At the Sea,' it's a reflection of a modern woman going through something really hard and not knowing what to do with it. I loved that.

The director and writers wanted to show the Latino side of the story. In the 1920s, there were a lot of immigrants coming from Mexico, and that was the backstory for Sister Camila. 

It gave me the background to understand that Sister Camila is escaping a terrible reality and hoping for peace, and then an exorcism comes. Her new hope becomes her worst nightmare.

That's the magic of it, right? When an actor stands out, it's because they bring part of their story into the character. Being Latina, and being an immigrant, really helped me ground Sister Camila. I think that's what helped me connect with her.

"Being Latina, and being an immigrant, really helped me ground Sister Camila. I think that's what helped me connect with her."

It feels crazy. I grew up doing telenovelas on Caracol, RCN, and later Telemundo. Before moving to the States, I remember praying for a script that would challenge me. Now I look back and I'm like, ‘Wow, I used to pray for this.'

My fiancé told me, ‘You've been praying for this moment.' And I was like, ‘I have.' Sometimes we work so hard we forget how far we've come. I feel very grateful.

It's intuition. If I feel I have something to say with a story, if it'll make people feel something or shift their perspective, that's what draws me in.

One of the things I loved about The Ritual was the dichotomy between mental health and spirituality. Emma, the possessed girl, is misunderstood, and I went through something similar after a concussion. No one understood what I was going through. That point of view in the script really connected with me.

Yes. Every movie or show is like a different kind of food or a different melody. Sometimes I'm in the mood for R&B, sometimes salsa, sometimes house music. Movies are like that too. They give me what I'm craving. If I need to laugh or reflect on relationships, I go to different stories depending on what I need emotionally.

Just keep going. Just know that it's all unfolding. I still have moments where I think, ‘This is so hard,' but then I look back and realize, ‘It's actually happening.' So just keep going.

"I remember praying for a script that would challenge me. Now I look back and I'm like, ‘Wow, I used to pray for this.'"

I'm very interested in exploring complex female psychology. Growing up and acting in Latin America, I often played characters that helped tell a man's story. Now I want to share the perspective of that other character — the woman who's always been there but hasn't had a voice.

After the concussion, I was going through crazy symptoms. I didn't want to go the medication route. My mom is a holistic Ayurvedic doctor, so I've always leaned toward natural medicine. 

I found these mushrooms and adaptogens through a doctor. I felt relief for the first time in six months. That was the start. And when someone leaves a voicemail saying how much Fungiments helped them, that motivates me. We really can impact lives.

I want a TV show. Hopefully, you'll see me soon on screens. I'd love to be in an HBO or Apple TV show. That's where I'm aiming.

	ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to formulate a joint strategy for the completion of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) railway project, Pakistani state media reported, amid Islamabad's efforts to open new regional trade avenues.


	The development followed a meeting between Pakistan's Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Uzbek Ambassador to Islamabad, during which the two figures held detailed discussions on the approximately 850-kilometer-long railway connectivity project, which includes a 647-kilometer rail track passing through Afghanistan.


	The trilateral initiative was launched in 2021 to enhance regional connectivity by linking Central Asia with Pakistan's southern ports of Gwadar and Karachi through Afghanistan. The project aims to improve trade access for landlocked countries and strengthen economic integration across the region.


	“Upon completion of this project, Pakistan will gain the shortest and most efficient route to Central Asia, which will not only increase trade volumes but also strengthen the region's economy on a solid footing,” Abbasi was quoted as saying by the APP news agency.


	“This railway corridor will significantly reduce transit time and transportation costs, benefiting all stakeholders.”


	Pakistan is seeking to leverage its strategic position as a key trade and transit hub to connect Central Asia with global markets and since last year, there has been a flurry of high-level visits, investment discussions and other economic engagements between Islamabad and Central Asian republics.


	Abbasi highlighted that the corridor is expected to handle an annual freight capacity of 15 million tons, which could help boost exports and imports across the region, according to the report.


	“This project will not only reinforce economic ties but will also play a pivotal role in promoting regional peace and stability,” he said.


	On the occasion, Ambassador Tukhtaev acknowledged investment opportunities in Pakistan's railway sector and emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to foster economic prosperity and create employment for both peoples, according to the APP report.


	Both officials also acknowledged the positive impact of the UAP project in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan.


	Last week, Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also held a phone call with his Uzbek counterpart, Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich, to discuss steps to advance the UAP railway project, including the framework agreement and its signing mechanism.


	Over the years, the project has faced significant challenges, including security concerns in Afghanistan, and the need to reconcile differing railway gauges across the three countries.


	“Emphasizing the importance of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity, both leaders agreed to work closely for an early finalization of the framework agreement,” the Pakistani foreign office said.


	LAGOS/JOHANNESBURG/MANILA: At a tense meeting in Nigeria's capital Abuja, health workers poured over drug registers and testing records to gauge whether US aid cuts would unravel years of painstaking work against tuberculosis in one of Africa's hardest hit countries.


	For several days in May, they brainstormed ways to limit the fallout from a halt to US funding for the TB Local Network (TB LON), which delivers screening, diagnosis and treatment.


	“To tackle the spread of TB, you must identify cases and that is in a coma because of the aid cuts,” said Ibrahim Umoru, coordinator of the African TB Coalition civil society network, who was at the Abuja meeting.


	“This means more cases will be missed and disaster is looming.”


	This desperate struggle to save endangered programs is being replicated from the Philippines to South Africa as experts warn that US aid cuts risk reviving a deadly infectious disease that kills around one million people every year.


	President Donald Trump's gutting of the US Agency for International Development has put TB testing and tracing on hold in Pakistan and Nigeria, stalled vital research in South Africa and left TB survivors lacking support in India.


	The World Health Organization says “the drastic and abrupt cuts in global health funding” threaten to reverse the gains made by global efforts to fight the disease — namely 79 million lives saved since 2000 — with rising drug resistance and conflicts exacerbating the risks.


	In Nigeria, TB LON is in the firing line.


	The project was set up in 2020, during Trump's first term, and received $45 million worth of funding from USAID. The US development agency said at the time it was committed to a “TB free Nigeria.”


	Five years later and with the same president back in charge but now with a more radical “America first” agenda, USAID support for TB LON's community testing work was terminated in February, according to a TB LON official. The official did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the project.


‘HARD WORK IN JEOPARDY'
	TB kills 268 Nigerians every day and cases have historically been under-reported increasing the risk of transmission. If one case is missed, that person can transmit TB to 15 people over a year, according to the World Health Organization.


	The Thomson Reuters Foundation spoke to half a dozen health workers who collect TB test samples for TB LON but had stopped doing so in January due to the US aid freeze.


	Between 2020-2024, TB LON screened around 20 million people in southwestern states in Nigeria, and more than 100,000 patients were treated as a result.


	“All that hard work is in jeopardy if we don't act quickly,” Umoru said, adding that non-profits working with TB LON had laid off more than 1,000 contract workers who used to do TB screening.


	Nigeria's health ministry did not respond to request for comment on the effect of the USAID cuts on TB programs.


	In March, First Lady Oluremi Tinubu declared TB a national emergency and donated 1 billion naira ($630,680) to efforts to eradicate the disease by 2030.


	In South Africa, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said TB and HIV programs had been disrupted across the country, making patient tracking and testing more difficult, according to a statement sent to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.


	South Africa had a TB incidence rate of 427 per 100,000 people in 2023, government data showed, down 57 percent from 2015. TB-related deaths in South Africa dropped 16 percent over that period, the data showed.


	Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi said in May that the government would launch an End TB campaign to screen and test 5 million people, and was also seeking new donor funding.


	“Under no circumstances will we allow this massive work performed over a period of more than a decade and half to collapse and go up in smoke,” he said at the time, referring to efforts to tackle TB and HIV.


BLOW TO CRITICAL RESEARCH


	South Africa is also a hub for research into both TB and HIV and the health experts say funding cuts risk derailing this vital work.


	The Treatment Action Group (TAG), a community-based research and policy think tank, says around 39 clinical research sites and at least 20 TB trials and 24 HIV trials are at risk.


	“Every major TB treatment and vaccine advance in the past two decades has relied on research carried out in South Africa,” said TAG TB project co-director Lindsay McKenna in a March statement.


	People struggling with poor nutrition and those living with HIV — the latter affects 8 million people in South Africa — were also more at risk of contracting TB as aid cuts made them more vulnerable by derailing nutrition programs, community outreach and testing, said Cathy Hewison, head of MSF's TB working group.


	“It's the number one killer of people with HIV,” she said.


	In the Philippines, US cuts have disrupted TB testing in four USAID-funded projects, and affected the supply of drugs, Stop TB Partnership, a UN-funded agency said.


	“The country has a nationwide problem with recurrent drug shortages, which is leading to a direct impact on efforts to eliminate TB,” said Ghazali Babiker, head of mission for MSF Philippines.


	In Pakistan, which sees 510,000 TB infections each year, MSF said US cuts had disrupted TB screening in communities and other services in the hard-hit southeastern province of Sindh.


	“We are worried that the US funding cuts that have impacted the community-based services will have a disproportionate effect on children, leading to more children with TB and more avoidable deaths,” said Ei Hnin Hnin Phyu, medical coordinator with MSF in Pakistan.


	“We cannot afford to let funding decisions cost children's lives.”


	ISLAMABAD: A high-level Pakistani delegation, set up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has urged the United States (US) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) envoys at the United Nations to play their role for the resumption of a “comprehensive dialogue” between Pakistan and India to resolve the Kashmir dispute and other issues, Pakistan's mission to the UN and state media said on Tuesday.


	Led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the nine-member parliamentary delegation arrived in New York on Monday as the first stop in a diplomatic mission to present Pakistan's position in world capitals following Islamabad's recent military conflict with India. The group headed by Bhutto-Zardari will visit New York, Washington DC, London and Brussels. Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will also visit Moscow.


	Tensions between Pakistan and India are high after they struck a ceasefire on May 10 following the most intense military confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors in decades. Both countries accuse the other of supporting militancy on each other's soil — a charge both capitals deny.


	The latest escalation last month took place following weeks of tensions after India blamed Pakistan for supporting an April 22 attack on the Kashmir territory it governs that killed 26 tourists. Pakistan denied involvement in the incident and called for an international probe. Both countries traded missiles, artillery fire and drone strikes before Washington brokered a ceasefire on May 10.


	” Bhutto-Zardari has urged the US to play its role in ensuring comprehensive dialogue between Pakistan and India to address all outstanding issues,” the state-run Radio Pakistan broadcaster reported after the Pakistani delegates' meeting with US Acting Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Dorothy Shea in New York.


	Bhutto-Zardari briefed Ambassador Shea on the developments following the April 22 attack, expressing deep concern over India's immediate attribution of blame to Pakistan without any “credible investigation or verifiable evidence.”


	“Such premature and baseless allegations exacerbate tensions and undermine prospects for constructive dialogue and peace,” he was quoted as saying.


	On Monday, the Pakistani delegates held a meeting with OIC envoys at the UN, wherein they reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to peace, restraint, and diplomacy, and called for the restoration of the Indus Waters Treaty by India, full respect for the ceasefire, and the resumption of a “comprehensive dialogue, with the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute at its core,” Pakistan's Permanent Mission to the UN said.


	India suspended the decades-old Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan a day after the attack at the Pahalgam resort town. The move drew a sharp response from Islamabad, which said any attempts to divert or stop the flow of its waters by India would be considered an “act of war.”


	About 80 percent of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects serving the country of some 250 million.


	“Bhutto-Zardari expressed grave concern at the unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a move that Pakistan considers a blatant act of weaponizing water and a violation of international and treaty obligations,” the Pakistani mission said.


	The former Pakistani foreign minister thanked OIC countries for their efforts and role aimed at de-escalation, mediation and ceasefire during the conflict. He highlighted that the only path to peace was in dialogue, engagement and diplomacy.


	“OIC has emerged as the moral conscience of the world in these difficult times,” Bhutto-Zardari said, thanking the OIC member states for their steadfast support for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.


	The statement said that the OIC's permanent representatives appreciated Pakistan's briefing and reaffirmed their solidarity with the country.


	“They reiterated their concern over the worsening security situation in South Asia and stressed the importance of upholding the principles of the UN Charter and international law and in this regard, the sanctity of treaties, including the Indus Waters Treaty,” Pakistan's UN mission said.


	The Pakistani delegation also met Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, president of the UN Security Council for June, according to a statement issued by Bhutto-Zardari party.


	“The Pakistani delegation stressed that in the face of a growing trend of unilateralism and escalation, the Security Council must play its crucial role to ensure peace and conflict resolution,” it said.


	The delegation urged the Security Council to play a “proactive role” in promoting de-escalation, ensuring respect for international law and treaties and facilitating peaceful resolution of disputes.


	The statement said Birkett reaffirmed the Security Council's commitment to upholding international peace and security in line with its mandate.


	Bitter rivals India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two of them over the disputed region of Kashmir, since gaining independence from British rule in 1947. Both claim the Himalayan territory in its entirety but rule it in part.


	ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) surged to an all-time high of more than 120,000 points on Tuesday, with analysts attributing the rally to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) financing package for Pakistan and strong buying by insurance companies in banking, fertilizer and power sectors.


	The benchmark KSE-100 index closed at an unprecedented high of 120,450.87 points, marking a gain of 1,573.07 points, or 1.32 percent, from the previous day's close of 118,877.80.


	The development follows the ADB's approval of an $800 million package to help Pakistan enhance fiscal reforms and economic stability, alongside the government's approval of over Rs800 billion for public sector development projects in the upcoming budget.


	“Stocks closed all time high led by scrips across the board after ADB approval of $800 million financing package,” Ahsan Mehanti, CEO of Arif Habib Commodities, told Arab News.


	“Government set FY26 growth target at 4.2percent and government approval for Rs880 billion PSDP in the federal budget FY26 announcements next week.”


	Mehanti said the anticipated budgetary relief for oil refineries, real estate and agriculture sectors, along with gains in rupee's value, played a catalytic role in the bullish close at the PSX.


	Raza Jafri, head of Intermarket Securities, said this was the first time the KSE-100 Index has ever closed above the 120,000-point mark.


	“Strong buying by insurance companies in sectors such as banks, fertilizers and power led the market higher,” he said.


	The budget for fiscal year 2025–26 is expected to be presented in Pakistan's lower house of parliament on June 10, following the Eid Al-Adha holidays.


	Pakistan's annual inflation rate rose to 3.5 percent in May, though the country's macroeconomic outlook has improved in recent months, supported by a stronger current account balance, increased remittances and declining inflation.


	Authorities remain cautious as they aim to build on recent economic stabilization, guide the country toward gradual growth, and reaffirm their commitment to ongoing economic reforms.


	ISLAMABAD: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday called for normal relations between India and Pakistan and expressed interest in closer counterterrorism cooperation with Islamabad during a meeting with a senior aide of Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Moscow.


	The meeting came as Syed Tariq Fatemi, special assistant to the prime minister, began a visit to Russia weeks after India and Pakistan exchanged missiles, drones and artillery fire, following heightened tensions that ended with a US-brokered ceasefire on May 10.


	Pakistan has since call for a “composite dialogue” with India to discuss all outstanding issues, though New Delhi has rejected direct talks after Washington said the two countries had agreed to meet at a neutral venue to defuse tensions.


	Both sides have also formed delegations to present their respective positions over the conflict to the international community.


	“At the outset of his visit to the Russian Federation, Syed Tariq Fatemi, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) called on Sergey Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, this afternoon,” Pakistan's embassy in Moscow said in a statement. “He also briefed the Russian Foreign Minister, in detail, about the recent developments in South Asia, conveying Pakistan's perspective on the dangers of escalation as well as the dire consequences of India's threat to reduce the flow of the Indus Waters Treaty, by holding the Treaty in a so-called ‘abeyance.'”


	“Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed Russia's support for promotion of normal relations between the two countries and its positive effect in the region,” the statement added.


	Fatemi also delivered a letter from Prime Minister Sharif to President Vladimir Putin and conveyed Pakistan's desire to expand cooperation with Russia in areas including energy, trade and connectivity.


	Lavrov, for his part, expressed satisfaction over the “steadily growing bilateral cooperation” and cited specific initiatives, including new steel mills and connectivity projects.


	“He [Lavrov] also stated that Russia looked forward to working closely with Pakistan, within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), especially in the field of counter-terrorism,” the embassy said.


	Russia and Pakistan have strengthened ties in recent years through growing bilateral cooperation, particularly in energy, and by working together on regional platforms such as the SCO, where both are full members.


	ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday launched a cybercrime helpline, 1799, that aims to ensure swift resolution of complaints, Pakistani state media reported.


	The development came during Naqvi's visit to the headquarters of the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which was established earlier this year, the APP news agency reported.


	The minister toured various departments, including the helpline center, forensic lab and network security section, and appreciated the staff for their efforts to combat cybercrime.


	“The helpline is now fully operational, and citizens can lodge cybercrime complaints by calling 1799,” the interior minister was quoted as saying.


	Pakistan transformed the Cybercrime Wing of its Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) into an autonomous organization and named it the NCCIA in April. It followed the introduction of a new law to regulate social media content, with journalist groups and rights activists saying it was aimed at curbing press freedom and dissent on social media.


	Enacted in 2016 and further tightened with amendments this January, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) was drafted with the stated aim to combat cybercrimes such as hacking, online harassment, and data breaches. Pakistani officials defended the PECA law, under which offenders can be handed prison sentences of up to three years and fines of Rs2 million ($7,200).


	Naqvi directed NCCIA officials to ensure quick resolution of all complaints, saying the agency was established to meet the demands of the modern digital era, according to the report.


	He emphasized the need for the use of advanced technology, software and hardware to fight cybercrime effectively and stressed the need to hire talented staff and equiping them with all necessary resources.


	The development came as authorities announced busting a child sexual abuse ring, allegedly run by a German national, in Azad Kashmir's capital of Muzaffarabad.


	“A state-of-the-art facility was formed with modern cameras and over there, children from poor families were exploited by giving money first and then blackmailing,” State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry said at a presser on Tuesday.


	“Their videos were sold on the dark web.”


	The NCCIA busted the ring in a five-hour operation on May 23 and arrested two suspects, according to the minister. Ten kids were also found at the facility, of which six were sent to the Child Protection Bureau.


	“The German man used to facilitate and sell this [content],” Chaudhry said, without disclosing the identity of the suspect. “We are trying to reach him legally.”


	Child sexual abuse has been a widespread issue in Pakistan, where perpetrators are often family members, teachers or trusted people. Poverty, lack of education and societal attitudes contribute to the problem. While laws exist, their implementation remains a challenge. Various NGOs are also working to raise awareness about the issue and support survivors.

New calculations have revealed that the super-energetic jets produced by spinning black holes could be a source for elusive dark matter particles.

In the face of eye-watering costs, long construction times and the Trump administration's slashing of federal science funding, physicists have proposed a cheaper alternative to the next-generation of particle supercolliders — peering into black holes.

Scientists initially hoped that the elusive particles that make up dark matter would be spat out by high-energy proton collisions inside CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), yet so far no such detection has been made.

Finding dark matter, therefore, could mean waiting decades until new, higher energy, supercolliders are built.

Or perhaps not, according to one group of researchers. Publishing their findings June 3 in the journal Physical Review Letters, they suggest that the answers we're looking for could be in violent collisions inside the fast-moving accretion disks that surround enormous black holes.

"One of the great hopes for particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider is that it will generate dark matter particles, but we haven't seen any evidence yet," study co-author Joseph Silk, an astrophysics professor at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Oxford, U.K. said in a statement. "That's why there are discussions underway to build a much more powerful version, a next-generation supercollider. But as we invest $30 billion and wait 40 years to build this supercollider — nature may provide a glimpse of the future in super massive black holes."

Particle colliders work by smashing particles into each other at near-light-speeds, creating interactions from which the most fundamental elements of the universe briefly emerge as high-energy debris. It's from these collisions that the LHC discovered the Higg's Boson in 2012, the elusive particle that gives all others their mass.

But despite this discovery and many others (alongside key contributions to the development of the internet, computing and some cancer therapies) the LHC has yet to produce dark matter, possibly because it is incapable of reaching the energies required to produce its particles.

One of the universe's most mysterious components, dark matter makes up roughly 27% of our cosmos's missing content. But it doesn't interact with light, so it has yet to be directly detected. This means that despite countless observations of the ways it shapes our universe, scientists are still unsure of where dark matter comes from, or even what it is.

Seeking a new source of dark matter particles, the researchers behind the new study looked to black holes. Observations by space telescopes have revealed that rapidly spinning black holes can launch massive jets of plasma from the accretion disks of hot matter that surround them.

And according to the researchers' calculations, these jets could be far more powerful than first thought — enabling particles to collide at similar energy levels as those projected for future supercolliders.

"Some particles from these collisions go down the throat of the black hole and disappear forever," Silk said. "But because of their energy and momentum, some also come out, and it's those that come out which are accelerated to unprecedentedly high energies."

Silk's team calculated that the energy produced by black hole jets could be "as powerful as you get from a supercollider, or more," adding that "it's very hard to say what the limit is."

To detect the particles zipping from black hole collisions, the researchers propose tracking them with observatories designed to study supernovae, such as the South Pole's IceCube Neutrino Observatory or the Kilometer Cube Neutrino Telescope.

"If supermassive black holes can generate these particles by high-energy proton collisions, then we might get a signal on Earth, some really high-energy particle passing rapidly through our detectors," Silk said. "That would be the evidence for a novel particle collider within the most mysterious objects in the universe, attaining energies that would be unattainable in any terrestrial accelerator. We'd see something with a strange signature that conceivably provides evidence for dark matter, which is a bit more of a leap but it's possible."

The internet has more UFO footage to analyze.

As OutKick readers know, there are few topics on the internet that fire people up as much as footage of unknown objects in the sky.

As I often say, the reason why is that we have limited to no information about what's going on, and it seems like the government has no interest in sharing what it knows.

The more information that's concealed, the more it invites conspiracy theories. That's just basic human nature. Now, we have a new video taking the internet by storm.

The YouTube account @paulodeleon.ufologo posted a three-minute video showing several different angles of an object flying through the sky.

The footage was filmed around the southern Valley of Guatemala City, according to BroBible.

You can watch the footage below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

It's important to keep an open-mind in life. Generally speaking, I'd like to think that's the best way to approach things.

However, we can't just accept everything as fact. That'd be foolish, and it waters down concrete evidence. While I'm certainly no expert, this damn sure doesn't look crazy to me.

It looks like it could be a drone or maybe even a small plane. I definitely am not buying that it is a "potential mothership," as described in the video's title.

Not buying all that, but I could also be wrong. I'm certainly not going to sit here with the OutKick audience and declare myself the smartest person out there.

Though The X-Files is arguably the show to have jump-started the paranormal procedural craze, it's hard to deny that The CW's Supernatural rivals the alien-based series in ongoing popularity, having done well to follow in its footsteps with its engrossing monster-of-the-week storytelling and characters. While the years since have similarly seen other shows attempt to match Supernatural's success, the one that has stood the test of time to become the best successor is The Librarians.

Developed by John Rogers and showrun by Dean Devlin, The Librarians served as a continuation of the Noah Wyle-led movie trilogy of the same name, following Wyle's Flynn Carsen as he's forced to relocate to a new Annex to try and tether The Library back to his world following an attack from the Serpent Brotherhood. This leads to him crossing paths with former Librarian candidates Cassandra Cillian, Jacob Stone, and Ezekiel Jones, all of whom land the job and, joined by new Guardian Eve Baird, embark on investigations regarding magical happenings, while Flynn searches to restore The Library.

Even with both The X-Files and Supernatural, one of the biggest problems I've had with similar shows is their difficulty striking a balance between their full-season arcs and the cases of the week. The X-Files frequently became troubled by the personal lives of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson affecting their production availability, leading to story changes that were never as engaging as the ones from the start of the series. Supernatural similarly got off to a great start with its first few seasons, while those after season 5, its originally planned final season, were a mixed bag.

...Devlin and Rogers always found a strong way to strike that balance by keeping seasons to no more than a dozen episodes.

The Librarians smartly avoids having 20-plus-episode seasons, which ultimately requires some filler episodes to pad out that runtime. That's not to say that some of the aforementioned shows' filler episodes weren't great, as they were actually some of the best, but they largely distracted from the intriguing season arcs. For The Librarians, Devlin and Rogers always found a strong way to strike that balance by keeping seasons to no more than a dozen episodes.

One of the best examples of this is the show's second season, which saw Shakespeare's iconic villain Prospero serve as the overarching villain with the help of James Moriarty, brought to life via magic from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Nearly every episode in the season held some kind of connection to the group's efforts to stop Prospero from undoing The Tempest's ending by reclaiming his magical staff, even if they shifted their focus to seemingly isolated investigations.

With the original trilogy of movies having been almost exclusively focused on Wyle's Flynn Carsen, introducing not one, but four new protagonists for The Librarians could certainly have been alienating. And yet, Rogers and Devlin did a wonderful job putting together a roster just as exciting to follow as Flynn. Christian Kane, a frequent Devlin collaborator on the likes of Leverage and Almost Paradise, brings much of the same comedy as his other roles, and while his characters' supposed lack of fighting skills compared to Eve may not be believable, he expertly captures Stone's passion for art.

TNT's Leverage remains a true delight of a twist on the heist genre nearly a decade later, albeit with just a few issues that keep it from perfection.

Admittedly, John Harlan Kim's Ezekiel took a while to grow on me, as he was a typical thief out for his own gain, and his selfishness was sometimes less comedic and more grating. Lindy Booth's Cassie steals the show every time she's onscreen, and her mix of quirky social awkwardness and genuine heart also makes her one of the most gripping characters, given how the show explores her life-threatening tumor. Meanwhile, Rebecca Romijn's Eve is a pretty run-of-the-mill action heroine in the writing, despite being a nice change of pace from similar genre fare with male guardian characters.

While I do generally enjoy the characters, The Librarians could have improved by giving its characters deeper development. Cassie enjoys the most range in her evolution, not only with her acceptance of her tumor and gifts, but also her use of magic. But given just how engaging this was, and that it encompassed multiple episodes across every season, it made it all the more disappointing that Ezekiel, Stone, and Eve's character growths were essentially done at a fraction of Cassie's.

With the show offering a wide range of foes for the titular group to face, from vampires to Egyptian gods and snow trolls, The Librarians' production values were certainly an important thing for the show's adventures, and they thankfully pulled it off to exhilarating success. The show primarily utilizes great practical effects, which is always a better choice, but considering how underwhelming cable TV CGI could look, I was largely impressed by how good the majority of it looked which, when combined with its fun storytelling and great characters, continues to make it one of the best Supernatural successors out there.

The Librarians is available to stream in its entirety on Prime Video.

WASHINGTON — Rumors have spread in recent weeks about a famous, cursed doll that allegedly went missing while on the road for a traveling exhibit. 

If this sounds like the plot of a horror movie, you're closer than you'd think. The doll is the supposedly demon-possessed "Annabelle" doll owned by ghost hunters Ed and Loraine Warren. But luckily for people with pediophobia (the official name for the fear of dolls), the threat of a possessed doll unleashed on the U.S. is confined to the realm of fiction. 

Rumors began circulating in May that Annabelle had gone missing in the midst of a paranormal tour across the U.S. with some other items from the Warrens' collection. 

But video evidence shows the doll, which isn't supposed to be moved in order to avoid antagonizing the malevolent spirit inside, safely back at home behind glass at the Warrens' Occult Museum in Connecticut. 

Annabelle is a supposedly haunted Raggedy Ann doll which, according to rumor, became supernaturally active sometime in the 1970s. 

The Warrens, who make a living investigating paranormal phenomenon and writing about them, say they were contacted by a student nurse in 1970 about issues with the doll. 

The student was given the doll as a gift, but it quickly began acting strangely, and a psychic told her that it was inhabited by the ghost of a girl named "Annabelle." According to the legend, the student and her roommate tried to live with the doll's growing supernatural nature as it appeared and disappeared seemingly at random. 

Eventually, the doll began showing aggressive behavior, fixating on a friend of the roommates named Lou. Threatening notes were left to Lou on parchment, despite nobody in the house having any on hand, and on at least one occasion, Lou reported being attacked physically by the doll. It reportedly scratched him across the chest and tried to strangle him. 

The Warrens were called in and determined the doll had been demonically possessed. They then took the doll to house it safely in their paranormal museum.

In 2025, the Warrens began a traveling tour, showing off pieces from their museum to paranormal lovers across the U.S. with stops in San Antonio, Texas and New Orleans. 

New Orleans is where the rumors began taking off, after a sold-out event in mid-May. Rumors started spreading after guests at the next stop on the tour, in White Castle, Louisiana, noticed Annabelle wasn't part of the collection on display. The hashtag #AnnabelleMissing began popping up on social media, but it was considered a joke. 

At first. 

A day after Annabelle's supposed "disappearance" was first noticed, 10 inmates escaped from a New Orleans prison, sparking a citywide manhunt. Days later, fire broke out at the Nottoway Plantation near White Castle. 

While both of these incidents were likely unrelated (The New Orleans inmates tunneled through a hole behind a toilet, and the plantation was a flammable wooden structure from the 1850s), it didn't stop paranormal enthusiasts from linking them to the supposedly missing doll. 

But video from the New England Society For Psychic Research shows Annabelle was simply put back in her glass enclosure at the Connecticut museum between shows. It's unclear why she was removed halfway through the tour, but it's unlikely that she got up and walked herself back. 

The story of Annabelle is the basis for a character of the same name in the Conjuring Universe, a shared-universe series of horror movies. 

The doll was the inspiration for 2014's Annabelle, 2017's Annabelle: Creation and 2019's Annabelle Comes Home. It also makes appearances in a number of other films in the series.

Australia has been receiving high-level briefings from the United States' UFO task force for years, despite the repeated denials of the top military brass, newly revealed emails show.

Login or signup to continue reading

Freedom of information documents from December 2021 show US officials discussing a briefing regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) - the modern term for UFOs - with its Five Eyes allies.

The email chain included officials from the United States UAP Task Force (UAPTF) and an Australian defence representative, using a US Department of Defence email address.

"Re tomorrow's UAP briefing, I received confirmation from Australia and Canada they will be here ... and of course UK," a UAPTF official wrote. 

However, a scheduling conflict led to the meeting being rescheduled for early January, 2022, much to the annoyance of the Office Under the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security (OUSD).

"I recall you and your team said last week that you wanted to come in today to brief the other partners. Because of this I urged the partners to build time into their schedules and come in for the brief," the OUSD official wrote.

"The last thing we want to do is be dismissive of our allies and their time," a UAPTF official replied.

"We definitely would like to continue this conversation with the partners, and now have an obligation to do so for multiple reasons."

The former Chief of Air Force - and now Vice Chief of Defence - Air Marshal Robert Chipman twice told senators during an estimates hearing that Australia had not been briefed on UAPs after the email exchange and rescheduled Five Eyes briefing. 

In November 2022, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked if the US had discussed UAPs with Australian intelligence services or the Air Force.

"I'm not aware of any formal discussions that we've held with the US," Air Marshal Chipman said.

"I imagine it would have come across my desk if those discussions were held in the last four months."

During the Senate estimates hearing the following year, the Air Marshal was more adamant in response to Senator Whish-Wilson's questions, which specifically queried if Australian defence attaches had received UAPTF briefings.

"No," Air Marshal Chipman said.

"No briefings at all," Senator Whish-Wilson said.

"No," Air Marshal Chipman repeated.

Briefing notes prepared in May 2022 for Air Marshall Chipman's Senate estimate hearing also state that neither "the US nor any other nation or ally" had requested or offered to collaborate on the issue of UAPs.

"Defence has no desire to seek collaboration on this issue," the briefing note states.

The Department of Defence refused to answer questions from The Canberra Times.

Grant Lavac, an Australian civilian UAP researcher, said the lack of transparency was "quite concerning".

"The Chief of Air Force leads all discussions on UAP in Australia, so if there's one person that needs to know what is happening on this topic in an Australian context and our discussions with allies, it's him," Mr Lavac said.

"He's either uniformed because there is a complete lack of intelligence sharing, or there's a degree of incompetence, or it's something more sinister like plausible deniability.

"Any one of those three scenarios is concerning."

It's not the first time the Australian Defence Force has misled Senators about the nation's UAP activities.

In 2024, Defence officials admitted Australia sent representatives to a UAP briefing in the Pentagon, after vigorously denying any involvement.

The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by members of the Five Eyes alliance, was later released by the US government.

It shows the alliance - which includes US, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand - met for a "caucus working group" to "cultivate shared awareness of allies' UAP issues, detection, and mitigation activities and challenges".

They discussed the need for "networks to share Five Eyes UAP reporting", including documents marked "top secret" and "special intelligence", along with UAP "collection planning".

"The intention is to develop a framework for future UAP collaboration," one document said.

Australia's UAP policy has previously been criticised for being out of step with its closest military allies, including the US, which introduced mandatory UAP reporting for defence personnel in 2021.

The US considers UAPs a potential flight safety and national security risk, while other allies have acknowledged the unknown aerial phenomenon, including the UK, Canada, France and Spain.

The Canberra Times has previously reported Australian Defence personnel don't feel comfortable reporting UAP sightings through official channels and freedom of information documents revealed senior Defence officials mocked the subject while preparing briefing notes.

The Australian Defence Force stopped collecting reports of UAPs in 1996, "after determining there was no scientific or other compelling reason to continue to devote resources to the recording and investigation of UAP".

As ever, excited middle aged men make dramatic sounding declarations around "anomalous data" originating from the astonishing amount of kit such as ground-penetrating radar and drones they have deployed at the 512 acre ranch in an effort to discover the truth about events there - and around there.

Events such as strange cattle mutilations, UFO sightings in "UFO Alley" and other paranormal events. Up to this point they have focused on an area of high activity they call "The Triangle" where equipment has inexplicably malfunctioned, possibly, some researchers have argued, as it may be a location where 'interdimensional portals' exist.

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence offers tons of strategy in an excellently designed euro game about finding alien life – and it's getting a new expansion!

Whether you imagine aliens to be benevolent givers of distant technology, horrible monsters from beyond the stars, or just some single-celled bacterium, there's no argument that finding alien life would be a major discovery. But until that happens, we can imagine what it would be like to be part of SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a competitive strategy game with resource management and some tableau building. The goal of each player is to earn the most victory points by the end of the 5th round. Victory points are scored in a vast variety of ways. However, players will be mostly wanting to find traces of life on various planets in order to discover new alien life and learn more about them to score big.

On each players turn, they will perform various actions like launching probes to scout out nearby planets, dropping landers on those planets to do some deeper analysis, scanning deep space around Earth, discovering new technologies, analyze data, and more.

Depending on the technologies each player unlocks, they will have a different edge over their competition for each different action. For example, one technology makes landing a rover cheaper, while another offers a wider range while scanning deep space.

As players are racing to launch probes, drop rovers, and also land on the multitude of moons, they might score points based on who got there first, who did the most research, and so on. But one the alien life is found, the game really begins!

There are several different alien species to be discovered, and players won't know which they've found until it's discovered. At that point, the aliens special setup and rules are revealed. The alien species will offer new cards for players to collect into their hand as well as new ways to earn points and resources.

The game ends at the end of the 5th round. At which point the player with the most points wins!

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a game that offers a ton of strategic depth. Plus there are lot of different tactics to reach victory. There are many different mechanics and systems that seamlessly work together in order to offer a great gaming experience. It's on the heavier side of complexity. But if that's not an issue for you gaming group, you might love SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

You'll be able to expand your search for alien life later this year. SETI: Space Agencies adds asymmetric organizations that will change how you scan the stars. These private tech companies and global research networks have unique abilities, strategic advantages, and starting conditions. 

The expansion introduces new alien species with their own unique traits, as well as more than 40 project cards that provide variety and strategic options. It also adds a new mechanic, Signal Tokens, that enhances scanning efficiency.

SETI: Space Agencies arrives in Q4 this year.

GOP Sen. Michael Fesi, of Houma, who apparently believes in chemtrail conspiracy theories

The Louisiana Legislature has passed a new bill to outlaw “chemtrails,” a made-up and very fake thing that conspiracy theorists and other assorted fringe people believe in.

Because of course.

After the House May 28 killed a bill to ban fluoride in drinking water, there was the slightest sliver of hope that lawmakers wouldn't agree to other conspiracy measures. That hope was apparently as short-lived as it was small.

Following House passage of Senate Bill 46 — which was authored by Houma Republican state Sen. Michael "Big Mike" Fesi — on June 1, Senate President Cameron Henry, a Metairie Republican, formally “enrolled” the bill, meaning it will become law — unless Gov. Jeff Landry vetoes it.

Unlike many of the other fake conspiracy theories that now make up much of the GOP's policy agenda, the chemtrail conspiracy theory seems to be relatively new. For instance, a Telegraph article from 2017 traces the scientifically debunked theory to the 1990s after the Air Force published a paper about theoretical efforts to control or influence the weather.

The theory goes something like this: All those white streaks you see in the sky caused by plane exhaust are not plane exhaust that has gotten more common over the years as more and more freight and commercial travel happens in the sky. Rather, this clearly unhinged theory claims that those streaks are actually dangerous chemicals that "they" are pumping into the sky for ... reasons.

Who are "they?" That's a great question. Like fingerprints, no two chemtrail conspiracists agree on all the details. That said, they typically choose from one of the "thems" commonly blamed for such made up things, including but not limited to:

The Government;

The Military;

The Corporations;

The Jews;

The Communists; and of course

The Aliens.

But even if there's no one "them" to blame, surely there's a reason, right? Again, that's up for debate. The point of spraying these unidentified-but-they're-real-man-do-your-research chemicals varies depending on a variety of factors, including political affiliation, how long the person has been using YouTube, their familiarity with legendary crank Art Bell, how many Burning Mans they've attended and of course, drug use. Here's just some of the many possible answers you might get:

Fesi and other Louisiana Republicans appear to have put their chips on “weather control,” based on the plain language of the bill. Who Fesi thinks is behind this preposterous fake plot is unclear.

There is one interesting difference between the other anti-science theories like anti-vaccine propaganda or the weird anti-fluoride movement that have become Republican policy. Those conspiracies have deep roots in conservative fringe elements that believed they were Communist plots to, as the 1964 classic Dr. Strangelove put it, steal or otherwise contaminate our “precious bodily fluids.” Chemtrails, however, were until recently largely the domain of drug addled, left-leaning hippie conspiracy theorists.

While the law may seem silly — because on one level, it clearly is — it could have significant implications. Conspiracy theorists could use the bill to challenge flight routes, the construction and location of airports, or file costly suits against airlines and air freight companies. Those, in turn, could increase costs and disruptions to companies and consumers.

There is no evidence that plane exhaust is part of part of some vast, coordinated plot, in large part because no such plot exists. Similarly, there is no evidence that the government is attempting to control the weather. Meteorology remains one of the least understood and inexact scientific disciplines.

And then there's the logistics of such a conspiracy. In order to undertake such a conspiracy, literally tens of thousands of people across the globe would have to be in on it, including people manufacturing the fictional weather control chemicals and dispersing equipment, the baggage handlers standing there while the fake technicians are loading it into planes, pilots, plane mechanics, air traffic controllers, and political leaders of countries that don't like each other. That's not even considering the untold thousands of red-tape loving, approval stamp wielding bureaucrats needed to undertake such a feat.

There is, however, clear, scientifically demonstrated evidence that burning fossil fuels like jet fuel is bad for the environment and human health. However, Fesi and other Republicans have not proposed banning them.

Because of course.
