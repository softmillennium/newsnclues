                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over 600 Palestinians have been killed or injured near the US-backed sites in just a week. Major U.S. firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has pulled out of its involvement in the U.S. and Israel's supposed humanitarian aid scheme in Gaza as human rights groups have warned that the operation is actually a “death trap” that has led to hundreds of casualties so far. BCG withdrew its ground operation team from Tel Aviv on Friday, The Washington Post reports, and has terminated its contract with the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The firm was selected last fall to develop the idea that quickly became yet another avenue for Israeli military massacres when it first opened aid sites last Wednesday. Sources told The Post that the operation at large will be in jeopardy without BCG's involvement, with the firm in charge of setting prices for contractors who built GHF's four distribution centers in Gaza. “They are actually making the wheels turn,” one person familiar said of BCG's role. GHF seems determined to continue the operation, however, and has reportedly tapped an evangelical leader and vehement Christian Zionist, Johnnie Moore, to lead the group after its CEO Jake Wood resigned last week. Moore, in charge of the project seen as a way for Israel and the U.S. to further their extermination of Palestinians, once lauded President Donald Trump's plan to forcibly expel all Palestinians from Gaza. Humanitarian groups have shunned the GHF operation since it was first announced months ago, saying that it is just another way for Israel to deny Palestinians crucial needs like food and water. Over 100 aid seekers in Gaza have been killed since GHF began operations, according to health officials, with Israeli forces seemingly indiscriminately firing on places where people are gathering on their way to the distribution sites. Overall, Israeli forces have killed or injured 600 Palestinians near three GHF sites, according to Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, just over the course of the past week. This includes 27 Palestinians killed and at least 90 injured on Tuesday when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd near the group's site in Rafah, the third such incident in three days. These massacres, targeting crowds of Palestinians desperate to stave off famine caused by Israel's aid blockade, have had horrific consequences. One man, identified by Euro-Med Monitor as A.B., said he was able to dodge gunfire on the way to the site and obtain a package, but gave it to a woman on the way out who was pleading for help for her and her children.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump appointed himself chair of the performance center in February, leading to boycotts and cancellations The Post says that sales data was collected and shared by former Kennedy Center employees. Though the subscription data is only one source of revenue for the center, it could serve as an overall indicator of public standing. Other sources of revenue include donations, individual ticket sales and government funding. About $125m of that came from earned revenue, such as ticket sales, the Post reported. The employee added that “we feel that we no longer have a choice but to force complete transparency with the public” after several staffers were ignored or outright fired for their opinions. He has since reshaped the center's governing board with his own appointees. A boycott by Les Misérables cast members was the latest in a string of stars pulling out of shows and positions at the center since Trump assumed control. Several shows have been called off, including a stop of the Hamilton tour that was canceled by the production itself, and Finn, a coming-of-age story about a young shark, which was canceled by the Kennedy Center. Trump had previously posted on social media expressing his desire to eliminate “drag shows” and “woke” content from the venue but did not clarify which productions he was targeting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. “God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself," SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement posted on social media. "Previously, we struck the Crimean Bridge in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater," he added. Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories. "And today, without inflicting any civilian casualties, the first explosive was activated at 4:44 a.m.," the SBU said. Russian state media later reported a "Ukrainian intelligence agent" who had constructed a bomb on "orders from Kyiv" had been detained by Russia's FSB A claimed "agent of Ukrainian intelligence services" has been detained in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service said later on June 3, accusing the detainee of producing a "powerful explosive." The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission. The $4 billion project was a political statement designed to affirm the Kremlin's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, as the peninsula is not connected by land to Russia. Russia's Defense Ministry previously claimed that three Ukrainian drones were downed over Crimea overnight on June 3. The Crimean Bridge was closed for traffic between 6 and 9 a.m. local time on that day, according to local Telegram channels. According to pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind, the bridge had been closed down for inspection, possibly to examine damage. Later the same day, Crimean Wind reported a new "powerful explosion" near Kerch at around 3 p.m., writing that a helicopter is patrolling the strait. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portuguese and German police on Tuesday launched joint searches of a “vast” area in Portugal's southern Algarve region for new evidence related to the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old British child Madeleine McCann. Portugal's investigative Judicial Police (PJ) had said on Monday they would execute search warrants between June 2 and 6 at the behest of the public prosecutor's office in Germany's Braunschweig, which in 2022 formally identified German national Christian Brueckner as an official suspect in the case. A source involved in the search operation said the targeted area was “vast” with police using ground-penetrating radar across several hectares. Portuguese officers were following instructions from German police under a European Investigation Order. None of these searches were confirmed to have yielded significant evidence. Reuters footage showed uniformed PJ officers on a cordon on a dirt road in Atalaia - a neighborhood of Lagos municipality - waving through unmarked vans and cars with German license plates from the city of Wiesbaden, where the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has its headquarters. Related video Madeleine McCann: A look back at one of the most recognizable missing person cases in history The BKA is assisting Portuguese law enforcement with “criminal procedural measures,” Braunschweig prosecutors told Reuters, declining to provide further details. The occupants of one of the German vehicles wore bucket hats, clothing with camouflage patterns and covered their faces with bandanas. A van belonging to Portugal's Maritime Police also arrived. That force has jurisdiction over coastal areas and took part in previous searches of beaches, wells and reservoirs using specialist divers. The search area was close to a property that Brueckner lived in, a neighbor told Reuters in 2020, though when was unclear. Madeleine went missing on May 3, 2007, while on holiday with her family in the Algarve town of Praia da Luz, sparking a frenzied search and gaining the attention of the world's media. Brueckner, a convicted child abuser and drug dealer, is behind bars in Germany for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same area of the Algarve. His sentence runs until September, meaning he is set for release unless prosecutors find enough evidence to charge him over Madeleine's disappearance. On Jan. 17 Sky News quoted the German prosecutor investigating Madeleine's disappearance as saying there was currently no prospect of charges being brought against Brueckner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lack of clear strategic guidance under David Richardson's leadership creates confusion for Fema staff The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. A spokesman for the department of homeland security (DHS) which oversees Fema insisted Mr Richardson was joking when he made the remark. There is mounting concern that the departures of a raft of top Fema officials, staff cuts and reductions in hurricane preparations have left the agency ill-prepared for a storm season forecast to be above normal. The storms have become increasingly more destructive and costly. A DHS spokesman said: “Despite mean-spirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what Fema will be doing this hurricane season. “Fema is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.” Mr Richardson's remark spurred confusion among agency staff and reignited concern about his lack of familiarity with its operations, three sources told Reuters. Mr Richardson, who has no disaster response experience, said he will not be issuing a new disaster plan because he does not want to make changes that might counter the Fema review council, the sources said. Its members include Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, governors and other officials. In a May 15 staff town hall, Mr Richardson said a disaster plan, including tabletop exercises, would be ready for review by May 23. The back-and-forth on updating the disaster plan and a lack of clear strategic guidance has created confusion for Fema staff, said one source. Mr Richardson has evoked his military experience as a former Marine artillery officer in conversations with staff. Mr Hamilton had publicly broken with Mr Trump over the future of the agency, but sources told Reuters that Trump allies had already been manoeuvring to oust him because they were unhappy with what they saw as Hamilton's slow-moving effort to restructure. Despite Ms Noem's prior comments that she plans to eliminate Fema, in May she approved Mr Richardson's request to retain more than 2,600 short-term disaster response and recovery employees whose terms were set to expire this year, one of the sources said, confirming an earlier report by NBC News. Those short-term staff make up the highest proportion of Fema employees, about 40 per cent, and are a pillar of the agency's on-the-ground response efforts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lisa Shields launched Fispan after noticing banks weren't keeping up with digital challengers.Tijana Martin/The Globe and Mail One of Canada's most successful women tech entrepreneurs, Lisa Shields, has raised US$30-million for her latest company Fispan Services Inc. in a deal led by U.S. growth equity firm Canapi Ventures. The Fispan transaction “is quite different” from deals of that era, which saw money-losing startups pursue growth at all costs and raise huge financings at ever-inflated valuations, said Tom Davis, Canapi's San Francisco-based general partner. Instead, it is more indicative of a return to saner market dynamics, he said. Fispan sells subscription software tools that enable banks to embed services for mid-market companies into enterprise resource planning (ERP) and accounting platforms such as Oracle NetSuite, Intuit QuickBooks and Xero. That makes it easier for clients to handle cash and accounts management in one place. (Fispan did fall prey to the grow-at-all-costs mindset, Ms. Shields admits, before cutting 30 per cent of staff in 2022 and shifting “to serve our bank clients with quality and consistency at all costs.”) Since Fispan sells to banks, it doesn't spend much on marketing and “has fantastic unit economics, a proven sales motion, a solid customer base and high net dollar retention within existing customers,” said Mr. Davis. “You're asking the question we had as an internal debate,” said Ms. Shields, an aeronautical engineer by training whose previous company, payments platform provider Hyperwallet Systems Inc., sold to PayPal Holdings Inc. for US$400-million in 2018. Canadian deal-making still stuck in a rut, despite the hot markets “We didn't want to take more than we had to,” said Jay Rhind, a Fispan director and partner with Rhino Ventures, the company's largest investor, which has invested $38-million in the company, much of that from buying out other early investors. The second reason was to find a new investor with expertise and deep pockets. Fispan had had the same group of investors since 2018 – early Fispan investor Rhino led the 2021 round – and Ms. Shields wanted to add a growth equity firm to her ownership group and boardroom that was familiar with the realities of selling to slow-moving banks. Canapi was the ideal choice for several reasons: Because it invests in a wider range of deals, it was open to investing a lower amount than some growth equity firms. Its leaders hail from finance, financial technology and regulatory affairs (managing partner Gene Ludwig was chief banking regulator of the U.S. during the Clinton administration), and its funders are comprised of 75 financial institutions, many of which could open doors for Fispan. That was important for Ms. Shields, who started Fispan after noticing banks weren't keeping up with digital challengers that were plugging their services into business software platforms. She set out to build tools that would make banking services “just as delightful and easy to use as those of any fintech” on those platforms. But many fintechs that target mid-market corporations (those with US$30-million to US$2-billion in annual revenues) typically top out before hitting 10,000 customers, she said. “Nobody has ever had the kind of market share that really makes it interesting. “I want guidance from people that have worked with banks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“And our responsibility for this cabinet therefore ends here.” Wilders' decision to withdraw support for the most right-leaning government in Dutch history has plunged the country's politics into chaos. It leaves the government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, with just 51 out of 150 seats in parliament. Prime Minister Dick Schoof called the decision “unnecessary and irresponsible.” But speaking with reporters after a Tuesday afternoon cabinet meeting, he offered few details on his conversations with Wilders. He said that without the PVV's support, it was impossible for the government to carry on, and that he would remain in office leading a caretaker government until a new coalition takes over. Polls suggest that, were elections to be held today, the PVV would lose seats but remain the largest party, just ahead of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. Polls suggest that both center-right and center-left parties would gain from new elections. Wilders' PVV was the clear winner of a November 2023 election. But a coalition accord struck after months of haggling dictated that, while his party would join the government, he would remain on the sidelines, in parliament. Wilders has a long history of anti-Islam and anti-immigrant rhetoric, He was convicted of discrimination after insulting Moroccan immigrants at a 2014 campaign rally, and his party calls for “no Islamic schools, Qurans, and mosques.” Wilders last week held a rare, formal press conference to present the government with an ultimatum for hardening the country's asylum policy – despite the fact that the minister for asylum and migration is a member of his own party. But the coalition, he said, refused his proposals. “I could do nothing other than say that we are now withdrawing our support for this cabinet.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ERIC S. EDELMAN is a counselor at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. FRANKLIN C. MILLER is a principal at the Scowcroft Group. At the time it was signed in 2010, New START had some advantages. It also had domestic political utility: in exchange for Republican support for the treaty, Democrats agreed to support modernizing aging strategic nuclear forces. But New START was written for a geopolitical landscape that no longer exists. Back then, although Russian President Vladimir Putin had begun to show his growing discontent with the prevailing world order, he had not yet revealed his determination to rebuild, to the maximum extent possible, the Soviet empire. Perhaps most important, many observers at the time considered China to be relatively benign and largely content to keep its military within its own borders. Although there were hints that it was seeking future capabilities, China's nuclear forces were based on older systems and seemed limited to maintaining “a minimum means of reprisal.” Russia has, according to Putin, modernized 95 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is pursuing several novel intercontinental systems that were designed to get around New START constraints. Most worrying, Putin has fielded a regional nuclear force of some 2,000 short- and medium-range lower-yield weapons that can be launched from the ground, air and ships. China, meanwhile, is undertaking what Admiral Charles “Chas” Richard, the former commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, described as a “strategic breakout.” The “explosive growth” of China's nuclear arsenal, he said, “can only be described as breathtaking.” Beijing, too, is now busy fielding a highly modernized regional nuclear force and is en route to becoming a full-blown nuclear peer to the United States. It is also collaborating with Russia in new ways that threaten U.S. security. As the 2023 congressionally mandated, bipartisan Strategic Posture Commisson unanimously noted: “The new partnership between Russian and Chinese leaders poses qualitatively new threats of potential opportunistic aggression and/or future cooperative two-theater aggression.” In a world with two potential nuclear-armed enemies, New START no longer provides for U.S. and allied security. By constraining U.S. strategic forces, it undermines the United States' ability to deter Russia and China simultaneously. New START also fails on a regional level by not addressing the shorter-range nuclear weapons that Russia or China would likely use first in wartime. For the past century, arms control agreements have been used to constrain threats posed by potential aggressor nations. Where there was such intent, arms control treaties have been covertly or overtly violated or channeled arms competition into areas that were not limited. In more recent decades, the Soviet Union and now Russia have been repeat offenders. Since coming to power in Russia, Putin has violated nine separate arms control agreements and now appears ready to skirt two more: the State Department's most recent arms control compliance report notes that Putin is following his Soviet predecessors in contravening the Biological Weapons Convention by maintaining “an offensive biological warfare program,” and after intelligence reports indicated Russia may be planning to put a nuclear weapon into Earth's orbit, Russia vetoed a UN resolution reaffirming the Outer Space Treaty. Moreover, by deliberately taking reckless actions such as cutting in front of U.S. naval and air forces, Putin's military routinely ignores the 1972 Incidents at Sea Agreement and the Reagan-era Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities Agreement, which both sought to regulate militaries' conduct in order to avoid accidents that could lead to inadvertent escalation or miscalculation. Given these willful and continuing violations, the prospect of negotiating a meaningful arms control deal with Putin under the best of circumstances is far-fetched. Add to the calculus that Moscow's forces have stepped up attacks on Ukrainian cities even as Putin gives rhetorical support to peace talks, and it beggars belief that Russia would engage in good-faith arms control negotiations over the next year. In the near term, nuclear discussions between Washington and Beijing seem similarly improbable. China, for its part, regards any willingness to engage in arms control as a sign of weakness, and it views the transparency and verification process that would presumably undergird such an accord as intrusive and akin to espionage. History clearly shows that building strategic nuclear forces creates painful defense dilemmas for adversaries and is the surest formula both for protecting the United States and its allies and for ultimately getting adversaries to the negotiating table. Unilateral restraint has never succeeded in doing that, nor has continuing to abide by outdated agreements that cannot ensure future security. On the U.S. fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, for instance, close to 100 launch tubes for Trident II missiles have been deactivated since 2011. Roughly 30 B-52 bombers have also been stripped of their nuclear capabilities to meet the treaty's limits. The United States should also upload its existing Trident II submarine-launched missiles and its land-based Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles by increasing the number of warheads carried on each missile. The overall increase in deployed warheads, however, need only be modest for the United States to maintain credible deterrence against both Moscow and Beijing. There is no need for the United States to match Russia and China weapon for weapon, but it does need the flexibility to maintain a strategic force that can hold one adversary at bay even after absorbing a first strike and retaliating against the other adversary. With the sole exception of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, every U.S.-Soviet/Russian nuclear arms agreement from SALT I in 1972 to New START has focused on intercontinental-range systems. Since the 1970s, successive U.S. administrations believed this was an acceptable risk, assuming that any use of nuclear weapons that would occur between Moscow and Washington would rapidly escalate to the use of intercontinental weapons. Strategists now generally agree that the first use of a nuclear weapon will occur as the result of an escalating regional conventional conflict. Putin has made such escalatory threats against Ukraine and NATO, and Russia's approximately 2,000 regional nuclear weapons are not subject to New START's 1,550-weapon ceiling. In the future, any new nuclear treaty should set an overall limit for all deployed nuclear weapons, regional and intercontinental, held by the treaty parties. Under that ceiling, each party could be free to alter the mix of intercontinental and regional weapons at any point, as long as it notified the other party. Of course, traditional arms control advocates will likely object to such an approach since the total number of nuclear weapons allowed will go up—suggesting progress has been lost—but that argument is disingenuous. As it is written, New START simply pretends Russia's regional weapons don't exist. If a new treaty were to freeze the overall force size at Russia's current roughly 3,550 level, the increase in number might look bad, but it would reflect reality. Better bad optics than pretending the weapons don't exist. Verifying the number of regional nuclear weapons deployed by each side (indeed, even identifying which regional nuclear weapons are deemed “deployed”) will be challenging, especially given their small size and frequent association with launchers that can be used for either conventional or smaller nuclear weapons. But this problem can be overcome once both sides recognize they have an interest in establishing limits. And if the parties can't get to that modicum of goodwill, it will be fruitless to pursue a treaty in the first place. If it instead tries to hold on to New START constraints in the unrealistic hope that doing so will coax Moscow back to the table, it will find itself mired in Cold War nostrums about strategic stability that were derived from a bipolar world. All the while, it will struggle to keep pace with the novel challenge of dealing with two nuclear peers that, increasingly, are working together against U.S. interests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LUXEMBOURG, June 3. An armed conflict between EU countries and Russia cannot be ruled out due to Brussels' irrational policy, Fernand Kartheiser, a European Parliament member who represents Luxembourg, said in an interview with TASS following a visit to Moscow. "Given, among other things, Europe's irrational policy and the aggressive atmosphere in which it is being pursued, the risk of an armed confrontation with Russia cannot be ruled out, unfortunately," he pointed out. According to Kartheiser, the situation "is growing increasingly dangerous" because of "large-scale propaganda and the suppression of freedom of speech" in Europe. The politician highlighted the need "to at least try to prevent an arms race and do everything possible to counter the arguments of warmongers." Kartheiser emphasized that the main goal of his visit was to demonstrate that Russia' "is a partner, not an enemy." Kartheiser, who heads Luxembourg's right-wing Alternative Democratic Reform Party, was elected to the European Parliament in 2024. He has consistently called for normalizing relations between the European Union and Russia. Kartheiser visited Moscow on May 25-28 at the invitation of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament). He held meetings with Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Grigory Karasin, chairman of the Federation Committee (upper house of parliament) on Foreign Affairs and Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko.</p>

Yomiuri Giants lifetime honorary manager Shigeo Nagashima, one of Japan's most beloved sports figures whose achievements as a player and manager earned him the moniker of “Mr. Nagashima passed away due to pneumonia at 6:39 a.m. in a Tokyo hospital. Nagashima visited Tokyo Dome for an exhibition game between the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 15, and took a photo with Shohei Ohtani. The following day, he developed a fever and was diagnosed with pneumonia. At one point his blood pressure stabilized, and he appeared to be stable. However, he passed away on Tuesday morning — the birthday of his daughter Mina, who had been caring for him. Born in Usui (now Sakura), Chiba Prefecture, Nagashima entered Rikkyo University after graduating from the former Sakura No. At Rikkyo, he broke the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League record for career home runs with eight. His clutch performances — most notably a walk-off home run in the first pro baseball game ever attended by the then Emperor and Empress in 1959 — sparked a national frenzy. Together with teammate and fellow legend Sadaharu Oh, the pair nicknamed “O-N” played a key role in the Giants winning an unprecedented nine consecutive Japan Series titles from 1965. He became known for his passionate performances, dazzling baseball fans with his dynamic fielding at third base and his powerful —  sometimes exaggerated —  swings that often delivered clutch hits. He ended his 17-year playing career in 1974, saying at a memorable retirement ceremony at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo: “My Giants are forever immortal.” His uniform number, 3, is now retired by the Giants. He began a second stint as manager in 1993 that lasted nine seasons. Nagashima retired in 2001 and was later afforded the title of lifetime honorary manager. However, he suffered a cerebral infarction in March 2004 and was unable to lead the team in Athens. Afterward, he worked hard on his rehabilitation and at times appeared in public to show his fans how he had progressed. Nagashima was hospitalized and received treatment for gallstones in summer 2018.
