                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with Los Angeles station ABC7 on June 3, Seacrest admitted that he felt a “tremendous amount of pressure” taking over the iconic show and still doesn't feel fully comfortable after taping 195 episodes. A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune) “Wheel of Fortune” legend Vanna White told ABC7 that the transition from co-starring with Sajak to Seacrest has been “seamless” and that he “makes it look easy.” But Seacrest said uneasily, “Most of the time. “Let me be honest,” he told the outlet. “There was a tremendous amount of pressure that I felt coming into this. It's been built with Pat and Vanna for so many years, I just wanted people to feel comfortable and watch, and if we got a few more along the way, then bonus round, right? I'm thrilled that the loyal audience has accepted what we get to do together.” Seacrest's debut on the show was a slam dunk, according to Variety, which reported that it was “most-watched entertainment series in September across broadcast, cable and syndication.” By January, the Los Angeles Times had called Seacrest “ratings gold” on the game show. A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune) Among Seacrest's fans is White, who told ABC7, “This whole season, I have been smiling from day one. For me, that makes it fun and I think we get genuine laughter out of each other. In April, White told TV Insider that she felt Seacrest came into the show with the best attitude, knowing he could never truly replace Sajak. He also said to me, ‘I am not replacing Pat Sajak because no one could – ever. That made me feel good because, as Ryan said, he's just stepping in – he's not trying to prove anything.” And although his return is not official, Seacrest is expected to host his 24th season of “American Idol” in early 2026.</p>

Luca Guadagnino has added another project to his always-packed slate. IndieWire can confirm that Guadagnino is attached to direct “Artificial,” a comedic film set in the world of AI, for Amazon MGM. Those outlets have also reported that Andrew Garfield and “Anora” star Yuri Borisov are circling roles in the project. Whether “Artificial” ends up being a literal take on the Altman saga or a fictional project that takes inspiration from it, the lucrative world of AI startups should offer Guadagnino plenty of material to work with. As virtually every industry on the planet prepares to be disrupted by AI in some capacity, companies are racing to find the products that will place them ahead of their competitors, which has created a gold rush for entrepreneurs developing those products.

Founded as a nonprofit in 2015 by a team of tech executives including Altman and Elon Musk, it was originally intended as an open source company that shared all of its research and technology with the public. But as the company developed potentially lucrative properties like ChatGPT, it transitioned to a for profit endeavor in 2019, prompting some founders (including Musk) to leave over a disagreement about the company's vision. The transition created a highly complicated corporate structure in which the OpenAI board of directors controls a nonprofit foundation that controls the for-profit entity, in which Microsoft also owns a minority stake. That structure laid the foundation for Altman to be pushed out as CEO by the board in November 2023, only to be re-hired three days later after a massive employee mutiny that saw many OpenAI workers threaten to leave for equivalent positions at Microsoft.

The author, Elisabeth Sereda, is a freelance entertainment journalist for Kurier and was a member of the now-dissolved Hollywood Foreign Press Association. She is also currently a voter for the Golden Globes (the Golden Globes are co-owned by PMC, which is the parent company of IndieWire), though she is not a Golden Globes employee. Related Stories Luca Guadagnino Attached to Direct AI Business Comedy ‘Artificial' for Amazon MGM ‘Ride or Die' First Look: Jamie Foxx Produces Indie Queer Road Trip Thriller Premiering at Tribeca Sereda said the quotes were drawn from 14 different interviews Eastwood gave to the HFPA as part of various panel discussions with HFPA members, and for which Sereda has spoken to Eastwood several times over the years. Transcripts of those interviews historically have been free to be used by HFPA members in articles, and Sereda said that while Eastwood may not have heard of Kurier, “he is certainly familiar with the HFPA — having given more than 20 interviews to the group dating back to 1976.” However, the original article was presented as though it were a fresh conversation given for his 95th birthday. “According to Sereda, she wrote the current article based on these conversations. Using multiple interviews for a birthday portrait is common practice,” the Kurier statement reads (translated via Google). “The article was formatted as an interview, not a portrait. Kurier's statement concludes saying it will no longer work with Sereda “because transparency and our strict editorial standards are paramount to us.” Sereda disputed the publication's explanation slightly, saying she “was asked” by Kurier to write a “Best of” compilation with prior quotes she had done. She also added that she was a freelance contributor, not an employee of Kurier, and over the past six months has “phased out her contributions” following the publication of her recent historical fiction novel.

Lively's motion is “denied based on [her] representation that the relevant claims will be withdrawn,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in an order issued on Tuesday. In a statement, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, lawyers for Lively, said their client is dropping certain claims because “they are no longer necessary” and that she will “continue to pursue emotional distress damages through other claims in her lawsuit,” including sexual harassment and retaliation. They added that the “Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive damages under California law.” Court Throws Out "Potentially Libelous" Taylor Swift Extortion Claims From Justin Baldoni's Team Blake Lively's Lawyers Are Extorting Taylor Swift, Justin Baldoni Claims He stressed that the actress is refusing to turn over her medical records, preventing him from disputing arguments that his alleged misconduct caused her emotional harm. Tuesday's order forecloses the possibility of Lively refiling emotional distress claims and providing her medical records unless Baldoni allows her to do so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The track will follow February's Short n' Sweet deluxe edition. Sabrina Carpenter topped a lot of people's song of the summer lists with “Espresso” in 2024, and now, she's gunning to do it for the second year in a row. After a day of teasing that she had a new project in the works, the pop star has announced that she has a new song titled “Manchild” on the way. !” she wrote in her caption, adding that a 7-inch vinyl for the single is now available to order. The announcement comes shortly after fans noticed that a number of mysterious billboards had gone up beside Interstate 69 displaying messages such as “Amen” and “Hey men!” One of them read, “I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them.” Before that, the Grammy winner also shared a teaser video of herself trying — and failing — to hitchhike. The new track will follow a whirlwind year of success for Carpenter, who earned her first top 10 hit last summer with “Espresso.” The song eventually reached No. “Manchild” will also mark the first new music from Carpenter since she dropped the deluxe edition of Short n' Sweet in February, adding bonus tracks “15 Minutes,” “Couldn't Make It Any Harder,” “Busy Woman” and “Bad Reviews.” She's currently on a short break from her Short n' Sweet Tour, which kicked off with a North American leg in the fall followed by a slew of European dates this spring.

The director in talks to helm Artificial at Amazon MGM Studios. While deals are still not closed, he looks to have found a strong ensemble as insiders say Andrew Garfield, Monica Barbaro and Anora breakout Yura Borisov are in early talks to star. Jennifer Fox is also in talks to produce. Amazon MGM Studios In Talks To Acquire Hot Video Game Package 'Split Fiction' Teaming Jon M. Chu & Sydney Sweeney Rock later this summer with Colin Farrell set to star. When the film had to push a full year, Guadagnino moved quickly to find something he could get up and running this year and mulled several options before landing on Artificial. While technically the film is in development until everyone has a closed deal, the idea would be to shoot this year once those deals have closed. The film reunites Guadagnino and Amazon MGM Studios. He directed After the Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which the studio is releasing in theaters October 10, and Challengers, starring Zendaya, which the studio released theatrically last year. Heyman is also already in business with the studio as he gears up to produce the next James Bond film alongside Amy Pascal. Additionally, he produced all eight film adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, as well as the three Fantastic Beasts films. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As both sides took to the court docket and the media Monday to fight over how Lively would or would not withdraw her intentional emotional distress claims from her New Year's Eve filed suit against Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, execs and publicists, the judge shut the whole thing down Tuesday lickety-split with a rebuke of Lively's side. Blake Lively Insists She Is Not Dropping Emotional Distress Claims Against Justin Baldoni, Despite What His Lawyers Say & Her Lawyers Seem To Have Said “The motion to compel at …is denied based on Plaintiff's representation that the relevant claims will be withdrawn,” wrote Judge Lewis J, Liman this morning in a fairly brisk order. “Lively's request that ‘because the parties have agreed to dismiss Ms. Lively's tenth and eleventh causes of action… the Court exercise its inherent authority and authority under Rule 15 to dismiss them without prejudice' is denied without prejudice to renewal,” the NYC-based federal official (and brother of director Doug Liman) added. “The parties shall stipulate to whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice, or Lively shall renew her request by formal motion.” As a kicker, a day after Lively's lawyers exclaimed their client in not completely abandoning her emotional distress claims, Judge Liman made where he sits on all this perfectly clear: “For avoidance of doubt, if the claims are not dismissed, the Court will preclude Lively from offering any evidence of emotional distress. After all the hoopla of yesterday's letters to the judge and weekend email exchanges between attorneys for Lively and Baldoni, lawyers and representatives for the latter were mum Tuesday, offering a telling “no comment” on Judge Liman's move in their favor. For Lively, who now has no window to shift strategy and release her requested medical and therapy records, there was a sidestepping of her loss and a repeat of what her team put out on Monday. “The court denied Wayfarer's motion,” said Lively lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb in a statement Tuesday. Ms. Lively has offered to dismiss those claims because they are no longer necessary, and she will continue to pursue emotional distress damages through other claims in her lawsuit, including sexual harassment and retaliation. In addition, the Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive damages under California law. This is exactly where both parties were before the Baldoni-Wayfarer Parties rushed to file this utterly pointless motion to compel, all searching for yet another press moment.” A formal suit by her followed on December 31 with a $400 million defamation and extorsion action from the Jane the Virgin actor against Lively, her hubby Ryan Reynolds and their PR team was not long behind. Sources on both sides have repeatedly and vehemently insisted to Deadline and the courts that there is no chance of a settlement now, with the high profile Lively and Reynolds hauled way out of their carefully created comfort zone and WME-dumped Baldoni's career now dead in the water in Hollywood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The superstar wants an appellate court to overturn a ruling last year that allowed the blockbuster harassment lawsuit from her backup dancers to move forward. They say Lizzo's behavior toward the dancers was clearly part of her artistic approach — and thus shielded by constitutional protections for free speech. “Plaintiffs' suit [is] an attack on Lizzo's First Amendment right to perform her music and advocate for body positivity,” writes Lizzo's attorneys, who include prominent Hollywood defense attorney Marty Singer. “Rather than accept personal accountability, plaintiffs filed this shotgun action, taking aim at nearly every facet of Lizzo's creative process.” One key claim in the case against Lizzo is that she pushed the dancers to attend a sex show in Amsterdam's Red Light District at a venue called Bananenbar, then pressured them to touch and engage with nude performers. But her lawyers say that incident – which they stress was entirely optional — was directly tied to the creation of her art and thus cannot form the basis of legal liablity. “There's no disagreement that Lizzo held these outings as a necessary part of her creative process,” Singer writes. “Early social gatherings during international tours (like the Bananenbar) are critical to teambuilding and fostering cohesion.” The star's legal defense centered on California's so-called anti-SLAPP law — a special statute that makes it easier to quickly end lawsuits that threaten free speech. In seeking to dismiss the case under that law, Lizzo's lawyers argued the dancers wanted to “silence” Lizzo and “weaponize” her creative expression against her. In early 2024, Judge Mark H. Epstein partly endorsed that argument and tossed out several allegations, including the discrimination claims about fat-shaming. But he allowed numerous accusations to move ahead toward a potential trial, including those over the Amsterdam sex show. “But it is equally dangerous to turn a blind eye to allegations of discrimination or other forms of misconduct merely because they take place in a speech-related environment.” “Judges must not dissect the creative process to determine what was necessary to achieve the final product and what was not,” Lizzo's lawyers write. “By rejecting the artist's proven experience for what is necessary to, and best enhances, her own art, the trial court stepped far outside its role.” “Lizzo has been trying and failing repeatedly to get this case dismissed because she does not want to face a jury of her peers explaining how she created such an egregious and unlawful work environment for our clients,” Zambrano said. Attorneys for the plaintiffs will file their own appellate brief later this month aimed at rebutting Lizzo's arguments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neil Young is a little over two weeks away from the launch of his Love Earth world tour. “When I tour the USA this summer, if there is not martial law by then which would make it impossible, let's all come together and stand for American values,” he wrote. Come and hear our music just as you did for decades.” He's alluding to the fact that Trump is a longtime fan of his work. Rolling Stone even rang up Trump in 2008 to discuss his fandom after noticing him at several New York shows, including the front row of a CSNY concert at the Theater at MSG where he was seated next to Patti Smith and Salman Rushdie. I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy.” He couldn't, however, name any of his songs when pressed. I like all his songs, you know, ‘Rock and Roll' — just great stuff.” Trump and Young met up at Trump Tower a little over ten years ago when the singer was looking for investors for his Pono music service. But their relationship soured once Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency, and began blasting “Rockin' In The Free World” at his events. “Your mindless destruction of our shared natural resources, our environment, and our relationships with friends around the world is unforgivable.… Our first black president was a better man than you are…Every time ‘Rockin' in the Free World' or one of my songs is played at your rallies, I hope you hear my voice. Remember it is the voice of a tax-paying U.S. citizen who does not support you. Elon Musk's Reign of Corruption Chronicled in Elizabeth Warren Report Trump Has 'Broken' Musk, Jon Stewart Roasts Tech Billionaire After White House Departure It Didn't Stop This Singer From Coming Out Last month, Young reacted to Trump's vicious campaign against Bruce Springsteen. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America,” he wrote. “You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. Think about saving America from the mess you made. In this new post, where Young invites Trump to his shows, he strikes a somewhat softer tone. “Bruce Springsteen and many others will be in our country this summer, there for you,” he writes, “playing our favorite music, songs like ‘Born in the USA.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parks and Recreation ended more than a decade ago, but its seven seasons left behind countless meme formats to be recycled in perpetuity. Nick Offerman recently came to the defense of his stoic character Ron Swanson after Michael Flynn Jr., son of Donald Trump's former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, shared a homophobic post on X using a Parks and Recreation meme. “Just wanted to post how I feel about ‘pride' month,” Flynn captioned a GIF that edited a Pride flag over the computer Swanson tossed into a dumpster in the Season Four episode “The Trial of Leslie Knope.” He replied to his own post doubling down on his rage bait, writing: “I love how triggered the ABC Mafia crowd is by this meme.” Trump Has 'Broken' Musk, Jon Stewart Roasts Tech Billionaire After White House Departure Ron was best man at a gay wedding you dumb fuck. Offerman took the post as an opportunity to set the record straight about Swanson, who would have never agreed with Flynn using him to boost homophobia. “Ron was best man at a gay wedding you dumb fuck,” the actor wrote in response. After making the reference to “One Last Ride,” Parks and Recreation's series finale where Ron joins his hairdresser's wedding, he added: “#Happy Pride.” Offerman recently portrayed a queer character in The Last of Us. His character Bill shaped a romance plot line with Murray Bartlett's Frank. “Stories with guts that when homophobic hate comes my way and says, ‘Why did you have to make it a gay story?'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As fans get ready to watch Ribeiro and Hough's third season hosting “Dancing With the Stars” together, former host Erin Andrews is gearing up to start her first hosting gig since leaving the show. After her unceremonious dismissal from the show after Season 28, Andrews focused on her job in sports journalism, as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox, and started her WEAR clothing line and “Calm Down with Erin and Charissa” podcast. Now that she's made her way back into reality TV to co-host the new game show “99 To Beat,” Andrews is, understandably, nervous. “I am excited to get back into that world. Obviously, it's been a minute since I got the boot from “Dancing With the Stars” with Tom Bergeron. I affectionately love to tell that story. My agent is like, ‘Don't say that, you weren't fired, you were replaced.' “I was on “Pyramid” one time with [Michael] Strahan, up against Aaron Rodgers. I love that whole vibe, and had been really, you know, taking meetings, and trying to get back into that world.” But she couldn't resist one swipe at “DWTS,” cheekily telling listeners. “Super pumped I don't have to wear a ballroom gown. Initially, 100 contestants compete against each other in mental, physical, and just plain ridiculous challenges. In one challenge, “pairs of contestants were blindfolded and had to identify the sound of squeaky toys,” Deadline reported. And it is out of the ordinary in that usually gameshows have winners and there has to be some extraordinary quality to the contestants, but in this show it is all about not losing.” Whoever finishes last in each challenge is out, and whoever makes it to the end as the final contestant standing takes home a jackpot of $100,000. The United States will be the 11th country to create its own version of 99 To Beat. According to TV Insider, Andrews will co-host with Ken Jeong, which is scheduled to air Wednesdays at 9 ET/8 CT in the fall.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Double Infinity is the band's sixth studio LP and follow-up to 2022's Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You. Out September 5 via 4AD, the record was made with a rotating cast of collaborators, among them Alena Spanger, Ginla's Jon Nellen, Natural Information Society's Mikel Patrick Avery, and Laraaji. Now a trio, following the departure of bassist Max Oleartchik, Big Thief recorded Double Infinity live over the span of three weeks at New York's Power Station, with longtime collaborator Dom Monks handling production, engineering, and mixing duties. Following the album's release, Big Thief will kick off their Somersault Slide 360 Tour of North America. Since 2022, all three members of Big Thief have kept busy with their solo projects. Adrianne Lenker shared Bright Future in 2024 and the live album Live at Revolution Hall earlier this year; Buck Meek put out Haunted Mountain in 2023; and James Krivchenia's Performing Belief arrived just last month.

Steen, in a press release, cited Oscar Wilde as an influence on the new song. “In ‘Cutthroat,' it's that whole idea from Lady Windermere's Fan, ‘Life's far too important to be taken seriously. Cutthroat is the follow-up to 2023's Food for Worms. Shame—featuring vocalist Charlie Steen, guitarists Sean Coyle-Smith and Eddie Green, bassist Josh Finerty, and drummer Charlie Forbes—recorded the new album, which they describe as “a joyride,” at Salvation Studios in Brighton, England. “This is about who we are,” Steen said. “Our live shows aren't performance art—they're direct, confrontational, and raw.
