                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have found that greenspace exposure is associated with widespread patterns of structural brain development during early adolescence, which in turn are associated with better academic and mental outcomes. The findings of the study in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier, emphasize the need to integrate natural environments into urban and educational settings and provide key insights for policymakers, parents, and educators to support adolescent well-being. Previous research has shown that exposure to green spaces positively influences mental health and cognition. However, there is limited understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of brain development and its potential role in supporting mental well-being in children. This is the first study to examine the influence of greenspace exposure on structural neurodevelopmental trajectories and which tests whether these trajectories mediate the relationship between greenspace exposure and positive academic or mental health outcomes. John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, comments, "We tend to focus on the detrimental effects and negative aspects of our environment. Investigators analyzed data from more than 7,000 ethnically diverse adolescents in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study from 21 sites across the United States to test the relationship between greenspace exposure at age 9-10 and brain structure two years later as well as change over time. Additionally, they tested whether brain structural development statistically mediated the associations of greenspace exposure with mental health and academic performance. Co-lead investigator Qingyang Li, MSc, Neuroimaging Department, Institute of Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, King's College London, explains, "We found greenspace exposure to be associated with brain structural changes at both whole-brain and regional-brain levels. They found that greenspace exposure was associated with greater total surface area (SA) and cortical volume (CV), greater cortical thickness (CT) in temporal regions and the insula, lower thickness in the caudal middle frontal and superior frontal gyri, greater SA across several regions, and greater volume of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. In analyses studying change in brain structure over time, higher greenspace exposure was associated with greater growth of total SA, lower average thickness reduction, and reduced total CV growth as well as changes at the regional level. Adolescence is typified by rapid structural brain development and heightened susceptibility to environmental influences. By 2050, approximately 68% of the global population is expected to reside in cities. Rapid urbanization reduces opportunities for individuals to interact with natural environments and green space. Co-lead investigator Divyangana Rakesh, PhD, Neuroimaging Department, Institute of Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, King's College London, concludes, "Children's and adolescents' mental health issues have become a global concern. This study offers insights for policymakers on how urban planning can help address the growing mental health challenges faced by children and highlights the importance of integrating green spaces into school settings and urban environments."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this study, researchers Arjun Sapkota, Sebok K. Halder, and Richard Milner from San Diego Biomedical Research Institute investigated how aging affects the brain's vulnerability to low oxygen, or hypoxia. Using C57BL/6J mice ranging from 2 to 23 months of age, they identified specific oxygen levels that disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-a critical structure that protects brain tissue from harmful substances. The findings are important for understanding age-related cognitive decline and the potential risks faced by individuals with chronic oxygen-limiting conditions such as asthma, sleep apnea, emphysema, and heart disease. The BBB is essential for maintaining brain health. Older mice showed significantly more BBB disruption than younger ones. Notably, barrier weakening and blood vessel changes occurred at oxygen levels of just 15% in aged mice, compared to 13% in young mice. These data suggest that the aging brain is more sensitive to oxygen deprivation, even at levels that may be considered only mildly hypoxic. The BBB showed increased sensitivity to low oxygen not only in aged mice but also in mice as young as 2 to 6 months, with a second spike occurring between 12 and 15 months-equivalent to middle age in mice. These findings may reflect age-dependent changes in brain vascular function and remodeling capacity. "Hypoxia-induced endothelial proliferation was relatively constant across the age range, but advanced age strongly enhanced the degree of BBB disruption (4-6-fold greater in 23 months vs. 2 months old)." Another key focus was microglial activation, a sign of brain inflammation. Aged mice exhibited higher microglial activation across all oxygen levels, including normal conditions. Chronic microglial activation is closely linked to neuroinflammation and has been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's. While the rate of blood vessel formation was constant across ages, the degree of BBB disruption increased sharply with age, suggesting that repair mechanisms may weaken over time. These results may help explain why older adults with chronic hypoxia-related diseases are at higher risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Altogether, these findings underscore the importance of protecting brain health in older individuals by managing oxygen exposure and reducing hypoxia-related risks. The researchers emphasize the need to develop new therapies that support blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly in aging populations exposed to chronic or intermittent low-oxygen conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Certain medications used in the treatment of bone conditions, particularly when combined with corticosteroids, may significantly increase the risk of a rare but serious jaw disease. This finding comes from a study by the University of Oulu, which analyzed data from Finnish adult patients who began bone medication between 2013 and 2015. The incidence of osteonecrosis was 0.3% among low-dose antiresorptive drug (AR) users and as high as 9% among those receiving high doses. The most commonly used AR drugs are denosumab and bisphosphonates. When corticosteroids were also involved, the risk increased further: simultaneous use of corticosteroids in addition to AR drug increased the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw by 2 times in high-dose AR recipients and 6 times in low-dose AR recipients. Other significant risk factors for jaw osteonecrosis included male sex and a cancer diagnosis. This is the first population-level study conducted in Finland on the incidence and risk factors of medication-related jaw osteonecrosis. The analysis covered data from nearly 60,000 Finnish patients. Our study confirms that denosumab is associated with a significantly higher risk of jaw osteonecrosis compared to bisphosphonates, but the difference in risk between the two was surprisingly large. It was also particularly surprising how strongly the simultaneous use of corticosteroids increased the risk in patients on low-dose bone medication.” Miika Kujanpää, doctoral researcher, University of Oulu and dentist The researchers recommend that patient treatment plans be reviewed more carefully when multiple medications are in use, particularly denosumab and corticosteroids together. They also emphasise the role of oral health care in reducing risks – for example, the condition of teeth and gums should be checked both before and during bone medication treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new type of mRNA vaccine is more scalable and adaptable to continuously evolving viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1, according to a study by researchers at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health and the Pennsylvania State University. The study was published today in npj Vaccines. Though highly effective at inducing an immune response, current mRNA vaccines, such as those used to prevent COVID-19, present two significant challenges: the high amount of mRNA needed to produce them and the constantly evolving nature of the pathogen. Suresh Kuchipudi, Ph.D., senior author, chair of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Pitt Public Health To address these challenges, the researchers created a proof-of-concept COVID-19 vaccine using what's known as a "trans-amplifying" mRNA platform. In this approach, the mRNA is separated into two fragments-the antigen sequence and the replicase sequence-the latter of which can be produced in advance, saving crucial time in the event a new vaccine must be developed urgently and produced at scale. In mice, the vaccine induced a robust immune response against many strains of SARS-CoV-2. "Additionally, this format requires an mRNA dose 40 times less than conventional vaccines, so this new approach significantly reduces the overall cost of the vaccine." The lessons learned from this study could inform more efficient vaccine development for other constantly evolving RNA viruses with pandemic potential, Kuchipudi said. "We hope to apply the principles of this lower-cost, broad-protection antigen design to pressing challenges like bird flu."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers found that, compared with consuming white rice, eating black beans or chickpeas was associated with reduced markers of inflammation, and consuming chickpeas was linked to reduced blood cholesterol. However, because black beans and chickpeas are relatively cheap and considered healthy by experts, this type of intervention is worth exploring further. This condition is marked by an inability to control levels of glucose in the blood. When blood glucose is elevated, it damages healthy tissues. Treatment can successfully manage type 2 diabetes and reduce the risk of damage, but there is no cure. Prediabetes, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is when an individual has “blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.” Unlike type 2 diabetes, however, prediabetes can be reversed, so scientists are exploring interventions that could help this population. Because nutrition plays a pivotal role in the development of type 2 diabetes, many scientists are focused on dietary interventions For their recent study, the researchers recruited individuals with prediabetes. At week 12, those consuming chickpeas had a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, those eating black beans had reduced levels of the inflammatory marker, IL-6. However, the scientists did not identify any significant changes in glucose metabolism. This was a small, relatively brief study, so researchers need to carry out more work to understand the full benefits of these legumes on people with prediabetes. There's also some evidence that consuming legumes may be associated with a reduction in cancer risk. Medical News Today reached out to Maddie Gallivan, RD, a registered dietitian who was not involved in the recent study. Soluble fiber helps reduce cholesterol in a number of ways. A variety of fibres from whole plant foods — like vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, pulses, legumes, nuts, and seeds — will feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, encouraging them to flourish and support overall health.” Legumes like chickpeas and black beans are an important staple in many parts of the world, but they are relatively unpopular in the West. Although widely available and low cost, research suggests that the average U.S. adult spends less than $5 per year on legumes. “There are a lot of ways to incorporate beans into your regular diet as a cost-effective way to support overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases,” explained author Morganne Smith, a doctoral candidate at Illinois Institute of Technology, and presenting author for this study. However, she also adds a note of caution for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): “It's important to take a gradual approach to increasing legume intake and seek personalized advice from a dietitian to manage symptoms effectively.” MNT reached out to Federica Amati, PhD, MPH, head nutritionist at ZOE, a science and nutrition company. “They are also good for the environment,” she told us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new JNeurosci paper, Adrian Rothenfluh and colleagues from the University of Utah developed a fruit fly model of cocaine self-administration that can be used to explore the genetic underpinnings of cocaine addiction. To model voluntary cocaine intake in fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, the researchers first assessed cocaine consumption and preferences of this insect. Cocaine was innately aversive to fruit flies because it activated their bitter-sensing receptors. In other words, the fruit flies did not like cocaine's bitter taste. When the researchers mutated a gene for these receptors to reduce bitter perception, this made cocaine less aversive to the flies, and they began to approach a solution containing cocaine. We have previously modeled alcohol self-administration in fruit flies, and this has revealed that humans and fruit flies share many of the same genes that drive alcohol consumption and addiction. So, it is reasonable to think that the genes involved with cocaine addiction in humans may also be involved in this fruit fly model." Philyaw, T. J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a young child in the 1980s, Jiwa Farrell earned the moniker “Little Apple Cheeks” because her face was always so “cute and pink.” But by the time she was 6 years old, she had already begun recognizing that something else distinguished her from other kids besides her bright pink complexion. “I had flu-like symptoms all throughout my childhood and always felt very fatigued,” Farrell told Medscape Medical News. “My muscles ached, my joints ached, and I remember thinking as a kid to myself, ‘If I feel this way and other people don't feel this way, what's wrong with me? The answer to that question would take a decade for Farrell and her family to discover, and for most of those years, Farrell's mother, Sharon, had grown so frustrated with doctors that she started letting them know at the start of each appointment the word that would cause her to turn around and walk right back out. Farrell did receive a diagnosis of childhood epilepsy, and the swollen knee was labeled an “unknown infection” as she spent 3 days on intravenous antibiotics in the hospital. “And through all these things, the doctors still continued to tell my mom I was a hypochondriac,” Farrell said. The breakthrough came when she was 16 years old after several events that were difficult to dismiss, although some doctors still did. Then while teaching a karate class, her entire right side went numb and she passed out. “As soon as we went in there, she saw my blood work and didn't even examine me before she snapped her fingers and said, ‘I know what this is,'” Farrell recalled. She ran tests to be certain, and sure enough, Farrell's antinuclear antibody test came back positive. Today, the 47-year-old from Lakeland, Florida, is a professional lupus patient advocate who helps others advocate for themselves in the way she wished she had known to do. “Symptom invalidation,” or “medical gaslighting,” as many patients call it, occurs when doctors dismiss, minimize, or simply ignore patients' symptoms, and it can contribute to depression, anxiety, suicidality, self-doubt, shame, healthcare avoidance, loss of trust in clinicians, and diagnostic delays, according to a recent systematic review. A recent “upsurge in the prevalence of contested, ambiguous, and difficult-to-diagnose illnesses” has made healthcare interactions with no known diagnosis the fastest growing type of medical visit, they noted. The researchers identified four broad categories of harm that clinicians' symptom invalidation can lead to: The findings from the new systematic review echo many of those reported recently in a study in Rheumatology that looked specifically at rheumatologic conditions that are often hard to diagnosis, including lupus, inflammatory arthritis, Sjögren disease, systemic sclerosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, or other inflammatory rheumatic disease. That mixed-methods study not only included participants whose symptoms were dismissed as psychosomatic but also many who received an inaccurate psychiatric diagnosis before their proper rheumatologic one. Patients with either experience had a higher incidence of anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem as well as reduced trust in clinicians and the medical system. “A key point is for clinicians to always consider autoimmunity when they are faced with a patient with many symptoms which initially don't seem to be linked or have an obvious cause, and not to reach for a psychosomatic or mental health diagnosis before they have ruled this out,” lead author Melanie Sloan, PhD, head of the Long-Term Conditions Group at the Cambridge University Department of Public Health, Cambridge, England, told Medscape Medical News. “And if they take on a patient who has been misdiagnosed previously, be very aware of how deep and pervasive the damage from these types of misdiagnoses can be.” More than 80% of patients given a psychosomatic or psychiatric misdiagnosis reported that the misdiagnosis had caused them to distrust doctors at the time and had damaged their self-worth. Patients who were misdiagnosed with psychiatric/psychosomatic symptoms also reported lower levels of confidence, trust, and satisfaction related to medical care than those who had been misdiagnosed with a different physical condition. However, acknowledging the validity of patients' experiences, asking patients how they would like to move forward as a team after an accurate diagnosis, and continuing to check in and support the patient can be valuable steps in building the clinician-patient relationship. Sareth Walton, a 40-year-old in Seattle, knows exactly what it feels like to get an incorrect psychiatric diagnosis before finally getting appropriately diagnosed with lupus. After slamming her head into the window during a car accident in 2007, she suffered blurred vision for 3 months. “It just went downhill really fast.” She began developing auditory hallucinations and became paranoid that light fixtures were actually cameras from the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigating her life. Despite being placed in a padded room, she was determined to break free and rammed her body against the walls so hard that the doctors eventually had to tranquilize her. She was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder “not otherwise specified” and prescribed antipsychotics. “Looking back now, I wish I didn't get the [psychiatric] diagnosis so quickly because they could have looked outside the box of just mental health,” Walton said. She wished they had done more bloodwork and looked at her “fresh, like a blank slate.” Yet even after the lupus diagnosis, Walton experienced dismissal of her symptoms. Sloan said that “medical gaslighting” is a common term and that she empathizes with patients who say they have experienced it because their symptoms have been disbelieved, dismissed, or misattributed to another cause. “Almost all of the clinicians interviewed in our study were shocked and saddened by the level of long-term distress from these misdiagnoses and highly motivated to improve their patients' experiences,” Sloan said. “Interestingly, several clinicians explained that they thought they were being reassuring by telling patients that their symptoms were most likely to be psychological or stress-related,” Sloan said. “They thought this would be preferable to patients worrying about having a disease. Yet for patients who knew there was something seriously wrong with their bodies and felt disbelieved, this ‘reassurance,' although usually well-intentioned, was found to often be deeply damaging with life-long and life-changing repercussions.” In their review, Bontempo and her colleagues suggested that symptom validation happens so often because the training clinicians receive hasn't maintained pace with growing uncertainty about new conditions. “I don't recommend reassurance about it ‘probably being nothing serious' to patients who have a lot of distress about their symptoms,” Bontempo said in a press release. “Patients appreciate clinicians communicating their uncertainty and admitting they don't know something.” “Naming what has happened and aiming to have a shared understanding of what has contributed to the misdiagnosis and its consequences are the first steps,” Lahijani said. Fotios Koumpouras, MD, an associate professor of rheumatology and director of the Yale Lupus Program at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, told Medscape Medical News that this topic “unfortunately has plagued patients with rheumatic diseases,” partly because many of their symptoms can sound bizarre when described by patients, potentially resulting in early disbelief. These findings could therefore be “impactful to both patients and physicians,” he said. Koumpouras also noted that some rheumatic diseases, such as lupus, have been found to be associated with anxiety and other psychiatric illnesses, an issue Sloan explored in a previous study. Lahijani noted that some patients may develop trauma and stressor-related disorders because of their medical illness, so it can be helpful to acknowledge the potential involvement of a sympathetic nervous system “in overdrive.” That can then “cause the ‘fight, flight, freeze, fawn' response” that “may help explain how patients engage in the medical system thereafter,” she said. “Patients need to be validated about what they have experienced and what residual distress they may have that can manifest as fear, worry, nervousness, hypervigilance, avoidance, or low mood,” Lahijani said. Sloan acknowledged the time pressures that clinicians face, which makes it all the more important to “empower and educate patients to be confident in knowing their own bodies,” such as tracking their symptoms and accessing peer support, she said. “We should not underestimate the power of doctors saying ‘I believe you' to patients with multiple invisible symptoms, and ‘I am sorry for what has happened in the past' if they had a difficult road to diagnosis.
