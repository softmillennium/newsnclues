                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tibetan activists protested for a “Free Tibet” during a women's soccer friendly between the United States and China at the weekend — and won the support of other spectators who booed when they were briefly evicted from their seats by security. The activists, dressed in white T-shirts, had been shouting slogans and holding up white banners that read “Free Tibet” during the second half of the game. That prompted boos from other spectators who shouted, “Let them stay!” and chanted “Free speech!” Soon after, stadium officials allowed the activists to return to their seats but confiscated their white banners. They also still wore their “Free Tibet” T-shirts. “The biggest takeaway (from this campaign) is that if Tibetans stand up, raise our voices, and take action for our own cause, then the people of the world automatically rise up in support,” one of the protesters, Tenzin Palsang, told Radio Free Asia on Tuesday. They also play games with human rights,” said Palsang, who is president of the Minnesota chapter of the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress. She cited harsh conditions inside Tibet, where she said children are suffering “colonial boarding school policies,” referring to the Chinese government-run schools where Tibetan children, aged 6-17, have reportedly been held in “prison-like” conditions and forced to study a Mandarin-heavy curriculum that promotes party loyalty or a state-approved “patriotic education.” According to Freedom House's annual 2025 Freedom in the World report, Tibet was given a score of 0, based on an analysis of political and civil freedoms, making it one of the least-free places in the world. China annexed Tibet in 1950 and has since governed the territory with an oppressively heavy-hand while seeking to erase Tibetan culture and identity. Beijing denies it represses Tibet or seeks to erase its cultural traditions, instead pointing to economic development in the region as evidence of its positive impacts on the population of about 6 million Tibetans.</p>

While some USMNT players know their World Cup status, others will be locked in chaotic competition for a roster spot

While every player on the U.S. men's national team heads into this summer with different individual circumstances, every player also shares a common goal: be a part of this team next summer, too.

Those are the stakes as the U.S. prepares for the Gold Cup, a tournament that will feel massive with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon. Positions are up for grabs and, particularly when assessing myriad absences during this camp, there are more than a few players who will be viewing the Gold Cup - and the two friendlies that precede it - as their potential big break.

Some will already know their status for the World Cup, barring an injury absence, while others will be aiming for a starting spot amid chaotic competition that could last until the first match kicks off next year. This is the chance to impress coach Mauricio Pochettino, either to vie for or lock down a World Cup spot.

Where do the players currently on the Gold Cup squad - not including absentees such as Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Gio Reyna, Ricardo Pepi, Folarin Balogun and Weston McKennie - stand? Who will feel good about their World Cup chances heading into this summer and who will have a point to prove? GOAL US breaks it all down.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A critical period is approaching for the U.S. Men's National Team. At the helm of that effort is Mauricio Pochettino, who succeeded Gregg Berhalter as USMNT manager in September 2024. “I don't have any doubt he'll get the most out of the players,” Donovan said to Sports Illustrated. “I've been vocal about the players making sure they get the most out of themselves, but it shouldn't be a coach's job to coach effort,” Donovan said. “I think Pochettino will do a great job making sure they're prepared and then the players have to show up and do the job.” When asked to define what a successful World Cup would look like for the U.S., Donovan was cautious to set the bar high. “I think at a minimum advancing out of our group,” Donovan said. “In many World Cups now, we've advanced out of our group and then lost the next game. And I think at home with momentum, hopefully a lot of players playing well in the prime of their career, we have a team that's right in the prime of its career. Donovan added that the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is “absolutely crucial” to best set up the USMNT leading into next year's World Cup. “We don't have any other meaningful games after this summer,” Donovan said. “It is, in my opinion, all eggs into that basket. We need to play well, we need to win the tournament, and gain some momentum and some confidence going into next summer.” The USMNT kicks off its Concacaf Gold Cup play against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15, while the FIFA World Cup begins June 2026 across the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said this week he hopes to instill in his team the type of urgency and desire to play for the national team that exists in other countries. Speaking on the Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard podcast, Pochettino cited some of the biggest names he has coached — Argentine legend Lionel Messi, French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe and Brazilian star Neymar — as examples of top players who remain “desperate” to play for their respective national teams. For them, when they go, they don't see if it's a friendly game, if it's an official game, it's a World Cup, it doesn't matter, because the possibility to defend one time more your flag, your shirt. The comments are striking after Christian Pulisic made the decision, in conjunction with U.S. Soccer, to skip this summer's Gold Cup. Citing his heavy workload with AC Milan and the U.S. — Pulisic is one of just 10 outfield players in the top five European leagues to appear in 50 games in each of the past two seasons — Pulisic felt he needed the rest in order to be healthy for next summer's World Cup. Donovan compared Pulisic to Messi in that he has the most eyeballs on him of any American player and asked how the staff could handle competing in the tournament this summer without Pulisic. Pochettino praised his team's top player and said he does not question Pulisic's commitment to the group or the country. “I think Christian in the last year showed a great quality,” Pochettino said. He's a very talented player that can help us to win. You say people compare Messi with Christian Pulisic. I don't want to be disrespectful with Messi or Pulisic, but I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi, because he's an iconic player, the kids on the street for sure if you ask one soccer player in this country, it's Pulisic. “We have very good communication with our players. Christian is a very nice guy, is very committed to the national team and he wants to help and of course is desperate to play in the World Cup and arrive in the best condition. All these conversations that we were taking with the players, I think that was the best decision to help him because every player are in different circumstances, and even if I want Christian here or another player here – Antonee (Robinson, injured Fulham left back) or like this – I think no one or another teammate is going to see badly about if I'm saying that, because I think … sometimes you need to put the interest in the medium and long term than in the present. “Because for me after the March camp, if I say, ‘OK I don't care about [anything], I want to win tomorrow,' [there] is [a] consequence after, because I think we are all preparing and focused on the World Cup. When we talk about these types of decisions for us, it was a tough decision  … It was our decision in the end, because if you say you need to come — you cannot force the player to come — but I think I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision to try to find the best for the national team and the best for the player.” It's true that we are a little bit disappointed. Then with all the circumstances in March, it didn't help us to show that.” The Gold Cup was meant to be an important team-building month for the U.S. under Pochettino, his first extended camp with the U.S. since taking over after last summer's Copa América failure. Now it takes on new meaning as Pochettino evaluates his wider national team pool. That being said, Pochettino insisted the goal was still to win. Ultimately, even without Pulisic and other starters — Robinson, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun and Gio Reyna are also missing the tournament via injury, FIFA Club World Cup duty, or, in Musah's case, personal reasons — the tournament serves as a step toward next summer's World Cup. That is true for MLS players trying to break into the squad, but also for others, including World Cup starter Matt Turner. “We don't have fears to talk with the player. At the moment OK, so far it's good, because we are checking your character, your personality, your capacity to be a leader, the leadership that you have, but at some point to be a leader you need to compete.” Pochettino also praised players like Diego Luna, who have started to show they bring value to the squad simply with their mentality and approach. Pochettino noted that Luna didn't want to come out of the game after being elbowed in the nose during a January-camp friendly, then bloodied and taped up, assisted on a goal. “The most important thing is to see in a spontaneous way who will step up when things are wrong, when the stress is there, when the pressure is there, who is going to say ‘Hey, I am here. There is, of course, an enormous amount of pressure on the team to perform in next summer's tournament. Struggles in last summer's Copa América, where the U.S. was eliminated in the group stage, and in this spring's Concacaf Nations League, where it lost to Panama and Canada, have upped the stakes. We all feel the responsibility,” Pochettino said. “Knowing that it's soccer or football, it's about the joy, it's about not to put too much pressure on the players, because the players need to perform. … But yes of course it's a massive pressure. The most important is go and to show. Show on the pitch when you need to defend your flag there, fighting and being a team, that is a moment to say, ‘Yes we have quality, I am a good player, but now it's about to defend your country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now 26 years old and a star performer for AC Milan in Serie A, expectations are sky high whenever he takes to the stage for the USMNT, especially with a home FIFA World Cup just over 12 months away. This comparison may seem laughable to some, but USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino appears to understand the thinking behind it. “I don't want to be disrespectful with Messi or with Pulisic or with Messi, but I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi,” the Argentine, who coaches Messi at Paris Saint-Germain, told Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast. “He's an iconic player and the kid on the street, for sure, if you ask one soccer player in this country, it's Pulisic,” Pochettino added. Pulisic may not quite have Messi's trophy cabinet, which includes eight Ballon d'Ors, four UEFA Champions Leagues, 10 La Liga titles, and a World Cup among many others, but the Pennsylvanian is enjoying an excellent career in Europe. After breaking through with Borussia Dortmund, where he won the German Cup, he made the move to Premier League side Chelsea, winning the Champions League, Super Cup, and Club World Cup. Pulisic's two seasons with the Rossoneri have seen him return to the top of his game, scoring 32 goals in 100 games in all competitions, helping his side lift the Supercoppa Italiana in January. Not that it's all been rosy in Italy, with Milan having recently concluded a torrid season domestically, failing to qualify for European soccer next year, despite Pulisic's best efforts. After two packed seasons with Milan, Pulisic subsequently opted out of being called up by Pochettino for the USMNT's upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, as well as the CONCACAF Gold Cup. This has proven extremely controversial, dividing the opinions of soccer fans and ex-players alike, with some left questioning his desire to play for the USMNT. “When you talk about if I feel disappointed or not, I think we have very good communication with our players,” he explained. Pochettino added that on occasion, he believes it's best to focus on the long term rather than the present, noting that “we are all preparing to focus on the World Cup.” “When we talk about this type of decision, for us, I think it was a tough decision because I think we agreed, because also it was our idea, it was our decision. “And then, because in the end, if you say you need to come, but I think we cannot force the player to come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USA TODAY and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article. DAZN believes the FIFA Club World Cup could become the most live streamed event in sports history. The Club World Cup begins June 14 with Lionel Messi and Inter Miami playing in the opening match in Miami, and ends with the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium on July 13. All 63 matches of the Club World Cup will be available to live stream for free worldwide on DAZN.com, while TNT will broadcast select matches on TV in the United States in English. We think this will easily become the highest streamed live sports event ever because we're going to have audiences not just in the U.S, but in South America, across Europe, across the Middle East, and so on," DAZN's CEO of Growth Markets Pete Oliver told USA TODAY Sports. "It's a really big moment to have a truly global sporting event available on one streaming platform. This is going to be an opportunity to bring in a big, new audience of fans onto DAZN, and for them to experience all of the things we do." Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid, Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, Champions League runner-up Inter Milan, Chelsea, Manchester City, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are among standout clubs participating in the tournament. Club World Cup matches will also be played in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Orlando, Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C. It's a big moment for America, first of all, because it's the first time this tournament (this size) has ever happened," Oliver said. We think it's going to be a very big cultural moment ahead of next year's World Cup." They can just download the app and watch," Oliver said. "It's going to be very big for us globally. DAZN plans to make the soccer-viewing experience unique for fans. The Fan Zone within the DAZN app will allow viewers to participate in polls, chat with each other, and talk to influencers while watching the action. DAZN also will broadcast the tournament in 15 different languages so respective regions across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and South America will be able to experience the tournament like they would any other soccer broadcast by the company. More than 100 popular social media influencers and creators with a combined reach of more than 32 million followers from countries like the U.S., England, Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Libya, France, Venezuela, Italy, Norway, Brazil, and Portugal will bring a wide range of perspectives and cultural energy for the tournament. There also will be alternative watch-along streams, and daily wrap-up shows to recap the tournament. "The coverage we're going to bring is going to be very focused on bringing influencers, younger players who've retired recently and got a more contemporary view, players and pundits who represent all the different countries involved," Oliver said. "We think fans will see a very different premium experience, plus all of those interactive features through the app, making it a much more social and interactive viewing experience than maybe they've had before."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>St. Louis, Missouri, is a city steeped in soccer history and Becky Sauerbrunn soaked in every bit she could growing up in the Gateway City, which many locals refer to as “Soccer City, USA.” At every soccer game on the weekend, whether it was at the prep level, indoor games or college games, she'd always make it an event with friends. “I just felt really fortunate because soccer was kind of all around,” Sauerbrunn told ussoccer.com. “I think that just helped me grow my love and passion for the game.” She formed an indoor team of her own where she was the only girl playing on an all-boys team. Looking back, Sauerbrunn realizes it was a rare gift to have grown up with such a rich history of the sport. Before the USWNT kicks off against Jamaica on June 3, Sauerbrunn will be honored with a retirement ceremony. Sauerbrunn, a center back, was a force in the backline for 219 caps, including two FIFA Women's World Cup victories and an Olympic gold medal in 2012. Current U.S. head coach Emma Hayes didn't have a chance get to coach Sauerbrunn for the USA when she took over the coaching reins in May 2024, but when she was working briefly for the Washington Freedom, which played in pro leagues that were precursors to the NWSL, she watched Sauerbrunn play. Sauerbrunn earned her first cap in January 2008 and became a cornerstone for the National Team between 2014-2021. Hayes said she continually sees the effect Sauerbrunn left on players who played with her and even young players who didn't get the chance. She didn't need to be the biggest name, but if her teammates remembered her as a player that they could ask for advice or come to with concerns, that was more than enough. “That was probably the greatest honor, is that the players felt like they could come to me with things,” Sauerbrunn said. “I think Becky was one of the best leaders this team has ever had,” Girma said. “Sometimes you see leaders look out for the superstars, the starters, but she was definitely someone who made sure that everyone was looked after ... she would make sure to be that voice for them.” She developed that quiet leadership style by watching her veterans. Early in her time with the USA, she remembered being pulled into players' only meetings with the captains to discuss important topics like the Players' Association matters and an upcoming Collective Bargaining Agreement. She learned quickly that while she wasn't a loud leader like Abby Wambach — she'd leave that role for teammates like Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Kelly O'Hara — she'd instead take an approach more like former defensive midfielder Shannon Boxx and lead in her own style. Boxx is now even more of a role model to Sauerbrunn as they're both broadcast teammates for TNT Sports. Her broadcast crew, the current USWNT, former coaches, former teammates and family will all be at Energizer Park to celebrate her brilliant soccer career. While Sauerbrunn originally planned on a quiet goodbye, only a match in St. Louis in front of the city and the people who helped her become a two-time World Cup champion would feel right. “Anytime you can celebrate your career with the people that helped build that career with you,” Sauerbrunn said, “I think it's pretty special.”</p>

The Blues are back in Europe's elite competition having finished fourth last term, capping off a successful season with a Conference League triumph in Poland and becoming the first club to win UEFA's three current competitions. But with Chelsea looking ahead to the Club World Cup in the United States later this month, business is beginning for the Blues, as they look to revamp their huge squad. A report from the Guardian has detailed the current state of Chelsea's squad ahead of a possible £50 million move for Borussia Dortmund starlet Jamie Gittens. The English winger would be a direct replacement for fellow BVB alumnus Jadon Sancho, who the West Londoners don't want to keep beyond this season following a loan spell from Manchester United – while fellow attackers Raheem Sterling and Joao Felix, who both went on loan last season, are expected to leave. With Chelsea's midfield one of the more stable aspects of the team this season, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has been named as another to leave, having failed to displace either Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo after winning FourFourTwo's award for the Best Player in the EFL in 2023/24 under Maresca. The former Leicester City star could be followed out the club by fellow no.8s, Carney Chukwuemeka and Lesley Ugochukwu, who spent last season on loan at Dortmund and Southampton, respectively. Maresca's backline, meanwhile, could well see the biggest changes with Chelsea prepared to let two goalkeepers leave in Robert Sanchez and Djordje Petrovic, along with a handful of defenders, including the injury-prone Wesley Fofana. Renato Veiga, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi – who spent the season half of last season out on loan at Juventus, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa – are expected to exit, while Trevoh Chalobah is the final name mentioned, having been recalled from Palace. FourFourTwo understands that Chelsea are primarily still in the market for new attackers and would like to bring in a new leader in defence, with Dean Huijsen eyed prior to his Real Madrid move.</p>

Traws Pharma Announces Publication of Compelling Efficacy data in... FDA Grants Breakthrough Device Designation to Guardant Health's S... USMNT star joins community to dedicate second of three mini-pitches aimed at fostering youth participation PHILADELPHIA, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allstate, in partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation, unveiled a new mini-pitch on Saturday, May 31, at Bell Avenue Elementary School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania. The initiative, part of a multi-year collaboration with U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Tyler Adams, aims to increase access to safe, engaging play spaces for youth in underserved communities. More than 75 children, ages 9 to 12, participated in a youth clinic led by grassroots partner Black Star, a national community platform focused on accelerating the growth and visibility of Black soccer players, coaches and fans. "As part of our ongoing commitment to youth empowerment, Allstate is proud to support initiatives that create safer spaces and more opportunities for young athletes to thrive," said Elizabeth Brady, executive vice president and chief marketing, customer and communications officer at Allstate. The event featured a block party with local food trucks, a DJ, inflatable soccer games and an appearance by Adams, who participated in the unveiling and engaged with youth and families throughout the day. Mini-pitches are hard-court surfaces designed for both pickup and organized play and have proven to be powerful tools in helping kids stay active, improving public safety and providing accessible, permanent spaces to grow the game. "Partnering with Allstate to create this mini-pitch means a lot to me, not just because it's about soccer, but because it's about access," said Adams. "Growing up, I didn't always have facilities like this. So being able to give kids in communities like Yeadon a safe place to play, grow and dream — that's what it's all about." "This partnership with Allstate and Tyler is a step forward in ensuring soccer is accessible, inclusive and inspiring for all youth, no matter where they come from," said Patrick Rose, director, Black Star and cultural marketing at For Soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IFAB has introduced a new penalty regulation after a high-profile incident in the Champions League game between Madrid and Atlético. IFAB has now ruled that starting from July 2025 (potentially including the Club World Cup), if such an incident occurs, the penalty must be retaken if it results in a goal. IFAB, which sets the laws of soccer, explained that referees tend to penalize the player for a double touch, which was not previously directly regulated. Polish referee Szymon Marciniak did exactly that to Álvarez, whose penalty ‘miss' was crucial in helping Real Madrid eliminate Atlético from the tournament. This is explained in a circular released on Tuesday. “This is very different from the penalty taker accidentally kicking the ball with both feet simultaneously or touching the ball with their non-kicking foot or leg immediately after they have taken the kick, which usually occurs because they have slipped when taking it”. IFAB has therefore decided that, starting from July 2025, “if penalty taker accidentally kicks the ball with both feet simultaneously or the ball touches their non-kicking foot or leg immediately after the kick”, the penalty will be retaken if it is scored. If the penalty is missed, an indirect free-kick will be awarded to the defending team (unless the referee decides to play advantage), while it will be recorded as a miss in a penalty shoot-out. The law that saw Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez's penalty controversially disallowed in March's Champions League shootout against Real Madrid has been officially amended — so that if such a ‘double touch' happens in future the kick would be retaken rather than ruled out.… pic.twitter.com/hHZTndYBV1 The new laws are “effective for competitions starting on or after 1 July 2025 and may be used by competitions starting before that date”. With the FIFA Club World Cup running from June 14 to July 13, the change could come into effect for the tournament, which means there would be no repeat of Álvarez's bizarre penalty and Atlético's controversial elimination.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the FIFA Men's World Cup comes to Seattle next year, Lumen Field will play host to six games, all of which will be played on a natural grass field. “We're very pleased with the cooperation. “We did numbers of presentations as to what this could mean for the state, what this could mean for our city, and we're super pleased, especially in this incredibly tough budget environment, that we got the funding that we needed to put in the grass to get the stadium ready and sort of the capital requirements that were necessary.” That opportunity will come next summer when Seattle is slated to host four group-stage games — including one game featuring the United States — one game in the round of 32 and one game in the round of 16. It will temporarily replace the artificial surface used for games involving the Seahawks, Sounders and Reign, but will only be used for the World Cup matches. That cost includes installation, irrigation and additional equipment to help maintain the health of a grass field at a venue that's never had grass as the primary surface in its history. Those will remain after the tournament leaves along with other infrastructure improvements around the stadium. “Everything the state is funding in capital for the stadium are all things that meet FIFA requirements, but also serve a broader purpose for the stadium ongoing,” said April Putney, chief strategy officer for the local organizing committee. It's all things that will provide ongoing benefit and help the stadium, either with attracting future events or solving the ongoing needs that they have.” There was also funding from the state for $1.7 million in upgrades to the soccer facilities at the University of Washington and another $100,000 for upgrades at Gonzaga. Seattle U and UW will be used as practice fields for teams while they are in town. Gonzaga is under consideration as a potential base camp for a country who could end up playing the majority of its matches on the West Coast with games set to be played in Seattle, Vancouver, B.C., the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. There is also expected to be additional funding coming from the federal level eventually. Seattle's portion of the federal request was $31.5 million to go along with $2.75 million already allocated from the state, Putney said.</p>

Originally slated as a two-game series against China, the change in opponent reintroduces a familiar Concacaf neighbor with the Reggae Girlz. The Stars and Stripes will square off against Jamaica at Energizer Park in St. Louis. The United States is coming off a 3-0 win over China on Saturday, and Jamaica is coming off an April window with two losses against regional rivals Mexico. Midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta made her debut at 32 years old on Saturday, while defender Kerry Abello and goalkeeper Claudia Dickey could get their first caps on Tuesday evening. Jamaica's difficult April window saw the team concede seven goals over two losses to Mexico. Head coach Hubert Busby Jr. will be without top striker Bunny Shaw, midfielder Drew Spence, and veteran goalkeeper Rebeca Spencer. Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more: The U.S. national team dominated the match and won 5-0 with goals scored by Sophia Wilson, Rose Lavelle, Kristie Mewis, and Trinity Rodman. The USWNT won the match convincingly, 3-0, with lots more glimpses of in-game awareness and quicker decision making when they were presented with a higher pressing China side instead of a more structured and defensive formation. "When you're trying to put together so many new players, as a coach, you want to make sure that every time you're with them, you're making less and less tactical corrections, and this week, we've made less than we've ever had to make. Because Avery Patterson knows where to be [on] both sides of the ball. So does Lily [Yohannes], so does Michelle Cooper, so that in return, means the group as a whole can go up higher level, because they're getting better at their understanding of that." "But I'm asking them to deliver a performance with a level of patience, so, I'm not going to criticize them for that. I feel like tactically, we've gone up another level. As Jamaica works on its build-up to the next World Cup cycle, head coach Hubert Busby Jr. is in a similar position of trying to evaluate the talent pool while multiple experienced players are unavailable this window. "As we kind of moved from that game into this one, we looked at a couple of things, and some different players into different positions, you know, and we had conversations about players and looking to try things. I know everyone wants to win every single match. That's what we're here for ... but these games are for us to be able to experiment and try things. We can't do them in World Cup qualifiers, right? So we have to be able to have this full picture of what it is," he said after announcing the Raggae Girls roster. And again, it's not, we're not anywhere close to where it should be, yet, I think we're on the process of getting done ... USWNT: Claudia Dickey; Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sams, Kerry Abello; Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Lindsey Heaps; Catatrina Macario, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson Jamaica: Sydney Schneider; Naya Cardoza, Chantelle Swaby, Allyson Swaby, Konya Plummer; Deneisha Blackwood, Olufolasade Adamolekun, Amelia Van Zanten, Atlanta Primus; Tiffany Cameron, Jody Brown Claire Hutton, USWNT: The deep-lying midfielder has been involved in USWNT camps throughout 2025 and has already made two appearances. Yohannes is developing good chemistry in her matches this year, and the U.S. coaching staff might want to see more games between the two teenagers. The USWNT prepared for a an organized defense against China and were presented with something else. They might be over prepped for a Jamaica side that typically faces them in a mid to low block. It might be another lopsided match with so many of Jamaica's key players unavailable. - Teenage midfielder Lily Yohannes marks one year with USWNT and is just getting started -  Recap: USWNT defeats China, 3-0, to kick off summer international window - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55mtUHdsxIYAttacking Third interview with Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello on first USWNT call-up ☀️ Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He has now agreed a deal with DAZN that will see his The Rest Is Football Podcast broadcast highlights of the Club World Cup. DAZN chief Pete Oliver said: "The Rest Is Football is essential viewing and listening for fans who want insight, entertainment, and personality. "This partnership is a brilliant way to bring the Fifa Club World Cup even closer to that audience. “It's about connecting global football with the voices fans trust and love, and showing the tournament in a fresh, exciting, and authentically British way.” The Club World Cup begins on June 15 and it is being held in the US. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has revamped the tournament to include 32 teams, with Chelsea and Manchester City flying the flag for England. Streaming giants DAZN are the event's global rights holder and will broadcast all 63 matches for free. Channel 5 will also show 23 live games after striking a sub-licencing agreement. It comes amid a bitter end to his time at the Beeb as Match of the Day chiefs dealt him a final snub just hours before his farewell show. The Sun exclusively revealed that they decided to axe his last interview with Liverpool star Mo Salah without warning due to fears he would say something controversial about Gaza. Lineker issued an apology last month after sharing a pro-Gaza video that likened supporters of Israel to rats. He has since been enjoying some time off in Ibiza, attending his son Harry's wedding and appearing to put his feud with brother Wayne aside during celebrations. It has always been Lineker's plan to expand his podcast empire after his BBC departure, saying: "Professionally, I've got a big podcast company and I think it takes up quite a bit of my time and it will probably take up a bit more now. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A poor performance in last summer's Copa America tournament followed by a 4th place finish this past March in the CONCACAF Nations League has injected seeds of doubt over this group's readiness to take on the world's best in what will perhaps be the most important tournament in American soccer history. This summer's Gold Cup (being played in the U.S. from June 14th through July 6th) was supposed to serve as a final opportunity for the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) to come together and right the ship prior to 2026. But several key absences from first team regulars means uncertainty around the squad will linger well beyond the tournament's conclusion. The most high profile of those absences is star attacker Christian Pulisic who plays his club soccer for Italy's AC Milan. Coming off back-to-back seasons of 50 games played, Pulisic asked for this summer off so as to rest and recuperate with the hope of maximizing his chances of being healthy for next summer's World Cup. On the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the two former American soccer stars sat down with current USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino who said the decision for Pulisic not to come was a collective one. “We cannot force the player to come. But I think I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision, you know, to try to find the best for the national team and for the best for the player. With Pulisic and other projected starters like Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun all unavailable for the tournament, is the goal still to win or is it simply to use this as a period of player evaluation? I feel so bad, so [expletive], that is the word, when we lose against Panama (in the Nations League). But in the same time, in a parallel way, I think it's a great opportunity for many players to show we are here and we want to fight for a place in the World Cup.” The United States' first Gold Cup match occurs on June 15th against Trinidad & Tobago in San Jose, California.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi has scored another Michelob Ultra commercial – this one timed to the FIFA Club World Cup. If you are a fan of football or fútbol, you likely remember the Michelob Ultra commercial from 2024's Super Bowl featuring the Argentina and Inter Miami superstar, Jason Sudeikis and NFL great Dan Marino in which Messi joins a game of beach soccer when the Michelob Ultra tap goes dry. The 30-second ad will appear on social media – including on YouTube – and air during broadcasts throughout the FIFA Club World Cup. The international tournament starts June 14 with Messi and Inter Miami taking on Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. "A global soccer icon like Messi helps fuel the significant momentum and growth both soccer and Michelob Ultra have been experiencing across the U.S.," he said in a statement to USA TODAY. Michelob Ultra will also sponsor the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Michelob Ultra pop-up beer gardens and pitchside clubs will be found at the 12 host stadiums, too. Fans can enter online to win a chance to sit in the Michelob Ultra Pitchside Club in New York City for the semifinals and final. "The FIFA Club World Cup is an opportunity to continue to make our brand synonymous with one of the world's most beloved sports by elevating the fan experience this summer and into 2026," Marques said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid is working to finalize several important signings before the Club World Cup. Huijsen and Alexander Arnold are already confirmed and they're negotiating for Álvaro Carreras with Benfica. However, it seems that things won't stop at just these three names. Josep Pedrerol has spoken and pointed out two more signings that Real Madrid will make. But there will be two more additions joining the three defenders he already takes for granted. Pedrerol has indicated that the first moves have taken place in defense out of necessity. Xabi Alonso has been clear about the signings he wants brought in this summer for next season. Beyond the defense, where they've strengthened in every position. A playmaker has been one of his major demands for next season. With Kroos's retirement last summer and Modric's departure this year, they've lost quality in the midfield. In attack, a forward like Joselu has been missed for matches that became complicated. A "tank" in the box, able to bring down balls and with the opposing goal always in mind. Maybe this isn't the priority right now, but Xabi Alonso has also requested it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA - The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is preparing to play a central role in hosting soccer fans from around the world during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with expanded service and enhanced customer support for the six matches scheduled at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. "Soccer fans can go from the plane to the train to their hotel seamlessly and let MARTA drive them easily to and from the matches and other Club World Cup festivities around the city." MARTA will increase service before and after each match, including running a pre-game shuttle train between Five Points and GWCC stations. Despite ongoing construction at Five Points Station, all rail service and transfers will operate as scheduled, with street-level access via Forsyth Street. Looking ahead to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, MARTA is coordinating with FIFA, the Atlanta Sports Council, and other agencies to expand service for the eight matches Atlanta will host. Fan events will extend beyond the stadium, including the City of Decatur's monthlong "WatchFest26" located above Decatur Station.
