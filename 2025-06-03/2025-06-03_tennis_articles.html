                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The three-time defending champion meets her biggest rival and world No. 1: who will reach the final in Paris?BySteve TignorPublished Jun 03, 2025 copy_link Before this past weekend, Swiatek-Sabalenka was in danger of becoming the great tennis rivalry that wasn't.They've been the two best women players since 2022, but that's also the last time they faced off at a major. As dominant as each has been during different sections of the season, they couldn't put it all together at the same time at a Slam. The way things were going as Roland Garros began, the drought didn't look like it was going to end any time soon.Swiatek, a four-time RG champion, had been the reigning Queen of Clay for most of this decade, but she appeared to have dethroned herself this spring. By the time Iga played in Rome three weeks ago, it felt like she was struggling to put two balls in a row into the court, and she wasn't getting any closer to figuring out why. For the first time, Sabalenka, who has never reached a final in Paris, had replaced her as the favorite there.

For the first time, Sabalenka, who has never reached a final in Paris, had replaced her as the favorite there. As they say, though, there's no place like home. From there, her topspin bombs finally stopped sailing over the lines, and started detonating in the corners again.Swiatek says her history in Chatrier helps her self-belief.“I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything, because there's more probably that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places,” she says. “I just maybe believe it a little bit more.” Down 6-1, 2-0 to Elena Rybakina in the fourth round, Swiatek took a full-cut rip at an important backhand, and it won her the point. From there, her topspin bombs finally stopped sailing over the lines, and started detonating in the corners again.Swiatek says her history in Chatrier helps her self-belief.“I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything, because there's more probably that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places,” she says. “I just maybe believe it a little bit more.” Swiatek says her history in Chatrier helps her self-belief.“I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything, because there's more probably that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places,” she says. “I just maybe believe it a little bit more.” “I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything, because there's more probably that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places,” she says. “I just maybe believe it a little bit more.” I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything, because there's more probably that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places. I just maybe believe it a little bit more. She hasn't dropped a set, yet she did get two useful tests in her last two matches, from hard-hitting players who have beaten her in the past. Amanda Anisimova pushed her to 7-5 in the first set in the fourth round, and Zheng Qinwen, who just beat Sabalenka in Rome, played well early and pushed her to a first-set tiebreaker. Both times, the top seed responded and reasserted control of the baseline.“I expected her to play a great match,” Sabalenka said of Zheng. I enjoyed that I had to come back in that first set, and the first set was, like, really tight. It could go either way.”So who's the favorite now? I'm going to see say it's even at the moment. Swiatek leads their head-to-head 8-4, and is 5-1 on clay. Sabalenka won their most recent meeting, on hard courts in Cincinnati last summer, and has been the better player since. “I expected her to play a great match,” Sabalenka said of Zheng.

This will also be their first meeting since Sabalenka engineered a thaw in their personal relationship—not that one seemed to exist—when she asked Swiatek to do a Tik-Tok video with her last fall. They'll probably be happy to be rivals again.“I love it,” Sabalenka says of getting a chance to Swiatek again at a Slam. I'm always excited to face someone strong and then someone who can challenge me.”The two appear to be at even strength at the moment, but I'll take the one who has been at her best all along this season.

Lorenzo Musetti advanced to his first semifinals appearance at the French Open Tuesday with a four-set win over Frances Tiafoe. Musetti held off Tiafoe despite receiving an unsportsmanlike conduct warning in the second set after inadvertently hitting a line judge with a ball he kicked toward the back wall at Roland-Garros out of frustration. The eighth-seeded Musetti drew an instant reaction from the chair umpire for a code violation, but was not penalized further. Musetti finished off Tiafoe in the fourth set after a series of close line calls went his way in the final games. Many questioned after match if Musetti should've received a default and been ousted from the tournament after the play. Tiafoe looked at the chair umpire as if he was expecting a ruling, but only a warning was delivered. "You could see (Musetti) was frustrated, but it wasn't as if he took a full throttle kicking the ball." Lorenzo Musetti received a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct after this incident 😳 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/ted26XaBUv The lineswoman received medical attention and was fine, but play had to be stopped and Djokovic's hit out of frustration was reviewed. Tiafoe won Tuesday's second set against Musetti with a blazing cross-court forehand on set point, but a loss in third-set tiebreak was when his opponent took the upper hand in the match. Musetti coasted in the final set, overpowering Tiafoe with his serve while taking advantage of a few ill-timed unforced errors from his opponent. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz lost in the first round of the French Open as the tournament's No. 4 seed on Monday, eliminated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by 66th-ranked Daniel Altmaier of Germany. Altmaier broke Fritz's big serve five times at Court Simonne-Mathieu and ended the Californian's 15-match Grand Slam winning streak against players ranked outside the top 50. Fritz's exit followed another by a top-10 American: No. 9 Emma Navarro was bounced from the women's bracket earlier Monday. In September, Fritz lost the U.S. Open trophy to Jannik Sinner, becoming the first U.S. man to reach a major final since Andy Roddick in 2009. In Paris, Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Roddick was No. While hard courts are Fritz's preferred surface, he did have a run to the second week on the red clay of Roland-Garros a year ago, making it into the fourth round before losing to Casper Ruud. This is not Altmaier's first big win at the French Open. 8 seed Matteo Berrettini there in 2020, and Sinner in 2023.</p>

Three former New Jersey high school stars are set to take part in a four-player singles field and a four-pair bracket for doubles. Delbarton alum Michael Zheng of Columbia headlines the action. The 2021 NJSIAA state singles tournament champion and last fall's NCAA men's singles tournament winner will compete in both the singles and doubles playoffs. His doubles partner is teammate Nicolas Kotzen, a Newark Academy alum who Zheng defeated in the NJSIAA singles final. Zheng was named an Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division-I All-American this spring. Also competing in the doubles bracket is Alex Kotzen, another Newark Academy alum and NJSIAA state singles champion from 2019. He is the older brother of Nicolas. The new event, featuring the top American collegiate players, is expected to more than double the average number of U.S. Open wild card berths earned by American collegiate players with six. The winners of the men's and women's singles and doubles competitions will earn U.S. Open main draw wild cards in their respective categories. The finalists, meanwhile, will receive U.S. Open qualifying wild cards. Zheng earned an automatic spot into the playoffs after winning the NCAA singles title in November. The rest of the field, listed below, were selected by a committee comprising USTA staff, college coaches, and an ITA representative. The event is free and matches will begin at 5 p.m. each day.

Yet even that status didn't spare her from competing in front of empty seats at Roland-Garros, something she says isn't fair. “It was a big match and probably would make more sense to put us a little bit later just so more people could watch it,” Sabalenka said after her 7-6 (3), 6-3 win. “ I definitely think that would make more sense to kind of like move our match for a little bit later.” No women's matches have been scheduled for the evening session this year, something Sabalenka said should change. Asked about her views on the fact that women haven't played a single night match this year, the player from Belarus said they deserve “equal treatment.” “There was a lot of ... great battles, a lot of great matches which would be cool to see as night sessions,” she said. “Just more people in the stands watching these incredible battles. I definitely agree that we deserve to be put on a bigger stage. There was, however, one upside to the early start for Sabalenka ahead of her semifinal against four-time champion Iga Swiatek.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominance at Roland Garros by securing her 26th consecutive victory at the event, defeating Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. 13 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine 6-1, 7-5 in their quarterfinal meeting on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Despite holding her lowest ranking since 2022 and nearly falling to Elena Rybakina in the previous round, Swiatek pulled out some of her peak play to dismiss Svitolina, who was seeking an appearance in her fourth career Grand Slam semifinal. "Even though first set, the score looks pretty straightforward, it wasn't like that in any other games," Swiatek said to the press. Swiatek, who has spent 125 weeks at World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final four on Thursday. Sabalenka is enjoying her 41st week at the top of the rankings and ousted reigning Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in their quarterfinal. Sabalenka, though, beat Swiatek 6-3, 6-3 in their most recent meeting, on the hard courts of Cincinnati last year. This will be their first-ever meeting at Roland Garros. "For sure our rivalry is pushing both of us, I think, but it's not only about the level of tennis," Swiatek said. Clay-court queens: Svitolina started the day as this year's clay-court match-win leader, with 16 victories on the dirt in 2025. Swiatek, meanwhile, entered Roland Garros without a clay-court title for the first time since 2020. However, she won that 2020 Roland Garros championship anyway, and she still has a chance to take the crown for a fifth time after closing out Svitolina's stellar clay-court swing. Swiatek is the fifth player in the Open Era, including women and men, to win 25 or more consecutive singles matches at Roland Garros. The rest of that list: Rafael Nadal, Chris Evert, Bjorn Borg and Monica Seles. "I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything," Swiatek said. "Because there's more [probability] that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places. I just maybe believe it a little bit more." Match moments: Tuesday's first-set scoreline looks routine, but Svitolina did have three chances to break in the opening frame. Once she got through that game, Swiatek and her signature forehand took control. In the next game, Swiatek used that wing to convert her fifth break point of another lengthy tussle and lead 5-1. She eased to the one-set lead from there. As windy conditions intensified in the second set, Svitolina made her presence felt. The Ukrainian jumped out to a 3-1 lead before Swiatek regrouped, slamming rally forehands crosscourt to pull back on serve. Still, Svitolina was two points away from taking the second set after a forehand winner gave her deuce at 5-4. Swiatek, though, was not to be denied, holding on for 5-5, then cranking a forehand return winner off of a second serve to break for 6-5. Serving for the match, Swiatek summoned her second ace of the day to queue up double match point. Defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominance at Roland Garros by securing her 26th consecutive victory at the event, defeating Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World No 5 looked crushed after his transformative clay swing ended in defeat to Alexander Bublik but grass is the perfect surface to make amends Now ranked No 5, Draper is one of the elite opponents that others lomeasure themselves against. As was the case with Bublik on Monday, this will sometimes work. Draper is still new to these situations; this is his second grand slam tournament as a top 20 player and his first inside the top five. A year ago, he could barely trust his body over five sets. Facing more of these experiences will teach him how to overcome them. Despite his own disappointment, Draper ends his clay season having made transformative progress on the surface, which he previously had minimal experience on. Less than two months ago, in his third-round defeat to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the Monte Carlo Masters, the British No 1 was still struggling badly with his movement on the surface and his confidence was shot. His growth since then is reflected in his results as he reached his first clay-court final at the Madrid Open, a Masters 1000 event, and following it up with a quarter-final in Rome. He could still reach a new high world ranking of No 4 on Monday. While some players tend to handle defeats better with age, Draper says that his losses are more painful. In the hours after his defeat to Bublik, he looked utterly crushed. One of Draper's most admirable qualities is the perspective he maintains in difficult moments. Since he has arrived on the circuit, navigating physical problems, anxiety and doubt, few things have come easily for him. “My journey, even though I've come up quickly this year, I've got myself to a high ranking, it's always been a steep learning curve for me. Once Draper has finished stewing over this loss, he will shift his sights on the coming storm. While British athletes are often burdened by hype and expectations, Draper is still somewhat under the radar. He has immense respect within tennis, and there is a consensus that he is a genuine contender at the biggest events, but his profile at home does not match his growing list of achievements. This will surely change when he heads to Wimbledon as one of the best in the world and on grass, a surface that perfectly suits his game, he will be a top contender. This will be Draper's first experience of the attention and scrutiny that comes with his new lofty status. How he handles those challenges will be fascinating and instructive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the many highs for Serena Williams, there were also some infrequent lows. And one of those less glamorous moments came at the French Open in 2019, where a surprise early exit would lead to a chain of consequences that would leave another tennis star rather unhappy. When Williams was sent home after a third round defeat to then 20-year-old Sofia Kenin, she was unsurprisingly not in the best of moods. After the defeat, a dejected Williams had to fulfil her media obligations and was desperate to get them done as soon as possible. According to French newspaper L'Equipe, Williams told a tournament official, "Put me in another room, smaller, but now" referring to the press conference theaters. It led to the official at Roland Garros telling Dominic Thiem, who was fulfilling his media obligations in one room, to end his press conference early to make way for Williams. What's the point of that, that I have to leave the room because she's coming?" It shows a bad personality, in my opinion," Thiem later told reporters. Maybe for a couple of minutes or so. "It doesn't matter if it is me who sits in there, even if a junior is in there. "I am 100% sure Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal would never do something like that." "I don't know if it was her mistake or only the mistake of the officials," Thiem later added. If she'd seen me, it would have been nicer for her to wait. "I had an apology [from tournament director Guy Forget]. I don't know whose fault it is exactly. It was just a very strange thing, I never had something like that before. The then fourth-seeded Thiem said he understood Williams' desire to get her media responsibilities done as fast as she could. "She lost and everything," the Austrian said. "So I think it was a little bit mistake of her, mistake of the officials, but as I said, it's forgotten. "It was a funny thing, strange thing, which made a big round in all the social networks, but now I don't put any attention on it anymore." Roger Federer offered his opinion on the situation at the time, aiming blame at those who allowed this situation to even occur. "I don't know what went wrong but something went wrong for this to happen," the Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion said. "If I would have lost today against Leonardo Mayer, I would let him go first or decide when he wants to go to press as he's got a next match. So that's just the way you go about it. "There must have been a misunderstanding, or maybe they should have kept Serena still in the locker room, not waiting here in the press centre." Annabelle Croft, a former world No.24 and now tennis commentator, slammed Williams at the time, claiming that she should have just waited. “She should be made to wait an extra five minutes until finished. Had it been a role reversal, there would have been absolute uproar," she said on EuroSport at the time. I think he's owed an apology to be honest.” “I begged them to put me in the small room, and they didn't. I was like, ‘You guys are so rude to do that', quote-unquote, that's what I said. The next day I had a bad personality. “I actually stuck up for the guy, so I don't understand how I got a bad personality for telling them what they did was wrong to him. “I'm really, quite frankly, too old to be in controversy. That's why I just wanted to clear the air. Later, Thiem would actually extend an olive branch to Williams, making it clear that it was likely not her fault but the fault of the organisers. “Probably it was not Serena's mistake,” he told reporters a month later I would like to make amends with her in Wimbledon or the US Open mixed doubles. “In retrospect, it was funny that such an organisational mistake happened at a Grand Slam tournament. What I do not understand is that it blew up so much.” So no hard feelings in the end.

The 30-year-old Australian has played very little tennis over the last two years because of various injuries, notably a wrist problem that required surgery.

In March at the Miami Open, he won his first singles match since 2022, but he pulled out of the ongoing French Open, where he had been down to play men's doubles, with a knee injury.

"I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year," he wrote on Instagram.

"I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint."

Kyrgios, whose undoubted talent has often been overshadowed by his fragile temperament, added: "This is just a bump in the road though and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever."

Kyrgios reached the final at Wimbledon three years ago before going down in four sets to Novak Djokovic.

The third Grand Slam of the year starts on June 30th.</p>
