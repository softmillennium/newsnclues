                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Trump Organization knows nothing about this project," a spokesperson for the Trump Organization told CoinDesk. The app, according to its sparse but live website, promises users the ability to hold and trade digital assets. It includes no technical documentation or launch timeline but features a waitlist for early access. U.S. President Donald Trump has leaned into crypto since reentering the political arena ahead of last year's election. Past initiatives tied to Trump include World Liberty Financial, a stablecoin venture, and the meme tokens Trump Coin and Melania Coin, both of which launched before his 2025 inauguration. Donald Trump Jr., one of the president's children, also said in an X post that the organization has "zero involvement with this wallet product," but that World Liberty will "soon" launch its own wallet. His youngest son, Barron Trump, also denied the partnership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In May 2025, an Italian crypto millionaire was allegedly tortured for weeks in a luxury Manhattan townhouse, hung from a roof ledge and attacked with a chain saw as his captors demanded his bitcoin password. Just months earlier, another crypto executive had his finger severed by kidnappers demanding millions in digital currency. Crypto investors are waking up to how these aren't isolated incidents—they're part of a terrifying new wave of violent crimes that many worry has put a target on their backs. As Bitcoin and other digital assets have reached record highs, criminals are shifting from laborious online hacking to brutal, real-world extortion. Criminals are increasingly professional in their approach, leveraging a mix of digital sleuthing and real-world surveillance. Many victims are identified after flaunting their crypto wealth on social media or in public forums, despite the lessons many learned after the Kim Kardashian kidnapping saga. Others are exposed through data breaches at exchanges. For example, in May 2025, Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) announced that hackers had accessed home addresses and account balances of almost 70k customers in the previous months, putting thousands at risk of targeted extortion and physical threats. Besides hacks, criminals have bribed insiders at crypto exchanges to leak sensitive customer data. This information can then be used to select and find high-value targets for kidnapping or home invasion. The luxury SoHo townhouse rented for up to $40,000 per month seemed like the perfect backdrop for crypto success. Instead, it became a torture chamber where 28-year-old Italian entrepreneur Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan was allegedly held for 17 days, his captors using increasingly brutal methods to crack his bitcoin wallet. According to police, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, both of whom have a history in the crypto world, didn't just threaten their victim—they hung him off the building's roof ledge, shocked him with electrical wires, and menaced him with a chain saw. When all that failed, they allegedly forced him to smoke crack cocaine and took Polaroid photos of his bound and bloodied body as trophies of their work. In the United States, a violent gang orchestrated a series of home invasions involving $3.5 million in stolen crypto between September 2022 and July 2023. Victims were threatened, tortured, and forced to transfer their digital assets under duress. The ringleader, Remy Ra St. Felix, was sentenced to 47 years in prison in 2024 after court documents revealed the gang's use of extreme violence, including inserting sharp objects under fingernails. “The victims in this case suffered a horrible, painful experience that no citizen should have to endure,” said U.S. Attorney Sandra J. Hairston for the Middle District of North Carolina in a prepared statement. In France, the crypto world recoiled in early 2025 when attackers didn't just kidnap the father of a prominent entrepreneur, but filmed themselves severing his finger and sent the video to his son, demanding €5 million (about $5.7 million) in crypto ransom. David Balland, a co-founder of Ledger, the crypto security firm, endured similarly gruesome attacks during his January 2025 kidnapping. Security experts urge investors to avoid sharing details of their holdings online, even with friends, and to use pseudonyms and fresh digital wallet addresses for each transaction. Physical safety measures are just as important—avoid posting geotagged photos, flaunting luxury items, or revealing travel plans that could signal wealth. Store the bulk of your assets in multi-signature or cold wallets, which require multiple keys or are kept offline, making immediate transfers under duress impossible. Consider setting up decoy wallets with small amounts of crypto to surrender if threatened, while keeping the majority of your funds inaccessible in an emergency. Finally, stay informed about the latest scams and extortion tactics. The rise of crypto extortion is a stark reminder that digital wealth can bring very real-world dangers. As criminals become more brazen and sophisticated, crypto holders must balance the pursuit of financial freedom with a heightened sense of caution. Protecting your assets and, more importantly, yourself means you'll need to give much more thought to security because in the new world of crypto riches, the risks are no longer just virtual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One NFT sold for 99.9 solana, or over $16,000 at current prices. Holders of the $TRUMP meme coin as well as those who attended Trump's gala dinner in May for his meme coin whales, were airdropped NFTs on the solana blockchain, according to a Tuesday announcement by the meme coin project's X account. Addresses, such as 12f1o and 2PdmU, received NFTs from three different collections – Diamond Hands, Gold Gala Dinner, and Power to the Holders –  if they met each of the criteria outlined by the meme coin project. The Diamond Hands NFT collection, which has a total supply of 118 NFTs, had a single transfer sale in the last 24 hours, but was the most expensive purchase of its cohort at 99.9 solana worth more than $16,000, data from NFT marketplace Magic Eden shows. With a total supply of 219 NFTs, the Gold Gala Dinner collection had four sales within the period which had an average sale of nearly 42.5 solana representing about $6,900. Magic Eden also revealed Tuesday afternoon it's partnering with the meme coin's team to launch a Trump-branded crypto wallet. The newly released NFT collections continue a years-long history of Trump rolling out digital collectibles and incentivizing dinners to buyers. The sitting president last dropped an NFT collection in August 2024 where buyers who acquired multiples could get rewards such as an invite to a gala dinner with Trump. DLNews reported in February that Trump generated between $7.3 and $8.2 million from his NFT collections, citing his financial disclosures from 2023 and 2024. The first time Trump promoted NFT cards using his image was in 2022, which sold out in a day for about $4.4 million, per a Forbes report. NFTs reached a fever pitch in 2021 after digital artist Beeple sold an NFT piece to art auction house Christie's for $69 million. The NFT mania has largely faded, with former giants like Yuga Labs selling CryptoPunks to a nonprofit. The bitcoin miner is sitting on a pile of crypto worth over $5 billion. “We're building with conviction and readiness,” the firm's CEO told Sherwood News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on June 3. In a blog post on Monday, the Ethereum Foundation said its Protocol Research & Development arm would continue under a new name: Protocol. At the same time, its headcount will drop from more than 110 employees to fewer than 100, according to organisation charts shared before and after the restructuring. The foundation also has an operations team as well as teams that research privacy-enhancing technology and support software developers building applications atop Ethereum. Earlier this year, the Ether cryptocurrency languished while Bitcoin and Solana hit all-time highs. Critics blasted Ethereum co-founder and foundation board member Vitalik Buterin for the foundation's seemingly hands-off approach to Ethereum development and called for Miyaguchi's ouster. While Buterin insists Miyaguchi's transition from executive director to president began long before critics' frustration boiled over, the new co-EDs wasted no time signaling they had heard the criticism and would lead accordingly. In April, they said they had three priorities for the next year: making Ethereum more performant, ensuring layer 2 blockchains remain affordable, and improving user experience. As I wrote at the time, that was a bit of a pivot for an organisation that had long believed the road to mass adoption ran through layer 2 blockchains alone. Monday's changes were all about delivering on that pivot, senior EF employees wrote. “We encourage every team in Protocol to consider how their work is supporting our execution of these strategic initiatives,” the blog post reads. Others were less concerned that a more assertive foundation would compromise Ethereum's decentralisation. “I applaud strong leadership that facilitates decentralization to actually happen instead of the kumbaya of the past that couldn't even get a basic website done to convey what Ethereum is even about,” Sebastian Bürgel, a vice president at Gnosis DAO, said. Ethereum has performed well in recent weeks, but that doesn't mean investors have forgotten the days when it was trading above $4,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ECB selects XRP Ledger and White Network for a 12-month CBDC pilot across 500 financial firms. XRP Ledger leads the ECB's Digital Euro pilot with White Network adding compliance and resilience. ECB begins CBDC testing using XRP Ledger and White Network to power cross-border Eurozone payments. The ECB launches a regulated, cross-border CBDC trial backed by XRP Ledger and White Network. The European Central Bank has initiated a 12-month pilot for its official Digital Euro project, selecting XRP Ledger and White Network as infrastructure providers. The program will test real-time settlement, cross-border payments and regulatory compliance across 500 financial institutions. XRP Ledger will serve as the primary infrastructure, delivering more than 1,500 transactions per second with sub-five-second finality. This ensures institutional-grade reliability and responsiveness in real-time financial environments. The European Central Bank will officially launch its Digital Euro pilot! The ECB has listed @WhiteRock_Fi as a secondary platform alongside $XRPL, to help power Europe's first regulated CBDC. XRP performance benchmarks align with these parameters, offering programmable, auditable and transparent transactions. The ECB will gather usage data to evaluate performance, integration capabilities and potential scalability. The pilot will undergo three phases between June 2025 and May 2026. These include infrastructure validation, institutional integration and full-scale testing across regulated financial networks. XRP Ledger's integration aims to demonstrate secure and efficient cross-border transaction capabilities in compliance with EU standards. The network features institutional support tools designed to complement XRP Ledger's capabilities in regulated environments. White Network will offer resilience and diversity to the pilot's infrastructure stack. White Network brings compliance-focused features tailored to European monetary regulations. These include smart contract governance tools, custody solutions and secure messaging protocols. The platform's team also launched a fair token initiative rewarding early holders, creating additional incentives. The phased rollout includes deployment, controlled testing and final performance analysis with key indicators guiding each phase's success metrics. All infrastructure providers must meet high security, speed and stability benchmarks to remain in the pilot. Upon pilot completion, final recommendations will be released after May 2026.

DOGE and PEPE, both among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, have gained 3% and 9% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin has climbed about 2% in that time. But while the top memes are leading BTC, they're severely underperforming a basket of established Solana-based animal meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF), Popcat (POPCAT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Moo Deng (MOODENG), all which are beginning a rebound off double-digit percentage losses in the last 7 days. That's still nearly 79% off its March 2024 all-time high of $4.83, however. The group, which all earned centralized exchange listings during last year's Solana meme coin frenzy, have also experienced trading volume increases during the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Beyond Solana, other established meme coins are leading the charge higher on their respective chains. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index maintains a total market capitalization of around $47.5 trillion. All this comes while the meme coin category has managed just a 3.1% gain during that time, and remains down nearly 10% over the last week.

Renovaro Secures Key U.S. Patent to Strengthen AI-Driven Drug Dis... HOLO allocates 66% of cash reserves to crypto, generating $19.08M income; represents major asset allocation shift with mixed risk profile. MicroCloud Hologram has made a significant financial move by allocating up to $200 million of its $303 million cash reserves (approximately 66% of total cash) toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. This represents an extraordinarily high concentration of capital in volatile digital assets for a technology service provider. The company reports it has already generated $19.08 million in cumulative investment income from these positions, suggesting an approximate 9.5% return on the initial investment. What's particularly notable is the scale of this allocation relative to HOLO's balance sheet. Committing 66% of cash reserves to cryptocurrency derivatives represents a dramatic departure from traditional corporate treasury management practices, which typically prioritize capital preservation through diverse, low-risk instruments. The remaining cash ($103 million) is earmarked for technology development across blockchain, quantum computing, holography, and AI-AR integration. HOLO's strategy diverges significantly from most public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, as those firms typically allocate a much smaller percentage of reserves. This approach introduces substantial volatility risk to HOLO's financial foundation, potentially impacting its ability to fund operations and R&D should cryptocurrency markets experience prolonged downturns. Investors should carefully evaluate whether this represents prudent diversification or an overconcentration in speculative assets that fundamentally alters the company's risk profile. SHENZHEN, China, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroCloud Hologram Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC price action is already hunting liquidity immediately above price as support thickens, but market analysis doubts that new highs will come this week. Bitcoin seeks to take liquidity around $106,000 as traders hope for a sustained price recovery. Significant support is in place down to $97,000, boosting the odds of price holding. Profit-taking is underway but lacks the intensity of classic cycle tops, research says. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reversing losses seen after the daily close. After dipping below old all-time highs from late 2024, Bitcoin managed to halt declines amid concerns that $100,000 may come in for a support test. Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass underscored the potential for price to “squeeze” higher or lower to take neighboring liquidity, with upside liquidity already in the firing line. “FireCharts shows ~$263M in BTC bid liquidity laddered down to $97,750, and an additional block of plunge protection just above the Yearly Open,” it observed on the day. “The trend undoubtedly is still up, but there has been no strong continuation above $100K+ this year just yet,” Daan Crypto Trades summarized the day prior. In new research into profit-taking activity among the Bitcoin hodler base, onchain analytics firm Glassnode showed just how unusual recent returns have been.

Solana was once just a niche Layer 1 blockchain, but now it has decidedly emerged onto the international financial scene. Because of this, digital asset investing is now looking ahead to an era where the technology is scalable, fast, and practical. Because evolving markets and investors want more thoughtful and open solutions, blockchain is naturally becoming part of the banking industry. Solana's work with major institutions matters for both sides, as it will shape future interactions. At the same time, people's broader interest in crypto investment is rising, thanks to ETF approvals, the rise of decentralised finance, and strong demand for Bitcoin price updates alongside Solana. Financial institutions are no longer deciding if blockchain is worth exploring—they are now working out which partners would be best to work with. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have had trouble meeting demand at peak times, Solana was designed to process a high volume of transactions without raising costs. Because of these skills, people regard this enterprise as a great option for handling real-world asset tokenisation, promising banks many opportunities. With blockchain tech providers partnering with Solana, banks can explore applying tokenisation to traditional assets, including bonds, equities, and derivatives. We want to improve the financial system, not replace it with something new. Solana's making it possible to use banks for tokenised assets is a significant catalyst for change in the industry. With the traditional system, assets such as real estate, stocks, and government bonds require multiple steps, which causes much delay and high costs. Using tokenisation, digital versions of these assets appear on the blockchain, simplifying things. For a tokenised bond, issuance, trading, and settlement take minutes, not days, as it does with traditional bonds. Investors may hold fractional stocks, immediately trade their shares on the secondary market, and clearly see their holdings and current value. With blockchain, banks experience lower expenses and can reach a wider range of clients. Since traditional asset classes are now less expensive and easier to trade, more people can invest small amounts in them. Using Solana will expand beyond the banking industry's technological foundations. Because the gap between traditional finance and blockchain is shrinking, more institutions are expected to offer services built on blockchain to their customers. This means you might get options like tokenised checking, benefits in crypto through rewards and frictionless movement between fiat and virtual currencies. Because of this faith from institutions, many retail investors are encouraged to learn more about what blockchain technology offers. Because banks now accept Solana, its reputation will increase, much as Bitcoin did when institutions started investing in it. Bank-released stablecoins, tokenised reward points, and debit cards working on Solana might be other changes we notice. These could improve the ability to use blockchain and attract a much larger number of people to use it daily. Strong Technical Aspects Are the Basis for Better Financial Integration Due to its specific design, Solana operates well under high-volume financial conditions. While many blockchains depend on sequential data, Solana creates its transaction log using Proof of History. Using smart contract automation allows banks to programme assets, handle settlements automatically, and check compliance rules without staff intervention. Because of these solid community networks, banks and businesses can use these solutions without doubt, since the blockchain system is constantly advancing and improving. Banks will continue to encounter new legal rules as they carry out tokenisation and set up blockchain solutions. Knowing Solana's technology, it is vital for services dealing with money to be well-defended from hacks and vulnerabilities. Solana's link with leading banks goes beyond an agreement; it confirms that future finance will be secure, open and fast. Once institutions start using blockchain technology, the whole investing world can change. As traditional finance and crypto work side by side, rather than against one another, Solana takes a key position in these sectors. Because it is fast, easily expandable and designed for developers, it makes ideas that once seemed science fiction a reality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICO, the UK's data and info regulator, is moving its HQ to 20,000 sq ft at No.3 Circle Square. The UK's independent data protection and freedom of information regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), is set to relocate its headquarters to Manchester city centre, having agreed a lease for 20,000 sq ft of high-quality workspace at Bruntwood SciTech's No.3 Circle Square. The ICO plays a vital role in empowering people through information. The ICO's arrival at this growing community follows a series of significant moves that continue to drive momentum. This includes global sportswear brand PUMA, which is relocating its UK headquarters to No.3 Circle Square, and Auto Trader, the UK's largest digital automotive marketplace, which has committed to seven floors within the same building. It joins an established cluster of innovation-led businesses already based at Circle Square, including Avalere Health, Roku, BlueSkeye AI, and HP Enterprise, as well as those located in the dedicated startup Tech Incubator – all contributing to a thriving ecosystem of technology, health, digital and creative leaders. This growing collective of global brands, scale-ups and pioneering start-ups reflects Circle Square's position as one of the UK's most vibrant and collaborative destinations for innovation. The development of No.3 Circle Square follows the successful completion of the fully-let No.1 and No.2 Circle Square and forms part of an ongoing £243 million investment across seven assets currently being built or undergoing refurbishment in Manchester city centre by Bruntwood SciTech, including Pall Mall, King's House, 117-119 Portland Street, and Greenheys at Manchester Science Park, as well as Citylabs 4.0, which officially opened its doors in March. No.3 Circle Square will include a shared roof terrace with expansive views across the city, breakout spaces and lounges, 24/7 access with high-speed connectivity, dedicated onsite security, and access to on-site meeting rooms. The building will also open onto Symphony Gardens; a newly landscaped space designed to complement the neighbouring Symphony Park and promote biodiversity and provide access to shared green space at Circle Square. A joint venture between Bruntwood SciTech and Vita Group, the Circle Square neighbourhood also offers more than 100,000 sq ft of retail and leisure space, including Manchester-favourite Onda Pasta Bar, North Tap Room, Half Dozen Other and Federal Cafe Bar. Its innovative features to maximise energy efficiency and improve fresh air and climate control for those within the building include an all-electric heating system with state-of-the-art heat pumps, roof mounted solar panelling, a smart Building Management System (BMS) and local Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) units. Josh Whiteley, Commercial Director, Bruntwood SciTech, said: “This latest commitment underlines our vision for Circle Square as a destination of national significance for digital, data and technology-led organisations. “At Circle Square we've created an environment that brings together forward-thinking businesses, academic institutions and emerging talent in a place purpose-built for collaboration and growth. Whether they're global leaders or scaling disruptors, our customers benefit from access to tailored support, a connected ecosystem, and workspace designed to meet the needs of modern, mission-driven organisations. It's also a significant milestone in Bruntwood SciTech's mission to support the UK's knowledge economy through long-term, place-based investment – ensuring that businesses have the infrastructure and community they need to thrive.” Jen Green, Executive Director – Strategy and Resources at ICO, said: “Our relocation to Circle Square will create a working environment that better supports how we operate now and into the future. “Wilmslow has been a welcome home for the ICO for 40 years, and we will continue to have a small presence in the area beyond next year. This move underlines Manchester's momentum and how Circle Square, which has recently also attracted Puma's national headquarters, is contributing to it.” A new railway connecting Liverpool and Manchester could kickstart a £90bn economic transformation across the North West – and help reshape how major infrastructure is delivered in the UK. Greenheys tops out at Manchester Science Park, set to deliver cutting-edge lab space and a new HQ for UK Biobank's vital research. We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The donation, which is made up of funds linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, would relocate San Francisco police's Real-Time Investigations Center, which oversees its work with drones, surveillance cameras and automated license plate readers, from the SoMa Hall of Justice to an office at 315 Montgomery St. in the Financial District. The other $7.25 million would come from the San Francisco Police Community Foundation, a charitable organization Larsen set up last year to support local police and crime-fighting initiatives. Police commissioners are scheduled to discuss the funding proposal Wednesday at their weekly meeting. In a Monday interview, Larsen credited last year's tech advancements with helping a chronically short staffed police force drive down crime rates and keep themselves safe. "I think we can clearly see what a force-multiplier this is," he said, noting the city's historically low rates of crime over the last year. "The number of tools that they have is quite small, and we know that (expanding them) will have an impact." "Little did we know how effective it would become with just the tools at our disposal." In a statement, Mayor Daniel Lurie credited the center for supporting an understaffed department and helping to keep neighborhoods safe. "I want to thank Chris Larsen for his continued dedication to our police officers and the safety of all San Franciscans." Both police and other city officials have for months bemoaned deficiencies in housing the department's technological epicenter the Hall of Justice, a crumbling building constructed in 1958 that relies on 1960s-era wiring. "The RTIC is in a windowless room in a concrete structure, which limits cell phone and emergency radio transmission capabilities." Last year touched off a technological revolution for city police following the passage of Prop. A wave of new equipment was introduced in short order. It included a fleet of officer-piloted drones, hundreds of new automated license plate readers and towering mobile security cameras stationed in crime hotspots. Many San Franciscans have embraced the advancements as an overdue response to its stubbornly high rate of car break-ins and other property crimes. But the tools remain deeply unpopular with privacy advocates who fear that they're vulnerable to abuses. The proposed windfall would both relocate the RTIC and expand it; with funds earmarked for purchases included a dozen additional drones and related software, a new video wall and the installation of fiber internet services. Larsen has previously footed the bill for other big-ticket items to support police and public safety, including a citywide network of surveillance cameras and an initial $1 million to the police charity to support officer wellness.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technology has hidden side effects -- we reveal them here Organized digital criminals have found another vulnerable group to attack: artists. It happened recently to Douglas Newton, a charming artist from Brooklyn who specializes in still-life oil paintings of candy. For a few months last year, he thought he'd stumbled on an amazing way to pay for his grandkids' college after an NFT broker approached him on LinkedIn. Instead, most of his retirement money was stolen by the NFT criminals. We tell his story in this week's episode of The Perfect Scam. I spoke with Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez for this story. Crypto crimes are so rampant — particularly in Brooklyn — that he's set up a special task force. While investigating Newton's crime, he discovered a series of other artists who'd been hit by the same crime — they were approached about a buyer who wanted an NFT of their art, paid fees, then learned the buyer was fake. Some people think NFTs will be valuable one day. I do think they are another great playground for criminals and speculators.) Experts constantly give trite advice like, “You should never pay money to make money,” but when you are in a small business, that's not an option. Artists, like others in small businesses, have to take small leaps of faith like this all the time. And of course, hearing the words, “I want to buy your painting,” can send even the most level-headed artist into a romantic fever. So that makes artists particularly vulnerable to crypto/NFT scams. I hope you'll communicate this warning to anyone you know who makes and sells artwork online, even if it's just a passion project. Also, as a society, we really need to protect our artists from scams. Douglas' work is beautiful and I'd hate for artists like him to get so discouraged that they stop creating and sharing their work. A partial transcript of this episode is below. You can listen by clicking the play button, or clicking on this link, or better yet, find and subscribe to The Perfect Scam wherever you get your podcasts. [00:10:09] Douglas Newton: And I just wasn't crazy about the idea, but I was approached on LinkedIn by a woman. [00:10:31] Bob: So Douglas trades LinkedIn messages with Ernestine for a while. [00:10:35] Douglas Newton: Well, I was intrigued because she said, you know, I can sell this, this thing and she picked a, a work out of my website. It was actually a pastel drawing of just two people I'd done in, in a life drawing class, and she said she can sell it. [00:11:06] Douglas Newton: Go ahead, and go, they sent me a contract actually, a paper contract that I filled out and mailed back. She didn't flatter me too much, it was more like, this, we just have to do this, and we just have to do that, and then you're going to get a lot of money, and it kept going up. [00:11:26] Bob: So he fills in the paperwork, sets up a crypto account as she told him to do. About two months go by and then Douglas hears from her again with amazing news. It's just a drawing, and a pastel drawing, and uh, she said I, she could sell it for $49,000, and then she told me it had sold for $49,000. [00:12:02] Douglas Newton: It was like free money because I, I hadn't expected to even sell the thing, you know. And I kept it a secret from the beginning. The NFT has been sold again, resold actually for even more money, so now he's entitled to eventually more than $300,000. [00:12:49] Douglas Newton: I said, “Great, where's the money?” And then she said, “Oh, by the… it sold, it's resold for much more, but you have to pay the sales tax and the, what they call internet fees.” They call them “gas” in the trade, internet fees. And so she started asking me for money. [00:13:12] Bob: The requests are small at first, just a thousand dollars for sales tax and internet fees. Douglas sends that to her using his new cryptocurrency account. Douglas doesn't have that kind of cash lying around. [00:13:41] Bob: He would send the money to this agent using PayPal, but that had limitations. Ernestine asked him to send money almost daily for several weeks until… [00:13:53] Douglas Newton: I can't remember the exact figures, but it was like $2000 a day they would let me do. And somehow, I worked my way through $100,000. [00:14:03] Bob: Just to give me a, an example, at one point she calls and says, “Great news. Now it's been sold for $150,000, but you need to put up $20,000.” Or you tell me, what, what kind of numbers would… It was uh, we were conversing on LinkedIn back and forth. I never talked to her on the phone. [00:14:31] Bob: Douglas has maxed out his credit card so he turns to the only other source of funds he has in his quest to get this NFT windfall released. [00:14:41] Douglas Newton: And I was just selling all this, all these IRAs getting them into Citibank, getting the money into Citibank, and then converting them. [00:14:50] Bob: What was the largest single dollar amount she asked for? [00:14:54] Douglas Newton: Oh, it must be about 20 or something like that. In fact, his cryptocurrency website shows just that. [00:15:14] Bob: You could look at an account and it looked like you had $300,000 worth of bitcoin there, right? That was the last thing they wanted me to do. [00:15:37] Bob: And all this is so tantalizing, right? [00:15:50] Bob: While all this is going on, Douglas doesn't tell his family. But after that last request, haunting doubts creep into his mind. Kind of the worst thing that ever happened to me. [00:16:59] Douglas Newton: Just the fact that I would spend all this money and nothing, nothing real ever happened, just promises. I remember waking up late at night thinking about this and going on the computer and googling everything I could think of. I never found anything definite, you know, like some other person who'd been scammed by them. But I had a lot of doubts and gradually the doubts got bigger than the hope, and uh when they asked for that last, last $10,000, which I did not have, then I, I confessed everything to my wife and my kids and uh, that, that was a really bad day. [00:17:56] Bob: Douglas' son ends up traveling home to help his dad deal with the fallout. [00:18:02] Douglas Newton: My son lives in Vermont, and he came down and together we tried to do something. We went to the Brooklyn DA, who were all very helpful, but they said this money's gone. You're not going to get it back. She was just the representative, I'm sure working on a percentage. [00:18:42] Bob: The Brooklyn DA is Eric Gonzalez, and he's taken a particular interest in NFT and crypto scams. There's even a task force — we'll get to that — but he tries to help Douglas as best he can. [00:18:55] DA Eric Gonzalez: I think in this particular case that we're, we're talking about an 85-year-old victim had really invested his life savings in trying to recoup money, monies that he thought he had earned by selling his NFTs online. W met him when he came into the office. [00:19:16] Bob: And it's a good thing he did report it because when the Brooklyn DA investigates, he finds out other artists have also been victims of these same criminals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that altcoins may collapse in their Bitcoin (BTC) pairs any moment now. In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 900,000 YouTube subscribers that the TOTAL 3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, remains in a downtrend against the flagship crypto asset and has yet to find a market bottom. “I don't care how great you think your altcoin community is. So if individually altcoins will bleed to Bitcoin, then collectively they should as well, and that's the reason why I think alt/Bitcoin pairs will eventually find themselves down here [at 0.25]. I think it's just a matter of time.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube A move toward the support area highlighted by Cowen would signal that altcoins are significantly underperforming Bitcoin. Cowen also points out that altcoins are in a multi-year downtrend against Bitcoin with no signs of reversing the trend anytime soon. Alts put in a new low against Bitcoin [on June 1st]. So any prior altseason that was called for, any prior call for a low by alt/Bitcoin pairs up until today was wrong.” TOTAL3/BTC is currently hovering at 0.33.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This term refers to a period where the prices of altcoins rise rapidly and outperform the Bitcoin price by a large margin. Usually, this happens after the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high, and money is rotated into altcoins. This goes against the widespread belief that the altcoin season has already come and gone, and is officially over. According to van de Poppe, the altcoin market is actually still in a bear market, but it is about to end. He predicts that the crypto bull market is about to begin, and this would be bigger than ever because the bear market has gone on for so long. Furthermore, he points out that this cycle is different than previous cycles and the next 1-3 years will be different as well. Thus, he predicts many investors will miss it for being impatient. Using the chart above, which was created by crypto analyst TechDev, van de Poppe shows that the altcoin market is at a pivotal point. It shows a period where the Bitcoin price is rising and altcoins have remained flat. However, this has usually turned out to be the calm before the storm, and altcoin season tends to follow. As Michaël van de Poppe mentioned, this cycle has been quite different from the previous one, and there have been a few reasons for this. The first is the advent of large buys from institutions such as Michael Saylor's Strategy and heavy hitters like BlackRock buying up Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The natural consequence of this is that money is now only staying in Bitcoin rather than rotating out at the top into altcoins like last cycle. Other factors that have been pointed out to have contributed to this are the extreme P2P that emerged with the advent of instant meme coin creations. Thousands of new coins flood the market daily, and this has left liquidity spread thin. Also, broader macroeconomic factors such as Donald Trump's tariff wars have contributed greatly to keeping market performance muted, and the weaker altcoins have suffered more for it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin continues to showcase resilience in the current cryptocurrency market cycle, consistently setting new records while many altcoins remain below their previous peaks. Contrasting Bitcoin's consistent growth, Ethereum and other prominent altcoins have yet to surpass historical highs that they reached several years ago, highlighting a notable divergence in market performance. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan recently explored the broader implications of this Bitcoin-dominated cycle in his market commentary. According to Dan's analysis, previous market cycles typically saw a gradual reduction in mid-to-long-term Bitcoin holdings as investor capital redistributed into altcoins. This shift traditionally drove altcoins significantly higher, usually marking the late stages of a bullish cycle. Frequent minor corrections in Bitcoin's price are followed by more significant and sharp downturns for altcoins, demonstrating persistent weakness. Crypto Dan notes that currently, very few altcoin investors have realized meaningful profits, an unusual circumstance compared to prior cycles. If history repeats, altcoins might experience substantial upward movements as the cycle approaches its maturity. Thus, while altcoins currently underperform, investors are advised to maintain patience until Bitcoin's momentum reaches its final bullish push, potentially signaling a turning point. Complementing this perspective, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Maartunn, provided insights into stablecoin inflows to major exchanges. Specifically, Maartunn highlighted that over 75% of Tether (USDT) deposits to Binance, tracked via the TRC-20 network, originated from large wallets, commonly known as whales, since November 2023. This substantial concentration of whale activity suggests that major market participants prefer Binance for significant capital movements involving stablecoins. The notable whale-driven inflows to Binance could indicate preparation for substantial market activity, including potential purchasing of Bitcoin or an eventual shift towards altcoins. Historically, stablecoin deposits from large holders precede increased volatility and trading activity, as whales position themselves strategically in anticipation of market shifts.</p>
