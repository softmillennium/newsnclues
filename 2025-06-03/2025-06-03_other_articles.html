                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this exclusive interview with ¡HOLA!, the Colombian actress opens up about her profound spiritual preparation that shaped her performance in the former film, shares what it was like to share the screen with the legendary Al Pacino, and reveals the deeper mission behind her burgeoning production company and holistic wellness brand. "Realizing I was acting with Al Pacino. The real-life exorcism took place over 23 days in a secluded Iowa convent, and paranormal activity was documented, including levitation, unearthly voices, and supernatural situations. I'm very spiritual and very sensitive energetically, and preparing for this required a lot of openness — because you have to be open for emotions and everything that happens. But it also required a lot of spiritual preparation. I remember being very grounded in my meditations and praying and protection because there was definitely something going on around. So yeah, I felt like there was something in the air. We were filming on this convent… it just felt very palpable. And for a lot of us, things were translating outside of the set. Natchez, Mississippi, where we filmed, is one of the most haunted towns in America. I remember one of the first days of rehearsal, Ashley [Greene] — one of my scene partners — asked me, ‘Are you feeling anything?' Patricia Heaton, one of the actresses, her sister is a nun. She created these protection medals for exorcisms and gave them to all of us. I believe in that a lot, so I carried it with me all the time. Then when I'd come home, I would just ground myself in meditation and ask for protection and groundedness. Realizing I was acting with Al Pacino. We were doing the table read, and he was doing his lines, and the next line was mine — but I just sat there, staring at him. I got lost in thought. I was like, ‘Oh wait, where were we?' I came back to my house and the water kept turning on. Sometimes I can say the names of big American stars and my parents won't really know them. He was obsessed with that movie. So when I told him, he was like, ‘Really?!' I think it was shocking for my family. They were happy but like, ‘Whoa — are you serious?' Whereas with 'The Ritual,' I had to learn what it was like in the 1920s, what it meant to be a nun, what it's like to go through an exorcism. With 'At the Sea,' it's a reflection of a modern woman going through something really hard and not knowing what to do with it. In the 1920s, there were a lot of immigrants coming from Mexico, and that was the backstory for Sister Camila. It gave me the background to understand that Sister Camila is escaping a terrible reality and hoping for peace, and then an exorcism comes. That's the magic of it, right? When an actor stands out, it's because they bring part of their story into the character. Being Latina, and being an immigrant, really helped me ground Sister Camila. I think that's what helped me connect with her. I think that's what helped me connect with her." I grew up doing telenovelas on Caracol, RCN, and later Telemundo. Before moving to the States, I remember praying for a script that would challenge me. My fiancé told me, ‘You've been praying for this moment.' If I feel I have something to say with a story, if it'll make people feel something or shift their perspective, that's what draws me in. Emma, the possessed girl, is misunderstood, and I went through something similar after a concussion. No one understood what I was going through. That point of view in the script really connected with me. Every movie or show is like a different kind of food or a different melody. Movies are like that too. They give me what I'm craving. If I need to laugh or reflect on relationships, I go to different stories depending on what I need emotionally. Just know that it's all unfolding. I still have moments where I think, ‘This is so hard,' but then I look back and realize, ‘It's actually happening.' "I remember praying for a script that would challenge me. I'm very interested in exploring complex female psychology. Growing up and acting in Latin America, I often played characters that helped tell a man's story. Now I want to share the perspective of that other character — the woman who's always been there but hasn't had a voice. After the concussion, I was going through crazy symptoms. I didn't want to go the medication route. My mom is a holistic Ayurvedic doctor, so I've always leaned toward natural medicine. I found these mushrooms and adaptogens through a doctor. I felt relief for the first time in six months. And when someone leaves a voicemail saying how much Fungiments helped them, that motivates me. We really can impact lives. I want a TV show. Hopefully, you'll see me soon on screens. I'd love to be in an HBO or Apple TV show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to formulate a joint strategy for the completion of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) railway project, Pakistani state media reported, amid Islamabad's efforts to open new regional trade avenues. The development followed a meeting between Pakistan's Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Uzbek Ambassador to Islamabad, during which the two figures held detailed discussions on the approximately 850-kilometer-long railway connectivity project, which includes a 647-kilometer rail track passing through Afghanistan. The trilateral initiative was launched in 2021 to enhance regional connectivity by linking Central Asia with Pakistan's southern ports of Gwadar and Karachi through Afghanistan. “Upon completion of this project, Pakistan will gain the shortest and most efficient route to Central Asia, which will not only increase trade volumes but also strengthen the region's economy on a solid footing,” Abbasi was quoted as saying by the APP news agency. “This railway corridor will significantly reduce transit time and transportation costs, benefiting all stakeholders.” “This project will not only reinforce economic ties but will also play a pivotal role in promoting regional peace and stability,” he said. Last week, Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also held a phone call with his Uzbek counterpart, Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich, to discuss steps to advance the UAP railway project, including the framework agreement and its signing mechanism. LAGOS/JOHANNESBURG/MANILA: At a tense meeting in Nigeria's capital Abuja, health workers poured over drug registers and testing records to gauge whether US aid cuts would unravel years of painstaking work against tuberculosis in one of Africa's hardest hit countries. For several days in May, they brainstormed ways to limit the fallout from a halt to US funding for the TB Local Network (TB LON), which delivers screening, diagnosis and treatment. “This means more cases will be missed and disaster is looming.” This desperate struggle to save endangered programs is being replicated from the Philippines to South Africa as experts warn that US aid cuts risk reviving a deadly infectious disease that kills around one million people every year. President Donald Trump's gutting of the US Agency for International Development has put TB testing and tracing on hold in Pakistan and Nigeria, stalled vital research in South Africa and left TB survivors lacking support in India. The project was set up in 2020, during Trump's first term, and received $45 million worth of funding from USAID. Five years later and with the same president back in charge but now with a more radical “America first” agenda, USAID support for TB LON's community testing work was terminated in February, according to a TB LON official. TB kills 268 Nigerians every day and cases have historically been under-reported increasing the risk of transmission. The Thomson Reuters Foundation spoke to half a dozen health workers who collect TB test samples for TB LON but had stopped doing so in January due to the US aid freeze. “All that hard work is in jeopardy if we don't act quickly,” Umoru said, adding that non-profits working with TB LON had laid off more than 1,000 contract workers who used to do TB screening. In South Africa, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said TB and HIV programs had been disrupted across the country, making patient tracking and testing more difficult, according to a statement sent to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. South Africa had a TB incidence rate of 427 per 100,000 people in 2023, government data showed, down 57 percent from 2015. TB-related deaths in South Africa dropped 16 percent over that period, the data showed. Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi said in May that the government would launch an End TB campaign to screen and test 5 million people, and was also seeking new donor funding. “Under no circumstances will we allow this massive work performed over a period of more than a decade and half to collapse and go up in smoke,” he said at the time, referring to efforts to tackle TB and HIV. South Africa is also a hub for research into both TB and HIV and the health experts say funding cuts risk derailing this vital work. People struggling with poor nutrition and those living with HIV — the latter affects 8 million people in South Africa — were also more at risk of contracting TB as aid cuts made them more vulnerable by derailing nutrition programs, community outreach and testing, said Cathy Hewison, head of MSF's TB working group. “It's the number one killer of people with HIV,” she said. In the Philippines, US cuts have disrupted TB testing in four USAID-funded projects, and affected the supply of drugs, Stop TB Partnership, a UN-funded agency said. “The country has a nationwide problem with recurrent drug shortages, which is leading to a direct impact on efforts to eliminate TB,” said Ghazali Babiker, head of mission for MSF Philippines. “We are worried that the US funding cuts that have impacted the community-based services will have a disproportionate effect on children, leading to more children with TB and more avoidable deaths,” said Ei Hnin Hnin Phyu, medical coordinator with MSF in Pakistan. “We cannot afford to let funding decisions cost children's lives.” Led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the nine-member parliamentary delegation arrived in New York on Monday as the first stop in a diplomatic mission to present Pakistan's position in world capitals following Islamabad's recent military conflict with India. The group headed by Bhutto-Zardari will visit New York, Washington DC, London and Brussels. Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will also visit Moscow. Tensions between Pakistan and India are high after they struck a ceasefire on May 10 following the most intense military confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors in decades. The latest escalation last month took place following weeks of tensions after India blamed Pakistan for supporting an April 22 attack on the Kashmir territory it governs that killed 26 tourists. Pakistan denied involvement in the incident and called for an international probe. Both countries traded missiles, artillery fire and drone strikes before Washington brokered a ceasefire on May 10. Bhutto-Zardari briefed Ambassador Shea on the developments following the April 22 attack, expressing deep concern over India's immediate attribution of blame to Pakistan without any “credible investigation or verifiable evidence.” The move drew a sharp response from Islamabad, which said any attempts to divert or stop the flow of its waters by India would be considered an “act of war.” About 80 percent of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects serving the country of some 250 million. “Bhutto-Zardari expressed grave concern at the unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a move that Pakistan considers a blatant act of weaponizing water and a violation of international and treaty obligations,” the Pakistani mission said. He highlighted that the only path to peace was in dialogue, engagement and diplomacy. The Pakistani delegation also met Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, president of the UN Security Council for June, according to a statement issued by Bhutto-Zardari party. The delegation urged the Security Council to play a “proactive role” in promoting de-escalation, ensuring respect for international law and treaties and facilitating peaceful resolution of disputes. Bitter rivals India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two of them over the disputed region of Kashmir, since gaining independence from British rule in 1947. ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) surged to an all-time high of more than 120,000 points on Tuesday, with analysts attributing the rally to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) financing package for Pakistan and strong buying by insurance companies in banking, fertilizer and power sectors. “Stocks closed all time high led by scrips across the board after ADB approval of $800 million financing package,” Ahsan Mehanti, CEO of Arif Habib Commodities, told Arab News. “Strong buying by insurance companies in sectors such as banks, fertilizers and power led the market higher,” he said. The budget for fiscal year 2025–26 is expected to be presented in Pakistan's lower house of parliament on June 10, following the Eid Al-Adha holidays. Pakistan's annual inflation rate rose to 3.5 percent in May, though the country's macroeconomic outlook has improved in recent months, supported by a stronger current account balance, increased remittances and declining inflation. Authorities remain cautious as they aim to build on recent economic stabilization, guide the country toward gradual growth, and reaffirm their commitment to ongoing economic reforms. ISLAMABAD: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday called for normal relations between India and Pakistan and expressed interest in closer counterterrorism cooperation with Islamabad during a meeting with a senior aide of Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Moscow. The meeting came as Syed Tariq Fatemi, special assistant to the prime minister, began a visit to Russia weeks after India and Pakistan exchanged missiles, drones and artillery fire, following heightened tensions that ended with a US-brokered ceasefire on May 10. Pakistan has since call for a “composite dialogue” with India to discuss all outstanding issues, though New Delhi has rejected direct talks after Washington said the two countries had agreed to meet at a neutral venue to defuse tensions. “At the outset of his visit to the Russian Federation, Syed Tariq Fatemi, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) called on Sergey Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, this afternoon,” Pakistan's embassy in Moscow said in a statement. Fatemi also delivered a letter from Prime Minister Sharif to President Vladimir Putin and conveyed Pakistan's desire to expand cooperation with Russia in areas including energy, trade and connectivity. Lavrov, for his part, expressed satisfaction over the “steadily growing bilateral cooperation” and cited specific initiatives, including new steel mills and connectivity projects. Russia and Pakistan have strengthened ties in recent years through growing bilateral cooperation, particularly in energy, and by working together on regional platforms such as the SCO, where both are full members. ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday launched a cybercrime helpline, 1799, that aims to ensure swift resolution of complaints, Pakistani state media reported. It followed the introduction of a new law to regulate social media content, with journalist groups and rights activists saying it was aimed at curbing press freedom and dissent on social media. Enacted in 2016 and further tightened with amendments this January, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) was drafted with the stated aim to combat cybercrimes such as hacking, online harassment, and data breaches. Pakistani officials defended the PECA law, under which offenders can be handed prison sentences of up to three years and fines of Rs2 million ($7,200). The development came as authorities announced busting a child sexual abuse ring, allegedly run by a German national, in Azad Kashmir's capital of Muzaffarabad. “A state-of-the-art facility was formed with modern cameras and over there, children from poor families were exploited by giving money first and then blackmailing,” State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry said at a presser on Tuesday. Child sexual abuse has been a widespread issue in Pakistan, where perpetrators are often family members, teachers or trusted people. Poverty, lack of education and societal attitudes contribute to the problem. Various NGOs are also working to raise awareness about the issue and support survivors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New calculations have revealed that the super-energetic jets produced by spinning black holes could be a source for elusive dark matter particles. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. In the face of eye-watering costs, long construction times and the Trump administration's slashing of federal science funding, physicists have proposed a cheaper alternative to the next-generation of particle supercolliders — peering into black holes. Scientists initially hoped that the elusive particles that make up dark matter would be spat out by high-energy proton collisions inside CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), yet so far no such detection has been made. Finding dark matter, therefore, could mean waiting decades until new, higher energy, supercolliders are built. Or perhaps not, according to one group of researchers. Publishing their findings June 3 in the journal Physical Review Letters, they suggest that the answers we're looking for could be in violent collisions inside the fast-moving accretion disks that surround enormous black holes. "One of the great hopes for particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider is that it will generate dark matter particles, but we haven't seen any evidence yet," study co-author Joseph Silk, an astrophysics professor at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Oxford, U.K. said in a statement. But as we invest $30 billion and wait 40 years to build this supercollider — nature may provide a glimpse of the future in super massive black holes." Particle colliders work by smashing particles into each other at near-light-speeds, creating interactions from which the most fundamental elements of the universe briefly emerge as high-energy debris.

This means that despite countless observations of the ways it shapes our universe, scientists are still unsure of where dark matter comes from, or even what it is. Observations by space telescopes have revealed that rapidly spinning black holes can launch massive jets of plasma from the accretion disks of hot matter that surround them. And according to the researchers' calculations, these jets could be far more powerful than first thought — enabling particles to collide at similar energy levels as those projected for future supercolliders. "But because of their energy and momentum, some also come out, and it's those that come out which are accelerated to unprecedentedly high energies." Silk's team calculated that the energy produced by black hole jets could be "as powerful as you get from a supercollider, or more," adding that "it's very hard to say what the limit is." —'Beauty' particle discovered at world's largest atom smasher could unlock new physics "If supermassive black holes can generate these particles by high-energy proton collisions, then we might get a signal on Earth, some really high-energy particle passing rapidly through our detectors," Silk said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The internet has more UFO footage to analyze. As I often say, the reason why is that we have limited to no information about what's going on, and it seems like the government has no interest in sharing what it knows. Now, we have a new video taking the internet by storm. The YouTube account @paulodeleon.ufologo posted a three-minute video showing several different angles of an object flying through the sky. You can watch the footage below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com. It's important to keep an open-mind in life. However, we can't just accept everything as fact. That'd be foolish, and it waters down concrete evidence. While I'm certainly no expert, this damn sure doesn't look crazy to me. I definitely am not buying that it is a "potential mothership," as described in the video's title. Not buying all that, but I could also be wrong. I'm certainly not going to sit here with the OutKick audience and declare myself the smartest person out there. A new UFO video out of Mexico is gaining traction online.

Supernatural similarly got off to a great start with its first few seasons, while those after season 5, its originally planned final season, were a mixed bag. ...Devlin and Rogers always found a strong way to strike that balance by keeping seasons to no more than a dozen episodes. The Librarians smartly avoids having 20-plus-episode seasons, which ultimately requires some filler episodes to pad out that runtime. That's not to say that some of the aforementioned shows' filler episodes weren't great, as they were actually some of the best, but they largely distracted from the intriguing season arcs. For The Librarians, Devlin and Rogers always found a strong way to strike that balance by keeping seasons to no more than a dozen episodes. Nearly every episode in the season held some kind of connection to the group's efforts to stop Prospero from undoing The Tempest's ending by reclaiming his magical staff, even if they shifted their focus to seemingly isolated investigations. With the original trilogy of movies having been almost exclusively focused on Wyle's Flynn Carsen, introducing not one, but four new protagonists for The Librarians could certainly have been alienating. And yet, Rogers and Devlin did a wonderful job putting together a roster just as exciting to follow as Flynn. Christian Kane, a frequent Devlin collaborator on the likes of Leverage and Almost Paradise, brings much of the same comedy as his other roles, and while his characters' supposed lack of fighting skills compared to Eve may not be believable, he expertly captures Stone's passion for art. Admittedly, John Harlan Kim's Ezekiel took a while to grow on me, as he was a typical thief out for his own gain, and his selfishness was sometimes less comedic and more grating. Lindy Booth's Cassie steals the show every time she's onscreen, and her mix of quirky social awkwardness and genuine heart also makes her one of the most gripping characters, given how the show explores her life-threatening tumor. Meanwhile, Rebecca Romijn's Eve is a pretty run-of-the-mill action heroine in the writing, despite being a nice change of pace from similar genre fare with male guardian characters. But given just how engaging this was, and that it encompassed multiple episodes across every season, it made it all the more disappointing that Ezekiel, Stone, and Eve's character growths were essentially done at a fraction of Cassie's. The show primarily utilizes great practical effects, which is always a better choice, but considering how underwhelming cable TV CGI could look, I was largely impressed by how good the majority of it looked which, when combined with its fun storytelling and great characters, continues to make it one of the best Supernatural successors out there. The Librarians is available to stream in its entirety on Prime Video. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. It's shocking that more people haven't tuned into this unforgettable fantasy TV show that audiences & critics alike praised for all 5 seasons. Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars could introduce Doctor Doom and Sue Storm's daughter, changing the MCU's Fantastic Four in a major way. The Sandman returns in July, and Netflix not only reveals season 2's episode titles but announces a surprise bonus episode of the fantasy series. Harrison Ford will be joined by a former co-star in his hit Apple TV+ series, Shrinking, creating an exciting reunion in the well-received series. Resident Alien season 4 reunites the gang in Patience, but with mounting danger from alien forces, things are on the verge of collapse. Sinners has been one of the biggest box office successes of this year so far, and it has just crossed one final milestone just as it hits digital.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON — Rumors have spread in recent weeks about a famous, cursed doll that allegedly went missing while on the road for a traveling exhibit. The doll is the supposedly demon-possessed "Annabelle" doll owned by ghost hunters Ed and Loraine Warren. Rumors began circulating in May that Annabelle had gone missing in the midst of a paranormal tour across the U.S. with some other items from the Warrens' collection. But video evidence shows the doll, which isn't supposed to be moved in order to avoid antagonizing the malevolent spirit inside, safely back at home behind glass at the Warrens' Occult Museum in Connecticut. Annabelle is a supposedly haunted Raggedy Ann doll which, according to rumor, became supernaturally active sometime in the 1970s. The Warrens, who make a living investigating paranormal phenomenon and writing about them, say they were contacted by a student nurse in 1970 about issues with the doll. The student was given the doll as a gift, but it quickly began acting strangely, and a psychic told her that it was inhabited by the ghost of a girl named "Annabelle." According to the legend, the student and her roommate tried to live with the doll's growing supernatural nature as it appeared and disappeared seemingly at random. Threatening notes were left to Lou on parchment, despite nobody in the house having any on hand, and on at least one occasion, Lou reported being attacked physically by the doll. They then took the doll to house it safely in their paranormal museum. In 2025, the Warrens began a traveling tour, showing off pieces from their museum to paranormal lovers across the U.S. with stops in San Antonio, Texas and New Orleans. New Orleans is where the rumors began taking off, after a sold-out event in mid-May. The hashtag #AnnabelleMissing began popping up on social media, but it was considered a joke. Days later, fire broke out at the Nottoway Plantation near White Castle. While both of these incidents were likely unrelated (The New Orleans inmates tunneled through a hole behind a toilet, and the plantation was a flammable wooden structure from the 1850s), it didn't stop paranormal enthusiasts from linking them to the supposedly missing doll. But video from the New England Society For Psychic Research shows Annabelle was simply put back in her glass enclosure at the Connecticut museum between shows. It's unclear why she was removed halfway through the tour, but it's unlikely that she got up and walked herself back.</p>

Freedom of information documents from December 2021 show US officials discussing a briefing regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) - the modern term for UFOs - with its Five Eyes allies. The email chain included officials from the United States UAP Task Force (UAPTF) and an Australian defence representative, using a US Department of Defence email address. "Re tomorrow's UAP briefing, I received confirmation from Australia and Canada they will be here ... and of course UK," a UAPTF official wrote. "I recall you and your team said last week that you wanted to come in today to brief the other partners. "The last thing we want to do is be dismissive of our allies and their time," a UAPTF official replied. "We definitely would like to continue this conversation with the partners, and now have an obligation to do so for multiple reasons." The former Chief of Air Force - and now Vice Chief of Defence - Air Marshal Robert Chipman twice told senators during an estimates hearing that Australia had not been briefed on UAPs after the email exchange and rescheduled Five Eyes briefing. In November 2022, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked if the US had discussed UAPs with Australian intelligence services or the Air Force. "I'm not aware of any formal discussions that we've held with the US," Air Marshal Chipman said. "I imagine it would have come across my desk if those discussions were held in the last four months." During the Senate estimates hearing the following year, the Air Marshal was more adamant in response to Senator Whish-Wilson's questions, which specifically queried if Australian defence attaches had received UAPTF briefings. Briefing notes prepared in May 2022 for Air Marshall Chipman's Senate estimate hearing also state that neither "the US nor any other nation or ally" had requested or offered to collaborate on the issue of UAPs. "Defence has no desire to seek collaboration on this issue," the briefing note states. Grant Lavac, an Australian civilian UAP researcher, said the lack of transparency was "quite concerning". "The Chief of Air Force leads all discussions on UAP in Australia, so if there's one person that needs to know what is happening on this topic in an Australian context and our discussions with allies, it's him," Mr Lavac said. "He's either uniformed because there is a complete lack of intelligence sharing, or there's a degree of incompetence, or it's something more sinister like plausible deniability. "Any one of those three scenarios is concerning." In 2024, Defence officials admitted Australia sent representatives to a UAP briefing in the Pentagon, after vigorously denying any involvement. It shows the alliance - which includes US, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand - met for a "caucus working group" to "cultivate shared awareness of allies' UAP issues, detection, and mitigation activities and challenges". They discussed the need for "networks to share Five Eyes UAP reporting", including documents marked "top secret" and "special intelligence", along with UAP "collection planning". "The intention is to develop a framework for future UAP collaboration," one document said. Australia's UAP policy has previously been criticised for being out of step with its closest military allies, including the US, which introduced mandatory UAP reporting for defence personnel in 2021. The US considers UAPs a potential flight safety and national security risk, while other allies have acknowledged the unknown aerial phenomenon, including the UK, Canada, France and Spain. The Canberra Times has previously reported Australian Defence personnel don't feel comfortable reporting UAP sightings through official channels and freedom of information documents revealed senior Defence officials mocked the subject while preparing briefing notes. The Australian Defence Force stopped collecting reports of UAPs in 1996, "after determining there was no scientific or other compelling reason to continue to devote resources to the recording and investigation of UAP".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence offers tons of strategy in an excellently designed euro game about finding alien life – and it's getting a new expansion! Whether you imagine aliens to be benevolent givers of distant technology, horrible monsters from beyond the stars, or just some single-celled bacterium, there's no argument that finding alien life would be a major discovery. But until that happens, we can imagine what it would be like to be part of SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a competitive strategy game with resource management and some tableau building. Victory points are scored in a vast variety of ways. On each players turn, they will perform various actions like launching probes to scout out nearby planets, dropping landers on those planets to do some deeper analysis, scanning deep space around Earth, discovering new technologies, analyze data, and more. Depending on the technologies each player unlocks, they will have a different edge over their competition for each different action. For example, one technology makes landing a rover cheaper, while another offers a wider range while scanning deep space. As players are racing to launch probes, drop rovers, and also land on the multitude of moons, they might score points based on who got there first, who did the most research, and so on. There are several different alien species to be discovered, and players won't know which they've found until it's discovered. At that point, the aliens special setup and rules are revealed. The alien species will offer new cards for players to collect into their hand as well as new ways to earn points and resources. Plus there are lot of different tactics to reach victory. There are many different mechanics and systems that seamlessly work together in order to offer a great gaming experience. You'll be able to expand your search for alien life later this year. SETI: Space Agencies adds asymmetric organizations that will change how you scan the stars. The expansion introduces new alien species with their own unique traits, as well as more than 40 project cards that provide variety and strategic options. It also adds a new mechanic, Signal Tokens, that enhances scanning efficiency. Just so you know BoLS may collect a share of sales from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOP Sen. Michael Fesi, of Houma, who apparently believes in chemtrail conspiracy theories The Louisiana Legislature has passed a new bill to outlaw “chemtrails,” a made-up and very fake thing that conspiracy theorists and other assorted fringe people believe in. After the House May 28 killed a bill to ban fluoride in drinking water, there was the slightest sliver of hope that lawmakers wouldn't agree to other conspiracy measures. Following House passage of Senate Bill 46 — which was authored by Houma Republican state Sen. Michael "Big Mike" Fesi — on June 1, Senate President Cameron Henry, a Metairie Republican, formally “enrolled” the bill, meaning it will become law — unless Gov. The theory goes something like this: All those white streaks you see in the sky caused by plane exhaust are not plane exhaust that has gotten more common over the years as more and more freight and commercial travel happens in the sky. Rather, this clearly unhinged theory claims that those streaks are actually dangerous chemicals that "they" are pumping into the sky for ... reasons. Like fingerprints, no two chemtrail conspiracists agree on all the details. That said, they typically choose from one of the "thems" commonly blamed for such made up things, including but not limited to: The point of spraying these unidentified-but-they're-real-man-do-your-research chemicals varies depending on a variety of factors, including political affiliation, how long the person has been using YouTube, their familiarity with legendary crank Art Bell, how many Burning Mans they've attended and of course, drug use. Here's just some of the many possible answers you might get: Fesi and other Louisiana Republicans appear to have put their chips on “weather control,” based on the plain language of the bill. There is one interesting difference between the other anti-science theories like anti-vaccine propaganda or the weird anti-fluoride movement that have become Republican policy. Those conspiracies have deep roots in conservative fringe elements that believed they were Communist plots to, as the 1964 classic Dr. Strangelove put it, steal or otherwise contaminate our “precious bodily fluids.” Chemtrails, however, were until recently largely the domain of drug addled, left-leaning hippie conspiracy theorists. Conspiracy theorists could use the bill to challenge flight routes, the construction and location of airports, or file costly suits against airlines and air freight companies. Meteorology remains one of the least understood and inexact scientific disciplines. And then there's the logistics of such a conspiracy. In order to undertake such a conspiracy, literally tens of thousands of people across the globe would have to be in on it, including people manufacturing the fictional weather control chemicals and dispersing equipment, the baggage handlers standing there while the fake technicians are loading it into planes, pilots, plane mechanics, air traffic controllers, and political leaders of countries that don't like each other. That's not even considering the untold thousands of red-tape loving, approval stamp wielding bureaucrats needed to undertake such a feat. There is, however, clear, scientifically demonstrated evidence that burning fossil fuels like jet fuel is bad for the environment and human health. However, Fesi and other Republicans have not proposed banning them. And we're plannin' on being here for 40 more.
