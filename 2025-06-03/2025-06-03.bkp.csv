            Portuguese and German police on Tuesday launched joint searches of a “vast” area in Portugal's southern Algarve region for new evidence related to the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old British child Madeleine McCann.
    


            Portugal's investigative Judicial Police (PJ) had said on Monday they would execute search warrants between June 2 and 6 at the behest of the public prosecutor's office in Germany's Braunschweig, which in 2022 formally identified German national Christian Brueckner as an official suspect in the case.
    


            A source involved in the search operation said the targeted area was “vast” with police using ground-penetrating radar across several hectares. Portuguese officers were following instructions from German police under a European Investigation Order.
    


            The scale of the searches could be the most extensive since the initial investigation was closed in 2008.
    


            Fresh but relatively focused searches were ordered by Portuguese, British and German police of scrubland, wells and reservoirs in 2014, 2020 and 2023. None of these searches were confirmed to have yielded significant evidence.
    


            Reuters footage showed uniformed PJ officers on a cordon on a dirt road in Atalaia - a neighborhood of Lagos municipality - waving through unmarked vans and cars with German license plates from the city of Wiesbaden, where the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has its headquarters.

            The BKA is assisting Portuguese law enforcement with “criminal procedural measures,” Braunschweig prosecutors told Reuters, declining to provide further details.
    


            The occupants of one of the German vehicles wore bucket hats, clothing with camouflage patterns and covered their faces with bandanas.
    


            A van belonging to Portugal's Maritime Police also arrived. That force has jurisdiction over coastal areas and took part in previous searches of beaches, wells and reservoirs using specialist divers.
    


            The road the police cordoned off is located close to a golf course and less than 1 km (0.6 miles) from the beach. The search area was close to a property that Brueckner lived in, a neighbor told Reuters in 2020, though when was unclear.
    


            Madeleine went missing on May 3, 2007, while on holiday with her family in the Algarve town of Praia da Luz, sparking a frenzied search and gaining the attention of the world's media. She has never been found.
    


            German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and Brueckner, in his 40s, was probably responsible. He has denied responsibility.
    


            Brueckner, a convicted child abuser and drug dealer, is behind bars in Germany for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same area of the Algarve. His sentence runs until September, meaning he is set for release unless prosecutors find enough evidence to charge him over Madeleine's disappearance.
    


            On Jan. 17 Sky News quoted the German prosecutor investigating Madeleine's disappearance as saying there was currently no prospect of charges being brought against Brueckner.

Follow:


            Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with the country's prime minister announcing his resignation following weeks of protests sparked by his family's lavish displays of wealth.
    


            Young Mongolians had taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, who lost a vote of confidence in his government on Monday, before stepping down, according to international news agencies.
    


            Democratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country's democracy.
    


            Here's what to know:
    


            The protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister's 23-year-old son's lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car.
    


            Suspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family.
    


            “With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy).
    


            Amina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people.
    


            Deepening the anger is the rising cost of living, soaring inflation in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine, and choking pollution in the capital that's home to half the population.
    


            “The cost of living in Mongolia has skyrocketed — many people are paying nearly half of their monthly income in taxes while barely making enough to cover food, rent, or utilities. Most are not living paycheck to paycheck anymore — they're living loan to loan, debt to debt,” she said.
    


            Protesters have gathered in the capital Ulaanbaatar's central Sükhbaatar Square, in front of the Government Palace, almost daily for two weeks, calling for Oyun-Erdene to release his finances and resign.
    


            The Prime Minister's office called the allegations of financial impropriety “completely unfounded.”
    


            “The prime minister makes regular financial declarations annually in line with Mongolian law,” the office said in a statement to CNN.
    


            For decades, Mongolia has struggled with endemic graft and protests often break out over allegations that corrupt officials and business leaders were enriching themselves with public funds.
    


            Mass protests erupted in 2022 over a corruption scandal involving the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars' worth of coal destined for China.
    


            Though analysts say there is no evidence of corruption by Oyun-Erdene, his son's social media posts deepened the frustration of a public long wary of their elected officials misusing public resources.
    


            “I want a fair society where ordinary people have a voice, and where government officials are held accountable. Seeing so much inequality, injustice, and arrogance from those in power pushed me to speak up,” said Ariunzaya Khajidmaa, 23, a resident of Ulaanbaatar who joined the protests with her 2-month-old baby.
    


            Part of public frustration is that even when corruption cases are prosecuted, they are slow to work their way through the judicial system, leading some to question the independence of the judiciary.
    


            The 2024 Freedom House index said “corruption and political influence in the daily work of judges remain concerns.”
    


            “If you look at the corruption index, it has gone down. And one explanation is that, even though the Prime Minister has exposed a lot of the corruption cases, nothing has been done. So now everybody's looking at the judiciary,” said Bolor Lkhaajav, a Mongolian political analyst and commentator.
    


            The Prime Minister had tried to save his coalition government and parliament, called the State Great Khural, held a vote of confidence on Monday.
    


            Oyun-Erdene failed to secure enough votes and a parliamentary statement later announced in a statement that he had resigned, Reuters and the Associated Press reported. Chinese state media also reported the Prime Minister had resigned.
    


            Oyun-Erdene and his son have submitted themselves to Mongolia's anti-corruption agency and the prime minister said he would resign if the investigation uncovered any irregularities.
    


            CNN has reached out to the prime minister's office for comment.
    


            The protests are just “the tip of the iceberg,” said Jargalsaikhan Dambadarjaa, a Mongolian broadcaster and political commentator, who pointed to some of the major economic shifts in the country.
    


            Oyun-Erdene, who was re-elected to a second term in 2024, had promised to diversify the country's economy, which is dependent on the mining industry accounting for about a quarter of GDP.
    


            Mongolia has huge deposits of coal, copper, gold and phosphorite, and about 90% of Mongolia's coal exports go to China.
    


            Oyun-Erdene's coalition government last year announced 14 new mega projects to boost economic growth, including cross-border railway connections and a major expansion of renewable energy.
    


            And one of Oyun-Erdene's signature policy centerpieces was establishing a national wealth fund, which the government said aimed to redistribute the country's assets to the people.
    


            The Sovereign Wealth Fund law, approved by parliament in April, allows the government to take a 34% stake in mines considered to have strategic mineral deposits, meaning they are vital for the country's economy and development.
    


            There are currently 16 such sites and the profits will go into the fund, with portions allocated to benefitting Mongolian people including through financial assistance, healthcare, education, and housing, according to public broadcaster Montsame.
    


            The move has not sat well with the country's wealthy and powerful mining elite.
    


            “These people, they are now at the edge of losing their power - huge money - which created huge inequality in the country. So they are fighting to the death against this government,” said Jargalsaikhan.
    


            Mongolia has been a parliamentary democracy since its democratic revolution in 1991. But the years since have seen multiple governments toppled, or leaders shuffled.
    


            This instability has led some Mongolians to believe the powers of President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, who is head of state, should be extended. Currently, the president can only serve one six-year term.
    


            “In this mosaic, those who are supporting presidential power argue that, look at Russia and China, they are one-man presidential powers and they are very stable. They say, we tried this parliamentarian system and it looks like it doesn't work. That's their idea,” Jargalsaikhan said.
    


            Khurelsukh has repeatedly said he does not want to change Mongolia's parliamentary democracy. However, some believe amending the constitution to extend presidential term limits is on the table.
    


            “It's a very crucial time, a very delicate time, and it's another test to our democracy,” said Jargalsaikhan. “Freedom comes only with the parliamentary system… If we don't do that, we will be another failed economy, a failed nation.”
    


            In a statement, the prime minister's office said, “there has been a deliberate attempt to undermine” the reforms of the coalition government by a “hostile campaign” that would “turn Mongolia away from a parliamentary democracy and return power and wealth to a small group driven by self-interest.”
    


            Analysts say Mongolia needs to show it can have stable governance so it can attract broader foreign investment and reduce its economic dependence on China and Russia.
    


            Khurelsukh last year welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for an official visit to Mongolia, a trip condemened by Ukraine. The visit was Putin's first to a member country of the International Criminal Court which had issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges on war crimes.
    


            “A lot of the governments that are looking at Mongolia as an oasis of democracy between Russia and China, so they want to trust us, but at the same time, you have to show some accountability and stability for other governments to say, okay, Mongolia is getting better,” said Bolor.
    


            Those on the streets say they are tired of political games and want to see tangible improvements to their daily lives.
    


            “We want stronger anti-corruption measures, public officials who are held to ethical standards, and a system that ensures no one is above the law,” said Ariunzaya.
    


            “It's time for the government to listen to its citizens and take meaningful, lasting action—not just offer words.”

Follow:


            The far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) is leaving the Netherlands' government over its policy for asylum-seekers, its leader Geert Wilders said on Tuesday, toppling the governing coalition.
    


            “I signed up for the strictest asylum policy, not for the downfall of the Netherlands,” Wilders told reporters Tuesday morning. “And our responsibility for this cabinet therefore ends here.”
    


            Wilders' decision to withdraw support for the most right-leaning government in Dutch history has plunged the country's politics into chaos. It leaves the government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, with just 51 out of 150 seats in parliament.
    


            Prime Minister Dick Schoof called the decision “unnecessary and irresponsible.” But speaking with reporters after a Tuesday afternoon cabinet meeting, he offered few details on his conversations with Wilders.
    


            He said that without the PVV's support, it was impossible for the government to carry on, and that he would remain in office leading a caretaker government until a new coalition takes over.
    


            Opposition leaders have called for immediate elections.
    


            Polls suggest that, were elections to be held today, the PVV would lose seats but remain the largest party, just ahead of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy.
    


            But that's no guarantee that it would be able to enter a new government. Dutch politics features a constellation of parties, none of which has ever been able to command a majority of Dutch votes. Polls suggest that both center-right and center-left parties would gain from new elections.
    


            Wilders' PVV was the clear winner of a November 2023 election. But a coalition accord struck after months of haggling dictated that, while his party would join the government, he would remain on the sidelines, in parliament.
    


            Wilders has a long history of anti-Islam and anti-immigrant rhetoric, He was convicted of discrimination after insulting Moroccan immigrants at a 2014 campaign rally, and his party calls for “no Islamic schools, Qurans, and mosques.”
    


            Wilders last week held a rare, formal press conference to present the government with an ultimatum for hardening the country's asylum policy – despite the fact that the minister for asylum and migration is a member of his own party.
    


            “The PVV promised voters the strictest asylum policy ever, aiming to make it the strictest in all of Europe,” Wilders said Tuesday. “We proposed a plan to close the borders to asylum seekers, to stop them, to send them away. To stop building asylum-seeker centers, to close them.”
    


            But the coalition, he said, refused his proposals.
    


            “I could do nothing other than say that we are now withdrawing our support for this cabinet.”

The Pentagon is preparing to make a “symbolic and operational split” between Greenland and Denmark by reassigning the Arctic island's command jurisdiction, Politico has reported.

Greenland would thus be moved from the European Command (EUCOM) to the Northern Command (NORTHCOM), whereas Denmark would remain in the former, according to the outlet. 

The change, which is part of a broader review of the Unified Command Plan, would elevate Greenland's priority in defense planning at the Pentagon and White House. “From the perspective of geography, the move makes some sense,” one official told Politico. “From a political perspective, however, this clearly is going to worry Europe.” 

Greenland, an autonomous territory within Denmark, is geographically closer to North America than to Europe – just 26 kilometers from Canada, but over 2,000 from Denmark.

The US already maintains a major military outpost at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, which was established in 1951 under a Cold War-era agreement. The base supports missile tracking and space surveillance, and now serves as a key node in Washington's expanding missile defense ambitions. 

Framing Greenland as a strategic asset, US officials have justified the shift as necessary to counter rival powers. “We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic,” Vice President J.D. Vance previously said, citing Russian and Chinese activity. 

According to Politico, the reassignment would also support expansion of the Golden Dome — a global missile shield announced by President Donald Trump last month and estimated to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The system would aim to intercept threats from anywhere on Earth or space. 

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has called the initiative a “reckless approach” that undermines global stability.

In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Arctic holds vast potential for trade and resource extraction. While stressing that “Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic,” he warned that geopolitical rivalry in the region is escalating, citing Washington's “serious plans regarding Greenland.”

US President Donald Trump appears to be “at the end of his rope” over the conflict in Ukraine, Washington's top diplomat in Türkiye has told local media.

Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Türkiye and special envoy for Syria, made the remarks during an interview with Turkish broadcaster NTV on Monday, in the wake of a second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations which lasted approximately 90 minutes.

He was asked about Kiev's calls for a high-level summit that would include Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky.

Barrack indicated that any such meeting would need to be “meaningful” and yield substantive outcomes, while acknowledging he could not speak for the US president directly. He added that Trump, who has openly expressed frustration with both Zelensky and Putin, is not known for his patience.

Barrack said Türkiye could play a key role in facilitating a breakthrough, given its status as a mediator.

Trump repeatedly used campaign rallies to claim he could resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours – a claim he later acknowledged was hyperbolic. His efforts to mediate, have faced resistance from European NATO members, who back continued military plans for Ukraine.

Last month, following pressure from Trump, Kiev dropped its opposition to direct talks with Russia, which said such a move was the logical next step.

Zelensky traveled to Türkiye on the date proposed by Moscow for the initial round, claiming he expected Putin to attend.

Russia has maintained that a summit involving top leaders should be the culmination of the negotiation process, not a substitute for it. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated the stance on Tuesday, saying a trilateral meeting with Zelensky and Trump appeared “unlikely anytime soon.”

At Monday's talks in Istanbul, Kiev reiterated its desire for a trilateral summit. Moscow, in turn, presented two potential paths toward a ceasefire and offered to return the bodies of 6,000 deceased Ukrainian soldiers as a goodwill gesture, which Kiev agreed to reciprocate.

By Ladislav Zemánek, non-resident research fellow at China-CEE Institute and expert of the Valdai Discussion Club

The final week of May marked a significant political development with the potential to reshape Asia's geopolitical landscape. Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, hosted the inaugural summit involving China, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). While signs of deepening engagement among these three actors had surfaced in preceding years, the establishment of a formal trilateral cooperation mechanism is a recent development.

This event did not occur in a geopolitical vacuum. The region is increasingly exposed to intensifying rivalry among China, the US, and other global powers. In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping embarked on a Southeast Asian tour – visiting Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam – to consolidate Beijing's influence. Almost simultaneously, an envoy dispatched by US President Donald Trump toured Cambodia and Vietnam and met with representatives from all ASEAN member states in an effort to repair relations damaged by Trump's tariffs and to reaffirm the commitment to a ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific'.

Meanwhile, the US president visited three Gulf states, making new deals and publicly denouncing the longstanding American policy of mentorship and interference in regional affairs. By the end of May, French President Emmanuel Macron also entered the scene, visiting Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam to remind Southeast Asian counterparts that the EU still exists and remains a potential alternative to both Beijing and Washington.

It is no coincidence that the China-ASEAN-GCC summit was convened in Malaysia. As the current chair of ASEAN, Malaysia plays a pivotal role, and its prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, is a vocal proponent of regional integration and innovative partnerships. Ahead of the trilateral summit, ASEAN members gathered in Kuala Lumpur to chart their future course. On this occasion, the ten member states adopted ASEAN's first 20-year vision – ASEAN 2045 – articulating the ambition to position Southeast Asia as a global growth engine aligned with other dynamic actors.

Among them, China and the GCC member states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – stand out prominently. Together, they represent a quarter of the world's population and contribute nearly the same proportion to global GDP. Their economic linkages are already well-established: China is the top trading partner for both ASEAN and the GCC. ASEAN has surpassed the EU as China's foremost economic partner, and Beijing imports over one-third of its crude oil from GCC states.

The summit in Kuala Lumpur brought together the world's second- and fifth-largest economies – China and ASEAN – along with key suppliers of energy and raw materials. The leaders did not conceal their optimism. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim advanced a vision of intercultural dialogue between Confucian and Islamic civilizations, aligning with China's Global Civilization Initiative. Chinese Premier Li Qiang envisaged a ‘big triangle' as a pillar of global security and prosperity, invoking the ‘shared Asian values' of openness, cooperation, and integration in contrast to perceived Western norms.

Notably, Beijing's official discourse increasingly emphasizes these ‘Asian values'. This narrative underpins a renewed focus on neighboring states. In April, Xi convened a rare high-level conference on relations with the ‘near abroad', characterizing it as essential to China's development, security, and diplomatic priorities. Among other regional actors, this recalibration may evoke concerns about a resurgence of a modern-day ‘Pax Sinica'. However, Beijing refutes these interpretations, instead invoking alternative historical models such as the Silk Road, which emphasized connectivity, integration, and equality.

The China-ASEAN-GCC summit was no exception: Beijing proposed extending the existing China-ASEAN Free Trade Area to include the GCC, a suggestion welcomed by Southeast Asian leaders. This could accelerate China's bid for trade liberalization and amplify the benefits of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world's largest free trade zone, which includes all ASEAN nations.

The summit's agenda focused heavily on economic issues, reflecting ASEAN's strategic orientation and the interests of Gulf states. Over the past decade, China has launched numerous projects with ASEAN members under the Belt and Road Initiative. Cooperation with the GCC is also expanding beyond traditional sectors such as raw materials to cutting-edge areas including artificial intelligence, the digital economy, and 5G technology. This economic emphasis is strategic, enabling stakeholders to bypass contentious political and security matters.

And these contentious issues abound. While China maintains robust ties with both ASEAN and GCC members, bilateral frictions persist. Within ASEAN, territorial disputes and sovereignty concerns – particularly in the South China Sea – complicate trust-building. China's disputes with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam are longstanding and strain regional relations. Perceptions of Chinese assertiveness also fuel anxieties over economic overdependence, potential ‘debt traps', and Beijing's political leverage. These factors have prompted leaders such as Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to move closer to the US in recent years.

The broader China-US rivalry remains a defining dynamic. Both ASEAN and GCC nations have historically strong ties to the US. The US remains ASEAN's largest export market and top foreign investor. GCC countries, long aligned with Washington, now face the challenge of navigating a careful balance between American and Chinese interests, particularly on sensitive technologies and security cooperation. Washington opposes the adoption of Chinese 5G and AI technologies by Saudi Arabia, and similar concerns have led to the suspension of military agreements between the US and UAE. Additionally, discussions about conducting oil trade in the yuan challenge the petrodollar system and attract Western scrutiny.

These geopolitical complexities could undermine trilateral collaboration, exposing fault lines and structural vulnerabilities. While sectors such as trade, energy, infrastructure, and advanced technology offer natural areas of convergence, geopolitical competition and cultural divergence present serious obstacles. Moreover, there is a pronounced asymmetry among the actors: Smaller ASEAN economies may lack the institutional and financial capacity to engage fully in this trilateral format.

Nonetheless, the China-ASEAN-GCC platform represents a novel configuration within an emerging multipolar world order. It reflects the accelerating momentum of South-South cooperation, which integrates multipolarity with multilateralism and economic globalization.

Trump's tariff storm served as a wake-up call for many US partners across ASEAN and the Gulf, underscoring the imperative of diversifying partnerships and embracing pragmatic alternatives. Closer ties with Beijing do not necessarily indicate a wholesale shift from one hegemon to another. Rather, ASEAN and the GCC are striving to engage both China and the US where feasible. Yet, recent developments suggest that Washington's strategy of pressuring states to reduce ties with China in exchange for benefits is losing traction.

The key questions now are whether ASEAN can effectively balance great power rivalries to become an autonomous pole in a multipolar world; whether regional actors can sustain this delicate equilibrium and avoid the formation of military blocs in Asia-Pacific and beyond; and whether the trilateral framework itself can endure amid mounting geopolitical tensions. These remain open-ended questions – and the answers will emerge only with time.

WASHINGTON, June 3. /TASS/. The Washington administration will not allow Tehran to enrich uranium under a potential deal on Iran's nuclear program, US President Donald Trump said.

""The Autopen (former US President Joe Biden - TASS) should have stopped Iran a long time ago from 'enriching.' Under our potential agreement - we will not allow any enrichment of uranium!"" he wrote on the Truth Social platform.

Earlier, the Axios news website reported that the nuclear deal proposal the United States had given Iran on May 30 would allow limited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to-be-determined period of time, contradicting public statements from top officials.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LUXEMBOURG, June 3. /TASS/. An armed conflict between EU countries and Russia cannot be ruled out due to Brussels' irrational policy, Fernand Kartheiser, a European Parliament member who represents Luxembourg, said in an interview with TASS following a visit to Moscow.

""Given, among other things, Europe's irrational policy and the aggressive atmosphere in which it is being pursued, the risk of an armed confrontation with Russia cannot be ruled out, unfortunately,"" he pointed out. According to Kartheiser, the situation ""is growing increasingly dangerous"" because of ""large-scale propaganda and the suppression of freedom of speech"" in Europe.

The politician highlighted the need ""to at least try to prevent an arms race and do everything possible to counter the arguments of warmongers.""

Kartheiser emphasized that the main goal of his visit was to demonstrate that Russia' ""is a partner, not an enemy.""

Kartheiser, who heads Luxembourg's right-wing Alternative Democratic Reform Party, was elected to the European Parliament in 2024. He has consistently called for normalizing relations between the European Union and Russia.

Kartheiser visited Moscow on May 25-28 at the invitation of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament). He held meetings with Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Grigory Karasin, chairman of the Federation Committee (upper house of parliament) on Foreign Affairs and Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Authorities say Egyptian national took firearm class but could not make purchase because he is not a US citizen

The man accused of attacking a a pro-Israel peace parade with molotov cocktails in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday told authorities he planned to use a gun and took a concealed firearm class – but was denied the purchase because he was not a US citizen.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, is facing federal and state charges over the attack which wounded 12 people as they held a weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. He had planned to target the demonstration with 18 molotov cocktails in his possession but apparently had second thoughts and threw just two, according to authorities.

In what the FBI has called a “targeted terror attack”, Soliman yelled: “Free Palestine,” police wrote in an affidavit. Police said Soliman abandoned his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before”.

Soliman, 45, is facing 16 state counts of attempted murder, 18 others related to the use of an incendiary device and a federal hate crime charge. The FBI said he also used a makeshift flamethrower against the demonstrators.

In court papers charging him with a federal hate crime, authorities said he expressed no regrets about the attack and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group”. Soliman had planned the attack for more than a year, authorities allege.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” J Bishop Grewell, the acting US attorney for the district of Colorado, said during a news conference on Monday.
 An FBI affidavit said Soliman told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people” – a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Authorities' affidavit said the molotov cocktails were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of them, and he also carried gasoline in a commercial-grade, backpack weed sprayer. Soliman allegedly told investigators he planned to use the weed sprayer to burn himself to death and “would never forgive himself if he did not do it”, as the Wall Street Journal reported.

“He stated that he … was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” said the affidavit, which added that investigators believe Soliman acted alone.

As of Tuesday, Soliman was being held on a $10m, cash-only bond, prosecutors said. His next court hearing is tentatively set for Thursday.

Soliman had been living in the US on an expired B-2 visitor visa for more than two years after entering the country in August 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a post on X.

He moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.
 Soliman worked as an Uber driver and had passed the company's eligibility requirements, which include a criminal background check, according to a spokesperson for the ride-share service. An online résumé also says he was employed by a Denver-area healthcare company working in accounting and stock inventory control.

Authorities said that the victims wounded in the attack ranged in age from 52 to 88, and their injuries spanned from serious to minor. Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, according to the organization of the targeted demonstration, the Denver-based, pro-Israel group Run for Their Lives.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego, who filmed the aftermath of the attack, said Soliman evidently set himself on fire as he threw the second molotov cocktail and had removed his shirt to reveal what appeared to be a bulletproof vest.

Soliman was arrested without any apparent resistance, according to the video Osante filmed. Authorities said Soliman was injured and taken to a hospital but did not elaborate on his injuries. A booking photo showed him with a bandage over one ear.

The attack at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder comes amid rising tensions over the Israel-Hamas war that has contributed to an increase in antisemitic violence in the US.

It comes nearly two weeks after a man was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington. As police arrested him, the suspect in that attack, identified as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez, yelled: “I did this for Gaza. Free Palestine. There's only one solution, intifada revolution.”

In April, a man set fire to the residence of Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish. The suspect later said the fire was a response to Israeli attacks on Palestinians.

Rabbi Yisroel and Leah Wilhelm, directors of the Rohr Chabad House at Boulder's University of Colorado, said in a statement that they had received “an immense wave of positive messages” after the attack. They said that was “another signal of the health and strong spirits of our community”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Jersey Mike's employee reportedly called county sheriff's office after finding note in store bathroom that read ‘HELP'

A Navarre, Florida, sandwich shop employee reportedly helped authorities save a domestic violence victim who had allegedly been kidnapped by her abusive, pro-wrestler boyfriend after the worker recently found a note in a store bathroom that read “HELP!”

At the center of the incident is Eleanor Coffee, who was at her job making sandwiches for a shop belonging to the Jersey Mike's chain when she noticed a “little piece of crumpled up paper” that had been discarded next to one of the business's toilet paper dispensers, as she put it to the local news station WEAR-TV.

Coffee at first thought it was a piece of trash but then realized the paper contained a plea for help, a woman's name, a phone number and an address for a nearby home.

“Please help me get home!” the note said in part, according to an arrest report reviewed by Law & Crime. The note's writer ominously also asked for someone to “get” her before Friday, adding: “HELP!”

Coffee alerted her manager to the note and called the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office, whose jurisdiction includes Navarre, she told WEAR. After reviewing security video at the Jersey Mike's shop, deputies established the note had been left by a woman who entered the store with her boyfriend, identified as 34-year-old Jordan Williams, a statement from the sheriff's office said.

The sheriff's office said it was familiar with Williams from prior domestic violence cases. Deputies then obtained a warrant to search the address mentioned in the note at Jersey Mike's before encountering a woman at that home “who confirmed she authored the note and detailed a prolonged period of abuse”.

“She detailed repeated assaults, threats involving weapons, and being held in isolation by Williams for a span of several months,” the sheriff's office said. The agency added that the woman had “visible injuries”, and paramedics brought her to a hospital to be treated for “suspected broken bones and other trauma”.

Deputies ultimately booked Williams – who reportedly wrestled professionally under the ring name Jayden Steele in the local independent circuit – with various felonies, including kidnapping, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and battery by strangulation. A judge ordered Williams held without bond after an initial court appearance on Thursday.

In a statement, Santa Rosa sheriff, Robert Johnson, praised the note writer for “the bravery” she displayed in making herself heard. “Thanks to her courage and the deputies' swift actions, she is now safe and receiving care,” Johnson's statement said.

Coffee, meanwhile, said she would never forget finding the note that led deputies to arrest Williams and find the woman whom he had allegedly kidnapped.

“My heart goes out to her and her family,” Coffee said. “And I'm just … hopeful that really doesn't happen again.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Operation ‘severely damaged' base of Crimean bridge, opened by Putin in 2018, Kyiv's SBU security service says



Ukraine has detonated a massive underwater blast targeting the key road and rail bridge connecting the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula to Russia, damaging its underwater supports.

The operation, for which Kyiv's SBU security service claimed responsibility, is the second high-profile operation by Ukraine in days striking significant Russian assets after a sophisticated drone raid on Moscow's strategic bomber fleet on Sunday.

The attack came as Ukraine confirmed it had been invited to the Nato summit later this month, after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it would be a “victory” for Russia if it was not present.

The latest strike on the 12-mile-long Kerch bridge – a prestige project of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, which he opened in 2018 – comes amid what appear to be determined efforts by Ukraine to change the narrative promoted by the Trump administration that Kyiv holds few cards in the war.

The mining of the bridge, which is heavily defended by Russian forces, follows the audacious long-range drone attack on airbases deep inside Russia, which Zelenskyy claimed had damaged “34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers”.

In a further development on Tuesday, Russia's state investigative committee accused Ukraine of carrying out “acts of terrorism” by blowing up two railway bridges in Russia over the weekend. Seven people were killed and 113 injured, including children, when two trains crashed as a result of the attacks.

A Russian rocket attack on the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Tuesday killed at least four people and wounded 25, officials said. Zelenskyy denounced the assault, saying it underscored the fact that Moscow had no intention of halting the war.

The SBU said the operation against the Kerch bridge had been planned for several months and involved the equivalent of more than a metric tonne of TNT, which it said had “severely damaged” the base of the bridge supports.

It is the third time Ukraine has targeted the key logistics route since Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.

In October 2022, a truck exploded on the bridge, while in July 2023, the SBU said it had blown up part of the bridge using an experimental naval drone. Both times, Russia repaired the damaged sections.

Lt Gen Vasyl Maliuk, of the SBU, who supervised the latest operation, described the bridge as “an absolutely legitimate target, especially considering that the enemy used it as a logistical artery to supply its troops”.

He added: “Crimea is Ukraine, and any manifestations of occupation will receive our tough response.”

The SBU published footage showing a blast coming out of the water and debris flying, along with a photo of some damage to the side of the bridge.

Road traffic on the bridge had been temporarily suspended, Russian authorities said on Telegram on Tuesday. Russian state media reported it had been closed to traffic for about four hours.

Russia said on Tuesday said it was wrong to expect a quick breakthrough in Ukraine talks, a day after Moscow rejected Kyiv's call for an unconditional ceasefire at negotiations in Istanbul. The Russian offensive has been going for more than three years, and has killed tens of thousands on both sides and forced millions from their homes in eastern Ukraine. Russia instead offered a partial truce of two to three days in some areas of the frontline, its top negotiator said after the talks.

“The settlement issue is extremely complex and involves a large number of nuances,” the Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday. “It would be wrong to expect immediate solutions and breakthroughs.”

The sides instead agreed on a large-scale swap of captured soldiers and exchanged their roadmaps to peace, or “memorandums”, at the discussions, which lasted for just under two hours on Monday.

According to a document handed to the Ukrainians that was published by Russian state media, Moscow is demanding, as a precondition to pausing its offensive, that Ukraine pull its troops out of four eastern and southern regions that Moscow claims to have annexed.

Peskov was speaking as Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, arrived in the US along with the deputy prime minister Yulia Svrydenko to press for tougher sanctions on Russia.

“We plan to talk about defence support and the situation on the battlefield, strengthening sanctions against Russia,” Yermak said on Telegram.

Peskov also dismissed the idea of a summit between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the US.

“In the near future, it is unlikely,” he told reporters, adding that such a summit could happen only after Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reached an agreement.

The White House said on Monday that Donald Trump was “open” to the idea of a summit, which is also backed by Zelenskyy and by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Zelenskyy's attendance at the Nato summit in The Hague from 24 to 26 June was welcomed by the Ukrainian president after reported misgivings over the potential for the renewal of friction between Zelenskyy and Trump administration officials.

“We were invited to the Nato summit. I think this is important,” Zelenskyy said on Monday after he held a meeting with Nato's secretary general, Mark Rutte, in Vilnius.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A Swedish commission on Monday recommended that international adoptions be stopped after an investigation found a series of abuses and fraud dating back decades.

Sweden is the latest country to examine its international adoption policies after allegations of unethical practices, particularly in South Korea.

The commission was formed in 2021 following a report by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter detailing Sweden's problematic international adoption system. Monday's recommendations were sent to Swedish Minister for Social Services Camilla Waltersson Gronvall, who said her department would review the report.

“The assignment was to investigate whether there had been irregularities that the Swedish actors knew about, could have done and actually did,” Anna Singer, a legal expert and the head of the commission, told a news conference. “And actors include everyone who has had anything to do with international adoption activities.

“It includes the government, the supervisory authority, organization, municipalities and courts. The conclusion is that there have been irregularities in the international adoptions to Sweden,” she said.

The commission called on the government to formally apologize to adoptees and their families. Investigators found confirmed cases of child trafficking in every decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, including from Sri Lanka, Colombia, Poland and China.

Singer said that a public apology, beside being important for those who are personally affected, can help raise awareness about the violations, because there is a tendency to downplay the existence and significance of the abuses.

An Associated Press investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), last year reported dubious child-gathering practices and fraudulent paperwork involving South Korea's foreign adoption program, which peaked in the 1970s and 1980s amid huge Western demand for babies.

The AP and Frontline spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the US, Australia and Europe, and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated child origins, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they had been sent to new parents overseas.

The findings are challenging the international adoption industry, which was built on the model created in South Korea.

In March, South Korea's truth commission concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children's backgrounds and origins.

The Netherlands last year announced it would no longer allow its citizens to adopt from abroad. Denmark's only international adoption agency said it was shutting down, and Switzerland apologized for failing to prevent illegal adoptions. France released a scathing assessment of its own culpability.

South Korea has sent about 200,000 children to the West for adoptions in the past six decades, with more than half of them placed in the US. Along with France and Denmark, Sweden has been a major European destination of South Korean children, adopting nearly 10,000 of them since the 1960s.

Over 100 inmates escape 

More than 100 inmates escaped from a prison and at least one was killed in a shoot-out in Karachi overnight after they were temporarily moved out of their cells following mild earthquake tremors. Senior police official Kashif Abbasi said 216 inmates fled the prison in the capital of Sindh Province before dawn. Of those, 78 had been recaptured. No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled, he said. One prisoner was killed and three security officials were wounded in the ensuing shoot-out, but the situation has been brought under control, Abbasi said, adding that police are conducting raids to capture the remaining escapees.

Two Japanese men killed 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday said that two Japanese men killed last month in the northeastern city of Dalian were business partners of the suspect and authorities were investigating. Dalian police confirmed the case in a statement yesterday, saying a 42-year-old Chinese male, who had lived in Japan for a long time, had been arrested. The two victims were business partners of the suspect and had entered China temporarily, police said. The Japanese government is “providing necessary support to the victims' families and will continue to respond appropriately from the perspective of protecting Japanese nationals,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Chinese police notified the Japanese consulate in Shenyang on May 25 about the killings, two days after the incident, Hayashi told a regular briefing.

PM resigns after protests

Prime Minister Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene has stepped down after losing parliamentary support following corruption claims that erupted into street protests last month, the parliament said yesterday. The parliament did not pass a draft resolution on a confidence ballot, meaning Oyun-Erdene was deemed to have resigned, a parliament statement said. “It was an honor to serve my country and people in difficult times, including pandemics, wars and tariffs,” Oyun-Erdene said after the result of the vote was known. Oyun-Erdene, who has been prime minister since January 2021 and was re-elected in July last year, is to remain caretaker prime minister until a successor is named within 30 days. The political upheaval comes after Mongolians last month protested for weeks in the capital, Ulan Bator, alleging corruption involving Oyun-Erdene and his family.

Dozens injured in quake

A magnitude 5.8 earthquake yesterday shook a coastal town, causing panic among residents, officials said. Dozens were reported injured after jumping from windows or balconies to get out of their homes while a teenager died after being taken to the hospital. No major damage was reported. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said the quake hit at 2:17am and was centered in the Mediterranean Sea, off the holiday resort of Marmaris. It was felt in neighboring regions, including on the Greek island of Rhodes, waking many from their sleep. Minister of the Interior Ali Yerlikaya said on X that a 14-year-old girl was taken to hospital and died there after what he said was an anxiety attack. It was not known if she had any underlying conditions. Nearly 70 other people were treated for injuries after jumping from windows or balconies in panic, he said. There were no reports of damage to buildings, he said.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) yesterday slashed its annual global growth forecast, warning that US President Donald Trump's tariffs blitz would stifle the world economy — hitting the US especially hard.

After 3.3 percent growth last year, the world economy is expected to expand by a “modest” 2.9 percent this year and next year, the Paris-based OECD said in a report.

In its previous report in March, the OECD had forecast growth of 3.1 percent for this year and 3 percent for next year.

“The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging,” said the OECD, an economic policy group of 38 mostly wealthy countries.

It said that “substantial increases” in trade barriers, tighter financial conditions, weaker business and consumer confidence, and heightened policy uncertainty would all have “marked adverse effects on growth” if they persist.

The OECD is holding a ministerial meeting in Paris yesterday and today, with US and EU trade negotiators expected to hold talks on the sidelines of the gathering after Trump threatened to hit the EU with 50 percent tariffs.

The G7 is also holding a meeting focused on trade.

“For everyone, including the United States, the best option is that countries sit down and get an agreement,” OECD chief economist Alvaro Pereira said in an interview.

“Avoiding further trade fragmentation is absolutely key in the next few months and years,” Pereira said.

In the report, he said that “weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception.”

“Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth,” he added.

The outlook is particularly gloomy for the US, which is expected to grow by just 1.6 percent this year, down from 2.2 percent in the previous outlook, and slow further to 1.5 percent next year, the OECD said.

“This reflects the substantial increase in the effective tariff rate on imports and retaliation from some trading partners,” the OECD said.

The effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports has gone from 2 percent last year to 15.4 percent, the highest since 1938, it said.

The OECD also blamed “high economic policy uncertainty, a significant slowdown in net immigration and a sizeable reduction in the federal workforce.”

While annual inflation is expected to “moderate” among the G20 economies to 3.6 percent this year and 3.2 percent next year, the US is “an important exception.”

US inflation is expected to accelerate to just under 4 percent by the end of the year, two-times higher than the US Federal Reserve's target for consumer price increases.

The OECD slightly reduced its growth forecast for China from 4.8 to 4.7 percent this year.

Another country with a sizeable downgrade is Japan: The OECD cut the country's growth forecast from 1.1 percent to 0.7 percent.

However, the outlook for the eurozone economy remains intact with 1 percent growth.

“There is the risk that protectionism and trade policy uncertainty will increase even further and that additional trade barriers might be introduced,” Pereira wrote.

“According to our simulations, additional tariffs would further reduce global growth prospects and fuel inflation, dampening global growth even more,” he said.



                                                                                With an approval rating of just two percent, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte might be the world's most unpopular leader, according to pollsters. Protests greeted her rise to power 29 months ago, and have marked her entire term — joined by assorted scandals, investigations, controversies and a surge in gang violence.
The 63-year-old is the target of a dozen probes, including for her alleged failure to declare gifts of luxury jewels and watches, a scandal inevitably dubbed “Rolexgate.”
She is also under the microscope for a two-week undeclared absence for nose surgery — which she insists was medical, not cosmetic — and is                                    


GROWING CONCERN: 
                                        Some senior Trump administration officials opposed the UAE expansion over fears that another TSMC project could jeopardize its US investment                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) is evaluating building an advanced production facility in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and has discussed the possibility with officials in US President Donald Trump's administration, people familiar with the matter said, in a potentially major bet on the Middle East that would only come to fruition with Washington's approval.
The company has had multiple meetings in the past few months with US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and officials from MGX, an influential investment vehicle overseen by the UAE president's brother, the people said.
The conversations are a continuation of talks that                                    


CAUTIOUS RECOVERY:
                                         While the manufacturing sector returned to growth amid the US-China trade truce, firms remain wary as uncertainty clouds the outlook, the CIER said                                        The local manufacturing sector returned to expansion last month, as the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose 2.1 points to 51.0, driven by a temporary easing in US-China trade tensions, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER, 中華經濟研究院) said yesterday.
The PMI gauges the health of the manufacturing industry, with readings above 50 indicating expansion and those below 50 signaling contraction.
“Firms are not as pessimistic as they were in April, but they remain far from optimistic,” CIER president Lien Hsien-ming (連賢明) said at a news conference.
The full impact of US tariff decisions is unlikely to become clear until later this month                                    



                                                                                Nintendo Co hopes to match the runaway success of the Switch when its leveled-up new console hits shelves on Thursday, with strong early sales expected despite the gadget's high price.
Featuring a bigger screen and more processing power, the Switch 2 is an upgrade to its predecessor, which has sold 152 million units since launching in 2017 — making it the third-best-selling video game console of all time.
However, despite buzz among fans and robust demand for pre-orders, headwinds for Nintendo include uncertainty over US trade tariffs and whether enough people are willing to shell out.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

11:39 JST, June 3, 2025

Yomiuri Giants lifetime honorary manager Shigeo Nagashima, one of Japan's most beloved sports figures whose achievements as a player and manager earned him the moniker of “Mr. Pro Baseball,” died on Tuesday. He was 89.

Nagashima passed away due to pneumonia at 6:39 a.m. in a Tokyo hospital.

Nagashima visited Tokyo Dome for an exhibition game between the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 15, and took a photo with Shohei Ohtani. The following day, he developed a fever and was diagnosed with pneumonia.

His condition worsened and his blood pressure dropped in late May, but he held on, which impressed his doctor and others. At one point his blood pressure stabilized, and he appeared to be stable. However, he passed away on Tuesday morning — the birthday of his daughter Mina, who had been caring for him.

“I will never forget my birthday of watching my father continue to hang on,” she said.

Born in Usui (now Sakura), Chiba Prefecture, Nagashima entered Rikkyo University after graduating from the former Sakura No. 1 High School. At Rikkyo, he broke the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League record for career home runs with eight.

In his first season with the Yomiuri Giants in 1958, he led the Central League in both home runs and RBIs and was named the Rookie of the Year.

His clutch performances — most notably a walk-off home run in the first pro baseball game ever attended by the then Emperor and Empress in 1959 — sparked a national frenzy.

Together with teammate and fellow legend Sadaharu Oh, the pair nicknamed “O-N” played a key role in the Giants winning an unprecedented nine consecutive Japan Series titles from 1965.

He became known for his passionate performances, dazzling baseball fans with his dynamic fielding at third base and his powerful —  sometimes exaggerated —  swings that often delivered clutch hits.

He ended his 17-year playing career in 1974, saying at a memorable retirement ceremony at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo: “My Giants are forever immortal.” His uniform number, 3, is now retired by the Giants.

Upon retirement, he became the Giants' manager, leading the team to the Central League pennant twice over six seasons.

He began a second stint as manager in 1993 that lasted nine seasons. In that span, the team captured the Central League pennant three times and won the Japan Series in 1994 and 2000.

Nagashima retired in 2001 and was later afforded the title of lifetime honorary manager. In 2003, he took on the role of manager of Japan's national baseball team, and led it in the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. However, he suffered a cerebral infarction in March 2004 and was unable to lead the team in Athens. Afterward, he worked hard on his rehabilitation and at times appeared in public to show his fans how he had progressed.

In 2013, he received the People's Honor Award from the government with baseball great Hideki Matsui, his protege who he mentored during his time with the Giants.

Nagashima was hospitalized and received treatment for gallstones in summer 2018. In 2021, he was one of the torchbearers along with Matsui and Oh for the Tokyo Olympic Games, and became the first person from the baseball world to receive the Order of Culture.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the third attack against the Crimean Bridge since Russia's full-scale war began in 2022, mining and damaging its underwater supports, the SBU announced on June 3.

“God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself,"" SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement posted on social media.

""Previously, we struck the Crimean Bridge in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater,"" he added. 

The SBU said the operation ""lasted for several months, with agents mining the ""supports of this illegal construction.""

Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

""And today, without inflicting any civilian casualties, the first explosive was activated at 4:44 a.m.,"" the SBU said.

Underwater supports of the bridge's piers were severely damaged at the bottom as 1,100 kilograms of explosives in TNT equivalent were detonated, according to the statement.

Russian state media later reported a ""Ukrainian intelligence agent"" who had constructed a bomb on ""orders from Kyiv"" had been detained by Russia's FSB

The operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.

A claimed ""agent of Ukrainian intelligence services"" has been detained in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service said later on June 3, accusing the detainee of producing a ""powerful explosive.""  

The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission. 

The construction of the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, holds a significant symbolic value for Russia. The $4 billion project was a political statement designed to affirm the Kremlin's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, as the peninsula is not connected by land to Russia.   

Russia's Defense Ministry previously claimed that three Ukrainian drones were downed over Crimea overnight on June 3. 

The Crimean Bridge was closed for traffic between 6 and 9 a.m. local time on that day, according to local Telegram channels. The Mash Telegram channel reported that a Ukrainian drone was shot down over the bridge, and its debris fell onto the road.

According to pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind, the bridge had been closed down for inspection, possibly to examine damage.

Later the same day, Crimean Wind reported a new ""powerful explosion"" near Kerch at around 3 p.m., writing that a helicopter is patrolling the strait. Several local channels reported that a fresh drone attack against the peninsula was underway in the afternoon, and that the bridge is closed once again.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The United Kingdom on June 2 launched its Strategic Defense Review, a plan to dramatically boost defense spending in light of the increased threat Russia poses to European security, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, adding that it is ""the largest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.""

""Every part of society, every citizen of this country, has a role to play because we have to recognize that things have changed in the world of today... The front line, if you like, is here,"" Starmer said.

""We face war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, growing Russian aggression in our waters, menacing our skies,"" he added.

The media reported on June 1 that a defense review would recommend increasing the U.K.'s military spending and introducing new equipment, including jets capable of launching tactical nuclear weapons.

The British military has a substantial nuclear arsenal, but can only launch such weapons from its submarines after decommissioning a number of platforms at the end of the Cold War.

Starmer announced a wide range of new defense spending commitments amid the increased threat Russia poses to Euro-Atlantic security.

Twelve new nuclear submarines are set to be built within the framework of the Aukus partnership with the U.K, U.S., and Australia.

The U.K. plans to boost weapons production and increase stockpiles, including plans to produce 7,000 long-range weapons and six new munitions factories. 

Weapons spending is set to increase by 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) to a total of 6 billion pounds ($8.1 billion). Another 15 billion pounds ($20 billion) will be invested in the U.K's nuclear warhead program.

""The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,"" Starmer said.

NATO officials have increasingly warned that Russia could attack the alliance's eastern flank in the coming years amid Russia's war against Ukraine.

Finland expects an increased Russian military buildup on its border once the war against Ukraine is over, Major General Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defense forces, told the Guardian in an interview published on May 21.

Russia has increasingly threatened Ukraine's allies as it continues to wage its war.

Members of NATO's eastern flank, including Finland and Poland, have raised concerns that Russia could intensify military buildup on their borders if Ukraine and Moscow reach a ceasefire.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Turkey on May 16 and June 2. The negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Russia reiterating maximalist demands. The talks mainly yielded agreements toward prisoner exchanges.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on June 2 slammed Russia for only providing its memorandum of a peace proposal at talks earlier in the day, saying that ""the Russians are once again stalling for time.""

""(I)f this is just another attempt to buy time, then there should be one response: tougher international sanctions,"" Umerov said in a post to Facebook.

""Our documents were submitted in advance. In contrast, the Russian 'memorandum' appeared only today — during the meeting itself. This created conditions that prevented the meeting from delivering the results needed to end the war,"" he added.

Ukraine and Russia held another round of peace talks on June 2, after their first meeting in Istanbul on May 16. Both rounds of talks were largely inconclusive, with Russia reiterating its rejection of a ceasefire.

Umerov attended the peace negotiations in Istanbul on June 2, leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which included several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors. Umerov also led Ukraine's 12-member delegation on May 16.

""We conveyed the positions formulated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One of the key points — an unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days. This has been our principle and the position of our partners for many months,"" Umerov said.

Russia only proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies.

""Russia rejects even the very idea of stopping the killings. That's why we appeal to the world: pressure is needed for real peace, not for an imitation of negotiations,"" Umerov said.

At the first round of peace talks, both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, which took place from May 23-25. 

On June 2, Ukraine and Russia agreed to work on another prisoner exchange with up to 1,200 captives from each side.

Zelensky, later on June 2, criticized Russia's proposal for a 2–3-day local ceasefire to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, speaking during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Zelensky earlier on June 2 called on U.S. President Donald Trump to deliver a ""strong new package"" of sanctions against Russia if peace talks in Istanbul remain unsuccessful.

""If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised,"" Zelensky said.

Trump on May 30 said that he was ""very surprised"" at Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities amid peace efforts.

The U.S. leader has repeatedly threatened additional sanctions against Russia, but has thus far refused to implement the measure.

Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is committed to ending the war. If not, he warned, the White House would ""respond a little bit differently.""

Erin Patterson is accused of serving her ex-husband's family poisonous mushrooms.James Ross/The Associated Press

An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband's elderly relatives with a meal laced with poisonous mushrooms wept as she was questioned over expletive-laden messages about the victims on Tuesday, in a case that has captivated the country.

Erin Patterson, 50, is charged with the July 2023 murders of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, along with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband. 

The prosecution alleges she knowingly served the guests Beef Wellington that contained lethal death cap mushrooms at her home in Leongatha, a town of around 6,000 people some 135 km (84 miles) from Melbourne.

Patterson denies the charges, with her defence saying the deaths were a “terrible accident”. She faces a life sentence if found guilty. 

Appearing as a witness for her own defence, Erin Patterson was questioned on Tuesday by her barrister Colin Mandy about a series of expletive-laden messages sent to friends regarding the Patterson family.

The court previously heard the relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, deteriorated shortly before the alleged murders due to a disagreement over child support.

“I wish I'd never said it. I feel ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn't have to hear that I said that,” she said of the messages, that the court has previously heard in the prosecution's case.

“I was really frustrated with Simon but it wasn't Don and Gail's fault,” she told the court through tears. 

Erin Patterson is the first witness for the defence after the prosecution rested its case on Monday, following a month of evidence from witnesses, including relatives and medical, forensic and mushroom experts.

The accused began her testimony on Monday afternoon. It is unknown how long she will give evidence for or whether she will be cross-examined by the prosecution. 

The trial, which began on April 29, has seen intense interest from Australian and international media, with podcasters, journalists and documentary-makers descending on the town of Morwell, around two hours east of Melbourne, where the trial is being held.

State broadcaster ABC's daily podcast about proceedings is currently the most popular in the country, with two others also high in the charts. 

The trial continues.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

Federal officials drafted warnings about travelling to the U.S. for Canadians and permanent residents in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump this year but did not post them, internal documents obtained through access to information legislation show.

A document – entitled “Potential impact of EOs on Canadians travelling to the USA Draft travel advice updates” – was drawn up by Global Affairs' C Branch, which deals with emergency management as well as travel advice. 

One section (entitled “Scenarios and Options for Senior Management consideration. Communications to Canadians in the United States”) suggests Canadians consider returning home if they do not have proper documents to stay in the U.S. 

Also addressed is an executive order entitled “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.” The American directive, issued on January 20, aims to enhance screening and vetting of foreign nationals entering the U.S.

American civil-rights groups have warned that the order may lead to the reinstatement of a ban on travellers from predominantly Muslim or Arab countries that Mr. Trump introduced during his first term as President. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has said it relies on the same statutory authority that was used to justify that 2017 travel ban.

What are Trump's executive orders on immigration, the ‘border emergency' and birthright citizenship?

The internal Global Affairs document, drawn up earlier this year, contains drafts of several potential travel advisories that could be issued in response, including versions to be used if bans for particular countries are introduced. Most of them reassure Canadian citizens and permanent residents that they would not be affected.

“The Government of Canada has been informed that Canadians travelling with a Canadian passport, including dual citizens who have Canadian citizenship and citizenship from one of the following X countries: INSERT COUNTRIES, will not be affected by the Executive Order,” the document says.

Another draft option reads: “Similarly, entry requirements for Canadian permanent residents with a valid Canadian permanent resident card and a passport from one of those seven countries remain unchanged because of the Executive Order.”

But another says: “Permanent Residents of Canada from one of the above seven countries should consult Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on the Executive Order for information on entry requirements.“

Federal civil servants also suggested specific updates to Ottawa's official advice after Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January declaring that the U.S. government now recognizes only two sexes: male and female.

It suggests a “generic update” to advice for Canadians with an X on their passport, rather than an F or M, that says “you might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the ”X"" gender identifier."" It adds: “Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.”

About 3,600 Canadians have X on their passport, according to the federal Immigration Department. 

The government already offers general travel advice for transgender and non-binary Canadians, including that “foreign laws and customs related to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics can be very different from those in Canada. As a result, you could face certain barriers and risks when you travel outside Canada.”

Transgender advocate Fae Johnstone, executive director of Queer Momentum, a Canadian LGBTQ advocacy group, said she was pleased that officials were thinking about an update, but speculated that politicians may have vetoed its publication because “Canada is not wanting to pick new fights with Donald Trump.”

”We do need updated travel guidance for people who have X on their passport. It feels like there's a way to do this which isn't about picking a fight with America, but supporting trans folks,"" she said.

The U.S. has said that its border agents will recognize Canadian passports with an X.

The Global Affairs document was obtained by researcher Ken Rubin through an access to information request and shared with the Globe and Mail. 

It emphasizes that, “It is too early to tell how the different EOs will impact Canadians travelling to the United States. The travel advice found in this document is subject to change and was drafted by making assumptions on the possible implications the EOs will have on Cansits” [Canadian citizens].

In March, Global Affairs updated its travel advice to make Canadians visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days aware of a new U.S. rule requiring them to register with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. 

In April, it further updated its guidance, telling Canadians to “expect scrutiny” from U.S. border guards, who may look through phones and laptops. “Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry, you could be detained while awaiting deportation.” 

In a statement on Friday, Global Affairs spokesperson Charlotte MacLeod said, “The intent of the updates is to ensure Canadians have accurate information about travelling to the United States and that they know which U.S. Government sources to turn to for official advice.”

She added that, “Officials prepare in advance to respond to a variety of possible scenarios, based on new information, analysis of trends, and historical examples. This preparation includes developing draft templates of text that can be quickly adapted to respond to a specific situation if needed, based on the most recent information.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Dutch coalition collapses after Wilders withdrawal","https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-coalition-collapses-after-wilders-withdrawal/a-72770240","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 11:03:45 GMT","

The Netherlands is heading for a new election after far-right firebrand Geert Wilders' party quit the coalition over an immigration policy row. Prime Minister Dick Schoof will lead a caretaker government until the vote.

Prime Minister Dick Schoof on Tuesday said the Netherlands would hold a new election after the collapse of his coalition government.

The announcement followed far-right leader Geert Wilders' withdrawal of his party's ministers in a dispute over migration policy.

Schoof said his administration would serve in a caretaker role and that he would formally offer the resignations of Wilders' Party for Freedom ministers to the Dutch king.

The prime minister said he had repeatedly told coalition leaders that collapsing the government would be ""unnecessary and irresponsible.""

""We are facing major challenges nationally and internationally and, more than ever, decisiveness is required for the safety of our resilience and the economy in a rapidly changing world,"" Schoof said.

No date for a new election has been set, but it is unlikely to be for several months.

Wilderspulled his far-right PVV (Party for Freedom) out of government, citing differences with his partners because of a lack of action over proposals to curb immigration.

""No signature for our asylum plans. No adjustment of the coalition agreement. The PVV is leaving the coalition,"" said Wilders on X, formerly Twitter.

He said he had informed Schoof that all ministers from his party would quit the government.

""I signed up for the toughest asylum policy and not the downfall of the Netherlands,"" said Wilders.

The PVV entered its first coalition government six months after a surprise victory in the Netherlands' November 2023 parliamentary elections; striking a deal with the conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the centrist New Social Contract (NSC) and the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB).

No date for a new election was initially set, but it is likely to be in several months.

The endeavor was shaky from the start, however, with politicians voicing aversion to working with firebrand Wilders and doubts about his willingness to abide by the country's constitution.

Wilders had been frustrated with what he saw as the slow pace of introducing the ""strictest-ever immigration policy"" that he had agreed with coalition partners after his election win in November 2023.

The government crisis comes just weeks before the Netherlands — the eurozone's fifth-largest economy — is due to host world leaders for a NATO summit. As a result of the collapse, NATO spending increases will likely be in limbo when the alliance's boss, former Prime Minister Mark Rutte, convenes the confab in his home country.

Though the remaining coalition partners could carry on as a minority government, a snap election is the likely consequence of Wilders' move.

Frans Timmermanns, leader of opposition Labor/Green bloc, said, ""I see no other way to form a stable government."" 

""The Netherlands deserves a government that unites the people and works shoulder to shoulder on real solutions,"" said Timmermans, ""It's time for elections, we are ready for them.""

Coalition partners blasted Wilders for his lack of seriousness.

""There is a war on our continent. Instead of meeting the challenge, Wilders is showing he is not willing to take responsibility,"" said Dilan Yesilgoz, leader of the conservative VVD.

""It is irresponsible to take down the government at this point,"" railed Nicolien van Vroonhoven, leader of the centrist NSC.

Wilders had already indicated in late May that he was ready to bring about the fall of the coalition if his 10-point plan to curb immigration was not put into action within a few weeks.

The plan included border closures for asylum-seekers, tougher border controls and deporting dual nationals convicted of a crime.

""Close the borders for asylum-seekers and family reunifications. No more asylum centers opened. Close them,"" was how he summarized the scheme.

The PVV called for military deployment to protect the country's borders, with Wilders demanding Syrian refugees be repatriated.

However, the plans were deemed unviable or even illegal by several political experts.

Some observers suggest Wilders created the current crisis as a means to topple the government.

New elections in the Netherlands would be yet another contest likely viewed as a measure of just how mad voters' are over immigration and cost of living issues.

Although the PVV racked up some 23% of the vote last November, it is currently polling around 20% — on par with Labor/Green.

Kyiv says it has bombed the Kerch Bridge in a ""unique special operation."" The blast targeted a critical Russian supply route. Meanwhile, three people were killed in a Russian attack on Sumy. 

Road traffic on the bridge connecting Russia to the Crimean peninsula was temporarily suspended Tuesday, according to Russian authorities.

Ukraine's SBU security service said it was behind an attack on the Kerch Bridge, claiming to have struck both the road and rail sections using underwater explosives.

Meanwhile, Russia continues missile attacks on Ukraine, with three killed in the northeastern city of Sumy.

Below are the main developments in Russia's war in Ukraine from Tuesday, June 3, 2025:

The head of the UN's nuclear safety watchdog said that the conditions for restarting Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant do not currently exist due to a lack of water for cooling and an absence of a stable power supply.

In an interview with Reuters in Kyiv, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said water would need to be pumped from the Dnipro River to restart the plant, which is currently shut down.

Grossi said the Russians have ""never hidden the fact"" that they want to restart the plant. However, they will not be able to do so anytime soon.

""We are not in a situation of imminent restart of the plant. Far from that; it would take quite some time before that can be done,"" he said.

Moreover, according to the IAEA chief, before the plant's machinery, which has been inoperable for three years, can be restarted, it must undergo a thorough inspection.

The nuclear plant, located in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, was occupied by Russia in March 2022 shortly after the country launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian representative to the United Nations, Andrii Melnyk, has told DW that he is hopeful new UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock will be able to use new position to bring an end to the war.

""Her record as a foreign minister, personally contributing to the support of Ukraine, also saw Germany as the second biggest, ally of Ukraine in this war,"" Melnyk told DW.

""I am confident that Annalena Baerbock will pursue the goal of consolidating democratic forces [in Ukraine], strengthening the United Nations, but also helping Ukraine to defend our independence.""

Russia has repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions to condemn the it attempt to annex parts of Ukraine. However, Melnyk is hopeful that with Baerbock at the helm, she could help ensure the UN charter is upheld.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine has been invited to a NATO summit that will take place in The Hague, Netherlands, from June 24 to 26.

The agenda is expected to focus on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's calls for alliance members to increase defense spending.

""We were invited to the NATO summit. I think this is important,"" Zelenskyy said Monday after holding a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Lithuania. 

Last week, Zelenskyy said that if Ukraine is not present at the NATO summit, ""it will be a victory for Putin, but not over Ukraine, but over NATO.""

A day after Moscow again rejected Kyiv's call for an unconditional ceasefire at negotiations in Istanbul, Russia said it was wrong to expect a quick breakthrough in Ukraine talks.

 ""The settlement issue is extremely complex and involves a large number of nuances,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that ""it would be wrong to expect immediate solutions and breakthroughs.""

On Monday, the two sides agreed to a large-scale prisoner exchange and exchanged their roadmaps to peace, also known as ""memorandums.""

According to the document handed to the Ukrainians and published by Russian state media, Moscow demanded that Ukraine pull its troops out of four eastern and southern regions that Moscow claims to have annexed as a precondition to pausing its offensive.

Kyiv had pressed for a full and unconditional ceasefire. Instead, Russia offered a partial truce of two to three days in some areas along the front line.

Peskov dismissed the idea of a summit between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. ""In the near future, it is unlikely,"" Peskov said, adding that such a summit could only happen after Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reach an ""agreement.""

Three people were killed and 25 others, including children, were injured in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy, in a Russian artillery attack, according to statements from the city council and the health ministry.

""Eight of the wounded are in serious condition, and three of them are children,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the assault underscored that Moscow has no intentions of halting the three-year war. 

""The Russians brutally struck Sumy — directly targeting the city, ordinary streets — with rocket artillery,"" Zelenskyy said.

""That's all you need to know about Russia's 'desire' to end this war,"" the Ukrainian president wrote in a post on Telegram.

Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that its troops had seized control of Andriivka in the Sumy region as its troops continues to advance.

Ukraine has not yet confirmed losing the settlement, which is located more than 20 kilometers from the regional capital of Sumy.

Ukraine has claimed responsibility for an underwater bombing of the Crimean Bridge, saying it carried out a ""unique special operation"" against the structure linking  illegally annexed Crimea to Russia.

The SBU, Ukraine's security service said it had detonated more than 1,000 kilograms (about 200 pounds) of explosives attached to one of the bridge's underwater pillars — marking what it described as the third successful strike on the bridge since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

Footage released by the SBU showed an underwater blast sending debris into the air, along with a still image showing apparent damage to the side of the bridge. However, the extent of the damage remains unclear.

Russian state media said the bridge was closed to traffic for about four hours earlier on Tuesday.

Kyiv has consistently called the 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge a legitimate military target, arguing it plays a key role in Russia's troop and equipment movements.

After direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul failed to produce a breakthrough on Monday, Russia continued attacks on Ukraine.

Russian artillery struck Sumy, a northeastern Ukrainian city, killing three people as Russian troops continued their advance in the border region.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's SBU claims it has damaged the foundations of the Kerch Bridge using more than a metric ton of explosives in an underwater operation planned months in advance.

It's the third such strike since 2022, with the SBU saying the bridge is now in ""emergency condition.""

Traffic was halted for three hours early Tuesday but has since reopened, according to Russian officials.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","What is the answer to overtourism?","https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-the-answer-to-overtourism/a-72700713","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 07:59:31 GMT","

Many popular holiday destinations are struggling from the environmental impact of huge visitor numbers. How can the issue be tackled? 

Tourism is booming all over the world. In 2024 there were around 1.5 billion holiday makers, setting the second highest ever record after 2019. 

From Gran Canaria to Mallorca and Rome, many population destinations are now overcrowded with visitors.

Overtourism describes the excessive, and often simultaneous, rush of vacationers to one place. According to the UN World Tourism Organization it is usually defined as the point at which locals or visitors feel tourism has negatively impacted the quality of life in a region to an unacceptable degree.

All of this applies to the seven Canary Islands. The archipelago in the Atlantic, home to 2.2 million locals, hosted a total of 15.2 million visitors last year — and a new record is expected this year.

While tourism accounts for more than a third of the islands' economy, it is mainly large investors that profit, according to local groups. Rents are exploding, the environment is suffering and living space for the local population is becoming scarce as property owners capitalize on lucrative short-term rentals.

Overtourism exacerbates the existing problems of heavy tourism and often stretches infrastructure and local resources to their limit.

Noise, littering, drones flying through the air to take holiday snapshots and traffic jams are just a few of the less pleasant aspects of surges in visitors.

Landscapes are often altered by additional footpaths or new parking lots catering to tourists, disrupting the local flora and fauna.

Tourism threatens water resources, especially on islands and in warm regions as vacationers, particularly wealthy ones, generally consume more water than locals.

Waste water is also often a problem. For example, the wastewater discharged into the sea off the popular Spanish Balearic island of Mallorca has caused underwater seagrass beds, important helpers in the fight against the climate crisis, to shrink considerably.

Emissions from tourism increased by 65% between 1995 and 2019. Today it is today responsible for 8% to 10% of all global greenhouse gas emissions.Air travel is the main driver of its growing climate impact. While flying accounts for a quarter of all vacation trips, it is responsible for three quarters of tourism emissions.

Added to this are emissions from local transportation, accommodation and leisure activities. The general rise in travel often leads to overtourism: If more people are traveling, particularly popular destinations become more crowded.

Short trips are becoming more popular. Last year, Germans alone took around 94 million short trips — an increase of almost a quarter compared to the previous year. This type of travel is particularly damaging to the climate, as the largest proportion of tourists' CO2 emissions comes from the journey to and from a destination. More short trips equals more arrivals and departures, and this means more emissions.

According to the Swiss non-profit organization fairunterwegs, air travel has a particularly influential role in driving overtourism. They say the existence of nearby airports, particularly if they are served by low-cost airlines, encourages the emergence of overtourism. Mallorca, for example, would probably not be as popular if people had to travel there by ship.

However cruise ships are also criticized for exacerbating the problem. Cruise ship tourists tend to go ashore for only a few hours, putting a strain on local infrastructure and contributing relatively little to the local economy, as they are usually fully catered for on board.

And then there is the phenomenon of so-called set-jetting. The filming locations of popular TV series often experience a huge spike in visitor numbers. On Maui and Sicily, the filming locations for the first two seasons of US series ""The White Lotus,"" the number of guests has risen by 20% since the islands appeared on-screen.

Dubrovnik in Croatia, where much of Game of Thrones was filmed, is also suffering from overtourism. And in Hallstatt, Austria, a local initiative is fighting against the impact of a tourism surge, likely driven by the picturesque town being featured in the South Korean Netflix series ""Spring Waltz.""

Some cities and regions are trying to limit the number of travelers at certain times or altogether.

In Venice, day tourists have to pay up to €10 and Lisbon charges cruise ship operators €2 for every disembarking passenger. Tenerife is restricting access to the summit of the Pico del Teide volcano to 300 visitors per day.

Paris has moved to limit the number of days per year locals can rent out their main residence via platforms such as Airbnb, while Thailand is closing the popular Similan and Surin Islands this year until autumn to allow local ecosystems to recover, and is planning to charge entrance fees in future. 

In addition to access restrictions and higher taxes on overnight stays, visitor flows are also managed through digital booking systems that help avoid queues in front of monuments or museums. Some tourism hotspots are also promoting attractions outside city centers.

Copenhagen is trying a different approach by instead rewarding more climate-friendly travellers, with those arriving by train able to access free rental bikes, yoga lessons, guided tours and reduced admission prices.

			Darren Beattie, who alarmed the State Department with his pro-Moscow views, is married to a woman whose uncle has ties to Vladimir Putin

A senior official who dismantled the US government's Russian disinformation unit is married to a Russian woman with links to the Kremlin, The Telegraph can reveal.

Darren Beattie has provoked alarm within the State Department since being appointed in February for his ardent pro-Russian views.

He has been noted for his focus on destroying the agency tasked with tackling Kremlin propaganda.

Mr Beattie, the acting under-secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, is married to a woman whose uncle has taken several roles in Russian politics and once received a personal “thank you” message from Vladimir Putin.

In the years before joining the government, Mr Beattie wrote social media posts suggesting Western institutions should be “infiltrated” by Putin, while he also attacked what he described as the “globalist American empire”.

Donald Trump is under pressure from many in his party, particularly senators, to take a tougher stance on the Russian leader while he continues to refuse to sign a ceasefire deal as the war in Ukraine drags on.

Many of Mr Beattie's social media posts also concern China, repeatedly calling on the US to surrender Taiwan to Beijing, and labelling Britain a “poor and pathetic kingdom” that would be “far better off under Chinese dominion”.

State Department sources expressed scepticism over whether he had undergone security vetting, a process which has been relaxed under Mr Trump.

Mr Beattie was a member of the first Trump administration, but after being sacked in 2018 for allegedly attending a white nationalist conference, he reinvented himself as an “alt-Right” media figure.

In May 2021, public records show, he married a Russian woman called Yulia Kirillova in a ceremony in Broward County, Florida.

Ms Kirillova, who according to her Facebook page was educated in Moscow before studying abroad in Canada and Washington DC, is the niece of Sergei Chernikov, a Russian drinks magnate who part-owns a flat with her mother, Natalia.

Mr Chernikov, whose net worth was estimated to be $150 million in 2005, reportedly received a letter of thanks from Putin for his help in the election campaign which first brought the Russian leader to power.

The same year, Mr Chernikov took his first step into politics, taking a role in the ministry of natural resources, before becoming deputy governor of the Nenets region in Siberia.

From 2008 to 2010, he was a member of Russia's civic chamber, which was founded following a proposal by Putin and is notionally meant to scrutinise the activities of the Russian government.

When the chamber was set up, critics claimed that it would be staffed by Kremlin allies and used to diminish a rival power base in the Russian State Duma.

Both before and after his marriage to Mr Chernikov's niece, Mr Beattie has repeatedly attacked what he called the “globalist American empire” while praising both Russia and China as counterweights to its “woke” ideology.

“The rise of non-woke (China) and anti-woke (Russia) geopolitical competitors to the Globalist American Empire is not a bad thing,” he wrote in October 2021.

He also said he looked forward to its “prestige and power” collapsing on the world stage and claimed that its “position in the global order [is] rapidly deteriorating”.

Mr Beattie, and Revolver, the news outlet he founded after leaving the first Trump administration, argues that the US has sought to engineer “colour revolutions” around the world – a common trope in Russia and China to dismiss pro-democracy movements as Western-backed coup attempts.

The businessman has claimed the US is running “colour revolution ops” in Ukraine, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Myanmar, and that an American “colour revolution brigade” is pushing for a “forever war in Ukraine”.

Two months before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he said: “Imagine the whining from the Globalist American Empire if Putin ‘invades' Ukraine… I love it when our national security bureaucrats fail!”

He has also praised Putin as “brave and strong”, and claimed the Russian leader had “done more to advance conservative positions in the US than any Republican”. He also declared: “Nato is a much greater threat to American liberty than Putin ever was.”

“The funny thing is just about every Western institution would improve in quality if it were directly infiltrated and controlled by Putin,” he wrote in September 2021.

Many of his posts focus on Britain, claiming it treats white people “far worse” than the Uyghur population that Chinese authorities have imprisoned in camps in Xinjiang.

He has labelled Britain a “sewage pit” and “the most utterly repulsive dystopia on earth”.

In a post more than two years after the outbreak of war in Ukraine, he criticised the UK's policy of “antagonising Russia”.

All of these social media posts were still online at the time of writing, although Mr Beattie has deleted disparaging tweets about Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, having previously claimed his now-boss attended “gay foam parties”.

According to Ms Kirillova's Facebook page, she moved to Washington on Jan 28, roughly a week before her husband began his role at the State Department.

Despite his wide-ranging brief at the heart of the US government, Mr Beattie is said to have focused a disproportionate amount of time on seeking to dismantle the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference hub, known as R/Fimi, while building cultural ties with Russia.

R/Fimi, which tracked and countered propaganda from sources including Russia, China and Iran, was a relatively small agency with a budget of just over $50 million at the time it was shut down.

The US's adversaries are estimated to spend tens of billions of dollars a year on foreign disinformation.

Mr Beattie's news outlet Revolver had spent years attacking R/Fimi, accusing it of being part of a “censorship network” designed to silence conservative voices.

Sources said Mr Beattie had doggedly pursued the agency after being appointed, taking it apart piece by piece.

Contractors were sacked and officials were ordered to stop communicating with others in the State Department or external partners without explicit permission.

Even before it was disbanded in mid-April, when Mr Beattie told staff in a brief speech that it was “severely misaligned” with the administration's priorities, its work had essentially wrapped up.

Mr Rubio confirmed in an interview distributed by the State Department the same day that Mr Beattie had played a major role in abolishing R/Fimi.

At the same time as Mr Beattie was working on dismantling the agency, he is said to have pushed to rebuild relations with Russia, insisting on instituting cultural exchange programmes in fields such as ballet and hockey.

He is also said to have taken a significant interest in classified material related to Russia, prompting widespread concern about turning over sensitive information to him.

Sources were highly sceptical if it had undergone a security vetting process, which the State Department's website notes can take anywhere from a couple of months to over a year to complete.

On his first day in office, Mr Trump unilaterally granted top-secret security clearances to personnel in the Executive Office of the President citing a backlog in processing. The office is not part of the State Department.

MIT Technology Review reported this month that Mr Beattie had launched a sweeping effort to obtain records from R/Fimi staff shortly before it closed, apparently with the intention of characterising it as an organisation dedicated to smearing conservatives.

He asked for communications with or about reporters who write about foreign disinformation, along with references to Mr Trump and his allies. One official said the move amounted to a “witch hunt”.

Mr Beattie would need confirmation by the Senate to take on the under-secretary role full-time: as an acting official, he is limited to 210 days.

Allies in the media have suggested he is unlikely to survive his time in the spotlight, and have suggested permanent posts where he could be installed without requiring backing from senators.

A senior State Department official said: “No one in America cares about a British gossip column. This is all fake news and low even for tabloid standards.

“Darren is a tremendous colleague who is committed to advancing President Trump's America First agenda.

“In a few short months, he has been able to spearhead high-level projects that have been critical in advancing a foreign policy that puts our national interests first.”

Mr Chernikov and Ms Kirillova have been approached for comment.

Mr Beattie described the allegations as “malicious defamatory trash that is beneath the standards of even the British tabloid press”.

Protests are unfolding as agents arrest undocumented people at courthouses, workplaces and on the way to school.

Protests over ICE raids are continuing across the United States as agents arrest immigrants at courthouses, from their workplaces, on the way to school and more. Immigration and human rights advocate Adriana Jasso with Unión del Barrio describes protests that met a massive raid in San Diego at a popular restaurant, the targeting of farmworkers, and how her organization has been conducting ICE patrols to alert the community.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We look now how protests over immigration raids and arrests are continuing around the country. In Milford, Massachusetts, this weekend, students walked out of school Monday to show support for Marcelo Gomes da Silva, an 18-year-old high school honor student detained Saturday by ICE agents in three unmarked vehicles as he drove his volleyball teammates to practice at 7:45 in the morning. Marcelo was born in Brazil, had lived in the Milford area since he was 5 years old. He was also a member of the school band and was scheduled to perform the next day at the school's graduation ceremony. So, on Sunday, many students marched in their gowns from their graduation to join hundreds of others at a protest outside Milford's town hall. That's Massachusetts.

Let's go across the country now to San Diego, where outrage is growing after 20 armed and masked ICE agents in full tactical gear raided a popular Italian restaurant Friday. The agents handcuffed the staff, demanded IDs, arrested four workers. Local residents reacted angrily to the raid, attempted to block ICE vehicles from leaving the scene. ICE agents responded by throwing flash-bang smoke grenades at the crowd.

Just two examples of communities expressing outrage over ICE raids. This comes as immigrant communities are also pushing back on the raids and arrests. In San Diego, the Unión del Barrio is conducting community patrols of ICE agents in their neighborhood. This is a clip from a patrol in May. They speak in English and Spanish.

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 1: [Estamos aquí, vigilando la (calle) 39 y] Hemlock. Parece unos vehículos sospechosos. [translated: We're here, watching 39th (Street) and Hemlock. Looks like some suspicious vehicles.]

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 2: Aquí están. They're in front of us. [translated: Here they are. They're in front of us.]

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 3: Sí, sí, los vemos. Estamos al frente de ustedes. ¿Qué vehículos, más o menos? [translated: Yes, yes, we see them. We are in front of you. What vehicles, more or less?]

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 2: Son tres vehículos. [translated: There are three vehicles.]

AMY GOODMAN: One of the people helping on these patrols by Unión del Barrio is Adriana Jasso, who will join us in a minute. This is a clip of her on another patrol, using a bullhorn to alert the community that ICE agents are on site. She speaks in Spanish.

UNIÓN DEL BARRIO MEMBER 4: Aqui tenemos al ICE. Sí era, sí era. [translated: Here we have ICE. Yes, it was (ICE). Yes, it was.]

ADRIANA JASSO: Aquí está ICE. Este es un vehículo de ICE. Un vehículo de ICE que está haciendo inteligencia a nuestra comunidades. [translated: Here is ICE. This is an ICE vehicle. An ICE vehicle that is doing intelligence on our communities.]

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined in San Diego by Adriana Jasso, immigration and human rights advocate with the longtime group Unión del Barrio.

Welcome to Democracy Now!, Adriana. It's great to have you with us. So, we are describing these different stories. Can you tell us first what happened on Friday at this Italian eatery? It was just opening up. Armed, heavily armed, ICE agents, various immigration parts of the government move in. And tell us what happened, and then how the community is responding.

ADRIANA JASSO: Thank you, Amy, for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be with you.

Yes, on Friday evening, around 5 p.m., as members of the community of South Park, which is a middle-class community in — one of the many communities in San Diego was getting ready for dinner, and this particular restaurant has been popular for many years by local families and people who are just about to enjoy an evening of family time. And on Friday, HSI, the investigative branch of CBP, of DHS, came to that location and requested for customers to exit the restaurant, as well as put under arrest and detention to every person working and serving a function in the restaurant.

AMY GOODMAN: And could you tell us, Adriana, in terms of this move toward actual raids, rather than just going in to arrest individual peoples, which the Trump administration started, but now raids in the community, how frequently have these begun to crop up?

ADRIANA JASSO: Yes, thank you, Dr. González.

We have seen an increase in the level of fear, intimidation and terror that our communities are experiencing. We have had a clear escalation of work raids, and including this latest one at this restaurant. At the end of March, a construction site was raided in the East County of El Cajon. And the images and the level of escalation and aggression and excessive use of force, intimidation and terror that some of the images showed in South Park do not compare to what we saw and witnessed in the city of El Cajon, wherein over 80 agents exercised an operation at a work site that lasted six-and-a-half hours, and they detained over 200 workers, with a conclusion of taking into custody 17 of those over 100 workers that they detained for over six hours.

AMY GOODMAN: And what about the situation of farmworkers? The whole nation, not just California, depends on the work of farmworkers in California, many of them immigrant workers. What's the situation, that you've been able to tell of, in the fields?

ADRIANA JASSO: Specifically to the community in the county of Bakersfield and the Central Valley, where most of the food comes from and is cared for and harvested by the hands and the labor of migrant workers and workers of Latino, Mexicano descent, as well as Central America, we have had two major work raids or targeting farmworkers in the Bakersfield, early — mid-December, and a second one that had an impact took place in the farmworkers community in the Orange County, as well, in the Orange County about a month ago. This has been the escalation of targeting, and this came from Border Patrol, another branch of CBP, where over a hundred workers were detained, the first operation, and the second one, over 20 workers were detained. What is particular to highlight is that many of the workers were able to exercise and defend themselves from the excessive use of force and the abusive psychological harm that border agents and ICE agents were trying to inflict at the time of the interaction with the workers.

AMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk, Adriana Jasso, about how the community is organizing? We're seeing communities where a sudden arrest happens, and just the community rises up, from Missouri to Massachusetts. But you've been organizing for years. How are you moving on now? What are you — what are people doing in their organizing as Stephen Miller talks about ramping up to 3,000 arrests each day?

ADRIANA JASSO: We understand and have adhered to our historical responsibility to fight back, to resist and to denounce and take the moral imperative to say that the legal framework, due process, constitutional rights, civil rights, human rights, that were protection to our communities and to the working class of the West and every and other places in the country, this administration has made sure to erase and to try to attack and violate every human right, every constitutional right. Unión del Barrio stands in very much the assessment and the understanding that we have the responsibility to defend our communities. We are organizing night and date, weekend, weekdays, every single possible energy and time that we are able to put into community work and say that we have the right and the responsibility to defend ourselves.

You had a chance to see the community patrols that we have in place from L.A., from Riverside, from San Diego, from Escondido, and we're developing relationships to implement this model in Santa, Barbara and San Francisco, and also potentially looking at growing in places like Utah, New York, Chicago. We are having those conversations because we know and we understand that the moral imperative to fight back, to resist and to not ask for permission or apologize for the right to exist. These are exciting times, yet they are difficult times, painful times. But this also could be an opportunity for the movement to gain the strength to stand up and face a fascistic, harmful government that has done away with the fundamental human rights and constitutional rights that we as communities deserve.

AMY GOODMAN: Adriana Jasso, I want to thank you for being with us, immigration and human rights advocate based in San Diego, California, a member of Unión del Barrio.

Sweeping cuts made by the Trump administration have already left the government unprepared for hurricane season.

President Donald Trump's acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly told staff that he was not aware that the U.S. has a hurricane season — despite leading the agency primarily responsible for responding to disasters in the U.S.

FEMA chief David Richardson made the comment during a meeting on Monday, according to four sources who spoke to Reuters. Staffers said it was unclear whether his comment was meant as a joke.

The comment was made the day after hurricane season began in the Atlantic Ocean, with the season officially ending in November. Some researchers suggest that the hurricane season is lengthening, however, as the climate crisis drives earlier and later storms, while also making storms stronger than they would be otherwise. 

Indeed, forecasters for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have predicted above-normal hurricane activity for 2025. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are killed by hurricanes each year in the U.S.

In a statement after the report was published, the Department of Homeland Security framed Richardson's comment as a joke. But the statement didn't outright deny the comment, calling the report “meanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy.”

“​​[T]here is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season,” the statement said. “FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.”

However, Richardson's comments — as well as President Donald Trump's flip-flopping on whether he wants to abolish FEMA itself — have reportedly spurred confusion and alarm, leaving even staff concerned over the government's ability to respond to hurricanes and other disasters.

Trump has suggested that he wants to get rid of or severely shrink FEMA, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has publicly announced plans to do so. Though the administration hasn't fully eliminated the agency yet, FEMA has reportedly drastically reduced trainings for state and local emergency hurricane response, potentially leaving communities across the U.S. shorthanded when a hurricane strikes this year.

At the same time, the administration's drastic cuts to the National Weather Service have left the agency majorly short staffed, meaning that the government's ability to predict and track storms is jeopardized.

Further, during the staff meeting on Monday, Richardson reportedly told staff that the agency was scrapping his plan for hurricane response, which he said was almost done. Instead, the agency was going to use last year's hurricane response plan — which wouldn't be possible, staff said, with the administration's cuts to the agency.

Richardson's appointment has also raised concerns over his ability to lead FEMA, especially through multiple staffing crises. The official has already racked up numerous gaffes in just a few weeks as FEMA director. 

During a town hall meeting with staff on the administration's plan for “FEMA 2.0,” for instance, Richardson bizarrely talked about his girlfriend with “huge red hair” educating him on the size of Texas, and went off on tangents about fruits while trying to discuss the future of the agency. He also speculated on the number of laws governing FEMA, while referencing crucial information he had just learned about FEMA “last week.”

Critics said a FEMA director shouldn't be making jokes about something as serious as hurricane preparedness, especially when he's only been in his role for a few weeks and has zero prior experience in emergency management. 

“Suffice to say, disaster response is no joke,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight of FEMA. “If you don't know what or when hurricane season is, you're not qualified to run FEMA. Get someone knowledgeable in there.”

Israeli forces fired on dozens of people, including children, near a privatized aid distribution site in southern Gaza.

Israeli forces on Tuesday gunned down dozens of people, including children, close to a privatized aid distribution site in southern Gaza, marking the third consecutive day that Israel's military has opened fire on Palestinians seeking food amid an increasingly dire humanitarian emergency.

A doctor at nearby Nasser Hospital, which is barely functioning and unequipped to handle an influx of patients, told The New York Times that the facility received 19 of those killed in Tuesday's massacre. Most of the victims, according to Dr. Ahmad al-Farra, were children between the ages of 10 and 13, “many with gunshot wounds to the head or chest.”

The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that “the incident shocked local residents and activists, who describe it as ‘another aid massacre' targeting defenseless civilians.”

“It is one of the deadliest incidents since the beginning of aid allocation in the southern Gaza Strip,” the newspaper observed.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that its soldiers opened fire near the aid site operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, but claimed “shots were directed near individual suspects who advanced toward the troops.” The Times reported that an IDF spokesperson “declined to explain the nature of the perceived threat.”

Testimony from witnesses, health officials, and humanitarian workers on the ground contradicted the IDF's account of limited firing at “individual suspects.”

According to The Associated Press, “Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said its field hospital in Rafah received 184 wounded people.”

AP went on to cite several Palestinians who witnessed Tuesday's massacre:

Yasser Abu Lubda, a 50-year-old displaced Palestinian from Rafah, said the shooting started around 4 am in the city's Flag Roundabout area, around one kilometer (1,000 yards) away from the aid distribution hub. He said he saw several people killed or wounded.

Neima al-Aaraj, a woman from Khan Younis, gave a similar account.

“There were many martyrs and wounded,” she said, saying the shooting by Israeli forces was “indiscriminate.”

She said she managed to reach the hub but returned empty-handed. “There was no aid there,” she said. “After the martyrs and wounded, I won't return,” she said. “Either way we will die.”

Rasha al-Nahal, another witness, said “there was gunfire from all directions.” She said she counted more than a dozen dead and several wounded along the road. She said she also found no aid when she arrived at the distribution hub, and that Israeli forces “fired at us as we were returning.”

At least 27 people were killed by Israeli forces Tuesday morning, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The deadly incident occurred after IDF troops killed more than 30 people and wounded dozens of others near the privatized aid distribution site on Sunday and Monday.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Monday that “it is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food.”

“I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable,” Guterres said. “Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law to agree to and facilitate humanitarian aid. The unimpeded entry of assistance at scale to meet the enormous needs in Gaza must be restored immediately. The U.N. must be allowed to work in safety and security under conditions of full respect of humanitarian principles.”

Follow:


            Staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency were caught off-guard and left bewildered when the disaster relief agency's new acting head David Richardson told personnel that he was previously unaware the United States has a hurricane season, which started Sunday.
    


            Richardson made the comments during a briefing Monday morning, multiple sources told CNN. While some interpreted the remark as a joke, others said it raised concerns about the recently appointed acting administrator, who has no prior experience managing natural disasters.
    


            A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN the comment was made in jest, adding, “FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.”
    


            It remains unclear whether Richardson's comment – joking or not – reflects a lack of knowledge before assuming his current role. In recent weeks, he has repeatedly referenced FEMA's preparations for hurricane season in meetings and interviews.
    


            Reuters first reported Richardson's comments in the meeting.

Exclusive: FEMA is ‘not ready' for hurricane season, internal agency review shows



            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appointed Richardson – a former Marine combat veteran and martial-arts instructor – in early May, firing President Donald Trump's first acting FEMA chief just hours after he broke from other Trump officials and told lawmakers he did not support eliminating FEMA.
    


            Richardson has promised to enforce Trump's agenda. In an all-hands meeting on his first day at FEMA, Richardson told agency staff he will “run right over” anyone who tries to prevent him from carrying out the president's mission, CNN previously reported.
    


            Since then, the Department of Homeland Security has installed more than a half-dozen of its officials into key roles at FEMA to effectively run the agency. Most of them, like Richardson, have little experience handling disasters.
    


            In Monday's meeting, Richardson announced that FEMA will not release an updated disaster plan for this hurricane season as previously promised, saying the agency does not want to get ahead of Trump's newly formed FEMA Review Council, sources said.
    


            Instead, FEMA will largely default back to its operating procedure from 2024, though the agency enters this hurricane season in turmoil, with a dramatically smaller workforce.
    


Roughly 10% of FEMA's total staff have left since January, including a large swath of its senior leadership, and the agency is projected to lose close to 30% of its workforce by the end of the year, shrinking FEMA from about 26,000 workers to roughly 18,000, according to a FEMA official briefed on the numbers.
    


            In a memo issued last month that was obtained by CNN, Richardson officially rescinded FEMA's 2022-2026 strategic plan, saying it “contains goals and objectives that bear no connection to FEMA accomplishing its mission.”

SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria is close to realizing its decades-old goal of joining the euro currency union and deepening ties with the more prosperous countries of Western Europe. But the government faces a populist backlash against the shared currency on the eve of a key decision by European Union authorities.

Fears of inflation, poverty and the unknown are mingling with disinformation spread on social media that aims to turn people against the euro. The discontent tracks with increased support for populist and anti-EU parties across Europe, which is exploited by nationalist and pro-Russian politicians in a country that remains one of Europe's poorest and most afflicted with corruption.

“Adopting the euro will make us feel the threshold of poverty. After all, prices will be in euros,” said 78-year-old retiree Tanya Ignatova.

“Bulgaria is not ready for the euro. Someday we may be ready, but not now,” said another retiree, Mario Georgiev.

Several thousand people rallied against the euro in the capital on Saturday, urging a referendum on whether to transition from the lev currency to the euro. The head of the pro-Russian Varazhdane party, Kostadin Kostadinov, told the crowd that “Bulgaria has risen and declared: Freedom, we choose the Bulgarian lev!”




Others in Bulgaria say the country already benefits from EU membership and it does not matter what the currency is. “We have inflation now and we will have it in the future,” said 26-year-old Konstantin Bozhinov.

Aiming at deepening European integration amid growing geopolitical tensions, the government is pressing ahead. It has asked for a review of whether it meets the requirements of low inflation, sound government finances and legal conformity to EU institutions. On Wednesday, the European Commission will announce the results.

If the commission gives a green light, other member states will decide on Bulgaria's candidacy in the coming weeks.

At the last review in 2022, Bulgaria failed on the inflation requirement. Inflation has since fallen.

President Rumen Radev has encouraged the anti-euro voices by proposing a referendum on the currency, citing public concerns over inflation and purchasing power. That followed a protest in February that saw the offices of the EU's executive commission in Sofia spattered with red paint and its entrance set on fire.

The president's proposal was turned down by the pro-European majority in parliament, which accused Radev of acting in favor of Russia with his last-minute attempt to sabotage the euro adoption.

According to the EU's multi-country Eurobarometer survey released last week, 50% of Bulgarians are against the adoption of the euro, while 43% are in favor. In contrast, trust in the euro continues to grow across the rest of the EU.

Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. It has been plagued by political instability and corruption that have fueled euroscepticism among its 6.4 million citizens. Analysts say disinformation campaigns from abroad have fed fears of economic changes that could bring more poverty.

Scores of false claims by opponents of the eurozone have been published on social networks. One claim says the EU plans to take away people's savings if they fail to spend them within a certain period. Another claims that plans to introduce a digital version of the euro are part of a plan to control everyone.

“There is a powerful brainwashing of the average Bulgarian. Illusory fears are being spread, lies are being told wholesale, unscrupulously and brazenly,” said Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in Sofia.

Economists say joining the euro will not bring massive change to Bulgaria's economy in the short run. That's because the government has pegged the currency to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.

Joining the euro can bring lower borrowing costs, greater ease in comparing domestic and foreign prices and no need to exchange money when vacationing in another euro country. More than that, it's a sign of integration into the EU and its large economy. Members get a seat on the European Central Bank's interest rate-setting committee.

Countries agree to join the euro when they join the EU, but so far 20 of 27 members have taken the step. Croatia was the last to join in 2023.

Bulgaria's government has very little debt, at 24.1% of GDP — the second lowest in the EU and well below the 60% level in euro membership criteria. That's a sharp contrast to its neighbor, Greece, which entered the euro in 1999 with high debt that was concealed through complex financial transactions. Greece's broken finances eventually triggered a eurozone-wide crisis.

Bulgaria's government has been “fiscally super conservative ... the risk of Bulgaria becoming a fiscal risk to the eurozone is essentially zero,” said Zsolt Darvas, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.

Fears of inflation are not entirely without basis. Experience in other countries shows that “whenever there is a changeover from national currency to the euro, there is often a minor inflation effect, but it's typically less than 1%,” said Darvas

Economists say a one-time increase occurs as service providers such as restaurants, which don't adjust prices as often as other sectors, take advantage of re-doing menus and price lists to implement hikes.

A man accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza appeared in court in Boulder, Colorado on Monday. Mohamed Sabry Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

Witnesses recounted the dramatic scenes after eight people, calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd.

Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in an attack that the FBI immediately described as an act of terror. Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack.

The White House said the violence seen in Boulder, Colorado Sunday is “unacceptable” after a man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Suspect in Boulder attack that injured at least 12 people faces multiple state and federal charges including commission of a hate crime.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A man posing as a gardener to get close to a group in Boulder holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza planned to kill them all with Molotov cocktails, authorities said Monday.

But he had second thoughts and only threw two out of the 18 incendiary devices he had into the group of about 20 people, yelling “Free Palestine” and accidentally burning himself, police said. Twelve people were injured in the Sunday attack. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn't spray it on anyone but himself “because he had planned on dying.”

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote in an affidavit. He didn't carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. The suspect's first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said during a press conference Monday.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

During a state court hearing Monday, Soliman appeared briefly via a video link from the Boulder County Jail wearing an orange jumpsuit. Another court hearing is set for Thursday. Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after the hearing. 

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88, and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims had what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration when video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He's right there. He's throwing Molotov cocktails.” A police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego said he was across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, police wrote. 

Osante said that after the suspect threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. 

Soliman told investigators he constructed the devices after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Soliman also told investigators he took a concealed carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he is not a legal U.S. citizen.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

In video and photos shot right after the attack by a woman at the gathering, Soliman can be seen pacing without his shirt on with what appears to be burns down one of his arms. He and a small group of people around him are screaming at each other, with some witnesses filming him. 

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers who'd play with Pruiett's kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman's home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

AKOBO, South Sudan (AP) — Wiyuach Makuach sat on her bed in a dimly lit ward of a hospital near South Sudan 's border with Ethiopia and rested her remaining arm in her lap as she recalled the airstrike that took her other arm and nearly killed her.

“Everything was on fire,” she said in an interview at the hospital in the border town of Akobo where she was being treated for her injuries. 

The bombing happened on May 3 at another hospital in the northern community of Fangak where she had traveled to be with her 25-year-old son while he sought treatment for tuberculosis. A series of strikes there, including several at the Doctors Without Borders facility, killed seven people.

“I ran outside and started rubbing mud on myself to stop the burning,” Makuach said.

Makuach, 60, is just one of the dozens of civilians who aid groups say have been killed or badly injured by airstrikes in recent weeks as South Sudan's army clashes with militia groups across the country. The army says it targets only combatants, and has not commented on civilian casualties. 

“The army displaced us and our families into the bush and that's when we decided we would fight back,” said Gatkuoth Wie, 24, who was wounded while fighting in northern Jonglei State.

The fighting has led to U.N. warnings that South Sudan is again on the brink of civil war. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to send to South Sudan a group of eight deportees from Cuba, Vietnam and elsewhere who have been convicted in the U.S. of serious crimes, sparking a legal fight that has reached the Supreme Court.




Many of those wounded in the South Sudan clashes have been transported to Akobo, where the International Committee for the Red Cross has set up a temporary surgical response. Others have been stranded for days by the fighting.

Doctor Bjarte Andersen, a surgeon working with the ICRC, says that the fighting has made it difficult to transport patients that have been critically wounded. “We know of one person who has died waiting for transportation, but there are probably more,” he said.

“The most critical cases cannot even be moved, they are not likely to survive the journey,” said Christina Bartulec, who oversees the organization's medical operation in Akobo.

The ICRC does not track which patients are combatants and which are civilians. Most of the people brought to their facility are young men, several of whom told The Associated Press that they were engaged in fighting.

In the past month, however, an increasing number of the victims have been women and a few children, according to hospital staff.

One is Kuaynin Bol, 15, who was gravely injured by a blast as he lay asleep in his home. Surgeons have removed bone fragments from his brain and performed four operations on his leg, which was badly broken.

Simmering tensions between the government and opposition groups erupted in March when a local militia called the White Army overran a military barracks in Nasir, a town in the country's northeast.

The government pinned responsibility for the attack on First Vice President Riek Machar, placing him under house arrest and detaining other members of his SPLM-IO party. It also brought in Ugandan forces to support a sweeping military offensive against opposition troops and community militias across the country.

That offensive centered on Upper Nile State and allegedly involved use of improvised incendiary weapons that Human Rights Watch has said killed at least 58 people, including children.

In May, the fighting spread to northern Jonglei State where Fangak is located, a region previously unaffected by the violence, after the government alleged several barges were hijacked by opposition forces there.

Isaac Pariel, a member of Machar's opposition party who is the local chairman in Fangak of the government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, said that at least 25 civilians have been killed this month. But the true toll is likely higher, as much of the fighting has taken place in remote areas that are inaccessible to medical workers.

One bombardment in the village of Wichmon on May 15 killed 12 people including 8 children, according to local authorities and one eyewitness. The Associated Press was unable to independently verify those figures.

The government has not officially claimed responsibility for the strikes. 

Army spokesman General Lul Ruai Koang told The Associated Press he was not authorized to comment on “ongoing military operations across the country.”

The violence has been devastating for civilians already reeling from successive humanitarian crises.

Much of the fighting has taken place in South Sudan's Greater Upper Nile region, a vast floodplain that in recent years has been ravaged by extreme weather, disease, and severe food insecurity.

“The people here are moving all the time, just during the night,” said William Nyuon, a Fangak resident. “They fear the plane will come and bomb them again.”

STOCKHOLM (AP) — A Swedish commission recommended Monday that international adoptions be stopped after an investigation found a series of abuses and fraud dating back decades.

Sweden is the latest country to examine its international adoption policies after allegations of unethical practices, particularly in South Korea.

The commission was formed in 2021 following a report by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter detailing Sweden's problematic international adoption system. Monday's recommendations were sent to Minister of Social Services Camilla Waltersson Grönvall, who said her department would review the report.

“The assignment was to investigate whether there had been irregularities that the Swedish actors knew about, could have done and actually did,” Anna Singer, a legal expert and the head of the commission, told a news conference. “And actors include everyone who has had anything to do with international adoption activities. 

“It includes the government, the supervisory authority, organization, municipalities and courts. The conclusion is that there have been irregularities in the international adoptions to Sweden.”

The commission called on the government to formally apologize to adoptees and their families. Investigators found confirmed cases of child trafficking in every decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, including from Sri Lanka, Colombia, Poland and China.

Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

Singer said that a public apology, beside being important for those who are personally affected, can help raise awareness about the violations because there is a tendency to downplay the existence and significance of the abuses.




An Associated Press investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), last year reported dubious child-gathering practices and fraudulent paperwork involving South Korea's foreign adoption program, which peaked in the 1970s and ‘80s amid huge Western demands for babies.

The AP and Frontline spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated child origins, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they had been sent to new parents overseas.

The findings are challenging the international adoption industry, which was built on the model created in South Korea. 

In March, South Korea's truth commission concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children's backgrounds and origins. 

The Netherlands last year announced it would no longer allow its citizens to adopt from abroad. Denmark's only international adoption agency said it was shutting down, and Switzerland apologized for failing to prevent illegal adoptions. France released a scathing assessment of its own culpability.

South Korea has sent around 200,000 children to the West for adoptions in the past six decades, with more than half of them placed in the U.S. Along with France and Denmark, Sweden has been a major European destination of South Korean children, adopting nearly 10,000 of them since the 1960s.

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — A Guatemalan court ordered Monday the arrests of Colombia's attorney general and a former Colombian defense minister who led a U.N. anti-corruption mission in Guatemala.

Guatemalan prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche, who himself has been sanctioned by the United States and other countries for allegedly interfering in corruption investigations, had requested that an appeals court issue the arrest orders for Colombia's top prosecutor Luz Adriana Camargo Garzón, who was the chief of investigations of the Guatemala mission, and Iván Velásquez, who had led the mission and later was Colombia's defense minister.

Curruchiche said Camargo and Velásquez had committed illicit association during their investigation into bribes paid to Guatemalan officials by Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.

Along with former Guatemalan prosecutors working with the U.N. mission, Velásquez and Camargo were part of “a criminal structure led by the former CICIG commissioner,” using the Spanish initials of the U.N. mission, Curruchiche alleged. 

Curruchiche had long ago focused his investigation on an agreement the anti-corruption prosecutors had signed with Odebrecht that would offer reduced penalties in exchange for the company's cooperation in the investigation. His boss, Prosecutor General Consuelo Porras, has also been sanctioned by the U.S. and other governments for blocking corruption investigations. Last week, a U.N. expert warned her office was using criminal law to pursue enemies.

Velásquez responded via X after learning of the accusations.




“So now the corrupt Guatemalan attorney general and her prosecutor Curruchiche – designated as corrupt and sanctioned by the United States and the European Union – extend their persecution for Luz Adriana Camargo and me,” Velásquez wrote. “My solidarity with the former officials and so many Guatemalan citizens who the Attorney General's Office has forced into exile.”

Camargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Among those former Guatemalan prosecutors forced into exile was Juan Francisco Sandoval, who led the special prosecutor's office against impunity.

Sandoval, who led the Odebrecht investigation with support from the U.N. mission and has been living in exile in the United States, said last month in a statement that Curruchiche's investigation was “a sham and a manipulation strategy.”

The U.N. mission operated in Guatemala from 2007 to 2019, when then-President Jimmy Morales decided to not renew its mandate, after it linked members of his family to a case.

It had worked with Guatemalan prosecutors to take down criminal structures in the country, sending judges, prosecutors, other public officials, including former presidents to trial for corruption.

Interim Top Federal Prosecutor for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba addresses reports that New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has allegedly ordered police to stop cooperating with ICE on ‘Hannity.'

Newark Mayor and Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Ras Baraka filed a lawsuit Tuesday against interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, accusing her of false arrest and malicious prosecution in connection with his May 9 arrest and charges outside a federal immigration center.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey, accuses Habba of acting politically in Baraka's May 9 arrest outside the Delaney Hall detention center, near Newark Liberty International Airport. Baraka was arrested during a protest outside the facility, after being accused of trespassing and ignoring warnings from law enforcement officials to leave. He was held in custody for several hours before being released. 

The U.S. attorney's office said last month it would drop the charges against Baraka ""for the sake of moving forward."" 

The civil lawsuit filed by Baraka seeks damages for what his lawyers described as his ""false arrest and malicious prosecution,"" as well as the allegedly defamatory remarks Habba made about his case, including on social media. The lawsuit includes screenshots of Habba's social media posts in question.

Baraka, an outspoken opponent of Trump's immigration policies, was briefly charged with criminal trespassing last month outside Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility near Newark, New Jersey. He was one of several public officials, including Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman, from the New Jersey congressional delegation, all of whom had massed outside the facility in protest.

Habba claimed he ""ignored multiple warnings"" from officials to remove himself from the privately owned ICE detention center – a contention Baraka disputed.

""After they finally told us to leave, and I told them I was leaving, they came outside the gate and arrested me,"" he previously said in an interview on MSNBC. ""So it looked like it was targeted.""

JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA

In the lawsuit, Baraka's lawyers accused Habba of acting as ""a political operative, outside of any function intimately related to the judicial process, and in her individual personal capacity.""

It also accuses her of green-lighting the arrest despite ""clear evidence that Mayor Baraka had not committed the petty offense of ‘defiant trespass.'"" Also named as a defendant in the case is Ricky Patel, a DHS Investigations agent in charge in Newark.

Fox News host Mark Levin gives his take on the America First Committee and Iran's nuclear enrichment on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.'

President Donald Trump on Monday evening looked to reaffirm his administration's position when it comes to nuclear negotiations with Iran and said Tehran will not be allowed ""any enrichment of uranium.""

His message, which surfaced on multiple social media platforms, appeared to be a direct response to a report by Axios which cited two sources with ""direct knowledge"" of a secret proposal that Washington provided to Tehran, allegedly said the U.S. would agree to permit ""limited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to-be-determined period of time.""

WHITE HOUSE URGES IRAN TO ACCEPT NUCLEAR DEAL AS IAEA REPORTS URANIUM ENRICHMENT SPIKE

Fox News Digital could not independently verify the details of the proposal, but if the decision to grant Tehran some uranium enrichment were granted, it would directly contradict public comments issued by lead negotiator Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump.

Iran has repeatedly said it will not agree to a uranium enrichment ban, arguing it has the right to the process, which is also vital for nuclear energy. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Monday reiterated this point in a press conference from Egypt, and, according to the Tasnim News Agency, said he plans to respond to the U.S. proposal soon.

Araqchi did not comment on the specifics of the agreement but said his ""response will be based on the principles of the Iranian nation."" 

The proposal also reportedly included the notion that Iran could join a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as a solution to its enrichment needs. However, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei on Monday reportedly argued that this was not a new solution, nor an adequate substitute.

US AND IRAN CLASH OVER URANIUM ENRICHMENT AS NUCLEAR TALKS RESUME IN ROME

""If some parties are proposing such a process, we welcome it and have no problem with participation either. But we emphasize that such an initiative cannot replace enrichment inside Iran,"" the spokesperson said. 

The White House has not said how long it will attempt to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program, as security officials have repeatedly warned that Iran could be playing for time as the threat of U.N. snapback sanctions is set to expire come October. 

Iran on Tuesday reiterated that it is not going to abandon negotiations but suggested it would not cave to Washington's demands either.

Retired NYPD Inspector Paul Mauro discusses the recent anti-Israel incidents in the U.S. and the attack in Boulder, Colorado as the country grapples with antisemitic violence. 

The suspect accused of bombing a gathering of pro-Israel demonstrators said he turned to improvised explosive devices after being denied the purchase of a firearm due to his immigration status.

According to an affidavit filed by the Boulder Police Department, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman told detectives that he had taken a concealed carry class in preparation to buy a firearm but was ultimately blocked from completing the purchase because he is not a U.S. citizen. 

""He said that he had previously tried to purchase a firearm, but resorted to the Molotov cocktails when he could not purchase a gun because he was not a legal citizen,"" acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said in a news conference on Monday afternoon. 

With access to guns restricted, the Egyptian national revealed to authorities that he turned to YouTube to learn how to construct homemade firebombs.

Soliman allegedly created 18 Molotov cocktails before driving to Boulder on Sunday, June 1 and prepared for the peaceful pro-Israel demonstrators to arrive for the ""Run For Their Lives,"" in support of the Israeli hostages. Soliman is accused of throwing two incendiary devices at the crowd. 

Judicial District Attorney Michael Dougherty said they have identified four additional victims – bringing the total to 12. None of the victims have died.

""We're going to continue to encourage victims and witnesses to come forward and contact law enforcement,"" Dougherty said in the Monday news conference. ""But we now have 12 victims. And later this week, we'll be filing formal charges against him.""

Authorities said all but two victims have been released from area hospitals. They did not note the severity of the injuries from the attack.

Victims and witnesses observed Soliman throw what appeared to be a glass bottle, which burst upon impact, creating large flames, the affidavit said. He also allegedly used a commercial weed sprayer as a ""makeshift blowtorch.""

According to the affidavit, authorities discovered multiple glass bottles containing liquid, a lighter, rags, an insecticide sprayer, and an AR-style rifle BB gun in Soliman's 2015 silver Toyota Prius.

Along with the materials, authorities also found a Quran and paperwork with the words, ""Israel,"" ""Palestine"" and ""USAID.""

FBI RAIDS HOME OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT SUSPECT ACCUSED OF FIREBOMBING PRO-ISRAEL RALLY IN BOULDER

In his interview with law enforcement, Soliman said he bore no remorse for his actions and reiterated his intent to carry them out again if given the opportunity. 

The affidavit noted that Soliman left behind an iPhone and a journal at his Colorado Springs home, detailing his motivations and preparations for the attack.

Now facing a litany of charges – including multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, and possession of incendiary devices – Soliman is being held on a $10 million bond.

Dougherty outlined the severe potential penalties facing Soliman if convicted on all charges related to the June 1 attack. He faces 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder – eight for attempted murder with intent and deliberation, and eight for attempted murder with extreme indifference.

If convicted and the sentences are ordered to run consecutively, he could face a maximum of 384 years in state prison for those charges alone. In addition, Soliman is charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device, which could add up to 48 years if served consecutively.

He also faces 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device, carrying a potential additional 192 years. In total, the maximum possible sentence could reach 624 years if all convictions are handed down and run consecutively.

Along with charges on the state level, he has also been federally charged with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin. 

""No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind. But our laws recognize that such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, their religion, or their national origin,"" Grewell said. ""According to our complaint and the charges brought by D.A. Dougherty's office, Mr. Soliman stated that he had been planning this attack for a year, and he acted because he hated what he called the ‘Zionist group.'""

His next court appearance, for filing charges, will be Thursday, June 5 at 3:30 p.m. MT.

MSNBC host Jen Psaki brushed off concerns about former President Biden's age, prior to him dropping out of the race, often by comparing him to his opponent, Donald Trump. 

MSNBC's revamped lineup has been a misfire through one month, with Jen Psaki shedding half the audience her predecessors averaged in the same timeslot and other new programming struggling to attract viewers. 

Psaki, a former Biden White House press secretary who has insisted she never saw signs the former president had declined while she worked for him, saw an increased role as part of MSNBC's overhaul when programming changes were announced earlier this year. 

Psaki took over MSNBC's coveted 9 p.m. ET timeslot on Tuesday through Fridays last month as ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" returned to only airing on Mondays, after Maddow temporarily returned to airing five nights a week during President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. 

""The Briefing with Jen Psaki"" averaged 971,000 total viewers from its May 6 debut through May 28, shedding a staggering 47% of the audience that Maddow and Alex Wagner pulled in at 9 p.m. ET throughout 2025.

Psaki has also hemorrhaged viewers from the advertiser-coveted demographic of adults aged 25-54, averaging 78,000 for a 52% drop compared to the 161,000 demo viewers that Maddow and Wagner averaged on Tuesday through Fridays at 9 p.m. ET before the former Biden spokesperson took over. Wagner hosted Tuesdays through Fridays in Maddow's usual spot before Trump's inauguration.

The network also canceled Joy Reid's program ""The ReidOut"" and replaced it with ""The Weeknight,"" an ensemble program featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris spokesperson Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez, the daughter of disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Michael Steele, the former Republican National Committee chair who now staunchly opposes the GOP.

""The Weeknight"" debuted on May 5 and averaged 776,000 total viewers through May 28 for a 12% drop compared to the 886,000 total viewers that ""The ReidOut"" and other temporary programs managed throughout 2025 in the 7 p.m. ET timeslot before changes went into effect.  

CREDIBILITY CRISIS: PRESS DISMISSED HUR REPORT ON BIDEN'S MEMORY ISSUES LONG BEFORE CONCERNS BECAME UNDENIABLE

""The Rachel Maddow Show"" returned to only airing on Mondays and ""The Briefing with Jen Psaki"" took over MSNBC's 9 p.m. ET timeslot on Tuesdays through Fridays last month.  

""The Weeknight"" shed even more viewers from the key demo, as the new MSNBC show averaged 72,000 for a 20% decrease, compared to the 90,000 demo viewers who tuned into the 7 p.m. ET timeslot before the ensemble program kicked off. 

Another new show, ""The Weekend: Primetime,"" with Antonia Hylton, Catherine Rampell, Elise Jordan and Ayman Mohyeldin, is down 11% among total viewers and 6% in the demo compared to MSNBC programming that used to occupy its timeslot. 

Despite the programming overhaul, MSNBC had its second-worst May in history among both total day and primetime in the demo. 

For the month, MSNBC settled for a dismal average of 49,000 viewers among the critical demo to lose to CNN, which averaged 59,000. During primetime, CNN averaged 76,000 demo viewers and MSNBC finished with an average of only 73,000.

Only one of MSNBC's new shows is outdrawing its timeslot predecessor, as ""The Weekend"" with Jonathan Capehart, Eugene Daniels, and Jackie Alemany is up 24% in total viewers and 29% among the demo since launching on May 3.  

An MSNBC insider pushed back on the notion the network was struggling, pointing to the historic news cycle that occurred during Trump's first 100 days in office that helped attract viewers before the new programs launched. The insider also noted that Psaki has built on the audience of her lead-in while competing in the NBA and NHL playoffs. 

MSNBC's viewership issues come as Comcast gears up to spin off NBCUniversal cable assets, including MSNBC, into a separate company called Versant that will not be tied to NBC News. 

MSNBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Fox News correspondent Stephanie Bennett reports on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's comments on the China threat and Indo-Pacific politics on ‘Fox Report.'

President Donald Trump blasted China recently on Truth Social, saying Beijing had ""TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US."" Trump furiously concluded, ""So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" 

Apparently, in return for mutual deescalation of trade tensions, Beijing had committed to again allow the free flow of rare earth minerals to the U.S. However, they did not follow through on that promise. No wonder Trump was angry; he should not, however, have been surprised. 

The White House will try to resolve this issue, and will hopefully again reduce mutual tariffs. The stock market will celebrate a near-term resolution, business managers will exhale, and shoppers won't hoard Barbies for Christmas. 

TRUMP WARNS COURT RULING AGAINST TARIFFS COULD LEAD TO 'ECONOMIC RUINATION' OF US

But longer term, the Trump White House must commit to eliminating our dependence on China for essential goods, which gives Beijing a stranglehold on our economy. China is an enemy and cannot be trusted. Relying on them for rare earths or for other critical goods, like pharmaceuticals, is dangerous. 

The US and Ukraine signed a key rare earth minerals deal earlier in 2025. FILE: Drag-line excavator mines rare earth materials on Ukrainian soil on February 25, 2025, in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine. (Photo by Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)

Rare earths are ""essential""; we need lanthanum and cerium, for instance, to make camera lenses and catalytic converters, respectively. Indeed, we need rare earths to produce everything from cars to missiles to cell phones. China accounts for about 60% of global mine output as well as 90% of processed materials. Our economy comes to a virtual standstill without these products. The Chinese know this and will take advantage of that reliance.  

This is one reason that Trump's proposal of a joint venture with Ukraine is brilliant. If the two countries can together begin to mine and process rare minerals, the U.S. will have a vested interest in defending Ukraine against Russian aggression (while our presence might presumably deter another assault) and the undertaking would also help alleviate our reliance on China. Ukraine is home to 22 of the 34 minerals classified as ""critical"" by the EU; we need them.  

PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA IS OPEN TO ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH US ON RARE EARTH MINERALS

It is not just rare earths and minerals we should be concerned about. Since the COVID-19 emergency, Americans have become increasingly aware that we also depend on China (and to a lesser degree India) for many essential pharmaceuticals, a reliance which could prove deadly should Beijing choose to block exports.  

In last year's first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001. The shortages sent parents searching high and low for amoxicillin and other prescription drugs for themselves and their kids. 

The Covid pandemic revealed the downside of not being self-sufficient in medical goods, when Beijing chose to withhold vital drugs and personal protective equipment from Americans. One of the most outrageous derelictions of Joe Biden's presidency was not addressing that dangerous vulnerability.    

At the outset of the pandemic, China controlled roughly half the global production of products like face masks and ventilators; though they expanded output 12-fold as Covid spread, they stopped exports to the U.S. The United States, for its part, was importing about 90% of the surgical face masks we used, even though we had invented virus-filtering N95 masks and disposable nitrile gloves.   

UKRAINE SIGNS DEAL TO GIVE US ACCESS TO RARE MINERALS WITH TRUMP ADMIN 'COMMITTED TO A PEACE PROCESS': BESSENT

Between January and March 2020, Chinese exports of critical medical goods to the U.S. fell sharply. China apologists argue (wrongly) that the decline stemmed from tariffs placed on such goods during the first Trump administration. Ventilators, oxygen masks and other medical products were not covered by Trump's tariffs against China; the fall-off was a purposeful decision by Beijing to restrict U.S. supplies. 

Reacting to critical shortages, with health workers having to reuse masks and wear garbage bags over their heads for protection, U.S. firms stepped up and began producing the necessary protective gear. But, as the emergency waned, China resorted to its usual practices and flooded our market with cheap products, undercutting U.S. manufacturers.

That's when the Biden administration should have stepped in to protect U.S. producers; for an administration that exhibited an almost religious zeal for wearing masks, ensuring domestic output (and availability) would seem a layup. They did not. 

In April 2025, the New York Times reported, ""Few domestic industries have been as devastated by the flood of cheap Chinese imports as manufacturers of face masks, exam gloves and other disposable medical gear that protects healthcare workers from infectious pathogens."" At the height of the pandemic, some 107 U.S. companies had started up to produce masks and glove; today only five remain.

It was not just PPE that became scarce. In 2020, the New York Times quoted a Chinese health specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations saying, ""Chinese pharmaceutical companies have supplied more than 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone, as well as 70 percent of acetaminophen and 40 to 45 percent of heparin in recent years.""  

ONE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES CAN FINALLY PUT AN END TO AMERICA'S RELIANCE ON CHINA

Congress, alarmed by revelations of U.S. dependence for PPE and pharmaceuticals, did what they do best: ordered up some studies on the issue and demanded better reporting. During Trump's last year in office, his administration tried to boost domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, but the effort died in the Biden years. 

In last year's first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001.

This is a fixable problem. If we can devote hundreds of billions of dollars to boosting domestic production of windmills and semiconductors, surely we should be taking similar steps to end our dependence on Chinese-provided drugs.

The New York Times revealed the Biden administration's multi-billion-dollar solution to drug shortages writing, ""The White House earlier this month proposed…  linking Medicare payments to hospitals in part on whether hospitals do a good job buying drugs from companies that demonstrate quality over the long term, rather than just the cheapest price."" 

That is not a solution. Instead, a solution would entail reducing our dependence on China for essential goods of all kinds and making domestic manufacturing profitable again through lower taxes, new technology like AI and deregulation. These are policies that dominate the Trump agenda, and they will work to make the U.S. independent again.

Former Congresswoman Michelle Steel outlines the threats China poses in the Yellow Sea amid South Korea's presidential election.

On Thursday, May 29, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation awarded an Honorary Bradley Prize to Jimmy Lai, a political prisoner of China's General Secretary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party.  

Lai was a serial entrepreneur who began with nothing and founded and grew major businesses in China before his imprisonment, where his Hong Kong-based media organizations, including Apple News, prospered and where he had become a symbol of free speech in the embattled city.  

Lai is also the most prominent persecuted Catholic in the world and should be all that Pope Leo XIV needs to know about Xi and his sinister plans for the church in China. (Leo should exit the ill-advised agreement his predecessor entered into with the Chinese communists, an agreement that is as sacrilegious as it is dangerous to the worldwide church.) 

WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY: RELEASE MY FATHER JIMMY LAI, WHO PUBLISHED WHAT CHINA'S LEADERS DID NOT WANT TO HEAR

Lai believed deeply in the rights of Hong Kong residents guaranteed them when the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China in 1997. At that time the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China entered into an agreement, known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which the PRC committed to the United Kingdom that Hong Kong citizens would retain their high degree of autonomy and the preservation of their capitalist system and way of life for 50 years.

This included the right to a separate executive, legislative and independent judicial system apart from that of Beijing's, as well as freedoms of assembly, speech and the press. The world can judge Xi's credibility by his actions vis-à-vis Jimmy Lai.  

The Bradley Foundation awards its prizes to individuals whose work exemplifies the foundation's mission to promote American exceptionalism and the Western tradition. It recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to scholarship, cultural institutions or public policy, often with a focus on conservative or classical liberal themes. The foundation's decision to highlight the plight of Jimmy Lai was an honorable and important step in bringing attention to his captivity in solitary confinement and under harsh conditions.  

TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT TARGETS CHINA INFLUENCE, KICKS OUT PRO-BEIJING AGITATORS AMID RISING TENSIONS

Xi now faces a dilemma. He rightly must conclude that Lai's case is soaring in the attention it receives around the world and that harsh judgments of Xi by the world's leaders and its businesses follow attention to the case.

Xi ought also to fear what the martyrdom of Lai would mean in the longer term for China. Who wants to invest in, much less visit, a country so cruel as to imprison a 77-year-old and increasingly frail man of faith?  

Did Xi learn nothing from the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was preceded by the world's attention on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, Natan Sharansky and Vladimir Bukovsky? High-profile dissidents are largely forgotten once they are exiled from their countries. The United Kingdom would accept Lai if Xi expelled him, but Xi's reputation for ruthlessness only increases and thus the world's wariness only climbs the longer Lai remains imprisoned.  

MARCO RUBIO TO CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER: TRUMP WILL PUT 'AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST' IN US-CHINA RELATIONS

President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have already linked their legacies to the freeing of Lai, and Pope Leo's is now inextricably connected to the heroic witness for the faith that Lai is living. We can pray the Bradley Foundation has provided the spark the world needed to focus on Lai.

""As you can see, I am not Jimmy Lai,"" Jimmy Lai's son Sebastian said on accepting the Bradley Prize in his father's place on May 29. ""Instead of being here with you wonderful people, accepting this prestigious award, my father sits in a maximum-security jail in Hong Kong as a high-risk category a prisoner. He's in jail in Hong Kong for the same reason he is being celebrated here, for courage in the face of oppression."" 

We should hope everyone in the world doing business with China realizes they are complicit in the harsh imprisonment of Jimmy Lai. They have the ability to appeal to Xi to #FreeJimmyLai as the hashtag puts it. Will they use it?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump is giving people the economic recovery they voted for","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/3428743/trump-economy-recovery-people-voted-for/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Before COVID-19, President Donald Trump built a thriving economy that was a model for the rest of the world. A return to the prosperity of that economy is the baseline for this administration, not simply the goal.

The people gave the president a mandate in 2024: Enact an agenda that will spur affordable growth, level the global playing field, put more money in the pockets of hardworking taxpayers, and right-size our bloated bureaucracy.

The president has answered that mandate by pushing full steam ahead on the most ambitious economic agenda in a generation. He is realigning global trade with an America First agenda, incentivizing unprecedented investment in U.S. industry, and modernizing regulations to empower U.S. innovators and energy producers. Now, with an assist from Congress, he is cementing the most sweeping tax reform in decades.

Contrast the president's success over the last 120 days with the situation he inherited. The government under former President Joe Biden had a reckless spending problem, having run up the largest deficit in our nation's history while not at war or in a recession, and caused an affordability crisis.

The president, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and I are working to fix this. By rebalancing our trade arrangements, making pro-growth tax reform permanent, and reprivatizing the economy, the administration will realize the golden age the president has promised.

Step one of the Trump economic agenda is to level the playing field with our international trading partners. Consider the recently announced U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, which will create $5 billion in new exports for American producers.

The White House and Treasury Department continue to press China to engage in fruitful conversations so that we can achieve a “big, beautiful rebalancing” that could open up China's consumer market to foreign trade.

Also consider the $2 trillion in financing that the president secured from our partners in the Middle East to extend America's lead in artificial intelligence. Such an unprecedented injection of capital reflects the confidence investors, businesses, and sovereigns across the world have in America's future, building a launchpad for the economy to take off through the second half of 2025. Through his bold actions on trade, the president is fighting to ensure Americans get a fair shake when doing business abroad.

Simultaneously, the administration's actions are empowering individuals and small businesses here at home. To that end, the secretary is leading the negotiations to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which recently passed in the House of Representatives. By advancing this legislation, Congress will make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, which stimulated billions of dollars in domestic investment while driving costs down, took unemployment rates to 50-year lows, and raised wages across the income spectrum.

This bill will also rejuvenate U.S. manufacturing by restoring 100% expensing and expanding it to new factory construction, which will strengthen our domestic supply chains as we look to onshore many of the necessary and critical products that were strained during the pandemic, while spurring new investment that will keep our economy at the forefront of global innovation. Expensing for equipment and factories will support forgotten communities across the country and expand high-skilled and high-paying jobs that the president has championed throughout his time in office.

And it will empower the working and middle class by codifying no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security.

Congress must now finalize this legislation because failing to do so would inflict enormous harm on workers. It would cost our economy 6 million jobs, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, and it would send tax rates skyrocketing for average people.

The third step in the Trump economic plan is to remove onerous regulations that have impeded access to capital and cost our economy trillions of dollars.

The weight of unnecessary regulation not only suffocates business growth and investment but also harms individuals. That's why the president has zeroed in on the costliest regulations of the Biden era. Recent executive actions to repeal Biden's administrative overreach will save the average family of four approximately $2,100.

PAUL SAYS ‘AT LEAST FOUR' REPUBLICANS OPPOSED TO TRUMP TAX BILL BUT INSISTS ‘I WANT TO VOTE FOR IT'

The cumulative effect of the president's economic agenda will be more jobs, better wages, and a higher quality of life for people across the country. Already, powerful evidence is emerging that the Trump economic plan is working. As a result, we have seen an additional 444,000 new private sector jobs in just the first few months of the second Trump presidency, inflation at four-year lows, and a 40-cent drop in gasoline prices over the past year.

Between the president's bold actions on trade and deregulation, the administration is unleashing the full might of the U.S. economy. Getting the One Big Beautiful Bill Act across the finish line is fundamental to fully realizing this effort. Congress should continue to work with the White House to put this bill on the president's desk in July. Working together, we will deliver on Trump's promises and give the people the robust economy they voted for.

In the wake of the terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) called for urgent action on gun control and a national reckoning with violent hatred and extremism.

The man suspected of carrying out the firebomb attack during a peaceful pro-Israel demonstration has been charged with a federal hate crime and numerous state-level offenses, including multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a crowd, injuring 12 people in what authorities are calling an “act of terrorism.”

Investigators say Soliman told them he had “researched on YouTube how to make Molotov cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them.” State court documents further reveal that Soliman had previously taken a concealed carry class in an effort to obtain a firearm, but resorted to using incendiary weapons after he was denied a gun purchase due to his lack of legal U.S. citizenship.

The attack, which targeted demonstrators marching in solidarity with hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, was reportedly accompanied by the assailant shouting “Free Palestine.” 

Raskin, a senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, appeared on MSNBC's The Weekend: Primetime on Sunday and called the attack a symptom of deeper national crises, including an epidemic of gun violence. He used the moment to press for long-standing Democratic priorities on gun policy reform.

“The safety of the people is the paramount imperative for government,” Raskin said. “People have the right to peacefully assemble, to exercise freedom of speech and religion. We've got to take whatever precautions we need to make sure that people can do that.”

He pointed to the Boulder incident as part of a broader national trend.

“Now we're seeing it in Colorado, but we've seen it across the country,” Raskin continued. “We are still in the midst of a gun violence epidemic. So we need to be acting with due concern for human life. I mean, this is why, of course, we have been fighting for universal, violent criminal background checks. We are for a ban on military-style assault weapons in the country. You know, our lax gun laws are a danger to everybody in America.”

TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' SPURS EARLY 2026 CAMPAIGN JABS

The MSNBC segment, hosted by Antonia Hylton, Catherine Rampell, and Ayman Mohyeldin, also touched on the global implications of rising antisemitism and politically motivated violence. Mohyeldin pressed Raskin on the connection between overseas conflicts, particularly the war in Gaza, and increasing domestic tensions.

“It's profoundly troubling to see all of these violent incidents taking place against the Jewish community,” Raskin responded. “We don't want wars to spill over and engulf everybody all over the world in violence.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump caught allies by surprise when he announced his decision over the weekend to withdraw billionaire commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman as his nominee for the next NASA administrator.

The Senate had been scheduled to vote on Isaacman's confirmation this week, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in April. But White House officials argue that Isaacman's past support for Democrats essentially tied the president's hands.

“The Administrator of NASA will help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump's bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars,” White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in a statement. “It's essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump's America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon.”

White House officials cited reporting from the Washington Examiner in January detailing Isaacman's more than $322,000 in donations to Democrats since 2010. That period included $100,000 donations to then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) super PAC in 2021 and more than $100,000 in donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2022 to 2024. Furthermore, White House officials cited Isaacman's ownership of a Russian MiG-29 fighter jet, potentially the only one privately owned in America, and his being a registered Democrat in Pennsylvania as justifications to withdraw his nomination.

Trump didn't specifically mention Isaacman's past donations while announcing his decision Saturday night.

“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA, I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Still, multiple Republican congressional staffers, all avowed supporters of the president, and aeronautical industry insiders say that growing tension between the recently departed Elon Musk, who had lobbied for Isaacman's nomination behind the scenes, and other senior members of the president's team contributed to the personnel decision.

Trump originally announced his plans to nominate Isaacman, buoyed by Musk's support, before entering office back in December of 2024. Two Senate GOP staffers told the Washington Examiner that the decision, made before the Trump team could stand up its Office of Presidential Personnel, cut short the vetting process for Isaacman and other possible NASA candidates.

Musk stepped down from his role as a special government employee on Friday, but not after running into conflict with Trump Cabinet officials regarding the slash-and-burn cuts to the federal workforce advocated by the Department of Government Efficiency. One senior aeronautical executive told the Washington Examiner that Office of Presidential Personnel Director Sergio Gor and other senior Trump advisers saw the Isaacman nomination as a means of settling the score with Musk.

“This was just a power play — the real people who are actually in charge of the White House letting Elon know, ‘we're running things,'” that person said.

White House officials vehemently denied that Musk's departure, and any conflict he had encountered with Trump's Cabinet, had factored into the president's decision on Isaacman. 

Both Senate GOP aides and aeronautical insiders floated retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Steven Kwast as the heir apparent to Isaacman.

Kwast, a decorated pilot and former commander of the Air Force's Education and Training Command in San Antonio, has steadily supported Trump and his push to launch both the Space Force in his first term and the Golden Dome missile defense system, which Trump announced in May.

Kwast has also said that space will emerge as a critical battlefield in future conflicts with China and has raised alarm bells about Beijing's plans to further develop “global reach” aircraft.

“China's plans to mature these hypersonic technologies is hardly a surprise. China is far ahead in developing and flying hypersonic weapons,” he co-wrote in a May op-ed published by Newsmax.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, himself a longtime proponent of American space dominance, told the Washington Examiner that he had not spoken to the president about his next choice to lead NASA but gave Kwast a full endorsement to fulfill that role if called upon.

THREE ISSUES ON WHICH TRUMP HAS DONE A TOTAL 180 COMPARED TO HIS FIRST TERM

“I have worked for years with Kwast. He was the brilliant head of the Air University. He is probably the most forward looking Air Force General I've ever worked with, and he would be an extraordinary leader at NASA,” he said Monday.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump boasted of the United States's stockpile of weapons while warning that Iran would not be allowed to enrich uranium, a major sticking point in negotiations.

Iranian nuclear negotiations appear to be losing momentum, with a senior Iranian official on the negotiating team telling Reuters that Tehran is poised to reject the latest U.S. offer. Trump vented his frustrations in a post on Truth Social, blaming former President Joe Biden's administration for the conundrum and contradicting reports that the U.S. would allow limited uranium enrichment.

“The AUTOPEN should have stopped Iran a long time ago from ‘enriching.' Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” he wrote.

He followed that post six minutes later with another about the U.S.'s military power:

“Just had a great talk with our Military Leaders. It is the strongest Military we have ever had, including the fact that we are stockpiling weapons at a rate never seen before by our Country. Hopefully, however, we will never have to use them!”

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly gave a new proposal to Tehran on Saturday, outlining “preliminary ideas” to be discussed at the sixth round of nuclear talks in the coming days, according to Axios. It allegedly contained details that contradict the public statements of Trump administration officials. Contrary to Trump and his administration's insistence, the deal allegedly allows limited low-level uranium enrichment within Iran.

Iran would halt new research and development of new centrifuges and “dismantle critical infrastructure for conversion and processing of uranium.”

US SUBMITS NUCLEAR DEAL PROPOSAL AFTER IRAN INCREASES URANIUM ENRICHMENT

“President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb. Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the Administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios in a statement.

Trump has balanced negotiations with saber-rattling, threatening Iran with military action if a deal couldn't be reached. Despite this, he has clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his push for military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Israel has readied a strike force to hit Iranian targets swiftly if talks fall through.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Leonard Leo, the architect of President Donald Trump's first-term legal legacy, is now at the center of a growing backlash from within Trump World — including from the president himself.

The attacks from Trump and his allies on Leo and the Federalist Society reflect rifts between the populist Right and the conservative legal establishment. They also underscore the high stakes of selecting judicial nominees during Trump's final term in office.

Trump launched an unusually personal attack last week on Federalist Society's co-chairman Leo, calling him a “sleazebag” and accusing the conservative legal network of giving him “bad advice” on judicial appointments. The comments, posted to Truth Social, came after the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled against Trump's tariff policies — a decision that set off a wave of public recriminations among Trump-aligned conservatives.

“I was new to Washington, and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges,” Trump wrote, referencing his reliance on then-Federalist Society Executive Vice President Leonard Leo's advice. “I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‘sleazebag' named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.”

Notably, the Federalist Society takes no specific policy positions or makes endorsements of judicial nominees publicly, though many lawyers from the influential legal network have gone on to be appointed to lifetime roles on the federal judiciary, and oftentimes current judges moderate panels at the group's events around the country.

Leo, whose claim to fame involved his recommendations to Trump to nominate Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett for lifetime Supreme Court seats, declined to escalate the dispute. 

“I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved,” he said. “There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.”

Legal scholars and former Justice Department officials say Trump's attacks on Leo and the Federalist Society stem from a deeper ideological divide on the Right.

Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law and a frequent figure at Federalist Society events, said he believes the new judicial nominations fight will take place between two factions on the Right versus the standard debates between Democrats and Republicans.

“In the past, the most vigorous clashes over judges happened between the left and the right. I think the next round of wars will be on the right,” he wrote for Volokh Conspiracy. “The left can sit back and enjoy the fireworks.”

Trump's recent broadside against Leo was sparked by a ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade that blocked his reciprocal tariff policy. That ruling has since been temporarily reversed by an appeals court.

Despite Trump's post last week, marking the harshest-worded attack on Leo since the pair's reported falling out in early 2024, the irony, according to some observers, is that Leo most likely had no involvement in the selection of the judge that ruled against his tariffs, nor would it have mattered.

As multiple legal analysts have pointed out, Judge Timothy Reif, the Trump-appointed member of the three-judge panel, was not a Leo pick. Reif was nominated as part of the court's bipartisan requirement and was recommended to Trump by then–U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former Democratic counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee.

“There's probably little or no legitimate reason for Donald Trump to blame Leonard Leo for Judge Reif and the loss in the tariffs case,” analyst David Lat wrote. “Even if Reif had voted the other way, Trump still would have lost, 2–1.”

While many of the details and context surrounding Trump and Leo's feud have not been publicly detailed, the public criticism the president has leveled at his former adviser stems from complaints about the way Trump's nominees have handled certain cases surrounding his executive actions. 

Earlier this year, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez found that Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans was unlawful. Weeks later, a separate Trump-appointed judge found the statute was lawfully invoked, ruling Trump met the requirements to say there is an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” on the United States.

Jack Goldsmith, former assistant attorney general under former President George W. Bush and now a professor at Harvard Law School, argued that Trump's frustration dates back even further, to his first term.

“The president was very frustrated … by lawyers inside the administration who were telling him he couldn't do certain things,” Goldsmith told former President Barack Obama's counsel Bob Bauer during a video conversation for their newsletter, Executive Functions. “He was extremely disappointed when the federal judiciary, including many judges he appointed … didn't go along with his election claims for the 2020 election.”

Since then, Trump and his allies have questioned not just the judges, but the legal philosophy that guided many of their appointments, Goldsmith argued.

“There's a genuine debate in the legal academy, within the conservative movement … about whether originalism is the right approach,” Goldsmith said. “What's different about Trump 2.0 criticisms is it's far to the right of the traditional conservative legal movement and its commitment to originalism and textualism,” he said, contrasting Trump's views with those of conservative judicial advocates such as the late Justice Antonin Scalia or former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Now, “it's grounded in a vision of what the proper outcomes in the federal judiciary are,” Goldsmith said.

Not everyone agrees with Goldsmith's diagnosis, however. Robert Luther III, a professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School and former White House associate counsel who helped oversee judicial selection under Trump's first-term, told the Washington Examiner last month that Trump's handful of nominees have thus far not drifted far from what Leo aimed to accomplish with his guidance in the president's first term.

“Nobody that actually knows what they're talking about has ever taken the position that the judges are going to be materially different this time,” Luther said, noting Trump's nomination of Tennessee Attorney General's office lawyer Whitney Hermandorfer to the 4th Circuit “looks just like the kind of person we would have picked.”

“If the same people were there this time, we would have picked her,” Luther said, referring to Trump's first-term advisers.

Trump's escalating rhetoric, including calling Leo a “sleazebag” and saying the Federalist Society “gave me… bad advice” on judicial nominations, has drawn rebukes from figures who once praised his first-term court picks.

UC-Berkeley law professor John Yoo told the New York Times that Trump was “basically turning his back on one of his biggest achievements of his first term.” John Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation told Bloomberg Law the president was “needlessly offending an ally.”

Ed Whelan, a conservative legal commentator and frequent Trump critic, warned on X that Trump's new approach might backfire. “Just yesterday, a very conservative appellate judge told me that s/he wouldn't take senior status because of concerns over who would be picked as successor,” Whelan claimed.

Just yesterday, a very conservative appellate judge told me that s/he wouldn't take senior status because of concerns over who would be picked as successor. https://t.co/VrtS0TJgo8

Whelan's anecdote correlates with a theory posited in a recent academic study published last year, which found that judicial nominees' ideologies influence retirement decisions for judges currently considering whether to end their life tenure on the federal bench.

“Why might this matter?” Case Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Adler rhetorically asked in a blog post for the legal blog Volokh Conspiracy. “At this moment there are 22 circuit court judges who were appointed by Republican Presidents who are eligible for senior status but have not yet announced any intention to step down, as well as 42 district court judges.”

For Adler, this suggests that if the White House wants to make Trump's nomination process as influential as last time, “it should seek to appoint the sort of judges that are likely to instill confidence in judges who are eligible to take senior status, particularly in the beginning.”

At the same time, voices aligned with Trump have gone on offense. 

Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project, accused Leo of building wealth for himself while refusing to help Trump during the years he faced prosecutions from Democratic district attorneys and federal prosecutors.

“Leonard sat on the sidelines with all that money for three years of lawfare and didn't support groups that were helping President Trump,” Davis said on Steve Bannon's War Room Friday.

“You would think that after you've gotten very wealthy off of President Trump, you could at least give President Trump the loyalty of keeping your mouth shut,” Davis added.

With Leo sidelined, Trump's judicial nominations are now being shaped by a tighter circle of aides and outside activists. Inside the White House, that includes chief of staff Susie Wiles, counsel Dave Warrington, and deputy counsel Steve Kenny. 

Outside, Davis's Article III Project is gaining influence, including in the recommendation of nominees like Hermandorfer, who clerked for Justices Samuel Alito and Barrett and was confirmed as Trump's first appellate nominee of the term. 

Goldsmith pointed to the nomination of Emil Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer and current Principal Deputy Attorney General, to the Third Circuit as emblematic of the shift.

“[Bove] has proven himself … as starting with representing Trump … and certainly with his actions in the Justice Department, he has proven himself to be a thoroughly credible loyalist,” Goldsmith said. “This is someone with a track record of complete loyalty to the President and in executing the President's will.”

However, the Senate's treatment of Bove's nomination “is going to be a real moment to see whether Trump is going to be able to change the composition of the federal judiciary the way he wants,” Goldsmith added.

A NEW TEAM GUIDES TRUMP 2.0 AS HE BEGINS TO FILL JUDICIAL VACANCIES

While many see stark differences between Trump's first and second term judicial selections, Trump's first-term defenders, such as Luther, say that the jurisprudence and ideology of nominees such as Bove and some of Trump's most recognizable first-term picks go hand in hand.

“Even before President Trump was re-elected I said that this term candidates for the most coveted judgeships will likely need to have demonstrated some form of public support for the President or his policies,” Luther told the Washington Examiner last week, noting “there is nothing wrong with that,” and that judicial nominees throughout history have more frequently shared “some connection” to the presidents that nominate them.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A lot happens under this administration, but a lot un-happens, too.

A useful one-sentence guide to the second Trump administration might go something like this: A lot happens under Donald Trump, but a lot un-happens, too.

In the past four months, President Trump has announced tariffs on Canada, paused tariffs on Canada, restarted tariffs on Canada, ruled out tariffs on certain Canadian goods, and then ruled in, and even raised, tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.

And that's just for starters. On April 2, so-called Liberation Day, Trump announced a broader set of tariffs on almost every country in the world. Soon after, the plan was half-suspended. Then Trump announced a new set of elevated tariffs on China, from which he backtracked as well. Next the courts, as often happens, took over the job of erasing the president's previously announced policies. Last week, a trade court struck down the president's entire Liberation Day tariff regime as unconstitutional, only for a federal circuit court to reinstate the tariffs shortly thereafter. Now a higher court has the opportunity to do the funniest thing: undo the undoing of the undoing of the tariffs, which have been in a permanent state of being undone ever since they were created.

Got all that? No, you most certainly do not, and neither does anybody else. Economists and corporate executives I've interviewed to understand future tariff policy have communicated to me a combination of confusion, fury, and resignation. Commentators have noticed the chaos too, of course. Observing how frequently Trump seems to back out of his own brinkmanship, the Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong memorably deemed this trend TACO, or “Trump Always Chickens Out.”

David A. Graham: The TACO presidency

Un-happening doesn't affect just trade and economic policy. In the realm of foreign policy, the Trump administration paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine after the ignominious on-camera spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Vice President J. D. Vance. Trump went further, claiming that Ukraine had started the war and that Zelensky was a dictator—raising the prospect that the administration was on the verge of explicitly aligning with Russia. Days later, the administration reversed course and resumed intelligence sharing and security assistance. Trump has since attacked Russian President Vladimir Putin for being “absolutely CRAZY!”

Un-happening also affects media, immigration, science, and education policy. Judges have ruled that the administration improperly froze grant money, inappropriately blocked the Associated Press from the White House press pool, and illegally sought to place sanctions on law firms that have done work, or employed lawyers, that Trump found unsuitable. On immigration, judges have blocked several of the administration's measures, including its invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants and its attempt to bar Harvard's international students. Federal judges have blocked so much of the Trump agenda that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has described the constitutional balance of power as a form of “judicial tyranny.” “I know this is inflammatory,” Vance said in an interview with The New York Times, “but I think you are seeing an effort by the courts to quite literally overturn the will of the American people.”

The administration's claims to monarchical power are a real threat to America's constitutional order. But its executive orders and policy feints are so haphazard and poorly articulated that they amount to a kind of autocratic takeover written in smudge-able crayon: terrifying, cartoonish, and vulnerable to erasure, all at once.

J. Michael Luttig: The end of rule of law in America

This is not to say that Americans should ignore Trump's efforts to make confetti of the Constitution. Rather, when evaluating any one Trump policy, one has to keep front of mind the possibility that it simply won't exist by the end of the week. Despite an energetic effort by some right-wing intellectuals to make Trump out to be some kind of 14-dimensional-chess player, his approach doesn't resemble chess so much as a denial-of-service attack on a functioning government.

All this un-happening shows both the upside and the downside of Trump's political instincts. The president's slippery relationship to his own policy agenda can serve as a kind of superpower, as Ross Douthat wrote in The New York Times. The TACO reputation is “crucial to Trump's political resilience,” because “the willingness to swerve and backpedal and contradict himself is a big part of what keeps the president viable.” The constant backtracking gives Trump the ability to both bend the Constitution to its breaking point and always step back to claim that “anything extreme is also provisional,” Douthat wrote. Indeed, Trump's approval rating for trade has rebounded since its Liberation Day implosion, according to several polls.

Questions of popularity aside, however, businesses tend to prefer certainty over promises and threats that keep disappearing. At some point, Trump's pledge to reinvigorate American industry and energy will require fat investments in factories and supply chains. Multi-hundred-million-dollar investments require clear expectations of financial return. Those aren't going to happen in a world where each policy idea boasts a half-life of 48 hours. Steve Bannon coined one of the most famous Trump-world truisms when he revealed MAGA's media strategy to “flood the zone with shit.” Far stranger, however, is the administration's insistence on flooding the policy zone with Schrödinger's cats—executive orders and Truth Social posts that exist in a liminal state among existence, nonexistence, and imminent radioactive decay.

The substantive problem with the MAGA agenda isn't just that too much is happening for any median voter to follow; it's that too much is un-happening for employers, investors, and consumers to know what the hell to do about it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","A Food Reckoning Is Coming","https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/06/climate-food-land-problem/683005/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

Our diets are awful for the planet. But we can't quit food.

Imagine that humanity quit fossil fuels. Think of our entire Ozymandian blob of a global economy running on clean energy instead of ancient heat-trapping hydrocarbons—more than 1 billion vehicles, 2 billion homes, every school, mall, skyscraper, data center, airport, seaport, factory, and cryptocurrency on Earth. No more gas stoves, gas stations, or gas-fired power plants. No more petrochemicals, petrostates, or petroleum jelly.



Even as a thought experiment, it's almost unimaginable. Fossil energy is so ubiquitous, so useful, so entrenched. The president of the United States is shredding regulations to get Americans to produce and consume even more of it. But radical change always seems unimaginable before it happens, and in recent years, the absurd fantasy of fossil-free energy has gotten a bit less absurd. America's coal power has declined by more than half since 2010, while wind power has more than tripled, solar capacity has expanded fortyfold, and more than 4 million electric vehicles have appeared on the road. Globally, most new electricity is zero emissions, because clean is now usually cheaper than dirty. Fossil fuels still energize most of the planet, so the transition away from them will take years, but it has begun, and Donald Trump can't stop it. We can now start to see how the fossil-fuel story will end, even if we don't know when it will end.



The thing is, fossil fuels are only two-thirds of the climate problem. Even if we do quit them, we'll never meet the emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement without addressing the other third. The challenge is food: what we eat, how we produce it, and the forests and other natural ecosystems we keep clearing to make room for more farms to make more food. And that's mostly a land story about the relentless spread of crops and pastures that already cover two of every five acres of land on Earth, obliterating the wild landscapes that soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We have no idea how or when that story will end.



Humanity's dominion over the Earth isn't really about the spread of cities and towns, highways and driveways, industry and commerce. It's about farming. Of all the planet's land that isn't ice or desert, barely 1 percent is developed. Half is cropped or grazed. Urban sprawl is a rounding error compared with agricultural sprawl. Look out the window on a cross-country flight: The land people use to live, learn, work, and play is dwarfed by the land used to make food.



Agriculture's footprint is already larger than Asia, and the more it expands, the more nature's footprint shrinks, expelling the carbon stored in its soils and vegetation into the overheated atmosphere. Somehow, we'll need to get the limited land on our hot and hungry planet to produce much more food to sustain us and absorb much more carbon to save us, because it will be impossible to decarbonize the atmosphere if we keep vaporizing trees. It's like trying to clean the house while smashing the vacuum cleaner to bits in the living room. And not only is the conversion of natural land into farmland and rangeland the leading driver of deforestation; agriculture is responsible for much of the world's water shortages, water pollution, wetland destruction, and biodiversity loss. It's propelling the worst extinction since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.



Oh, and unlike the fossil-fuel problem, this land problem is getting worse. That's partly because the number of people on Earth increases every day, while the amount of land on Earth does not. But it's also because those people are eating more meat, which means not only more methane emissions from cow burps and manure, but the use of more land to grow grass and grain for animals to eat before we eat them. More than three-quarters of the world's agricultural land now supports livestock. In the U.S., nearly half that land is used to produce beef, which provides just 3 percent of U.S. calories.



In other words, we're eating the Earth. Agriculture is essential because food isn't optional, but the planet can't keep losing a soccer field's worth of tropical forest every six seconds. If current trends hold, the world's farmers will have to clear at least a dozen more Californias' worth of land to fill nearly 10 billion human bellies by 2050. That could wipe out the Amazon rainforest and other natural carbon storehouses that are not only refuges for wildlife but our best defense against climate chaos. The math is daunting: Global agricultural production will need to expand about 50 percent by 2050—the caloric equivalent of a dozen extra Olive Garden breadsticks every day for everyone alive today—while the global agricultural footprint needs to shrink.

Producing enough calories to nourish our growing population without chewing up the carbon sinks that stabilize our warming climate will be as monumental a challenge as ending oil. The rich world will need to eat less beef and more plants, while the entire world will need to produce more food with less land. That's going to get even harder as climate-driven droughts, floods, heat waves, and pest infestations drag down crop and livestock yields.



The good news is that remarkable people are working on this eating-the-Earth problem, and their work can be antidotes to climate fatalism. They're reengineering soybean plants to grow dairy proteins, developing feed additives to help cattle burp less methane, restoring carbon-rich peatlands, upcycling food waste into snacks, and even improving the miracle of photosynthesis. They're growing superefficient salmon in indoor tanks, superefficient trees on barren land, and superefficient crops genetically manipulated to survive droughts and floods. They're inventing bio-fertilizers that train microbes to fetch nutrients from the air and biopesticides that use RNA technology to constipate beetles to death. John Deere is preparing to roll out its first electric tractors—in green, naturally.



But food and climate solutions are still about a quarter century behind energy and climate solutions. Less than 4 percent of the world's climate finance is flowing into the land sector, much of it toward farm-grown biofuels and low-yield agricultural approaches that would induce even more deforestation and emissions. There's a strange consensus among hippie-foodie lefties who read Michael Pollan, all-natural biohacker bros who listen to Joe Rogan, and executives who run major agribusinesses and philanthropies that the answer lies in kinder and gentler alternatives to industrial farming. But the truth is that organic and grass-fed are usually worse for the climate than conventional and feedlot-finished—mainly because they're less productive and more land-intensive. Meanwhile, all public agricultural research and development focused on the climate in the U.S. is a fraction of Apple's R&D, as if farming weren't nearly as important as a better iPhone camera.

Although the fossil-fuel problem is now a mostly political story because we basically know what we need to do, the eating-the-Earth problem is still an analytical story. We haven't yet figured out what we need to do. But we know it won't be easy. Making more food with less land will require new crops, new foods, new policies, and new behaviors—and they won't be invented, approved, and adopted worldwide overnight. We'll have to make personal and political changes as unimaginable as quitting fossil fuels, and we can't quit food. Feeding the world without frying it is another absurd fantasy that eventually needs to become reality.

The speculative guesswork distracts from the all-too-ordinary issues at the center of his case.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Over the past year and a half, I've kept finding myself in unexpected conversations about Diddy. Cab drivers, deli cooks, and far-flung uncles have all wanted to chat about the 55-year-old rapper who's now on trial for charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transportation to engage in prostitution. There is, certainly, plenty to talk about: Federal prosecutors allege that the media mogul liked to throw baby-oil-slicked orgies—called “freak-offs”—where abuse and exploitation regularly occurred. (He pleaded not guilty; his lawyers say he never coerced anyone into anything.) But the conversations tend to be less about Sean “Diddy” Combs than about playing a guessing game: Who else was involved?

Some of the people I've spoken with had theories about Justin Bieber, citing rumors suggesting that the singer—a teenage protégé of Diddy's—had been preyed upon (“Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims,” Bieber's representative said in a statement last month). Others speculated that the Democratic Party, whose candidates Combs has campaigned for over the years, was in some way implicated in the case. Most of them agreed that Diddy was comparable to Jeffrey Epstein in that he was probably at the hub of a celebrity sex-crime ring.

Since the trial began a few weeks ago, it's become clear what these conversations were: distractions from the bleak, all-too-ordinary issues that this case is really about.

The wild nature of the conspiracist narratives surrounding Combs can't be understated. In January, social-media users wondered if the fires that swept through glitzy L.A. neighborhoods were meant to destroy evidence pointing to the participation of other celebrities. On Amazon last year, sales spiked for a salacious memoir purportedly written by the rapper's late girlfriend, Kimberly Porter, and published by a self-described investigative journalist using the pseudonym Jamal T. Millwood—the latter being the supposed alias that Tupac used after he, according to legend, faked his death. (Amazon pulled the book from its offerings after Porter's family lambasted it as a forgery.) One viral fake news story, based on no evidence at all, said that Will Smith had sold one of his children into Combs's servitude. On Truth Social last fall, Donald Trump himself shared a meme featuring a fabricated image of Kamala Harris and Diddy, with text reading, “Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?”

The media also stoked the fervor. A former bodyguard of Combs's gave an interview for a TMZ documentary saying that politicians, princes, and preachers were mixed up in the rapper's debauchery. The conservative influencer Charlie Kirk devoted a portion of one webcast to wondering, “Maybe P. Diddy has footage of Barack Obama doing something he shouldn't have been doing?” Piers Morgan hosted a singer, Jaguar Wright, who insinuated that Jay-Z and Beyoncé had committed crimes much like the ones Diddy is charged with. After those stars issued a vigorous denial and threatened to sue, Morgan apologized and edited any mention of them out of the interview online—and then, in February, retired General Michael Flynn presented Wright with a “Defender of Freedom Award” at Mar-a-Lago.

A few actual facts underlay all of this QAnon-esque speculation. For more than a decade, Combs's legendary White Parties attracted a medley of stars to the Hamptons, Los Angeles, and Saint-Tropez. Attendees often joked publicly about how rowdy the festivities could get. Over the past year or so, dozens of people—an array of musicians, workers, models, and others who have crossed paths with him since the 1990s—have sued Combs for a variety of offenses (all of which he denies), and some of those suits have alluded to alleged misdeeds by other celebrities. (One lawsuit naming Jay-Z was dropped after the star denied the claim; he has since countersued for defamation.)

Still, the speed and sheer giddiness with which conspiracist thinking eclipsed the known details of Combs's case confirmed a few bleak realities about the psyche of a country in which economic inequality and sexual abuse are both stubbornly endemic. A whole class of politicians, commentators, and media platforms exist to exploit the resentments that everyday people hold toward the rich and famous. Meanwhile, rates of sexual harassment and assault—reportedly experienced by 82 percent of women and 42 percent of men in the United States in their lifetime—remain as high as they were when the #MeToo movement erupted in 2017. Examining the real reasons for this is less fun—and, for many, less profitable—than imagining that Hollywood is a front for ritualistic sadism.

The trial itself, which began in Manhattan on May 12, has not yet revealed a network of super-famous evildoers. Although the testimony has surfaced vivid and bizarre details about the rarefied lives of celebrities, it's also told an intimate, human, oddly familiar story about how power can warp relationships in all sorts of ways. I realized that in the random conversations I'd had leading up to the trial, I'd heard a lot about the imagined villains, and very little about the people they were said to have hurt.

Combs's downfall in the public eye began in November 2023, when an ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, filed a lawsuit alleging that he had raped and physically abused her. The suit was settled one day later out of court, but many of its details are resurfacing now. Although the federal trial against Combs is expected to last at least eight weeks and feature dozens of witnesses, Diddy and Ventura's relationship has been central to the testimony. Prosecutors say Combs ran an organized criminal enterprise that served, in part, to assist in and cover up this one woman's subjugation.

Ventura, now 38, was a 19-year-old aspiring R&B singer when she met Combs around 2005. He'd heard her first-ever single, “Me & U”; it would become a hit, but Diddy promised that he could guide her to a career of lasting success. He signed her to a 10-album deal with his label, Bad Boy Records, and released her debut album in 2006. It is still her only album to ever come out.

Their relationship soon evolved from professional to romantic. The singer said she'd initially rejected the rapper's advances but that she'd felt pressured to do what he wanted because her career was largely in his hands. He also reportedly provided her with gifts, threatened her with punishment, and supplied her with drugs until she felt he controlled her life. She said that he then used that control liberally, dictating what she wore, whom she socialized with, which medications she took.

He also beat her. Hotel security-camera footage from 2016 published by CNN last year—and used as evidence in the trial—showed Combs chasing Ventura down a hallway, throwing her to the ground, kicking her, and pulling her by her sweatshirt. The video is a small and terrible glimpse into their relationship. Diddy is in a towel and clearly furious; Ventura, starkly alone, makes no effort to defend herself. “My behavior on that video is inexcusable,” Combs said in a filmed mea culpa last year; during the trial, his lawyers have acknowledged that he was violent toward her.

Other witnesses in the trial have testified that the hotel assault was not an isolated incident. One former assistant, Capricorn Clark, reported seeing Combs repeatedly kick Ventura after learning that she'd been romantically involved with the rapper Kid Cudi. Another former assistant, George Kaplan, described a 2015 altercation between Combs and Ventura on Diddy's private jet. He heard the sound of breaking glass in a private area, where he then saw Combs standing and holding a whiskey glass over Ventura, who was on her back. According to Kaplan, Ventura screamed, “Isn't anybody seeing this?” No one on the plane intervened, Kaplan said.

The now-notorious freak-offs allegedly occurred against this backdrop of violence and intimidation. Ventura's lawsuit said that toward the beginning of Combs and Ventura's relationship, Combs hired a man to have sex with Ventura while Diddy watched. Encounters like that, involving sex workers and drugs, became regular occurrences that could last for days at a time. The freak-offs were, prosecutors say, “performances” for Combs's pleasure. And they affected the performers; Ventura testified to having medical problems, mental-health issues, and drug addiction as a result of them.

Combs's defense argues that Ventura willingly participated in these events. His lawyers have cited text messages in which she appears to express enthusiasm: “I'm always ready to freak off,” she wrote to him in August 2009. Other texts suggest a more complicated picture—in 2017, Ventura wrote, “I love our FOs when we both want it.” She and prosecutors assert that whenever she tried to resist Combs's commands, he would bring her to heel with physical violence and threats of blackmail and financial harm. Ventura's lawsuit alleged that when she tried to break up with him for good in 2018, he raped her in her home (an accusation that Diddy's defense has concertedly pushed back on during the trial).

Ventura is not the only alleged victim of Combs's. His employees have shared particularly disturbing stories: Clark said that Combs kidnapped her twice; a former assistant identified as Mia testified last week that the rapper repeatedly sexually assaulted her. (Diddy's lawyers dispute that the kidnappings ever happened and have questioned Mia's credibility.) Prosecutors are pursuing racketeering charges on the theory that Combs didn't act alone: For example, they say he may have had someone set Kid Cudi's car on fire (the defense denies Combs's involvement in that arson). In this way, Diddy's case is also a story about what happens when it's easier to take the check and not ask too many questions.

But fundamentally, the trial is another highly public test of the definition of consent. It recalls the prosecutions of Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer who allegedly dangled job prospects to women interested in the film industry in exchange for sex (one of his convictions was overturned last year and is being retried now). It also evokes R. Kelly, the musician who wooed aspiring singers with promises of career help and then violently kept them—and other women—in sexual servitude (behavior for which he is currently serving 31 years in prison).

And the issues here transcend celebrity. When #MeToo erupted eight years ago, it forced many everyday Americans to reexamine experiences they'd had in their workplaces and homes. The movement has, by many indications, petered out or even curdled into backlash: Yesterday, one of Diddy's lawyers asked Mia whether she was looking for a “Me Too money grab,” which suggests he thinks the very words Me Too might be tinged for some jury members. But to sit with the allegations against Combs—and the experiences of the alleged victims—is to again be confronted with the underlying reasons that movement happened. It's to be confronted with the intolerable things that happen when men are given the power to pursue their desires however they want, and to extract whatever they want from their underlings.

A lot of people would evidently prefer to turn away from that confrontation—and to focus on fantasy. Since I started paying attention to the case, my YouTube algorithm has become polluted by videos with AI-generated courtroom sketches of stars such as Will Smith and Jay-Z, paired with totally imaginary testimony about their involvement in Combs's crimes. The videos are yet another sign that our society is losing any shared sense of reality. They do, however, have disclaimers stipulating that they are fiction, which raises the question: Why is this the story someone wants to hear?

Perhaps because tales of demonic Hollywood cabals offer a simple, clear-cut narrative that doesn't ask us to reflect on how domestic violence and sexual coercion really get perpetuated—and perhaps because that narrative benefits certain agendas. Last month, I tuned in to Asmongold, a popular Twitch streamer who interprets the daily news for a large audience of young, often aggrieved men. He had a glazed look in his eyes as TV news footage related to the trial played on his screen. Then he said, “I don't care about this case at all—until Diddy starts naming names.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Unable to defend their health-care cuts on the merits, congressional Republicans have pivoted to magical thinking.

Congressional Republicans claim to have achieved something truly miraculous. Their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, they argue, would cut nearly $800 billion from Medicaid spending over 10 years without causing any Americans to lose health care—or, at least, without making anyone who loses health care worse off.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, by imposing Medicaid work requirements, the bill would eventually increase the uninsured population by at least 8.6 million. At first, Republican officials tried to defend this outcome on the grounds that it would affect only lazy people who refuse to work. This is clearly untrue, however. As voluminous research literature shows, work requirements achieve savings by implementing burdensome paperwork obligations that mostly take Medicaid from eligible beneficiaries, not 25-year-old guys who prefer playing video games to getting a job.

Perhaps for that reason, some Republicans in Washington are now making even more audacious claims. On CNN over the weekend, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought insisted that “no one will lose coverage as a result of this bill.” Likewise, Joni Ernst, a Republican senator from Iowa, recently told voters at a town hall, “Everyone says that Medicaid is being cut, people are going to see their benefits cut; that's not true.” After one attendee shouted, “People will die,” Ernst replied, “We all are going to die,” and later doubled down on her comment on social media, attempting to equate concern that Medicaid cuts could harm people with believing in the tooth fairy.

Officials such as Vought and Ernst have not provided a detailed explanation of their blithe assurances. But there is one center of conservative thought that has attempted to defend these claims: the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Last week, it published an editorial headlined “The Medicaid Scare Campaign.” The thesis is that the Medicaid cuts would “improve healthcare by expanding private insurance options, which provide better access and health outcomes than Medicaid.”

This would be, as they say, huge if true: The GOP has found a way to give low-income Americans better health care while saving hundreds of billions in taxpayer money. The timing is even more remarkable, given that this wondrous solution has come along at precisely the moment when congressional Republicans are desperate for budget savings to partially offset the costs of a regressive and fiscally irresponsible tax cut.

Sadly, a close reading of The Wall Street Journal's editorial reveals that no such miracle is in the offing. Instead, the argument relies on a series of misunderstandings and non sequiturs to obscure the obvious fact that cutting Medicaid would make poor people sicker and more likely to die.

Jonathan Chait: The cynical Republican plan to cut Medicaid

The editorial begins by acknowledging a recent study's conclusion that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act reduced mortality by 2.5 percent among low-income American adults. This would imply that taking Medicaid away from people would cause many of them to die. Not so fast, the editorial insists: “The 2.5% difference in mortality for low-income adults between the expansion and non-expansion states wasn't statistically significant when disabled adults were included.”

The implication is that the lifesaving effect of the Medicaid expansion disappears if you include disabled adults. In fact, Bruce Meyer, a University of Chicago economist and a co-author of the study, told me that the reason the study excluded disabled adults is that they were already eligible for public health insurance before the expansion. The way to measure the effect of a change is to focus on the population that was treated to the change. So either the Wall Street Journal editorial board is misleading its audience intentionally or it does not understand statistics. (Decades of Journal editorials provide ample grounds for both explanations.)

The editorial then suggests that Obamacare has not overcome other social factors that are causing people to die: “What's clear is that the ObamaCare expansion hasn't reduced deaths among lower-income, able-bodied adults. U.S. life expectancy remains about the same as it was in 2014 owing largely to increased deaths among such adults from drug overdoses and chronic diseases.”

This passage, like the previous one, is intended to sound like a claim that giving people access to medical care does not reduce their likelihood of suffering a premature death. But that is not really what it's saying. The editorial is merely noting that the drug epidemic and other factors worked against the effects of the Medicaid expansion. Presumably, if the government had started throwing people off their health insurance at the same time that the drug-overdose epidemic was surging, then life expectancy would have gotten even worse.

The article goes on to explain that Medicaid reimburses doctors and hospitals at a lower rate than private insurance does. That is absolutely correct: In the United States, Medicaid is the cheapest existing way to give people access to medical care. The editorial laments that Medicaid recipients have worse outcomes than people on private insurance do. But the Republican plan isn't to put Medicaid recipients on private insurance, which would cost money. The plan is to take away even their extremely cheap insurance and leave them with nothing. (Well, not nothing: The editorial notes that the bill would double “the health-savings account contribution limit to $17,100 from $8,550 for families earning up to $150,000.” For reference, in most states, a four-person household must earn less than $45,000 a year to be eligible for Medicaid.)

Finally, the editorial asserts, “The GOP bill is unlikely to cause many Americans to lose Medicaid coverage.” Here is where I would analyze the editorial's support for this remarkable claim, but there is none. The sentence just floats by itself in a sea of text that bears no relationship to it.

Indeed, the editorial doesn't even attempt to explain why the official Congressional Budget Office estimate is dramatically wrong. Nor does it engage with the mountain of evidence showing that people who obtain Medicaid coverage tend, naturally enough, to be better off as a result. The near-universal belief that being able to see a doctor and buy medicine makes you healthier is the kind of presumption that would take extraordinary evidence to refute. The Wall Street Journal editorial offers none at all.

Advocates of the House bill have cultivated an aura of condescension toward anybody who states its plain implications. But even the most detailed attempt to substantiate their position consists entirely of deflections and half-truths. If this is the best case that can be made for worrying about the GOP's plan for Medicaid, then Americans should be worried indeed.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Susan Choi's new book, Flashlight, considers the evolution of rage.

Following up on a profoundly angry book that made her a literary star is the daunting challenge Susan Choi faces with Flashlight, her sixth novel. Its predecessor, Trust Exercise (2019), broke out in a way that her earlier fiction, though well received, hadn't. The success of the book, a formally inventive story about a popular teacher sexually abusing a student at an elite arts school in the 1980s, may have had to do with its timeliness—it appeared at the height of the #MeToo movement—but certainly stemmed from its fierceness. One of its three narrators, Karen, incarnates its fury. In her section, the novel's best, rage crackles from every controlled, precise line.

For Karen's author, such rage was a real departure. The characters in Choi's previous fiction tend to treat anger as an unwelcome guest. They repress it, relegating it to the realm of the unacknowledged in hopes that there, it might shrivel and die. Regina, the narrator of My Education (2013), reveals in one seething passage that she was raped four years before the novel begins—a memory that shifts the story—but Choi relates the assault in such a rushed, muddled way that even comprehending what happened takes two readings. The question of what violent feelings Regina might harbor, Choi quite consciously leaves unexplored.

Read: Trust Exercise is an elaborate trick of a novel

The leap from Regina to Karen might seem colossal, but Choi told The Guardian that the 2016 election led her to the latter's creation. “Karen came from feeling so angry all the time. I specifically felt as though someone had taken a story that was my story—the story of my country, my origins. I'm the daughter of an immigrant, I'm the granddaughter of immigrants, I've always been so proud of that.” Trust Exercise isn't about immigration, but Choi's comment conveyed the broad sense of betrayal that underlies Karen's anger at her abuser and his admirers. It also, perhaps, foreshadowed Flashlight, which is about immigration on a global scale.

Some of Choi's earlier novels feature characters who have immigrated to the United States, but those books all begin after the move. Flashlight, by contrast, follows a family as its members migrate, variously, from Korea to Japan, Japan to North Korea, Japan to the United States, and—in some cases—back, each seeking what's generally seen as a very American freedom: the right to learn about, and become, their truest selves in a new home. By telling this story on an ambitious new historical and geographical canvas, Choi not only detaches this quest from any one nation, but makes mobility her theme. In doing so, she has found a very different way to handle anger. No longer an unwanted intrusion or the dominant mood, it has become a tunnel that her characters travel through, a long and dark but inescapable part of getting somewhere they need to go.

Choi gives her three protagonists—Serk, a professor at a midwestern college; Anne, his wife; and Louisa, their daughter—many reasons to be angry. Serk's trace back to his childhood. Born in Japan during World War II to Korean parents who'd emigrated from their colonized homeland in search of opportunity, he's devastated, at age 6, by the loss of “his belief in his Japaneseness.” (On learning he's Korean, he says to his mother, “But what are Koreans?”) He dreams of assimilation while his family's devotion to Korea's communist cause grows in response not just to Japanese discrimination, but also to the U.S.-backed South Korean army's massacre of civilians on the parents' home island of Jeju. Eventually, Serk's parents and most of his siblings move to North Korea. Serk won't go. Alone in Tokyo, he tries to stifle his resentment at the prejudice that drove his family away, telling himself that sometimes

the unjustly downtrodden took up arms and fierce miens, but equally often they turned the other cheek, studied harder, camouflaged themselves ever more behind obedience and merit and bided their time, believing against all evidence that the future would bring something better, for them if for nobody else. He tried to be the second kind of ruined person.

Materially speaking, Serk's strategy largely works. Though he can't assimilate, he succeeds well enough academically to emigrate and get a professorship. But emotionally, his efforts take a toll. As Flashlight progresses, Choi shows Serk's transformation into a glacial spouse, a jittery parent, a person so afraid of his anger that when he feels it, he gets angrier still. Such men aren't new in her writing: Serk shares these traits with Lee, the protagonist of A Person of Interest (2008), but Choi never calls on Lee to spend time alone with his emotions. Serk has to—though only after he is, shockingly, kidnapped from a Japanese beach by North Koreans while teaching in Japan for a semester.

Such abductions really did happen from 1977 to 1983, which North Korea acknowledged only in 2002. Little is known about most kidnapping victims' fates, but Choi imagines years of horror for Serk and grief for Louisa and Anne, who think he's dead. Choi lets the reader in on his survival through Flashlight's nonlinear structure, which may be, if not the most experimental way she's told a story, the trickiest approach she's taken. She weaves back and forth in time, frequently shifting her focus from one character to another. This allows her to hide some secrets from her readers, some from her characters, and some from both. Only the omniscient narrator knows what's going on: Everyone else is at sea, and furious about it.

But nobody in Flashlight stays mad, no matter how complex or layered their anger may be. In captivity, Serk has no choice but to sit still with his anger—not only at his jailers, who force him to teach them Japanese, but at the Japanese discrimination that marked his childhood and his family's lives. In the process, he finds that he can allow the emotion to wane—and that, when he does, it's replaced by others, such as love for his daughter, that help him survive. An ocean away, Anne makes a similar discovery. She gets diagnosed with multiple sclerosis not long after she concludes that Serk has drowned, and is understandably bitter at fate for visiting these ordeals upon her. Yet she discovers that holding on to an anger aimed at such a large, unreachable target is less satisfying than letting it go. Louisa is livid at losing both her father and the healthy version of her mother. Though she travels through her anger more slowly, she shares her parents' capacity to let it evolve and diminish. Choi has never written about that process before. For the first time in her career, she shows herself interested above all in anger's impermanence—and in the emotions that occupy the hole it leaves once it's gone.

In the same way that Trust Exercise has Karen as its incarnation of anger, Flashlight has an incarnation of anger's absence. In Anne's youth, before she met Serk, she had a son, Tobias, custody of whom she ceded to his older, married father. Years later, he reenters her life, initially as a teenager consumed by rage that turns out to be the effect of a brain tumor, and then, post-surgery, as a preternaturally placid drifter, a young man given to “floating through the world like a mote.” Tobias is Flashlight's court fool, a source of chaos, comedy, and pathos. He can't fully take care of himself, which worries Anne and aggravates Louisa. It also reminds the reader that if anger can grow stagnant, so can its absence. The capacity to get mad, to rise to provocation, and to strike out against insult is not just a good thing but a goad to growth. On that front, Choi's perspective hasn't changed since Trust Exercise.

What has changed is her prose. The critic Ron Charles said of her in 2013 that “few other writers alive today make their sentences work so hard.” Before Trust Exercise, her writing was carefully balanced, sinuously elegant yet never showy. And then she swerved, compacting her sentences to convey anger, as in Karen's blunt summation of her non-relationship with the mother who failed to protect her: “When I visit my brother, he doesn't tell our mother I'm coming. When he visits me, he doesn't tell her he's going. He pretends that he's traveling on business.” In Flashlight, she swerves again, expanding her prose further than ever before, packing an astonishing amount of beauty and meaning into her descriptions. Growing up, Serk steals from vendors “who sit like solemn stones beside their little piles of mountain ferns or frail carrots drawn slightly too soon from the dirt because the leisure to wait for a vegetable doesn't exist anymore.” His mother accepts his haul silently, and his “father, who comes home every day in clothing so stiffened with dirt that his mother uses the hand broom to beat him all over like a rug before he undresses and joins them inside, is unaware of this system by which the evening soup bowl is enhanced.”

These detail-rich sentences thrive on patience. By slowing down her description of the vegetable market, Choi calls attention to the small amounts of loveliness present there, amid the devastation of war, and to the poverty that makes Serk steal and his mother allow it. By taking the time for Serk's mother to beat his father like a rug, Choi puts her readers in the father's place, on the threshold of the family home, waiting for the woman in charge to let us in. As the novel goes on, the more brutal a character's conditions are, the more carefully Choi writes them, forcing readers to slow down and inhabit them. Her characters, too, have to pay close attention to their life; their survival depends on it. In a passage in which Serk, famished and desperate in a North Korean prison camp, discovers that he can trap and eat rodents, her descriptions of the geography around him—to say nothing of his joy once he has a belly full of rat—are almost too vivid to bear.

Here, in the rat stage, is when Serk gives up the last of his anger. Choi seems to draw on, or at least she echoes, Viktor Frankl, the psychologist and Holocaust survivor who maintained that the hallmark of humanity is “the freedom to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.” When Serk summons the energy to catch rats to keep himself alive, the strength to notice his surroundings comes with it—and that, in turn, provides the hope he needs to try to escape. Just as anger could not do this for him, it can't assuage Anne's loneliness after Louisa leaves for college. Living alone for the first time, she becomes, through an inner process that mystifies her, someone so responsive to the outside world that what she sees around her counterbalances the physical and emotional pain she feels: She is genuinely uplifted by sunlight in her apartment and by a sighting of a circus elephant, “its ancient flanks as otherworldly as the moon, its eye as bright, the four stupendous steles of its legs bearing its hulk easily as the sky bears its clouds.” Remembering the elephant, Anne thinks simply, “That was the sort of thing you stayed alive for.”

If Choi had written Flashlight less lushly—if the elephant just had legs, not stupendous steles— Anne's replacement of bitterness with appreciation would risk registering as corny uplift. So would the gratitude that comes to preoccupy Serk. Choi's style conveys that the world, even at its worst, rewards devoted examination; her characters' long arcs, meanwhile, remind readers that just because anger has ebbed doesn't mean it's gone. Louisa knows almost nothing of her father's past as a Japanese colonial subject, and yet she inherits a version of his anger about it: The awareness that she will never know what his childhood was like festers.

Louisa's emotions speak directly to Choi's earlier work. In A Person of Interest, a character named Mark, on learning that his parents concealed his past, imagines discussing his grief and anger with a long-dead mentor. “If we don't know the people we came from,” he muses, “how do we know who we are?” Choi eventually gives Mark the knowledge he wants, but in Flashlight, she denies it to Louisa—which is the realistic choice. When war, colonialism, and discrimination force people to migrate, family history all too often gets left behind. Japan's occupation of Korea has this effect on Choi's main characters, and Serk's anger about it ripples throughout the book, becoming part of Louisa's inheritance. But his and Anne's ultimate bequest to their daughter is the ability to struggle against her resentment rather than sinking permanently into it. Doing so isn't easy, but Choi's characters manage it over and over. In fact, it's what keeps them alive.

What the next Dark Ages could look like

Judging from news accounts and interviews, numerous people in and around the Trump administration are beguiled by imperial Rome. They see themselves as interpreters of its lessons—beware immigration; uphold masculinity; make babies—and inheritors of its majesty. A banner at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, in Washington, D.C., depicted Donald Trump in Augustan profile, his brow garlanded with laurel leaves. Elon Musk styles himself “Imperator of Mars” and has named one of his many children Romulus. Steve Bannon keeps a bust of Julius Caesar in his Capitol Hill office.

Two decades ago, when maga was just a Latin word for “enchantress,” I wrote a book about ancient Rome and modern America. The book didn't touch on masculinity or the birth rate, and it didn't try to explain the fall of Rome; the idea was just to sift through the story of a past society for clues to the one we live in now. Researching a bygone empire brought me into contact with prominent scholars who generously gave me their time. One man I think about often is the late Ramsay MacMullen, a historian at Yale and the author of the classic 1988 study Corruption and the Decline of Rome—a book whose lessons retain their grip.

MacMullen was nearing 80 when I met him, still an active outdoorsman, and at the time considered the greatest living historian of the Roman empire, an honorific bestowed by the American Historical Association. We got together initially for lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, and afterward kept up by phone and email. I already knew him as a jaunty writer, spelunking among funerary inscriptions and papyrus fragments and bits of ancient poetry. In person, his short, tousled white hair complemented the way he spoke: confident, casual, polydirectional. At lunch, MacMullen brought up a wide range of topics—perhaps dwelling too long on early Church councils—but again and again came back to a single theme: what happens to a polity when central control and common purpose are eroded by expediency, self-interest, and profit. This had been the subject of his book on corruption—a word, as MacMullen used it, with connotations broader than bribery and graft.

What interested him, he explained, were the mechanisms that kept the Roman empire functioning, and how grit worked its way inexorably into the cogs. Rome never had an administrative state as developed as anything we know today, but when it worked, it worked pretty well. What MacMullen called a “train of power” linked authority at the center to faraway commanders and distant magistrates, to minters of coin and provisioners of ships—all the way “to a hundred cobblers in the Bay-of-Naples area, a hundred peasant owners of ox-carts in Cappadocia.”

From the October 2003 issue: Cullen Murphy on medieval characteristics of the present day

And then it came undone. MacMullen described the problem: Over time, layers of divergent interests came between command and execution, causing the train of power to break. The breakage could come in the form of simple venality—somewhere along the way, someone found it profitable to ignore distant authority. Or it could occur because a public task was put into private hands, and those private hands had their own interests to protect. The military was largely farmed out to barbarian contractors—foederati, they were called—who did not always prove reliable, to put it mildly. In many places, the legal system was left to the marketplace: A bronze plaque survives from a public building in Numidia listing how much a litigant needed to pay, and to whom, to ensure that a lawsuit went forward. MacMullen had many examples of such breakage—a whole book of them.

A political scientist might use the phrase externalization of state functions to capture much of what MacMullen was looking at. A more familiar term would be privatization, the word MacMullen himself used. By the early 2000s, after two decades of deregulation and denationalization, the term had gained wide currency in a different context: to describe the path taken by governments in the West, notably the United States and Great Britain, as ever larger chunks of public responsibility—for security, finances, education, infrastructure, data—were lopped off and put into private hands. Independent fiefdoms were coming to life everywhere. I had written about this process, and it became a big part of my book.

I found myself returning to Corruption and the Decline of Rome in the early days of the current Trump administration, and wondering how MacMullen would have reacted to the rapid dismantling of government agencies and the mass firing of government workers. More and more public functions are now likely to be outsourced. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been pushing for years to privatize health care for veterans. Another administration official, Mehmet Oz, has argued for privatizing Medicare—a program he now oversees. The administration has shown interest in taking apart the National Weather Service and spinning off some of its functions. It is looking into fully privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which underpin the nation's mortgage industry.

The president has floated the idea of privatizing the United States Postal Service. On his first day in office, he issued an executive order allowing the Justice Department to again send inmates to prisons run by private companies, reversing the Biden administration's policy. He has promised to deport millions of undocumented people, and elements of that effort are also being privatized. Politico reported this spring that investors led by Erik Prince, the founder of the mercenary group once known as Blackwater, had sent a proposal to the White House arguing for the creation of a private military entity to set up “processing camps” and conduct roundups, possibly with the help of private citizens deputized to make arrests. The administration has as yet said nothing about that idea, but it did award a $151 million contract to the charter company CSI Aviation to operate deportation flights—an opportunity “too valuable not to pursue,” according to an executive of one of CSI's subcarriers.

Adam Serwer: The new dark age

MacMullen died three years ago, so I can't ask him about any of this. I do remember two questions I posed when we met. The first I had thought almost preposterous: Could he summarize the evolution of imperial Rome in a single sentence? He said he could do it in three words: “Fewer have more.”

The second question was about privatization, and where it leads. MacMullen was too careful a scholar to venture any grand pronouncement. There is no “must” in history, he explained. He could speculate only about how certain processes had played out in ancient Rome. That said, he liked comparing cultures and time periods (he later sent me a paper he'd written on corruption in Rome, India, and China in three different eras), and he liked to explore ideas. He thought about my question, then bounced it back: “Are you thinking about the Middle Ages?” he asked. “Or are you thinking about right now?”

The Middle Ages and I had a deal, or so I thought. For my part, I gave them sincere respect (the rise of universities, the revival of philosophy, the invention of eyeglasses) and romantic admiration (the mossy arches, the mottled stained glass, the wafting aroma of spit-roasted boar). I studied medieval history in college and for many years collaborated with my father on Prince Valiant, a comic strip set in the Middle Ages. Dank masonry and a roaring fire still bring a feeling of peace.

From the February 1994 issue: Cullen Murphy on Prince Valiant's England

In return for my love, the Middle Ages were supposed to stay where they were. But they have not. With the accelerating advance of privatization, they seem to be moving our way in the form of something that resembles feudalism. Medievalists argue over what that word really means, parsing it with contentious refinement. Was it even understood at the time? Stripped bare, though, the idea is simple enough.

In Europe, as imperial power receded, a new system of organization took hold, one in which power, governance, law, security, rights, and wealth were decentralized and held in private hands. Those who possessed this private power were linked to one another, from highest to lowest, in tiers of vassalage. The people above also had obligations to the people below—administering justice, providing protection. Think of the system, perhaps, as a nesting doll of oligarchs presiding over a great mass of people who subsisted as villeins and serfs.

The idea of governments as public ventures with a public purpose and some degree of public voice—what the Mayflower Compact called a “civill Body Politick”—took a long time to claw its way back into existence. Most people in the developed world have been living in a civill Body Politick, or something that aspires to be one, for several centuries. I won't overstate how successful this experiment has been, but it's the reason we have police forces rather than vigilantes, and safety nets rather than alms thrown haphazardly from horseback by men in tights.

In the 1980s and '90s, privatization started gaining traction again, and it had plenty of help. Anti-government sentiment created opportunities, and entrepreneurs seized them. Privatization was also pushed by policy makers who saw outsourcing as inherently more efficient. And besides, the public sector can't do everything. Case by case, privatization of this or that may well make sense. The problem comes in the sheer accumulation. In the U.S., even before Trump took office a second time, there were roughly twice as many people employed by private contractors to do the federal government's business as there were federal employees.

As the pace of privatization picked up in the 21st century, the idea of “neo-feudalism” or “techno-feudalism” began to interest scholars and theorists—Joel Kotkin, Jodi Dean, Robert Kuttner, and Yanis Varoufakis, among others. Most of the scholars are profoundly wary: They foresee an erosion of transparency, a disregard for individual rights, and a concentration of power among an ever smaller group of wealthy barons, even as the bulk of the population is relegated to service jobs that amount to a modern form of serfdom. For their part, theorists on the techno-libertarian or neo-reactionary fringe, observing from egg chairs in the Sky Lounge, see all these same things, and can't wait.

The meaning and consequences of privatization may be up for debate, but the phenomenon itself can't be argued away. To run through a few examples:

Holding a monopoly on control of the money supply was once a hallmark of public power. In the span of a decade, private cryptocurrencies have undermined that control while at the same time enabling a wide range of illicit activities. Cryptocurrencies are hard to regulate even when there's a will, which there often isn't. In the U.S., Trump and his family are heavily involved in the crypto business. In April, the president announced that he would invite the top 220 investors in his $TRUMP meme coin to a private dinner; the value of the meme coin rose within hours by 60 percent.

A monopoly on the legitimate use of force—replacing the knights and pikemen of sundry vassals with professional standing armies—was another traditional hallmark of public power. Donald Rumsfeld famously observed that “you go to war with the army you have,” but another option today is “the army you rent.” Globe-spanning private military companies such as the Wagner Group and Triple Canopy recall the roving mercenary Landsknechte of yore. The world is awash with mustered-out veterans of recent wars. Governments and corporations alike often want kinetic solutions without legal oversight. (“Like medieval mercenaries,” a 2019 report from National Defense University observes, today's freelance personnel “can prove overly brutal when executing contracts.”) From 2007 to 2012, the U.S. alone spent $160 billion on private security contractors. Growing up alongside them—an industry even larger in size—are the private intelligence-gathering companies, such as Palantir, on which the U.S. spends a significant portion of its intelligence budget. The very name Palantir seems to harken back, via Tolkien, to a feudal world.

Public police forces with a mission to protect everyone are largely a 19th-century invention. But police forces are shrinking. In the U.S., anyone with money and a need now hires private security guards, who outnumber police officers by a ratio of 2 to 1. Among companies based in the U.S., the third-largest global employer—after Amazon and Walmart—is a private security firm, Allied Universal. Private guards patrol small towns and swaths of entire cities. A consortium of hundreds of businesses in Portland, Oregon, hired a company named Echelon Protective Services to secure their downtown precinct, day and night. During the fires that devastated Los Angeles in January, the wealthiest residents of Brentwood called in the secretive security firm Covered 6 to protect their homes from looting. As for personal protection, the market has no ceiling. Mark Zuckerberg's reported annual budget for personal security is $23 million, five times more than the pope pays for the Swiss Guards.

As in medieval times, the affluent withdraw behind barriers. If it were built today, Windsor Castle would be described in the sales prospectus as a “privately governed residential community.” In the 1990s, when the economist Robert Reich began writing about “the secession of the successful,” some 3 million American housing units were lodged inside gated communities, which protected a population of about 8 million. Today, gated communities encompass 14 million housing units. On its website, a real-estate company in Florida earlier this year asked readers, “Is a Moat Right for You?” It was an April Fools' joke, but not a very good one, because modern moated residences already exist. Perhaps the most exclusive gated community in the world is actually an island—Indian Creek Village, in Biscayne Bay, Florida, with 89 residents (including Jeff Bezos, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner) and a perimeter-security radar system designed by the Israeli company Magos. Officers in speedboats intercept anyone venturing too close.

Privatization has also upended the law. One example from an ambitious survey by Robert Kuttner and Katherine V. W. Stone in The American Prospect : the growing use of compulsory arbitration, written by corporations into private contracts, as a way of settling consumer and employment disputes. The public court system is clogged. Arbitration—the “outsourcing of jurisprudence,” as the authors call it—creates a parallel private system, one in which efficiency may be more highly valued than public oversight or due process.

Oversight more broadly—of the environment, food, drugs, finance—has been drifting for decades into the hands of those being overseen. In their 2021 book, The Privatization of Everything, Donald Cohen and Allen Mikaelian documented the loss of public control over water, roads, welfare, parks, and much else. The deliberate dismantling of government in America in recent months, and its replacement with something built on privatized power and networks of personal allegiance, accelerates what was long under way. Its spirit was captured decades ago in a maxim of Ronald Reagan's economic adviser Murray Weidenbaum: “Don't just stand there— undo something!”

One of the most watched television programs in the U.K. last year was the ITV series Mr Bates vs the Post Office, a dramatized version of events that took place starting decades ago. Britain's postal system, once overseen directly by a government minister, became a (government-owned) statutory corporation in 1970. In time, parts of it were spun off—since the days of Margaret Thatcher, the nation has pursued privatization more aggressively than most other countries—and the legal and oversight structure was subjected to continual tinkering. In a deal originating as a “public-private partnership” arrangement, the Post Office in the late 1990s computerized its accounting and other operations; the system was supplied by a U.K. company that was then acquired by the technology giant Fujitsu. Glitches in the software soon resulted in hundreds of rural postmasters being falsely accused of theft and summarily fired. Several went to prison. A number committed suicide. Fujitsu has acknowledged the errors; it does not accept blame for the entire cascade of injustice. Inside the Post Office, corporate opacity and dispersed responsibility made concealment easy and accountability hard. Without investigative reporting by the trade publication Computer Weekly—and, of course, the TV series—there might have been no accountability at all.

In the end, the head of the Post Office suffered an ironically feudal fate: Formerly a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, she had her CBE status revoked by King Charles III. And Mr. Bates, the local postmaster who organized resistance by the subpostmasters, was knighted.

Mr Bates vs the Post Office enjoyed great storytelling advantages—a gnomish hero, angry villagers, and all that verdant countryside. But grit working its way into the cogs of government is rarely cinematic or even in public view. The consequences may reveal themselves slowly, and often come down to the fine print. In 2008, desperate for cash, Chicago privatized its parking meters, selling off the rights to all the revenue for 75 years to a group of investors led by Morgan Stanley. A “true-up” provision in the contract requires the city to compensate investors for lost revenue when meters are taken out of service—a provision that weighs on decision making whenever the city considers projects that would eliminate meters or favor mass transit over cars. The rights to operate toll highways have been sold off by some jurisdictions to private companies, including foreign ones. The fine print in the contracts often prevents improvements to adjacent roads on the grounds that such enhancement would create undue competition. Private prisons generally put a quota clause into their agreements. States and municipalities may be hoping, as a matter of policy, to reduce their prison populations, but the beds in private prisons must be filled regardless.

Evoking the train of power that enables effective government, MacMullen wrote: “At every point of connection the original intent must be transmitted as it was received. Otherwise it will come to nothing.” Control and accountability are the bedrock. Control: Who makes the decisions and who decides whether they will be executed—and for whose benefit? Accountability: Who determines whether something has gone wrong, and who determines whether the problem is fixed? In a privatized world, government becomes “diffuse, unstable, unpredictable,” and the skein of responsibility more and more attenuated. Contractors hire subcontractors, who hire subcontractors of their own. “I can't tell you about the sub to the sub to the sub,” a NATO official told The New York Times in 2010 when asked about convoy guards in Afghanistan who turned out to be in league with the Taliban. Throughout much of our spun-off government today, “the sub to the sub to the sub” is almost a job description.

Is feudalism our future? There is no “must” in history, and the present is as much a riddle as anything that lies ahead. A privatized world may be a temporary aberration, a new stage of development, or just the default setting of human society. Our own era doesn't have a name yet, and it won't be up to us to give it one. From the perspective of some far-distant vantage point, the age we inhabit may even come to seem “Middle.” With contentious refinement, historians will parse what “privatization” might have meant, and wonder whether we understood it at the time.

President Donald Trump is pausing one of the harshest consequences for student-loan borrowers who default on their debt.

On Monday evening, the Department of Education confirmed to Business Insider that it would be pausing Social Security garnishment for defaulted student-loan borrowers after restarting collections on May 5.

""The Department has not offset any social security benefits since restarting collections on May 5, and has put a pause on any future social security offsets,"" Ellen Keast, an Education Department spokesperson, told BI.

""The Trump Administration is committed to protecting social security recipients who oftentimes rely on a fixed income,"" Keast continued. ""In the coming weeks, the Department will begin proactive outreach to recipients about affordable loan repayment options and help them back into good standing.""

A notice posted to the Department of Education's debt resolution page also said that the department is ""delaying offsets of these monthly benefits for a couple of months and plans to resume sometime this summer.""

The notice added that the department still intends to resume wage garnishment ""later this summer.""

This announcement comes after a five-year pause that Trump started during the pandemic, halting negative credit reporting and collections on defaulted student loans. Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said that collections would resume once again in an effort to restore accountability to the student-loan system.

""Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense. Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others,"" McMahon wrote in a May opinion piece.

A federal borrower typically enters default after missing payments for more than 270 days. Those who are in default can rehabilitate their loans or consolidate their loans — both of which can be time-consuming — or file for bankruptcy.

Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default. The New York Federal Reserve recently found that the number of borrowers who moved into serious delinquency surged to 8.04% in the first quarter of 2024, meaning that millions more could enter default this summer.

Some student-loan borrowers previously told BI that they cannot afford to lose their Social Security income if they default on their debt.

""There will be no retirement. I'll die on the job,"" James Southern, a 63-year-old borrower, said. ""Even if I were at my full retirement age, they'd garnish the Social Security, so I'm still going to have to work in order to survive.""

Emerging artists, long-established musicians and big bosses in the music industry can take away something from her victory.

Don't bet against Taylor or her Swifties.

Taylor Swift emerged triumphant after a yearslong battle over the rights to her earlier music on Friday. She now has complete control from the songs to packaging to distribution — and no corporate edicts to deal with. That would be enough cause for celebration, but reports say that she bought her catalog for more than $300 million. For a Grammy award-winning, multi-platinum international superstar worth $1.4 billion, that's pretty much a steal.

This should not be viewed as just a massive financial and artistic win for her.

Populism has remade the party; now only a few lonely senators are worried about the budget bill's impact on debt.

Putting it on the credit card.

There is no constituency for debt reduction, which is a fancy way of saying voters don't care that the federal balance sheet is roughly $37 trillion in the red — and growing.

This simple fact of American politics goes a long way toward explaining why President Donald Trump, with the help of congressional Republicans, is pushing a sweeping reconciliation package of tax cuts and fresh domestic spending priorities that is projected to add approximately $3.8 trillion to the swelling federal debt. Politics is a service business and Trump and his Capitol Hill allies are aiming to please the customer.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Wall Street calls it a golden age for alternative assets. Richard Ennis, who spent decades helping pensions and endowments devise modern portfolios, calls it a costly delusion draining billions from portfolios — one that will come undone in the coming decades. 

For years, the pitch to institutional investors has been the same: passive returns on stocks and bonds are fine as they go, but to thrive money managers need hedge funds, private assets and other alternative vehicles. Yet after dissecting the data, Ennis — who helped pioneer the art of investment consulting — finds there is surprisingly little evidence it's true.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Volkswagen AG is in the process of reducing production capacity and headcount in Germany.

Volkswagen AG said about 20,000 employees will voluntarily leave the company by the end of the decade as the carmaker restructures its German operations to cope with uneven demand for its vehicles.

The result shows that the company's restructuring plans are on track, Gunnar Kilian, Volkswagen's head of human relations and board member, told employees Tuesday at a workers assembly in Wolfsburg. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Hims & Hers Health announced Tuesday it will acquire European telehealth platform Zava in its push to expand globally.

""We're excited to take this moment to really accelerate both the European expansion, but also use this platform as an accelerant as we move into more markets,"" Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told CNBC in an interview.

The deal is set to close by mid-year, according to the company's press release. While terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the company said details of the transaction will be available in financial disclosures at closing.

Dudum spoke at length during the company's first-quarter earnings call in mid-May about the company's commitment to global expansion.

""Early traction in the UK gives us confidence that we can scale out platform globally and extend out mission to help people around the world,"" Dudum said at the time.

Hims first expanded its global footprint to the United Kingdom in 2021 when it acquired London-based vertical health platform Honest Health.

The deal to acquire Zava will expand the company's services to Ireland, France and Germany and will grow its active customer base by roughly 50%, adding 1.3 million customers to Hims' existing base of 2.4 million subscribers.

Zava CEO David Meinertz, who launched the platform in 2011, said the deal will provide relief to an otherwise overwhelmed European healthcare system.

""The medications are priced more competitively than in the U.S. so more people can actually afford it and we are seeing a huge demand,"" said Meinertz. ""The demand is increasing with additional strains on the statutory systems that telehealth can alleviate.""

In the EU, the statutory healthcare system generally refers to the publicly funded health insurance and healthcare delivery systems within individual member states. These systems are universal, providing comprehensive coverage to citizens and residents, although access and coverage can vary. 

After the acquisition closes, Zava platforms will maintain their branding for a ""few quarters"" before being rebranded as Hims & Hers, Dudum said. Meinertz will become a general manager of the international business.

Dudum noted that while some companies are pulling back or withholding growth outlook given macroeconomic uncertainty, he has full confidence that pushing forward is the right decision.

""The pricing on pharmaceuticals is so much more consumer advantageous in broader Europe relative to the U.S.,"" said Dudum. ""The ability to bring accessible, personalized treatments to customers overseas may be equal or easier than what we see domestically just given the pricing and complexities of insurance and [pharmacy benefit managers] and the pricing power that exists here.""

In this article

Meta has signed a 20-year agreement to buy nuclear power from Constellation Energy, continuing the wave of tech giants teaming up with the industry in order to meet the growing power needs of data centers.

Beginning in June 2027, Meta will buy roughly 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which is the entire output from the site's one nuclear reactor. The companies said the long-term agreement will support the continuing operation of the plant, as well as its relicensing. Without the commitment from Meta, the plant was in danger of closing when its zero-emissions credit, which it's relied on since 2017, expired.

""We are proud to partner with Meta. ... They figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,"" said Joe Dominguez, Constellation's president and CEO. ""Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.""

Terms of the deal, which will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, were not disclosed. The plant will not power Meta's data centers directly — instead it will continue to provide power to the regional grid, while contributing to the tech giant's goal of 100% clean electricity.

Constellation shares were up 1% on Tuesday, well off their highs of the session.

Tuesday's announcement is the latest in a slew of deals between big tech and the nuclear industry. In September, Constellation said it would restart Three Mile Island — the site of the worst nuclear meltdown in U.S. history — and sell the power to Microsoft under a 20-year agreement.  

Google recently pledged to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, after last year teaming up with Kairos Power, a developer of small modular reactors, or SMRs. Amazon invested more than $500 million to develop SMRs in October and bought a data center campus powered by the Susquehanna nuclear plant in March 2024. Tech giants including Amazon, Google and Meta signed a pledge in March led by the World Nuclear Association calling for nuclear energy worldwide to triple by 2050.

Still, the deal with Constellation marks Meta's first official foray into nuclear. In December, the company put out a request for proposals to find nuclear energy developers to partner with, saying they wanted to add between one and four gigawatts of new nuclear generation in the U.S. That proposal, which is focused on advanced nuclear, remains in progress, and stands apart from the company's backing of the Clinton facility.

""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta. ""We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.""

President Donald Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at speeding nuclear deployment, setting a target of quadrupling U.S. nuclear energy by 2050. The executive orders call for, among other things, an overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as building out a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

The White House has also called for faster regulatory approval for reactors — including small modular reactors. In the past, nuclear projects have been plagued by high upfront costs and long construction timelines. The industry is hoping that SMRs can be a more cost-effective way to scale up nuclear power. At present, there are no operational SMRs in the U.S.

Constellation said Tuesday that it is considering seeking a new permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to possibly build a SMR at the Clinton site.

Related Stories

Ten years ago, my wife, daughter and I relocated from the Washington, DC area to Lisbon, Portugal. Living here has been one of the best experiences of our lives, so we're not surprised that it's the country Americans want to move to the most.

But once we arrived, we soon learned that some of our expectations before the move were unrealistic. For example, we thought we could fully integrate simply by mastering the language and making a lot of Portuguese friends. Ten years later, we still feel just as culturally ""American"" as we did when we first landed.

Now that we've fully settled in, our friends back home often ask about what living and retiring abroad is really like. Here are the top three myths about leaving the U.S.:

""Laid-back"" and ""low-stress"" aren't necessarily the same things, especially if you're used to efficiency and attentive customer service.

It may take minutes to open a bank account in the U.S., but it could take weeks or longer for an American expat to do it in a country like Portugal, where banks require significant documentation and review periods before opening an account. 

And if you're worried about American politics, moving abroad won't stop the news cycle. In fact, without the reassuring familiarity of being ""home,"" moving abroad might make you even more stressed.

So if your motivation for relocating overseas is to leave your worries behind, you may become disillusioned with life in a foreign country. But if your goal is to pursue excitement, novelty and the great unknown, then you'll have an easier time overcoming the unwelcome surprises that exist in even the most laid-back countries. 

The cost of living in a country like Portugal might be lower than comparable lifestyles in the U.S., but Americans often face extra administrative steps when they live abroad that can result in added costs.

For example, you may need to hire both a U.S. accountant for your U.S. income taxes, plus a local accountant to file your taxes for your country of residence.

Depending on which country you move to, you should consider the volatile nature of currency exchange rates. For example, the euro rose from about $1.03 early this year to nearly $1.14 today, so most things that my family buys in Portugal now cost us over 10% more than they did a few months ago. 

Most importantly, don't overlook the value of your time. A medical prescription in Portugal might cost a fifth of what it costs in the U.S., but can take five times longer to fill.

If one of your goals for moving abroad is to lower your living expenses, I suggest doing three things:

In Lisbon, there's a huge number of expat-focused group activities. There are co-working spaces that cater to expat communities and language schools. But as welcoming and friendly as Portugal tends to be, you may struggle to make new connections if you're based in more rural parts of the country. 

So how can you meet new friends and colleagues? If you're traveling with school-age children, does the school organize parent activities? Do you have hobbies you can pursue in a group setting, especially groups that meet regularly so you'll start to see the same faces over and over again?

Also important: What about your ""helper"" network? If you face a sudden need to take a return trip to the U.S., for example, who will care for your pets while you're gone? If you get into an accident, who will notify your family back home if you're unable to do so? 

My best advice is to have a written contingency plan, complete with names and phone numbers for who will stand in for you if necessary. It's okay if there are blanks in your contingency plan — you can fill those in as you develop new relationships in your new country. 

As for the one belief about moving abroad that actually is true? ""You'll love living near the ocean on a glorious, sunny day."" A picture tells a thousand words.

Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof stepped down from his role on Tuesday after disagreements over immigration proposals led to far-right leader Geert Wilders withdrawing his party from the ruling coalition.

Earlier in the day, Wilders said in a CNBC-translated post on the X social media platform that his Party for Freedom (PVV) party would be departing over the alliance's lack of support for their asylum proposal.

""We had no choice. I promised the voter the strictest asylum policy ever, but that was not granted to you,"" he said in a separate Google-translated comments on X.

The PVV won a landslide victory in the Netherlands' general election in 2023, knocking former Prime Minister Mark Rutte's party off the top spot. Despite the victory, the country's four major parties chose the former head of the Netherlands' intelligence service, Dick Schoof, as prime minister.

Conflicting ideas on immigration sank the former coalition in 2023 and ultimately led Rutte, the country's longest serving premier, to step down from the top post.

Wilders had on Sunday warned his party could leave the coalition.

""Let me be crystal clear. If the majority of our proposals from the ten-point asylum plan are not adopted by the coalition (and thus added to the Main Lines Agreement) and implemented by the cabinet as soon as possible, then the PVV will withdraw from this coalition,"" he said in a post on X over the weekend, according to a Google translation.

Last week the PVV put forward a 10-point plan to reduce immigration which included a call to halt asylum and temporarily stop the reunification of families for all asylum seekers who have been granted refugee status.

""We wanted a stricter asylum policy... You see that many countries in the European Union - Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium, they go further in taking measures,"" Wilders said in televised comments, according to a CNBC translation.

The Dutch economy has been steadily growing, despite inflation hitting 4.1% in April, well above the target for the euro area. The economy is expected to grow 1.5% this year and in 2026, according to the Dutch central bank, which also cautions that rising geopolitical tensions could put a strain on further growth.

The leaders of the other coalition parties accused Wilders of putting his own interests ahead of the needs of the country. ""He chooses his own ego and his own interests,"" Dilan Yesilgoz-Zegerius, leader of Rutte's former party, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, told Dutch broadcaster NOS in Google-translated comments.

""I am astonished. He is throwing away the chance of a right-wing policy. This is super irresponsible,"" she said.

The Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) party said in a statement that Wilders had single-handedly pulled the plug on the government. ""Governing the country is something different than threatening on social media,"" said Caroline van der Plas, leader of the BBB.

""This is completely irresponsible, reckless and incomprehensible for anyone who hoped for change.""

The BBB party said the fall of the government now means ""at least a year and a half of standstill,"" with left-leaning parties more likely to take over and put forward more lenient asylum policies.

Other opposition partieshave already called for elections, with the leader of the Socialist Party SP (SP) faction, Jimmy Dijk, saying in a post on X that now is the time for elections and ""political change.""

Economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and globally were cut further by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as President Donald Trump's tariff turmoil weighs on expectations.

The U.S. growth outlook was downwardly revised to just 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026. In March, the OECD was still expecting a 2.2% expansion in 2025.

The fallout from Trump's tariff policy, elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown of net immigration and a smaller federal workforce were cited as reasons for the latest downgrade.

Global growth, meanwhile, is also expected to be lower than previously forecast, with the OECD saying that ""the slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada and Mexico,"" while other economies are projected to see smaller downward revisions.

""Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and in 2026 ... on the technical assumption that tariff rates as of mid-May are sustained despite ongoing legal challenges,"" the OECD said.

It had previously forecast global growth of 3.1% this year and 3% in 2026.

""The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging,"" the report said. ""Substantial increases in barriers to trade, tighter financial conditions, weaker business and consumer confidence and heightened policy uncertainty will all have marked adverse effects on growth prospects if they persist.""

Frequent changes regarding tariffs have continued in recent weeks, leading to uncertainty in global markets and economies. Some of the most recent developments include Trump's reciprocal, country-specific levies being struck down by the U.S. Court of International Trade, before then being reinstated by an appeals court, as well as Trump saying he would double steel duties to 50%.

""The reasons why we downgraded almost everybody in our forecast is that trade uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty has reached unprecedented levels,"" OECD Chief Economist Alvaro Pereira told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Tuesday. 

""As a consequence, we've been seeing that consumption and investment has come down, and in fact, activity indicators also have come down. And if you take this into account, and we also try to estimate in our models, you see that there'll be less growth, less jobs, and more inflationary pressures going forward.""

The OECD adjusted its inflation forecast, saying ""higher trade costs, especially in countries raising tariffs, will also push up inflation, although their impact will be offset partially by weaker commodity prices.""

The impact of tariffs on inflation has been hotly debated, with many central bank policymakers and global analysts suggesting it remains unclear how the levies will impact prices, and that much depends on factors like potential countermeasures.

The OECD's inflation outlook shows a notable difference between the U.S. and some of the world's other major economies. For instance, while G20 countries are now expected to record 3.6% inflation in 2025 — down from 3.8% in March's estimate — the projection for the U.S. has risen to 3.2%, up from a previous 2.8%.

U.S. inflation could even be closing in on 4% toward the end of 2025, the OECD said. 

The OECD's Pereira also discussed developments in technology such as AI, and how they are impacting productivity — and giving the U.S. an advantage.

""Productivity has been very strong in the United States, and we expect that likely this will widen the gap between the United States [and] the rest of the world, exactly because the exposure to AI by sectors in the U.S. are higher,"" he said. 

With technology like AI, robotics and quantum computing, there is the possibility of a ""significant productivity revival,"" he said — but only if trade barriers are lowered and investment and consumption increase.

""I think if we are able to get trade agreements between countries, not only between China, United States, but also other parts of the world and if we are able to reduce uncertainty, we do believe that we might be on the cusp of something quite significant,"" Pereira said.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


In his first week away from the U.S. government's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk is seeing positive activity in his companies. His brain tech startup Neuralink announced a $650 million funding round, while his electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla in May enjoyed a 213% year-on-year jump in sales in Norway.

Granted, Tesla's encouraging numbers in Norway are an outlier amid a plunge in Europe sales. And the causal link between those rosy developments and Musk's departure from DOGE is tenuous. Starlink's funding round and Tesla's increase in Norway sales occurred while Musk still had his hands full with the White House. Hence, they could have happened with little — or none — of his leadership or input.

But both outcomes serve as reminders of why so many are Musk backers: His companies are, fundamentally, successful ones. Tesla still has a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, and Musk is seeking a valuation of more than $120 billion for his artificial intelligence startup xAI — by contrast, rivals Perplexity AI and Anthropic are looking for valuations at $14 billion and $61.5 billion, respectively.

While Musk's firms still deserve investor attention, they, like Tesla's promised full self-driving feature, aren't completely autonomous. They need a steady — and ideally ""super focused"" — hand to guide them for the road ahead.

Muted start to JuneU.S. stocks posted modest gains Monday, the first trading day of June. The S&P 500 advanced 0.41%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.08% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.67%. Asia-Pacific markets climbed Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.17%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 inched up 0.07% at 2 p.m. Singapore time.

China's factory activity in May falls sharplyThe Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 48.3 in May from 50.4 in April, meaning China's factory activity shrank last month. The reading sharply missed Reuters' estimates of 50.6 and was the steepest drop since 2022. A gauge for new export orders fell to its lowest level since July 2023, Caixin said, indicating foreign demand is slowing because of U.S. tariffs.

Steel tariffs will hike U.S. pricesThe 50% tariff on steel imports that U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday will push up prices of the metal in America, according to analysts. ""Already steel prices in the U.S. are higher than anywhere else, and it is a net importer which needs to have volumes coming in. All this does is raise prices there,"" Josh Spoores, head of steel Americas analysis at CRU, told CNBC on Monday.

Neuralink raised $650 millionElon Musk's Neuralink has closed a $650 million funding round, the brain tech startup announced Monday. ARK Invest, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and other firms participated in the round, according to a press release. Neuralink is building a brain-computer interface, a system that translates brain signals into commands for external technologies.

Tesla sales in Norway jumpTesla's sale of new cars in Norway skyrocketed 213% to 2,600 in May from a year earlier, according to official data. The increase was mostly driven by sales of the firm's revamped Model Y compact sport utility vehicle. That bucks a downward trend across Europe — industry groups on Monday reported significantly lower May sales for new Tesla vehicles in Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Sweden.

[PRO] Tourist spending as bellwetherIn February, while luxury brand Moncler was still basking in the glow of a stellar 20% share price surge from January, fund manager Giles Parkinson made a contrarian move: He sold out. Parkinson's caution wasn't borne out of analyst reports or traditional financial modeling, but from what he called a ""good short-term guide to luxury industry writ large"": the spending patterns of international tourists.

In China, 'The Great American' burger is now made with Australian beef

American agricultural products have been vanishing from Chinese stores and restaurants and losing ground to other imports.

At his restaurant in Beijing, Geng Xiaoyun used to offer a special dish of salt-baked chicken feet — or ""phoenix talons"" as they are called in China — imported from America.

""American chicken feet are so beautiful,"" Geng said. ""They're spongy so they taste great. Chinese [chicken] feet just aren't as good.""

With prices climbing 30% from March due to tariffs, the owner of Kunyuan restaurant had to pull the Chinese delicacy from the menu.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stocks reversed course late in the session on Tuesday to close marginally higher, with the Stoxx 600 index provisionally eking out a 0.01% gain.

Major bourses were all in the green, with Germany's DAX up 0.64%, France's CAC 40 up 0.33% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 up 0.13%.

The euro dropped 0.56% against the U.S. dollar after data showed inflation in the euro zone eased to a cooler-than-forecast 1.9% in May, below the European Central Bank's 2% target. The figures supported expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the ECB at its meeting on Thursday, with some economists suggesting a follow-up rate cut in June now looks more likely.

Tomorrow we'll be monitoring talks between European Commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who are due to meet in Paris around 9 a.m. local time. It's also the day U.S. President Donald Trump's hastily announced hike in duties on steel imports to 50% — expected to fuel domestic inflation and rock the struggling European steel industry — will come into effect.

CNBC will be broadcasting from SuperReturn in Berlin, one of the world's largest gatherings of the private equity industry, with guests including Carlyle's Head of Global Credit Mark Jenkins and Bain's EMEA private equity head Alexander Schmitz. See you then.

Ratings agency S&P Global has made 26 negative ratings actions, including eight downgrades, five CreditWatch negative placements and 13 outlook revisions due to tariffs since the start of March through to the end of May.

Data from S&P published in a report Tuesday showed 24 of the 26 entities were corporations, 18 of which were based in the U.S., including Fender Musical Instruments Corp. — downgraded from stable to negative — and Conair Holdings — downgraded to developing from negative.

Outside of the U.S., Slovakia's sovereign rating was cut to negative from stable, while China's Geely Holding, automaker Volvo's parent company, was also cut to negative from stable.

European firms impacted included Dutch chemicals firm Pearls, and window coverings manufacturer Hunter Douglas Finance.

U.S. markets have seen a muted open, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both down by around 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%.

Fund manager Giles Parkinson of Trinity Bridge sold shares of luxury retailer Moncler in early March and avoided steep losses in the weeks following as the stock slid.

Parkinson's caution wasn't borne out of analyst reports, hushed industry whispers, or traditional financial modeling, but from what he called a ""good short-term guide to luxury industry writ large"": the spending patterns of international tourists.

His thesis was confirmed when Moncler reported its first quarter 2025 results on April 16. While not disastrous, it painted a clear picture of a company navigating choppier waters.

The euro was 0.2% lower against the U.S. dollar and 0.07% down against sterling at 10:42 a.m. in London, after data showed inflation in the euro zone eased to 1.9% from 2.2% in May. The rate was lower than the 2% expected. 

Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was a little over 2 basis points lower at 2.497%. 

European stock markets remained largely in the red, with the regional Stoxx 600 index down 0.2%. 

""We expect inflation to fall further in the coming months, leaving the headline rate comfortably below 2% in the second half of the year,"" Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. 

""This won't have much of a bearing on Thursday's ECB decision, which already looked almost certain to be a 25bp cut. But May's inflation data strengthen the case for another cut at the following meeting in July,"" 

— Jenni Reid

Sweden's Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson has told CNBC that Washington's seesawing over global trade and tariffs is worse than levies themselves.

""The most constant right now seems to be the sudden shifts of [U.S. President] Mr. Trump,"" she told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition.""

""He's changing almost on a daily basis what will happen, and that's of course really costly for our companies, for our households and for the global economy. So right now, the uncertainty and the unpredictability is worse than tariffs,"" she said.

— Holly Ellyatt 

Inflation in the 20-member euro zone eased to 1.9% in May, coming in below analyst expectations and also under the European Central Bank's target of 2%. 

The headline decline, assisted by a steep monthly drop in services inflation from 4% in April to 3.2% in May, further builds the case for a widely anticipated interest rate cut from the European Central Bank when it meets on Thursday.

Shares of Starlink competitor Eutelsat rose by more than 6% as the company is reportedly in discussions to raise 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) from investors.

Bloomberg News reported that Eutelsat, which runs the OneWeb satellite constellation, is in talks with the government of France, the United Kingdom, and shipping company CMA CGM to raise funds to build its low-earth orbit network.

The deal would take the French government's stake in the company to 30% from the current 13.59%, Bloomberg said.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has turned lower after rising in early trade. The benchmark was lower by 0.2% at 8.30 am in London.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100, CAC 40 and Germany's DAX were also in the red by 0.1%.

Swiss bank Julius Baer plans to cut costs by 130 million Swiss Francs ($158.8 million) by 2028 as part of its strategic review.

The bank said that the savings will be in addition to its target to lower expenses by 110 million Swiss Francs ($134 million), which was announced in February. Julius Baer said it expects to exceed that target by 20 million Swiss Francs.

Analysts largely welcomed the strategy update from the bank's new chief executive, who took control at the start of this year.

""The words discipline/disciplined appear a total of 19 times in the Strategy Update presentation from Julius Baer under new CEO Stefan Bollinger and this is giving the right messaging to all stakeholders given the issues over the past years, in our view,"" said JPMorgan's Amit Ranjan in a note to clients.

The bank also revealed its plans to increase gross profit margins, assets under management and return on its CET reserves.

""While targets appear conservatively struck and imply earnings below consensus, this makes sense but is likely to require evidence of a better outcome and buybacks to resume to see earnings growth and upgrades coming through,"" said RBC Capital analyst Anke Reingen.

Good morning from London and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action in European financial markets, as well as business news, analysis, earnings and data.

Futures data from IG on Tuesday morning suggests London's FTSE will open 6 points higher at 8,787, Germany's DAX 42 points higher at 23,984, France's CAC 40 up 6 points at 7,741 and Italy's FTSE MIB up 106 points at 40,073.

The specter of U.S. tariffs has returned to the fore for markets this week, after President Donald Trump said Friday that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50% on June 4.

Investors will also be monitoring any developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, which soured last week. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggested Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could have a conversation as soon as this week.

— Holly Ellyatt

Investors in Europe will be keeping a close eye on the latest inflation data from the euro zone.

Flash data from the single currency area is expected to show inflation cooled toward 2% in May, paving the way for the European Central Bank to deliver a widely expected 25 basis point rate cut at its next meeting on Thursday.

Euro zone inflation was unchanged at 2.2% in April, missing expectations for a move lower.

— Holly Ellyatt

U.S. stock futures slipped on Tuesday morning after the major averages began June's trading on a positive note.

In the regular session, the S&P 500 climbed 0.41%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.67%, and the Dow added 35.41 points, or 0.08%.

Stocks ended Monday higher despite rising tensions between China and the United States, with Beijing countering President Donald Trump's accusations that it had violated a temporary trade agreement. Investors had grown hopeful that the two countries could work out a trade deal, but this latest development points to negotiations taking a turn for the worse.

Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose overnight after China's manufacturing activity in May shrank at the fastest pace since September 2022, a private survey showed.

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 48.3, missing Reuters' median estimate of 50.6 and dropping sharply from 50.4 in April, as a sharper decline in new export orders highlighted the impact of prohibitive U.S. tariffs.

South by Southwest (SXSW) may be a well-known event in the United States, but it certainly hasn't reached the same level of recognition in Britain.

""What's that?"" asked a pedestrian who was passing by a SXSW London sign.

SXSW is a festival held in Austin, Texas, every year that brings together big names in music, film, art and technology. The organizers have brought the event to London for the first time this week, and CNBC took at look at what's going on.

CNBC's Tania Bryer moderated a discussion with London Mayor Sadiq Khan who during an opening speech made the pitch for the city as a ""hub for talent, trade, tech and innovation.""

Khan took veiled swipes at the U.S. President Donald Trump and his trade policies and pitched London as open for business.

""So at the time when there's so much uncertainty and political turmoil across the pond, defined by an inward looking mentality, I'm going to reach out to international investors, businesses and creators to say that London offers you the opposite,"" Khan said, according to Deadline.

SXSW is being held in various venues across the creative neighborhood of Shoreditch which is also close to Old Street, a key tech hub in the early days of London's startup scene. Shoreditch was taken over by SXSW London branding, from murals to signs on lampposts.

Big names are in attendance, such as ""Game of Thrones"" star Sophie Turner and actor and musician Idris Elba. On the tech front, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis spoke, as did Thomas Wolf, co-founder of artificial intelligence firm Hugging Face.

So what was the experience like? The day started with me picking up my press pass and receiving an SXSW tote bag. There was a schedule and map in there and bar of SXSW-branded Tony's Chocolonely.

I made my way to Shoreditch Electric, a venue I just found out is home to the National Centre for Circus Arts. I watched a session where Thomas Wolf of Hugging Face discussed the progress of open-source artificial intelligence models and the future of robotics. Open source is a big deal in AI right now because of the strong performance of those models, especially out of China, which are free to use.

The venue was an industrial-style, exposed brick building. Just outside was a coffee bar, which was perfect for the sunny weather in London on Monday.

I then walked over to the Truman Brewery, where the main stage of the conference was. Outside the entrance were lots of food trucks and, of course, big brand displays from sunglasses firm Ray-Ban and electric car company Polestar, which had live music performances throughout the day.

Then there was the official merchandise store which was selling a pair of SXSW-branded socks for £18 ($24) and a T-shirt for £30.

After a quick security check, I was in the Truman Brewery in time for a session from Hassabis. I decided to try to watch it on stage but the line to get in was long, even about half an hour before the talk. So I decided to watch it on a screen in the media lounge, which had pretty decent sandwiches.

AI was certainly a big theme, with companies like Hugging Face, Google DeepMind and even Wayve, a U.K. driverless car startup backed by SoftBank, discussing the future of the technology.

Hassabis spoke about artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is generally understood as AI that is smarter than humans. He said AGI would be ""bigger"" than the Industrial Revolution and the internet in terms of its impact on society. He also warned about the need to develop this technology responsibly.

The DeepMind founder also said that over the next five to 10 years, AI tools are going to ""supercharge technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies, but combining it with creativity and other skills.""

""I think they're going to be able to achieve superhuman things,"" Hassabis said.

There are lots of big names performing throughout the week, including R&B star Tems — but they're far too late in the evening and don't sync up with my 5 a.m. wake-up call. So you'll have to look on social media to see what kind of vibe those events have.

HOLO allocates 66% of cash reserves to crypto, generating $19.08M income; represents major asset allocation shift with mixed risk profile.

MicroCloud Hologram has made a significant financial move by allocating up to $200 million of its $303 million cash reserves (approximately 66% of total cash) toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. This represents an extraordinarily high concentration of capital in volatile digital assets for a technology service provider.

The company reports it has already generated $19.08 million in cumulative investment income from these positions, suggesting an approximate 9.5% return on the initial investment. While this appears positive on the surface, investors should recognize this performance occurred during a period of broader cryptocurrency market strength.

What's particularly notable is the scale of this allocation relative to HOLO's balance sheet. Committing 66% of cash reserves to cryptocurrency derivatives represents a dramatic departure from traditional corporate treasury management practices, which typically prioritize capital preservation through diverse, low-risk instruments.

The remaining cash ($103 million) is earmarked for technology development across blockchain, quantum computing, holography, and AI-AR integration. This dual strategy of aggressive crypto exposure alongside core technology investment creates a hybrid business model—part technology company, part crypto investment vehicle.

HOLO's strategy diverges significantly from most public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, as those firms typically allocate a much smaller percentage of reserves. This approach introduces substantial volatility risk to HOLO's financial foundation, potentially impacting its ability to fund operations and R&D should cryptocurrency markets experience prolonged downturns.

Investors should carefully evaluate whether this represents prudent diversification or an overconcentration in speculative assets that fundamentally alters the company's risk profile.

SHENZHEN, China, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ: HOLO), (""HOLO"" or the ""Company""), a technology service provider, announced that they have purchased up to $200 million in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. As of Jun. 03, the  cumulative investment income has reached $19.08 million. HOLO currently holds $303 million in cash reserves. The company plans to allocate these $303 million reserves toward derivatives and technology development in cutting-edge fields such as Bitcoin-related blockchain, quantum computing, quantum holography, and AI-powered AR.This move marks HOLO's further exploration and practice in the cryptocurrency sector while also demonstrating its determination and strategic vision for future business expansion.

The purchased Bitcoin and its derivatives this time will be incorporated into HOLO's capital reserve strategy, aiming to enhance the company's financial stability and long-term growth potential through diversified investments. HOLO stated that purchasing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency derivatives is a key initiative in its exploration of the cryptocurrency market, helping it gain insights into market mechanisms, price fluctuations, and investment strategies. Through this plan, HOLO seeks to accumulate valuable experience for future business expansion and capital operations in the cryptocurrency sector.

The company currently holds approximately $303 million in cash reserves. The allocated funds of up to $200 million will primarily be used to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with significant market influence and growth potential, as well as related securities derivatives. These assets will become a crucial part of HOLO's financial reserves, helping to enhance the diversity and risk resilience of its overall asset portfolio. Meanwhile, HOLO also announced that its the  cumulative investment income have now reached $19.08 million. This figure highlights HOLO's commitment to maintaining a strong financial position while also striving to create long-term value for its shareholders. HOLO emphasized that it will continue to uphold a prudent business strategy, enhance profitability and market competitiveness, and generate greater returns for its shareholders.

As a technology service provider, HOLO has also achieved significant breakthroughs in quantum system research and large-scale DeepSeek integration. These technological innovations not only provide strong support for HOLO's investments in the cryptocurrency sector but also lay a solid foundation for its future business expansion.

With the continuous growth of the cryptocurrency market, more and more enterprises are entering this field. As one of the pioneers, HOLO's investment decisions and strategic planning will undoubtedly serve as a model for other companies. Moving forward, HOLO will continue to explore and advance in the cryptocurrency sector, creating greater value for its shareholders while making a positive contribution to the overall development of the industry.

Bitcoin is regaining after a week of losses, rising back above $106,000 as of this writing—but top meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) is up more on the day, while Pepe (PEPE) and other less-valuable meme coins are sizably outperforming the top coin in terms of daily gains.

DOGE and PEPE, both among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, have gained 3% and 9% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin has climbed about 2% in that time. 

But while the top memes are leading BTC, they're severely underperforming a basket of established Solana-based animal meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF), Popcat (POPCAT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Moo Deng (MOODENG), all which are beginning a rebound off double-digit percentage losses in the last 7 days.

Each member of the group has gained at least 10% in the last 24 hours, led by WIF, which has jumped 20% to $1.02. That's still nearly 79% off its March 2024 all-time high of $4.83, however.

The group, which all earned centralized exchange listings during last year's Solana meme coin frenzy, have also experienced trading volume increases during the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.

Beyond Solana, other established meme coins are leading the charge higher on their respective chains. The Ethereum-based SPX6900, a token which was created with the intention of flipping the S&P 500 in market cap, is up 12.9% to a $1.04 billion market cap—and unlike other meme coins, has actually gained in the last week. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index maintains a total market capitalization of around $47.5 trillion.

Ethereum's Mog Coin (MOG) has also added 15.5% in the last 24 hours. Newer meme coin ecosystems are joining the party too, with Hyperliquid's PURR token gaining nearly 38.7% in the last 24 hours.

All this comes while the meme coin category has managed just a 3.1% gain during that time, and remains down nearly 10% over the last week.

Even though Bitcoin has started its rise once more, Bitcoin dominance—or its market capitalization relative to the entire crypto market cap—has fallen to 64.15%. That's a drop of around 0.16%, and further off the four-year high it marked one month ago as memes and alts outperform.

Bitcoin ETF redemptions have surpassed $1.2 billion over the past three days as Ethereum ETFs marked their 12th day in the green on Monday. Analysts see this as BTC fund investors using recent all-time high prices to take profits while institutional momentum keeps building for ETH.

Bitcoin ETFs saw $268 million in outflows on Monday, according to data from Farside Investors.

""In contrast, Ethereum [funds] recorded $78 million in inflows, marking a 12-day streak totaling $634 million—the strongest accumulation trend since ETF approval,"" wrote BRN analyst Valentin Fournier. ""This flow divergence highlights growing institutional interest in ETH, while suggesting sustained profit-taking on BTC, especially as retail demand stays muted.""

Ethereum co-founder and Consensys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin sent another celebratory message about publicly traded gaming company SharpLink Gaming, which completed a $425 million investment round that it will use to fuel its new Ethereum treasury reserve. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

""Soon, stablecoins will replace dollars in global settlement. Public markets are beginning to understand this. We're proud to lead a $425 million private placement into SharpLink ($SBET) to bring Ethereum exposure to traditional capital markets,"" he wrote on X.

The global economy is digitizing. Every institution, corporation, and country runs on fragmented, bespoke infrastructure.  What the internet did for information, Ethereum is doing for value: A shared, open standard for programmable money. 

🧵 https://t.co/3KEuOEONA7

— Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) June 3, 2025



It's worth pointing out, though, that SBET has had a rocky start as an Ethereum treasury company. Its share price peaked at $105.59 on Friday, slid to $46.34 yesterday and has now rebounded 29% to $71.60 at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, Ethereum has risen above $2,600 and is currently trading 4.5% higher than it was this time yesterday, according to CoinGecko data. By contrast, Bitcoin has gained 1.8% since yesterday and is currently changing hands for just over $106,000.

Looking at the bigger picture, BRN's Fournier added that market momentum still remains fragile.

""With clear signs of rotational flows into altcoins, we are maintaining a high-risk allocation and tilting further into outperforming assets,"" he wrote.

But specifically for Ethereum, GSR analyst Carlos Guzman said the roadmap for the layer-1 has been inspiring more confidence among investors.

He alluded to Ethereum Foundation co-director Tomasz K. Stańczak saying that the network will grow tenfold in the next year—a sentiment that was echoed by none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

""There was a lot of criticism about [Ethereum] moving slowly and that the layer-2 roadmap not being at the best for it,"" Guzman told Decrypt. ""[The Ethereum Foundation] really shifted their dynamic and communication to prioritize at the L1 layer. Still definitely supporting L2s, but maybe giving more of a little bit of attention as well for the L1.""

Decrypt reporter André Beganski contributed to this report.

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that altcoins may collapse in their Bitcoin (BTC) pairs any moment now.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 900,000 YouTube subscribers that the TOTAL 3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, remains in a downtrend against the flagship crypto asset and has yet to find a market bottom.









“I don't care how great you think your altcoin community is. I don't care if your developers that you follow have not yet rugged you. Altcoins, in my opinion, are oscillators at best against Bitcoin, and many of them just bleed to Bitcoin. So if individually altcoins will bleed to Bitcoin, then collectively they should as well, and that's the reason why I think alt/Bitcoin pairs will eventually find themselves down here [at 0.25]. I think it's just a matter of time.”

A move toward the support area highlighted by Cowen would signal that altcoins are significantly underperforming Bitcoin.
Cowen also points out that altcoins are in a multi-year downtrend against Bitcoin with no signs of reversing the trend anytime soon.
“I don't know exactly when alt/Bitcoin pairs are going to go to the range lows. I can't tell you that, but what I can say is what you're witnessing is basically the slow conversion of people holding alts and then they are just converting them to Bitcoin… 
The chart tells you what's happening. Alts put in a new low against Bitcoin [on June 1st]. So any prior altseason that was called for, any prior call for a low by alt/Bitcoin pairs up until today was wrong.”
TOTAL3/BTC is currently hovering at 0.33.

Bitcoin continues to showcase resilience in the current cryptocurrency market cycle, consistently setting new records while many altcoins remain below their previous peaks.

Currently trading just above $104,000, Bitcoin has recently retraced from its all-time high above $111,000, set last month. Contrasting Bitcoin's consistent growth, Ethereum and other prominent altcoins have yet to surpass historical highs that they reached several years ago, highlighting a notable divergence in market performance.

This divergence has been a focal point among analysts, prompting a deeper examination of investor behavior and capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins. Recent insights from CryptoQuant analyst Dan suggest that while Bitcoin remains dominant, the situation for altcoins might shift in the upcoming phase of the crypto market cycle.

Bitcoin Investor Behavior Suggests Potential Shift Ahead

CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan recently explored the broader implications of this Bitcoin-dominated cycle in his market commentary. According to Dan's analysis, previous market cycles typically saw a gradual reduction in mid-to-long-term Bitcoin holdings as investor capital redistributed into altcoins.

This shift traditionally drove altcoins significantly higher, usually marking the late stages of a bullish cycle. However, this cycle exhibits a different pattern.

Frequent minor corrections in Bitcoin's price are followed by more significant and sharp downturns for altcoins, demonstrating persistent weakness. Crypto Dan notes that currently, very few altcoin investors have realized meaningful profits, an unusual circumstance compared to prior cycles.

Despite this ongoing difficulty for altcoin holders, the analyst maintains optimism, emphasizing that historical patterns suggest Bitcoin's dominance typically declines towards the end of each cycle.

If history repeats, altcoins might experience substantial upward movements as the cycle approaches its maturity. Thus, while altcoins currently underperform, investors are advised to maintain patience until Bitcoin's momentum reaches its final bullish push, potentially signaling a turning point.

Whale Activities Hint at Upcoming Altcoin Attention

Complementing this perspective, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Maartunn, provided insights into stablecoin inflows to major exchanges.

Specifically, Maartunn highlighted that over 75% of Tether (USDT) deposits to Binance, tracked via the TRC-20 network, originated from large wallets, commonly known as whales, since November 2023.

Over 75% of USDT Inflows to Binance Are from Whales

“The data shows a clear trend: whales prefer Binance. Since November 2023, approximately 75% of total USDT deposits to Binance have originated from whale addresses.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/KCBA8cVCdb

This substantial concentration of whale activity suggests that major market participants prefer Binance for significant capital movements involving stablecoins.

The notable whale-driven inflows to Binance could indicate preparation for substantial market activity, including potential purchasing of Bitcoin or an eventual shift towards altcoins.

Historically, stablecoin deposits from large holders precede increased volatility and trading activity, as whales position themselves strategically in anticipation of market shifts.

Over the past few weeks, the crypto market has slowly recovered from its previously extended bear cycle, with the Bitcoin price making new all-time highs and Ethereum surging to unexpected levels. Now, bold predictions of a new price peak and a possibly parabolic altcoin season are spreading, with a crypto analyst forecasting Bitcoin climbing to $200,000 and Ethereum hitting $10,000. 

The Bitcoin price is on a trajectory toward $200,00,0, and Ethereum could reach $10,000 by the end of 2025, according to market expert Ash Crypto. This bold prediction is backed by market signals that suggest that the next phase of the crypto bull cycle is accelerating. 

After months of sideways consolidation, the market appears to be on the verge of a massive upward move, and Ash Crypto believes that this will not only be a breakout for top assets but also the beginning of a full-scale altcoin season. Historically, strong rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum act as precursors to altcoin surges, with capital rotating back from large-cap coins into smaller, high-potential tokens. 

As the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) tops, altcoins typically begin outperforming, delivering exponential gains in short timeframes. During the last bull cycle, Ethereum skyrocketed to new all-time highs, leading the altcoin market and paving the way for other cryptocurrencies to surge.

Current data shows that similar patterns are forming, indicating that the altcoin cycle could begin as soon as BTC and ETH break through key resistance levels and reach their highest levels yet. 

The message to investors and traders by Ash Crypto is to “not get shaken out and not sell early”. He highlights that selling at current levels, especially after enduring deep drawdowns, would be premature. 

Presently, Bitcoin is roughly 50% below its projected target of $200,000, while Ethereum still trades well under $5,000. At the same time, many altcoins are trading 70-90% below their previous highs, presenting a rare opportunity for high-risk and high-reward plays.

As Bitcoin and Ethereum set the stage, Ash Crypto is projecting 10x to 20x returns on select assets, particularly those with strong utility, active development, real-world use cases, and a vibrant and supportive community. 

Sharing similar sentiments about an impending altcoin season, market expert CryptoElites announced on X that the Bitcoin Dominance has officially reached a peak. The analyst shared a chart with BTC.D sitting at a high of 64.35%, indicating that altcoins may be preparing to skyrocket. 

Notably, after the Bitcoin Dominance reached critical resistance zones and peaked in 2021 and 2019, altcoins outperformed significantly. The analyst's chart shows that altcoins jumped by a whopping 50x in 2021, as capital rotated out of BTC. 

Now, in 2025, BTC.D has reportedly reached its highest price around similar key resistance levels. If it tops out and reverses just like before, CryptoElites predicts that a new altcoin season will begin, potentially paving the way for another 50x gains in select cryptocurrencies.

 ChatGPT and Grok can help you analyze altcoins, compare projects, and stay ahead in crypto research. 

Investments in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market require real-time insights and efficient research. With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. 

AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. 

This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.

Both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. 

You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. 

Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.

On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.

ChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. 

With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:

Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”

Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project's breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” 

Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”

Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. 

Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.

ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. 

For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” 

Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:

And this is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.

To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: 

“Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” 

Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:

Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:

These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.

Did you know? Elon Musk's Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.

Developer traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin's long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.

You could use prompts like:

“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”

You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:

“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”

ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:

Here is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:

“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”

Here is ChatGPT 4o's response for this prompt:

This is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.

For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.

AI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.

When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.

Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.

In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.

 Paris-based Blockchain Group acquired $68 million in Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC amid rising institutional interest in crypto treasury strategies. 

Paris-based cryptocurrency firm Blockchain Group has acquired $68 million of Bitcoin, joining a growing wave of European institutions adding BTC to their balance sheets.

The Blockchain Group, which claims to be Europe's first Bitcoin treasury firm, has acquired 624 Bitcoin (BTC) for 60.2 million euros ($68.7 million).

The latest acquisition brings the firm's total holdings to 1,471 Bitcoin, or over $154 million, with a BTC yield of 1,097.6% YTD, the Blockchain Group announced in a June 3 X post. 

Institutional interest has grown since the US approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024, introducing the first fully regulated BTC investment vehicles for traditional investors.  

Corporate appetite saw another significant uptick on March 7 after US President Donald Trump issued an executive order outlining a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using crypto seized in criminal cases.

Despite Bitcoin's economic model favoring the early adopters, only a few European companies have displayed Bitcoin treasury ambitions. These include French banking giant BNP Paribas, Swiss firm 21Shares AG, VanEck Europe, Malta-based Jacobi Asset Management and Austrian fintech firm Bitpanda.

The Czech National Bank has also publicly explored using Bitcoin as a diversification strategy for its foreign exchange reserves.

In the market, Bitcoin is set to “consolidate between $103,000 and $108,000” after reaching the $112,000 all-time high on May 22, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.

“Still, onchain data shows continued whale accumulation, which shows a bullish signal; this frames any further corrections as a potential entry point,” the analyst told Cointelegraph.

Bitcoin treasury firms like Michael Saylor's Strategy have spearheaded global Bitcoin adoption efforts.

Strategy, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over $60.5 billion worth of BTC, is now about $8.3 billion away from surpassing BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, currently worth over $68.9 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence.

Strategy bought $75 million worth of Bitcoin between May 26 and 30, at an average price of $106,495 per BTC.

On June 2, Strategy announced plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stocks to fund its future Bitcoin acquisitions.

Meanwhile, Metaplanet, also known as “Asia's MicroStrategy,” became the world's eighth-largest Bitcoin holder after a $118 million Bitcoin investment on June 2, Cointelegraph reported.

Dimitra, a blockchain-based agricultural technology company, has partnered with Layer 1 blockchain platform MANTRA to bring real-world agricultural assets on-chain.

Jon Trask, Dimitra's founder CEO, told CoinDesk at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas last week that the partnership aims to eventually bring a billion dollars worth of agricultural assets, starting with cacao in Brazil and carbon credits in Mexico, onto MANTRA's blockchain.

Trask added that the two pilot projects with MANTRA are currently small in scale — in Brazil, only 25 of the 374 cocoa farmers in Brazil's so-called “cocoa pole” in the southern region of Roraima are currently signed up to participate — but could be expanded “indefinitely” with enough investor interest.

Through the partnership, MANTRA holders will be able to invest directly in smallholder farmers, providing funding for a variety of regenerative agricultural projects in a way that is made traceable and verifiable by the blockchain. Trask estimated that investors could see between a 10-30% return on their investments annually, which he clarified was a a projected range based on preliminary modeling — with agriculture comes risks like pests and drought which could impact yield, he added.

Trask said that Dimitra is still in the process of integrating the two pilot programs with MANTRA, but expects that holders of MANTRA's native OM token will be able to invest in the projects within the next couple of months.

Dimitra's announcement comes a month after MANTRA took a beating. Its OM token plummeted 90% in a flash-crash in April. Since the crash, OM has hovered around $0.34 — a far cry from its height of $8.47 in February.

Asked why Dimitra went forward on a partnership with MANTRA following the fallout, Trask said that the deal pre-dated the crash, but admitted it initially gave him pause.

“We made the deal many months ago,” Trask told CoinDesk. “Then they had their crash, and we all took a pause to reassess to ensure we were making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of the community and projects amid a time of volatility.”

But ultimately Trask decided to move forward with the partnership, telling CoinDesk that, when the dust settled, he still found the fundamental reasons for the partnership to hold true: MANTRA had a strong team, he said, the real-world asset (RWA) development was sound, and he was impressed by their virtual asset service provider (VASP) license, granted by Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), which it obtained earlier this year.

MANTRA has done a number of RWA tokenization projects in the Middle East, including tokenizing $500 million worth of real estate in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a Dubai-based real estate group.

“Tokenizing agriculture isn't just about innovation, it's about finding solutions to real-world issues long associated with food supply — at scale — and for long-term impact,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Dimitra is solving real-world problems, with a focus on traceability and transparency — and we're proud to help bring those to a wider audience. MANTRA Chain was built to support projects like these.”

The purchase was executed through Banque Delubac & Cie and Swissquote Bank Europe SA, with custody provided by Swiss infrastructure firm Taurus. The company indicated plans to acquire an additional 60 BTC through ongoing convertible bond issuances from UTXO Management and Moonlight Capital.

The Group's latest acquisition was funded through a €8.6 million capital increase, with participation from investors including TOBAM Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund and Quadrille Capital, alongside a €55.3 million convertible bond issuance to Fulgur Ventures.

The company reported a BTC Gain of 439 BTC year-to-date and a BTC € Gain of approximately €42.3 million, highlighting the growing trend of European corporations diversifying treasury assets into Bitcoin.

At press time, Bitcoin trades at €92,349 ($105,260), as institutional adoption continues to reshape corporate treasury management across Europe and globally.

Guests at last month's Trump meme coin holders dinner were airdropped up to three NFTs, one of which has already sold for approximately $16,000. Even people who registered but didn't make the top 220 cutoff to attend, were given an NFT. Among that category, an NFT has already sold for $4,000.

Despite the big sales, there appears to be no utility for these NFTs. The official TRUMP meme coin X account called them “historic collector's items that celebrate the Crypto President.”

As promised, if you participated in the “Dinner With Trump”, your $TRUMP NFTs are now in your wallet. These NFT's are on Solana. They are historic collector's items that celebrate the Crypto President!

— TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) June 2, 2025



The Trump gala dinner took place in May and was open to the top 220 holders of the official meme coin of the President of the United States. It was held at his National Golf Club in Washington, D.C.. Outside the event, more than 100 demonstrators protested the dinner calling for the end of “crypto corruption.” And high-ranking U.S. Democrats claimed that the event could open the door to foreign actors to buy political influence through the meme coin.

But that didn't stop the event from happening. Some attendees relished the hour that President Trump was present. While others were disappointed by the absence of one-on-one Trump time and appalled by the “cheap steak” that was served.

It took almost two weeks for the attendees to receive the limited-edition NFTs for attending and holding the tokens.

There are three different NFTs, sent depending on how dedicated to the meme coin the recipient was. The “Power to the Holders” NFT was sent to 1,049 addresses and appears to be the bottom tier collectible shared with people who registered for, but didn't necessarily attend, the dinner. The “Gold Gala Dinner” NFT was sent to 219 addresses belonging to people who attended the event.

Finally, 118 “Diamond Hands” NFTs were sent to those that held their tokens throughout the dinner, according to the official Trump meme coin X account.

People like Morten Christensen, founder of AirdropAlert, bought a hefty bag of TRUMP tokens on the spot market, thus qualifying for the dinner, while also shorting the same amount elsewhere to reduce the fluctuation of the meme coin's price.

Christensen sold their supply before the dinner and confirmed to Decrypt they did not receive the Diamond Hands NFT as a result. But they said they did receive the Power to the Holders and Gold Gala Dinner NFTs.

By selling, they've missed out on a potential $16,000 after one Diamond Hands NFT sold for 99.9 SOL late on Monday. This is the only NFT of this class to have sold at the time of writing.

As for the other rarities, the Gold Gala Dinner NFT collection has a floor price of 48.15 SOL ($7,700) while the Power to the Holders collection floor price sits at 7.6 SOL ($1,200),  according to Magic Eden.

One X user suggested that Diamond Hands holders should be invited to play a round of golf at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. To this, the official TRUMP meme coin account responded, “that would be awesome.”

The month of May held a bitter surprise for NFT supporters. While Bitcoin shone with a notable increase in its volumes in the non-fungible token market, the entire sector sank into a new phase of decline. Proof that the health of a flagship asset is not always enough to lift an entire ecosystem upwards.

There is something ironic about seeing a market welcoming more buyers… while selling less. In May, non-fungible tokens recorded $474 million in sales, a drop of 21.25% compared to April.

Yet, the number of buyers rose by 16.45%, and sellers too, though more modestly (+1.57%). This paradox illustrates a troubling dynamic: a growing audience, but slowing transactions.

Moreover, this decline does not only affect smaller chains. Even Ethereum, still the undisputed number one in volume, saw its sales fall by nearly 21%, stabilizing around $140 million.

Diversification was not enough to stem the decline: Polygon, often touted as a dynamic alternative, saw its volumes collapse by 47.38%. A disenchantment that seems more structural than cyclical.

While most blockchains retreat, Bitcoin shows a 20.16% growth in the NFT sector, reaching $74.5 million in May. A figure all the more impressive given that Bitcoin-backed NFTs are relatively recent on the scene.

The Ordinals protocol and related innovations have allowed the Bitcoin ecosystem to quickly establish itself as a credible player in this segment long dominated by Ethereum.

Even more spectacular: the meteoric rise of Avalanche. With an increase of over 1200%, Avalanche emerges as the surprise of the month.

This explosion is largely driven by the launch of the XSY Deposit project, which alone generated more than $30 million. This once again proves that a single flagship project can revitalize an entire blockchain—at least temporarily.

What May highlights is that it is no longer necessarily the blockchains pushing the momentum, but the collections themselves. Courtyard, on Polygon, dominated the rankings with nearly $60 million. Dmarket (Polkadot/Mythos) was close behind, and XSY Deposit rounded out the podium. As for Doodles, its 226% rise proves that storytelling and community effect can still work miracles.

This shift of power—from infrastructures to projects—underlines the NFT market's growing maturity. It is no longer enough to have a fast or cheap blockchain; you need to offer an experience, a universe, a rarity that attracts.

Bitcoin is increasingly establishing itself in a sector once far from its initial DNA. At this pace, it could soon surpass Solana in terms of cumulative NFT sales. But will that be enough to reverse the overall trend? Nothing is less certain. Because while the spotlight shines on isolated successes, the overall scene remains gloomy.

Bitcoin's progression in the NFT world is undeniable, but it struggles to mask market fatigue signs. Overall volume is declining, speculation concentrates on a few niches: the market specializes and fragments. In this landscape undergoing major reshaping, SharpLink surprises by betting one billion dollars on Ether, briefly rekindling investor enthusiasm. Still, this isolated impulse does not answer the real question: are we facing healthy consolidation… or the prelude to a gradual disengagement of the general public?

Technology has hidden side effects -- we reveal them here

Organized digital criminals have found another vulnerable group to attack: artists.  Using the confusion and buzz around crypto and NFTs, they are approaching artists with tempting partnership offers — we'll make and sell NFTs of your work, and you'll earn tidy commissions. But after months of promising messages, and alleged big-ticket sales, the criminals ask the artists to pay taxes and fees and then disappear with the money.

It happened recently to Douglas Newton, a charming artist from Brooklyn who specializes in still-life oil paintings of candy. For a few months last year, he thought he'd stumbled on an amazing way to pay for his grandkids' college after an NFT broker approached him on LinkedIn.  Instead, most of his retirement money was stolen by the NFT criminals. We tell his story in this week's episode of The Perfect Scam. 

I spoke with Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez for this story. Crypto crimes are so rampant — particularly in Brooklyn — that he's set up a special task force.  While investigating Newton's crime, he discovered a series of other artists who'd been hit by the same crime — they were approached about a buyer who wanted an NFT of their art, paid fees, then learned the buyer was fake.

(NFTs — non-fungible tokens — are a part of the crypto universe, a digital representation of a piece of art (or anything, really) that is entered into the blockchain to prove it's a one-of-a-kind creation.  Some people think NFTs will be valuable one day. I don't. I do think they are another great playground for criminals and speculators.)

Experts constantly give trite advice like, “You should never pay money to make money,” but when you are in a small business, that's not an option. Artists, like others in small businesses, have to take small leaps of faith like this all the time. And of course, hearing the words, “I want to buy your painting,” can send even the most level-headed artist into a romantic fever.  So that makes artists particularly vulnerable to crypto/NFT scams. I hope you'll communicate this warning to anyone you know who makes and sells artwork online, even if it's just a passion project. Also, as a society, we really need to protect our artists from scams.  Douglas' work is beautiful and I'd hate for artists like him to get so discouraged that they stop creating and sharing their work.

——————-Partial transcript————————-

[00:10:09] Douglas Newton: And I just wasn't crazy about the idea, but I was approached on LinkedIn by a woman. Her name was Ernestine Vigil. She lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She said she liked my work, you know, and she would like to convert one of them to an NFT and sell them.

[00:10:31] Bob: So Douglas trades LinkedIn messages with Ernestine for a while.

[00:10:35] Douglas Newton: Well, I was intrigued because she said, you know, I can sell this, this thing and she picked a, a work out of my website. It was actually a pastel drawing of just two people I'd done in, in a life drawing class, and she said she can sell it.

[00:10:55] Bob: And critically, she was absorbing the expense of making the NFT, a few hundred dollars, and do all the legwork. So what's the risk? Douglas gives her permission.

[00:11:06] Douglas Newton: Go ahead, and go, they sent me a contract actually, a paper contract that I filled out and mailed back. She didn't flatter me too much, it was more like, this, we just have to do this, and we just have to do that, and then you're going to get a lot of money, and it kept going up.

[00:11:26] Bob: So he fills in the paperwork, sets up a crypto account as she told him to do. About two months go by and then Douglas hears from her again with amazing news.

[00:11:37] Douglas Newton: I thought, you know I'd be, I'd be happy to sell it for $1000, the actual thing, or less even. It's just a drawing, and a pastel drawing, and uh, she said I, she could sell it for $49,000, and then she told me it had sold for $49,000.

[00:11:55] Bob: She sold the NFT for $49,000?! That's amazing.

[00:12:02] Douglas Newton: It was like free money because I, I hadn't expected to even sell the thing, you know. I thought, oh I'm going to surprise my family with all this money that's suddenly appeared. And I kept it a secret from the beginning.

[00:12:17] Bob: Well you, you probably were imagining, you know, what, you could pay for college for the kid or, or…

[00:12:22] Douglas Newton: Yeah! Oh yeah, yeah, I would do re–, repairs on the house. Not that it needs that much, but you know, just lots of extra money. It was wonderful.

[00:12:33] Bob: But then, after a couple more months pass, the news gets even more wonderful. The NFT has been sold again, resold actually for even more money, so now he's entitled to eventually more than $300,000.

[00:12:49] Douglas Newton: I said, “Great, where's the money?” And then she said, “Oh, by the… it sold, it's resold for much more, but you have to pay the sales tax and the, what they call internet fees.” They call them “gas” in the trade, internet fees. And so she started asking me for money.

[00:13:12] Bob: The requests are small at first, just a thousand dollars for sales tax and internet fees. Douglas sends that to her using his new cryptocurrency account. Then she needs several thousand more. And as the days go by, the requests and fees keep going up. Douglas doesn't have that kind of cash lying around.

[00:13:32] Douglas Newton: I ended up getting a, a personal loan at Citibank for $4000, and I ended up maxing out a couple of credit cards.

[00:13:41] Bob: He would send the money to this agent using PayPal, but that had limitations. Ernestine asked him to send money almost daily for several weeks until…

[00:13:53] Douglas Newton: I can't remember the exact figures, but it was like $2000 a day they would let me do. And somehow, I worked my way through $100,000.

[00:14:03] Bob: Just to give me a, an example, at one point she calls and says, “Great news. Now it's been sold for $150,000, but you need to put up $20,000.” Or you tell me, what, what kind of numbers would…

[00:14:14] Douglas Newton: That's exactly how it went. It was uh, we were conversing on LinkedIn back and forth. I never talked to her on the phone. It was all on LinkedIn and later on we switched to email for some unknown reason.

[00:14:31] Bob: Douglas has maxed out his credit card so he turns to the only other source of funds he has in his quest to get this NFT windfall released.

[00:14:41] Douglas Newton: And I was just selling all this, all these IRAs getting them into Citibank, getting the money into Citibank, and then converting them.

[00:14:50] Bob: What was the largest single dollar amount she asked for? Do you remember?

[00:14:54] Douglas Newton: Oh, it must be about 20 or something like that.

[00:15:00] Bob: But all the while, he thinks he has a huge payout coming. In fact, his cryptocurrency website shows just that.

[00:15:07] Douglas Newton: By the time it was over, she said I was going to get $310,000.

[00:15:14] Bob: You could look at an account and it looked like you had $300,000 worth of bitcoin there, right?

[00:15:20] Douglas Newton: Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. 310. I had to pay another $10,000 to get the key to unlock the money. That was the last thing they wanted me to do. Some, some sort of a key that would unlock the money.

[00:15:37] Bob: And all this is so tantalizing, right? Because they kept saying just pay this little bit more and you can unlock all this money.

[00:15:43] Douglas Newton: Yeah. I hate to admit it, but I sent all my IRAs at Vanguard to them.

[00:15:50] Bob: While all this is going on, Douglas doesn't tell his family. The whole time he's hoping he can surprise them with this windfall. But after that last request, haunting doubts creep into his mind.

[00:16:03] Douglas Newton: Over months, I kept this a secret, I kept thinking, this must be a scam but I would look it up on the internet and I didn't get any definitive proof that it was. It was like a nightmare. It, it was a horrible experience, it really was. Kind of the worst thing that ever happened to me.

[00:16:20] Bob: Oh God, I'm so sorry.

[00:16:23] Douglas Newton: Yeah, and I just, and I kept it a secret and I really thought I would surprise my family with $310,000, until they asked me for more money than I had in my IRAs at Vanguard, and at that point I just, something dawned on me, and I just realized that you know I, I didn't have any more money to give them, and it was that I was being scammed. I really realized, it took that for me to realize that I was being scammed.

[00:16:54] Bob: The feeling is devastating.

[00:16:59] Douglas Newton: Just the fact that I would spend all this money and nothing, nothing real ever happened, just promises. I remember waking up late at night thinking about this and going on the computer and googling everything I could think of. I never found anything definite, you know, like some other person who'd been scammed by them. I couldn't find it. But I had a lot of doubts and gradually the doubts got bigger than the hope, and uh when they asked for that last, last $10,000, which I did not have, then I, I confessed everything to my wife and my kids and uh, that, that was a really bad day.

[00:17:40] Bob: A really, really bad day.

[00:17:44] Bob: Can we talk about the day you had to tell your, your family? What was that like?

[00:17:47] Douglas Newton: Oh, it was horrible. It was just horrible. And they couldn't believe it at first, and then I, you know I, I showed them the numbers.

[00:17:56] Bob: Douglas' son ends up traveling home to help his dad deal with the fallout.

[00:18:02] Douglas Newton: My son lives in Vermont, and he came down and together we tried to do something. So we, we went to the police. We went to the Brooklyn DA, who were all very helpful, but they said this money's gone. You're not going to get it back. And they, they traced some of the calls, the emails I sent and they thought the money went to Europe, and then eventually Nigeria, imagine. Well I could imagine. But to Germany and other countries that it was part of a whole gang of people. She was just the representative, I'm sure working on a percentage.

[00:18:42] Bob: The Brooklyn DA is Eric Gonzalez, and he's taken a particular interest in NFT and crypto scams. There's even a task force — we'll get to that — but he tries to help Douglas as best he can.

[00:18:55] DA Eric Gonzalez: I think in this particular case that we're, we're talking about an 85-year-old victim had really invested his life savings in trying to recoup money, monies that he thought he had earned by selling his NFTs online. W met him when he came into the office.

[00:19:16] Bob: And it's a good thing he did report it because when the Brooklyn DA investigates, he finds out other artists have also been victims of these same criminals.

Mintable is set to launch NFT collectibles as part of its interactive Eco Trail Treasure Hunt ahead of the country's annual Youth4Climate Festival 2025, as part of the Singapore Sustainability Festival.

The Singaporean NFT marketplace is preparing to launch five unique NFTs that visitors can collect by participating in a blockchain-based card game held at City Square Mall on Kitchener Road, Singapore. The Eco Adventure card game will run alongside the Singapore Sustainability Festival, scheduled from June 6 to June 8.

During the festival's run, participants will be able to collect digital badges that they can obtain by scanning eco-friendly installations throughout the mall and completing mini sustainability lessons. Once completed, participants will be able to collect up to five unique NFT collectibles dubbed “Green Stop” NFTs without prior web3 knowledge needed. 

Partnering with City Developments Limited, the Singapore Innovation Centre, the Asia Blockchain Association, and the Sustainability Alliance, Mintable's B2B utility NFT arm, Mintology, will power the Eco Adventure card game using blockchain. The initiative leverages the project's gasless NFT infrastructure.

Mintable CEO Zach Burks sees the joint campaign with Go Green SG as an opportunity to engage young people and spark interest in sustainability. The program also introduces them to web3 technology, including NFTs, by taking a “balanced approach” and promoting healthy attitudes toward digital innovation.

“We are excited by the potential of the gasless minting technology deployed into the treasure hunt and will continue working with key government bodies to build future solutions that help everyday individuals better interact with the world around them,” said Burks.

The mini sustainability lessons cover topics such as upcycling workshops, materials exploration, the importance of trees, and the impact of visual upcycled art in society. All lessons are designed to be kid-friendly and interactive, integrating Mintable's web3 technology with real-world engagement.

Participants who collect all five NFTs will be eligible to enter the festival's lucky draw for a chance to win prizes. The joint campaign aims to demonstrate how NFTs can be seamlessly integrated into government-supported green initiatives while boosting the adoption of web3 technology.

According to the country's Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index 2025, crypto ownership in Singapore has fallen by 11%. A survey conducted by Independent Reserve Singapore found that nearly 50% of crypto investors have sold their holdings in the past year, with 67% of them making a profit.

The ICO will relocate its head office to Manchester in autumn 2026. 

We will be moving to the Circle Square development on Oxford Road.   

The ICO's head office has been in Wilmslow since our foundation forty years ago. The decision to move follows a detailed review of options, ahead of the upcoming expiration of the lease on our current office at Wycliffe House.  

Jen Green, Executive Director – Strategy and Resources yesterday said:

“Our relocation to Circle Square will create a working environment that better supports how we operate now and into the future. The new space will provide a more flexible, collaborative setting for our teams, with improved access to the facilities and connections we need. 

“Wilmslow has been a welcome home for the ICO for 40 years, and we will continue to have a small presence in the area beyond next year. Moving to Manchester puts us close to universities and other organisations working in data and digital, and will also support our efforts to attract new and diverse talent and strengthen the way we engage with the wider sector.” 

 

We have issued a reprimand to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) following failures in its storage and handling of CCTV footage

Transparency is the cornerstone of accountability, and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) is designed to increase transparency. But this legislation isn't just about responding to requests; public authorities must also publish information proactively. This allows the public to routinely access information that is in the public interest and is safe to disclose. 

We have reprimanded the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (the council) after it left exposed the personal information of 6,528 people for almost two years.  

We have fined Newcastle based sole trader Darian Bishop, trading as ECO4U, £50,000 for making over 194,000 unlawful marketing calls to people on the UK's 'do not call' register.

ICO, the UK's data and info regulator, is moving its HQ to 20,000 sq ft at No.3 Circle Square.

The UK's independent data protection and freedom of information regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), is set to relocate its headquarters to Manchester city centre, having agreed a lease for 20,000 sq ft of high-quality workspace at Bruntwood SciTech's No.3 Circle Square.

A landmark development at the heart of the city's knowledge quarter, the £87 million, 267,000 sq ft innovation hub is the latest phase of the Circle Square neighbourhood to be brought forward. The building is being delivered by Bruntwood SciTech, the UK's largest property platform dedicated to the growth of the innovation, tech, and science sectors, in a joint venture between Bruntwood, L&G and Greater Manchester Pension Fund.

The ICO plays a vital role in empowering people through information. The move from the regulator's base which it has held since being founded, in Wilmslow, Cheshire, will see it establish its new national headquarters within the 15-storey development. The ICO expects to move to Manchester in autumn 2026. 

Relocating to the Oxford Road Corridor places the regulator at the heart of one of Europe's most dynamic knowledge quarters, offering direct access to Manchester's world-leading universities, a highly skilled graduate talent pool, and a vibrant urban environment. The move supports the organisation's ambition to access a broader and more diverse talent pool, enabled by Manchester's excellent connectivity and position at the heart of a vibrant, tech-driven community at Circle Square. Alongside its flexible floorplates, No.3 Circle Square has been designed to promote collaboration, support flexible ways of working, and enhance employee wellbeing.

The ICO's arrival at this growing community follows a series of significant moves that continue to drive momentum. This includes global sportswear brand PUMA, which is relocating its UK headquarters to No.3 Circle Square, and Auto Trader, the UK's largest digital automotive marketplace, which has committed to seven floors within the same building.

It joins an established cluster of innovation-led businesses already based at Circle Square, including Avalere Health, Roku, BlueSkeye AI, and HP Enterprise, as well as those located in the dedicated startup Tech Incubator – all contributing to a thriving ecosystem of technology, health, digital and creative leaders. This growing collective of global brands, scale-ups and pioneering start-ups reflects Circle Square's position as one of the UK's most vibrant and collaborative destinations for innovation.

The development of No.3 Circle Square follows the successful completion of the fully-let No.1 and No.2 Circle Square and forms part of an ongoing £243 million investment across seven assets currently being built or undergoing refurbishment in Manchester city centre by Bruntwood SciTech, including Pall Mall, King's House, 117-119 Portland Street, and Greenheys at Manchester Science Park, as well as Citylabs 4.0, which officially opened its doors in March.

No.3 Circle Square will include a shared roof terrace with expansive views across the city, breakout spaces and lounges, 24/7 access with high-speed connectivity, dedicated onsite security, and access to on-site meeting rooms.

Wellbeing and active travel have also been prioritised, with a bespoke gym, secure bike storage and high-quality shower and changing facilities also included. The building will also open onto Symphony Gardens; a newly landscaped space designed to complement the neighbouring Symphony Park and promote biodiversity and provide access to shared green space at Circle Square. 

A joint venture between Bruntwood SciTech and Vita Group, the Circle Square neighbourhood also offers more than 100,000 sq ft of retail and leisure space, including Manchester-favourite Onda Pasta Bar, North Tap Room, Half Dozen Other and Federal Cafe Bar.

Sustainability is one of the core principles in the design of No.3 Circle Square as part of Bruntwood SciTech's net zero carbon commitments. The building will be net zero carbon in both its construction and operation of its communal spaces, and is expected to achieve BREEAM Excellent status, as well as a NABERS 5-star rating and an EPC A rating. Its innovative features to maximise energy efficiency and improve fresh air and climate control for those within the building include an all-electric heating system with state-of-the-art heat pumps, roof mounted solar panelling, a smart Building Management System (BMS) and local Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) units.

Josh Whiteley, Commercial Director, Bruntwood SciTech, said: “This latest commitment underlines our vision for Circle Square as a destination of national significance for digital, data and technology-led organisations. The ICO's decision to relocate its UK headquarters here reflects the strength of Manchester's knowledge economy and the value of being part of a dynamic innovation community.

“At Circle Square we've created an environment that brings together forward-thinking businesses, academic institutions and emerging talent in a place purpose-built for collaboration and growth. Whether they're global leaders or scaling disruptors, our customers benefit from access to tailored support, a connected ecosystem, and workspace designed to meet the needs of modern, mission-driven organisations.

“Manchester has long been recognised as one of the UK's most ambitious and innovative cities – and this letting further reinforces its position as a hub for data, digital services and policy leadership. It's also a significant milestone in Bruntwood SciTech's mission to support the UK's knowledge economy through long-term, place-based investment – ensuring that businesses have the infrastructure and community they need to thrive.”

Jen Green, Executive Director – Strategy and Resources at ICO, said: “Our relocation to Circle Square will create a working environment that better supports how we operate now and into the future. The new space will provide a more flexible, collaborative setting for our teams, with improved access to the facilities and connections we need.

“Wilmslow has been a welcome home for the ICO for 40 years, and we will continue to have a small presence in the area beyond next year. Moving to Manchester puts us close to universities and other organisations working in data and digital, and will also support our efforts to attract new and diverse talent and strengthen the way we engage with the wider sector.”

Councillor Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council, said: “We welcome the ICO's decision to make Manchester its new national headquarters. It is further evidence of how attractive our city – with a huge talent pool, access to expertise including from our world class universities, and national and global connections – is proving to employers considering the best place to be. This move underlines Manchester's momentum and how Circle Square, which has recently also attracted Puma's national headquarters, is contributing to it.” 

Manchester Museum has been recognised as one of Europe's leading museums after winning the European Museum of the Year Award 2025.

A new railway connecting Liverpool and Manchester could kickstart a £90bn economic transformation across the North West – and help reshape how major infrastructure is delivered in the UK.

Greenheys tops out at Manchester Science Park, set to deliver cutting-edge lab space and a new HQ for UK Biobank's vital research.

              Highlights            



                        Companies across payments and banking are moving forward with stablecoin initiatives, balancing innovation with regulatory risk in anticipation of clearer federal guidance.                      


                        The U.S. administration is signaling a friendlier approach to crypto, evidenced by dropped SEC cases and public endorsements of stablecoin legislation, suggesting potential regulatory breakthroughs.                      


                        Despite growing political momentum and two proposed bills (the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts), the U.S. crypto regulatory landscape remains unclear, leaving financial institutions uncertain about how to proceed with digital asset integration.                      

The only thing more complicated than paying with cryptocurrency appears to be regulating it.

Despite Washington inching closer to policy clarity for digital assets since President Donald Trump's reelection, crypto rulemaking in the United States remains as fluid and uncertain as ever.

The industry's hopes lie in two legislative packages, the GENIUS Act and the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which, respectively, propose first-of-their-kind federal regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and digital asset financial markets. If the bills eventually make their way to Trump's desk, they could provide clarity to traditional financial players and incumbents as well as FinTechs and more spear-tip ecosystem players, many of whom are already chomping at the bit for a piece of the potential U.S. digital asset marketplace.

Meanwhile, federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are adjusting their postures in real time, with implications for custody, payments and compliance operations in the traditional financial sector.

The executive branch has not been shy about its own embrace of the crypto sector. Speaking at an industry event last week, Vice President J.D. Vance highlighted the sitting administration's priorities: dismantling restrictive policies, enacting stablecoin legislation, and establishing a comprehensive market structure for digital assets.

Still, the GENIUS Act, which was once promised by Memorial Day, is still working its way through Washington; and the CLARITY Act likely faces a similarly winding journey. In the meantime, existing payments and financial players may find themselves caught in an inflection point: lay the groundwork for blockchain integrations or take a wait-and-see approach.

For over a decade, cryptocurrency has largely operated on the fringes of finance — volatile, speculative and unruly. As regulation looms, the hope of the industry is that all that is about to change. In a sign of the changing times, the SEC dismissed its civil enforcement action Thursday (May 29) against entities associated with the Binance crypto exchange, as well as its billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao.

The agency dropped or paused multiple legal actions against crypto companies, but opposed certain unregistered staking protocols, signaling a pragmatic view toward the industry's various offerings.

“There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS in April. “This is not a confrontational posture.”

“The obvious growth in stablecoins and the fact that you have a lot of issuers ready to be fully compliant, it's a hard argument for Congress to ignore,” Boyle added.

The marketplace is responding in turn. Stablecoin issuer Circle upsized its initial public offering (IPO) Monday (June 2), raising the expected price from the $24 to $26 per share it announced Tuesday (May 27) to $27 to $28 per share.

Meanwhile, payments firm Stripe reportedly held initial talks with banks about using stablecoins. Stripe is among several companies in the FinTech space — including PayPal, FIS and Fiserv — that are using stablecoins as a method of payment; not just something used in crypto trading.

Worldpay teamed with cryptocurrency bank BNVK Tuesday to promote stablecoin payouts; while stablecoin-focused cross-border payments platform Conduit announced Wednesday (May 28) that it raised $36 million in new funding.

For traditional payment providers and settlement institutions, this creates a paradox. On one hand, stablecoins offer faster and cheaper settlement, potentially unlocking efficiencies in cross-border payments. On the other hand, without clear regulatory cover, stablecoin use exposes banks to counterparty and reputational risks.

The uncertainty plaguing today's operating landscape can also be a headwind to experimentation. Data from the PYMNTS Intelligence May 2025 Certainty Project report revealed that 8 in 10 product leaders said tariffs have forced them to redirect their focus to short-term fixes over long-term strategies, meaning innovation initiatives are taking a back seat to cost-trimming measures.

As with all inflection points in finance, the winners will be those who can read the signs and act accordingly. In the era of digital assets, that may mean embracing the promise and the perimeter of regulation.

After all, some of the world's largest banks are doing anything but standing still.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","SocGen Forge inks another stablecoin partner with BCB","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/socgen-forge-inks-another-stablecoin-partner-with-bcb/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 11:15:15 GMT","

Societe Generale-FORGE continues to ink deals for its MiCAR compliant EURCV stablecoin, the latest being BCB Markets, part of the digital asset focused BCB Group, known for providing on and off-ramp services as well as trading. 

“The stablecoin market is dominated by dollar-pegged coins, which of course is very useful for those who wish to work in that currency. But we firmly believe there is a market for alternatives in Europe,” said Jerome Prigent, Managing Director, BCB Europe.“Money remittances are a significant market in many emerging economies and between those markets and Europe, and euro-denominated stablecoin is a way to reduce the cost of those remittances by as much as 80%, without going through the dollar,” Prigent added. The company noted the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are also looking for dollar alternatives.

BCB Europe has licenses both as a European digital asset service provider (DASP) and an electronic money institution, similar to SocGen-FORGE.

This partnership is the latest for SocGen-FORGE following a January stablecoin deal with Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum that made EURCV available to its banking partners. In recent months the stablecoin issuer also announced plans to expand its stablecoin beyond Ethereum to Solana, Stellar and XRP Ledger, but these have not yet launched. SocGen-FORGE has partnerships with crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Bitpanda and based on blockchain logs, institutional crypto exchange Bullish also uses the digital currency.

These expanding partnerships are crucial for driving adoption, as currently there are 41 million EURCV stablecoins issued, with four wallets holding 90% of the balance, of which €25 million has barely been touched. As SocGen-FORGE builds momentum with new alliances and multi blockchain expansion, the stage is set for EURCV to capture greater market share and establish itself as a leading euro alternative to dollar dominated stablecoins

HOLO allocates 66% of cash reserves to crypto, generating $19.08M income; represents major asset allocation shift with mixed risk profile.

MicroCloud Hologram has made a significant financial move by allocating up to $200 million of its $303 million cash reserves (approximately 66% of total cash) toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. This represents an extraordinarily high concentration of capital in volatile digital assets for a technology service provider.

The company reports it has already generated $19.08 million in cumulative investment income from these positions, suggesting an approximate 9.5% return on the initial investment. While this appears positive on the surface, investors should recognize this performance occurred during a period of broader cryptocurrency market strength.

What's particularly notable is the scale of this allocation relative to HOLO's balance sheet. Committing 66% of cash reserves to cryptocurrency derivatives represents a dramatic departure from traditional corporate treasury management practices, which typically prioritize capital preservation through diverse, low-risk instruments.

The remaining cash ($103 million) is earmarked for technology development across blockchain, quantum computing, holography, and AI-AR integration. This dual strategy of aggressive crypto exposure alongside core technology investment creates a hybrid business model—part technology company, part crypto investment vehicle.

HOLO's strategy diverges significantly from most public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, as those firms typically allocate a much smaller percentage of reserves. This approach introduces substantial volatility risk to HOLO's financial foundation, potentially impacting its ability to fund operations and R&D should cryptocurrency markets experience prolonged downturns.

Investors should carefully evaluate whether this represents prudent diversification or an overconcentration in speculative assets that fundamentally alters the company's risk profile.

SHENZHEN, China, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ: HOLO), (""HOLO"" or the ""Company""), a technology service provider, announced that they have purchased up to $200 million in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related securities derivatives. As of Jun. 03, the  cumulative investment income has reached $19.08 million. HOLO currently holds $303 million in cash reserves. The company plans to allocate these $303 million reserves toward derivatives and technology development in cutting-edge fields such as Bitcoin-related blockchain, quantum computing, quantum holography, and AI-powered AR.This move marks HOLO's further exploration and practice in the cryptocurrency sector while also demonstrating its determination and strategic vision for future business expansion.

The purchased Bitcoin and its derivatives this time will be incorporated into HOLO's capital reserve strategy, aiming to enhance the company's financial stability and long-term growth potential through diversified investments. HOLO stated that purchasing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency derivatives is a key initiative in its exploration of the cryptocurrency market, helping it gain insights into market mechanisms, price fluctuations, and investment strategies. Through this plan, HOLO seeks to accumulate valuable experience for future business expansion and capital operations in the cryptocurrency sector.

The company currently holds approximately $303 million in cash reserves. The allocated funds of up to $200 million will primarily be used to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with significant market influence and growth potential, as well as related securities derivatives. These assets will become a crucial part of HOLO's financial reserves, helping to enhance the diversity and risk resilience of its overall asset portfolio. Meanwhile, HOLO also announced that its the  cumulative investment income have now reached $19.08 million. This figure highlights HOLO's commitment to maintaining a strong financial position while also striving to create long-term value for its shareholders. HOLO emphasized that it will continue to uphold a prudent business strategy, enhance profitability and market competitiveness, and generate greater returns for its shareholders.

As a technology service provider, HOLO has also achieved significant breakthroughs in quantum system research and large-scale DeepSeek integration. These technological innovations not only provide strong support for HOLO's investments in the cryptocurrency sector but also lay a solid foundation for its future business expansion.

With the continuous growth of the cryptocurrency market, more and more enterprises are entering this field. As one of the pioneers, HOLO's investment decisions and strategic planning will undoubtedly serve as a model for other companies. Moving forward, HOLO will continue to explore and advance in the cryptocurrency sector, creating greater value for its shareholders while making a positive contribution to the overall development of the industry.

BCP Technologies, a cryptocurrency company registered in the UK, is claiming bragging rights for issuing the first stablecoin denominated in British pound sterling, Tokenised GBP (tGBP), under the UK's regulatory ambit.

The launch of tGBP follows a 14 month review including one month participation in the FCA regulatory Sandbox, which concluded on 31 May, the company said on Tuesday.

Stablecoins, with around $250 billion in collective market cap, are one of the fastest growing areas within crypto. But the vast majority of these tokens are pegged to USD, in a market currently dominated by Tether's USDT, the largest, and Circle's USDC, the second biggest.

Each tGBP token is backed 1:1 by reserves held in a segregated account at a UK-regulated financial institution and is fully redeemable for sterling at any time, according to a press release.

“Our vision is to abstract the complexity of blockchain with the familiarity of a GBP denomination, ultimately replacing GBP e-money with our GBP stablecoin,” said Benoit Marzouk, CEO of BCP Technologies in a statement.

This arrival of tGPB comes as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority opens a public consultation on stablecoin and crypto custody rules on the 28th of May.

By Megan Cassidy

A crypto billionaire with a reputation for funding public safety projects San Francisco is asking officials to greenlight a $9.4 million gift to create a new, state-of-the-art technology hub for the city's police force.

The donation, which is made up of funds linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, would relocate San Francisco police's Real-Time Investigations Center, which oversees its work with drones, surveillance cameras and automated license plate readers, from the SoMa Hall of Justice to an office at 315 Montgomery St. in the Financial District.

If approved, the Police Department would sublet the Montgomery Street location for free from Ripple, which paid $2.3 million for the lease through December 2026 but is no longer using the space, according to a proposal ordinance.

The other $7.25 million would come from the San Francisco Police Community Foundation, a charitable organization Larsen set up last year to support local police and crime-fighting initiatives.

Police commissioners are scheduled to discuss the funding proposal Wednesday at their weekly meeting. If they agree to accept the money, the decision would fall on the Board of Supervisors for a final approval.

In a Monday interview, Larsen credited last year's tech advancements with helping a chronically short staffed police force drive down crime rates and keep themselves safe.

""I think we can clearly see what a force-multiplier this is,"" he said, noting the city's historically low rates of crime over the last year. ""The number of tools that they have is quite small, and we know that (expanding them) will have an impact.""

Evan Sernoffsky, a spokesperson for the police department, said the gift would ""supercharge"" a unit that in 2024 assisted in over 500 arrests and helped drive a 40% drop in auto thefts over a one-year period.

""We cobbled together our current (Real Time Investigations Center) with everything we basically had lying around,"" Sernoffsky said. ""Little did we know how effective it would become with just the tools at our disposal.""

In a statement, Mayor Daniel Lurie credited the center for supporting an understaffed department and helping to keep neighborhoods safe.

""With this new facility, the SFPD will have the tools and the technology it needs to take this work to the next level,"" Lurie said. ""I want to thank Chris Larsen for his continued dedication to our police officers and the safety of all San Franciscans.""

Both police and other city officials have for months bemoaned deficiencies in housing the department's technological epicenter the Hall of Justice, a crumbling building constructed in 1958 that relies on 1960s-era wiring.

""In its current location, the RTIC has experienced power and internet outages, and plumbing leaks from the ceiling,"" the proposal ordinance stated. ""The RTIC is in a windowless room in a concrete structure, which limits cell phone and emergency radio transmission capabilities.""

During a recent press conference at the RTIC's Hall of Justice location, police asked reporters to refrain from charging their equipment in the room's electrical outlets because doing so risked overwhelming the system.

Last year touched off a technological revolution for city police following the passage of Prop. E, an assortment of measures that increased police powers and loosened the amount of oversight surrounding their surveillance technology.

A wave of new equipment was introduced in short order. It included a fleet of officer-piloted drones, hundreds of new automated license plate readers and towering mobile security cameras stationed in crime hotspots.

Many San Franciscans have embraced the advancements as an overdue response to its stubbornly high rate of car break-ins and other property crimes. But the tools remain deeply unpopular with privacy advocates who fear that they're vulnerable to abuses.

The proposed windfall would both relocate the RTIC and expand it; with funds earmarked for purchases included a dozen additional drones and related software, a new video wall and the installation of fiber internet services.

Larsen has previously footed the bill for other big-ticket items to support police and public safety, including a citywide network of surveillance cameras and an initial $1 million to the police charity to support officer wellness.

While AI is everywhere today, it remains reliant on a handful of large corporations, centralized infrastructure and locked in a computing power arms race.

Bittensor, by contrast, makes AI a collective, decentralized process by rewarding contributors for using AI – activities ranging from text translation and data storage to predicting the structure of complex protein chains – focused into problem-solving clusters called subnets.

""The launch of BittBridge underscores UConn's role as an academic pioneer, providing students with cutting-edge experiences in decentralized AI and blockchain technology,” said Professor Greg Reilly, interim dean of the University of Connecticut School of Business in a statement. 

""In a rapidly evolving technological field, the best way to prepare our students is to immerse them in real-world innovation,"" Reily said.

Yuma is the latest company launched by crypto entrepreneur Barry Silbert, the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG).

""The transformative power of AI shouldn't be limited to a few tech giants or well-funded companies with massive compute access,"" Silbert said in a statement. 

""Our partnership with UConn represents a significant step in building pathways so the next wave of talent – including students and builders across disciplines – can enter deAI and help shape the outcomes of this extraordinary technology,” Silbert said.

Ether extended its rally Monday as institutional demand surged and exchange supply dropped to a multi-year low. 

The asset climbed as high as $2,650.18 before easing to around $2,617, where it currently trades, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.

Despite the minor retracement, ETH remains one of the best-performing major tokens this week, supported by $321 million in fresh inflows into ether-linked investment products. That's the strongest weekly inflow figure since December, reflecting mounting investor confidence in ether's long-term value. 

Analysts also highlight a drop in ETH held on centralized exchanges, which suggests a shift toward self-custody and accumulation.

Dogecoin (DOGE) surged nearly 6% over the past 24 hours, marking a sharp reversal from its recent sluggish performance as institutional interest appears to be driving renewed optimism. 

Price-Action

According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model, the token rose from $0.191 to $0.200, fueled by strong technical momentum and high-volume trading that saw peak volume hit 470 million units during the 01:00 hour.

The rally comes at a time of heightened global economic uncertainty, with geopolitical tensions weighing on risk assets across the board. 

Despite this backdrop, Dogecoin's price action has defied broader market trends, breaking through key resistance at $0.193 and forming a new support level at $0.200 after brief consolidation.

Technical analysis highlights DOGE's strong uptrend, with higher lows and higher highs forming throughout the period. 

The most aggressive buying occurred during the final four hours of the session, with volume spikes at 01:43 (32.9M units) and 01:46 (37.3M units) underscoring significant institutional accumulation.

A notable $20 million DOGE transfer to Coinbase coincided with the launch of the SHIB DAO, sparking renewed interest in the meme coin sector and potentially contributing to the surge.

Technical Analysis Recap

As DOGE heads into the next trading session, traders will be watching closely to see if the meme coin can sustain its momentum amid broader market volatility.

 Fading Solana hype and rising institutional inflows are boosting Ether's fundamental strength. 

Key takeaways:

A gold-like five-point breakout structure is making a strong case for an Ether price boom.

Ether is also repeating its 2016–2017 fractal and could rally to $5,000–$6,000 if the pattern holds. 

Fading Solana hype and rising institutional inflows are boosting Ether's fundamental strength.

A multi-year gold fractal is making a strong case for an Ether (ETH) price rally toward $6,000 in the coming months.

A side-by-side comparison of ETH and gold charts shows Ethereum mirroring gold's multi-year accumulation structure from 2019 to 2024.

Both assets are exhibiting a near-identical five-point formation: two local tops (points 1 and 3), two deep pullbacks (points 2 and 4), and a rounded base (point 5) before an explosive breakout.

Gold completed this pattern with a breakout above $2,100 in early 2024, rallying over 60% to reach new all-time highs above $3,400.

Ethereum now appears to be following the same setup, currently bouncing from its point 4 low near $1,600 and approaching the $3,000–$3,500 resistance zone—analogous to gold's breakout point.

Another fractal further strengthens the bullish Ether outlook, making a case for a $6,000 ETH price in the coming months.

Ether appears to be repeating in the current 2024–2025 cycle, potentially setting the stage for a new all-time high, according to technical analyst Crypto Eagles.

The pattern in focus follows four distinct stages: a multimonth consolidation range, a sharp shakeout that traps late bulls, a breakout above resistance, and finally a parabolic rally. 

In 2017, this structure led to a price surge of over 1,000% from sub-$10 levels to above $1,400. 

The current setup shows Ether moving in a similar trajectory, with its range between $1,600 and $4,000, followed by a steep pullback, now rebounding toward a potential breakout zone around $3,500–$4,000.

Crypto Eagles suggests that Ether could rally toward the $5,000–$6,000 range in the coming months if the “candle for candle” fractal continues to play out.

“Only difference now [is that] the base is 100x larger,” the analyst explained, adding: 

Fundamentally, ETH's bullish case is further supported by improving market positioning. 

Ether has outperformed the broader crypto market in recent weeks, especially Solana (SOL), which had previously drawn capital away during its memecoin-fueled rally. 

As the memecoin frenzy cools and bearish patterns emerge on the SOL/ETH chart, analysts at Standard Chartered and chartist Alex Clay expect ETH to extend its dominance.

Institutional demand is also accelerating. Ether-focused investment funds attracted $321.4 million in the week ending May 30—the largest inflow among all crypto assets—according to CoinShares.

 Wynn has asked the crypto community for donations to help him fight the “market-making cabal” that he says is hunting for his liquidation. 

Multimillionaire cryptocurrency trader James Wynn has opened a second leveraged Bitcoin position for nearly $100 million, just days after being liquidated from a similar trade.

According to blockchain data aggregator Hypurrscan, the position is set to be liquidated if Bitcoin (BTC) falls below $103,630 and is currently showing an unrealized loss of over $592,000.  

The trade comes less than a week after Wynn's previous $100 million position was liquidated on May 30, when BTC briefly dipped below a 10-day low of $105,000.

Wynn's bet coincides with growing market caution. Bitcoin's next significant support remains just above $103,000, as market participants remain in “wait-and-see mode” ahead of the release of the key US jobless claims report on June 5, Nexo dispatch editor Stella Zlatareva, told Cointelegraph.

Following news of his second bet, Wynn alleged on X that his liquidation level is being deliberately targeted by major market participants.  

“They're coming for me again,” wrote Wynn, disclosing his $103,640 liquidation level in a June 2 X post, adding:

Crypto influencer Altcoin Gordon also called out market manipulation after Wynn's second $100 million bet was initiated.

“Within seconds, the shady market makers dumped the price toward his liquidation price of $104,580,” wrote Gordon in a June 2 X post.

Some traders have started donating to Wynn's blockchain address to help him fund his leveraged positions.

At least 24 blockchain users sent stablecoins to Wynn's cryptocurrency address, with the largest donation nearly reaching $8,000, according to data compiled by pseudonymous blockchain sleuth “dethective.”

Wynn previously asked the crypto community for stablecoin donations to “fight the market-making cabal,” promising to reimburse each user, “assuming” that he wins.

He also claimed that some of his personal accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges were “closed overnight” for no obvious reason.

“Bearish momentum is weakening,” wrote Wynn in a follow-up X post on June 3, predicting an incoming Bitcoin rally that will see investors “caught off guard.”

 BTC price action is already hunting liquidity immediately above price as support thickens, but market analysis doubts that new highs will come this week. 

Key points:

Bitcoin seeks to take liquidity around $106,000 as traders hope for a sustained price recovery.

Significant support is in place down to $97,000, boosting the odds of price holding.

Profit-taking is underway but lacks the intensity of classic cycle tops, research says.

Bitcoin (BTC) retargeted $106,000 after the June 3 Wall Street open as traders eyed the start of a bullish turnaround.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reversing losses seen after the daily close.

After dipping below old all-time highs from late 2024, Bitcoin managed to halt declines amid concerns that $100,000 may come in for a support test.

Analyzing the current market setup, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades hinted at the potential for liquidity grabs above and below the spot price.

“There are still a lot of positions built up on both sides,” he wrote in part of his latest X commentary. 

Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass underscored the potential for price to “squeeze” higher or lower to take neighboring liquidity, with upside liquidity already in the firing line.

Referencing one of its proprietary trading tools, trading resource Material Indicators highlighted key areas of support in the event of a fresh downturn.

“FireCharts shows ~$263M in BTC bid liquidity laddered down to $97,750, and an additional block of plunge protection just above the Yearly Open,” it observed on the day. 

Material Indicators nonetheless doubted the odds of Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs in the coming week without a suitable volatility catalyst.

“The trend undoubtedly is still up, but there has been no strong continuation above $100K+ this year just yet,” Daan Crypto Trades summarized the day prior. 

In new research into profit-taking activity among the Bitcoin hodler base, onchain analytics firm Glassnode showed just how unusual recent returns have been.

“The recent Bitcoin ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit,” it stated alongside a chart of the spent output profit ratio (SOPR) metric in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain.” 

Glassnode added that despite hodlers cashing out, the market had not yet reached the kind of “euphoric” state seen during previous long-term price tops.

 The GENIUS Act could soon be up for Senate debate and crypto lobbyists urged senators to quickly pass the bill as amendments on credit card fees threaten to delay the bill. 

A stablecoin-regulating bill will soon be on the US Senate floor for debate, and crypto lobbying groups have called on lawmakers to focus on passing the bill, as some senators have flagged possible amendments.

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act could pass the Senate as soon as this week. It seemingly has enough votes to pass to the House after the Senate moved the bill forward in a procedural vote on May 19.

Now, crypto groups the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Digital Chamber and the DeFi Education Fund have said they're ready to help lawmakers maintain “positive momentum” to get the bill before the House. 

“As the bill continues through the amendment process, we respectfully urge lawmakers to remain committed to its central goal: providing a targeted and comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight,” the groups said in a joint statement on June 2.

Many Democrats have again backed the bill after pulling support, originally citing concerns over President Donald Trump's ties to crypto, including his family's crypto platform launching a stablecoin.

However, the stablecoin legislation could now hit a roadblock from an unrelated amendment about credit card fees.

Senators Dick Durbin and Roger Marshall want to attach their “swipe fee” legislation, the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA), to the stablecoin bill,  Politico reported on June 2.

The amendment would force payment networks like Visa, Mastercard and American Express to compete on the fees they charge merchants for processing transactions.

The controversial measure has been strongly opposed by banks and card networks, claiming government overreach. 

Meanwhile, crypto advocates are scrambling to prevent their long-sought victory from being derailed by the unrelated credit card amendments, which have created a political minefield.

James Czerniawski from the libertarian group Americans for Prosperity said last month that the changes are “unacceptable,” and claimed that the proposed amendment was “bad policy,” which undermines Americans' access to credit.

Other suggested amendments include new disclosure requirements for government officials holding stablecoins, guardrails against Trump family crypto ties, bans on Chinese and foreign ownership of stablecoin issuers, and reforms to the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering rules, crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett reported on June 2. 

“If no agreement is reached, procedural hurdles will likely slow things down and potentially push final passage into the week of June 9,” she said.

Bizarre Quantum Universe

Even how matter exists in the first place is a mystery to physicists

By Andrea Gawrylewski 

Scientific American

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

In 2022 three scientists won the Nobel Prize in Physics for proving something astonishing: the universe is not locally real. In other words, particles don't have fixed properties until they are measured. Although it seems to counter everything we perceive, the discovery was established by some of the most rigorous experiments ever conducted, and it aligns with a prediction Albert Einstein and his colleagues made almost 100 years ago: that particles strangely influence one another, even across vast distances. Today quantum strangeness is no longer confined to theory. Researchers are entangling objects large enough to see, quantum computers are on the cusp of solving problems no classical machine can touch, and speculative ideas such as vacuum decay and alternative realities are serious science. The quantum era has arrived.

Bizarre quantum dynamics underpin our view of reality: Time travels forward for us, but in the quantum world, it may flow in two directions. Gravity itself may follow quantum rules. Quantum mechanics supports the possibility of alternative universes, but even if they exist, we can't access them (and probably shouldn't anyway). Some physicists argue that quantum rules dictate that everything in the universe is preordained, making free will an illusion, so we might as well accept our current reality.

These insights are fueling tremendous scientific innovation. The strongest force in nature, which binds together quarks inside protons and neutrons, may be dictated by quantum interactions. Scientists have found that electrons swarm in a soup of quantum entanglement in a recently discovered class of materials called strange metals. An experiment housed deep underground in a Sardinian mine is designed to determine the weight of empty space—yes, it weighs something—and thereby isolate particles predicted by quantum field theory. To better understand the most inexplicable behavior of quantum particles, physicists have created lattices out of light waves that simulate solid materials.

If many universes exist, the stars and planets that were able to form in ours could be the best evidence for them. But even how matter exists in the first place is a mystery to physicists. The universe seems stable, but an unlikely shift in the Higgs field, a quantum field that pervades all of space, could trigger a bubble that passes through the universe, annihilating all matter.

Perhaps the most tangible application of quantum discovery is in computing. The key to quantum computing is the qubit, and it promises to make electronic machines obsolete. In a type of computing arms race, researchers are trying to build systems that can withstand the might of future quantum-armed hackers. Despite the hype and parade of press announcements from big tech, however, so far no company has achieved “quantum advantage”—that is, a quantum computer able to solve a problem no classical computer can.

For corporeal creatures such as humans, grappling with a universe that might not be singular, time that moves in many directions, and matter that both does and does not exist is mind-bending, to say the least. Two giants in early quantum theory, Werner Heisenberg and John Bell, speculated that because we perceive as we do, the mind, in a sense, defines quantum interactions. Its implications are cosmic, but the quantum realm is definitively a human one.

Chronic inflammatory bowel disease is challenging to treat and carries a risk of complications, including the development of bowel cancer. Young people are particularly affected: when genetic predisposition and certain factors coincide, diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease usually manifest between the ages of 15 and 29 -- a critical period for education and early career development. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Researchers at Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin have now discovered a therapeutic target that significantly contributes to halting the ongoing inflammatory processes. Their findings are published in the current issue of the journal Nature Immunology.

Sometimes gradually, sometimes in flare-ups -- accompanied by severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue and a high level of emotional stress -- this is how the two most common chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, often begin. While ulcerative colitis only affects the inner lining of the large intestine, Crohn's disease can involve the entire thickness of the intestinal wall, most commonly in the small intestine, but sometimes also the stomach and esophagus. Ongoing inflammation can cause lasting tissue damage and increase the risk of cancer. While traditional treatments aim to suppress the immune system as a whole, newer therapies are more targeted: they interrupt the inflammatory process by blocking specific messenger substances that drive inflammation in the body.

The exact causes of severe systemic diseases are still not fully understood to this day. In addition to genetic factors, environmental influences are also believed to play an important role in their development. Prof. Ahmed Hegazy has been studying inflammatory processes in the gut and the immune system's defense mechanisms at Charité's Department of Gastroenterology, Infectiology and Rheumatology for several years. Together with his team, he has now succeeded in identifying the interaction between two messenger substances of the immune system as the driving force behind chronic intestinal inflammation: Interleukin-22, a protein that supports the cells lining the inside of the gut and helps maintain the protective barrier, and oncostatin M, a signaling molecule that plays a significant role in tissue repair and cell differentiation.

Uncontrolled chain reaction

""At the clinic, we mainly see young patients who just beginning their professional lives. So far, we have only been able to slow down the progression of the disease and alleviate symptoms. But not all patients respond well to existing treatments, so new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed,"" says Ahmed Hegazy. In previous work, the research team closely examined the effects of oncostatin M, an inflammation-promoting messenger molecule. This protein, produced by certain immune cells, activates other inflammatory factors -- setting off a chain reaction that triggers an excessive immune response. ""It was especially interesting for us to see that patients with high levels of oncostatin M do not respond to several common therapies,"" Ahmed Hegazy explains. ""This means that Oncostatin M levels could help predict treatment failure and may serve as a biomarker for more severe disease. That's exactly where we focused our efforts: we wanted to understand this signaling pathway better and find ways to block it with targeted treatments.""

The research team spent five years uncovering how the immune messenger oncostatin M triggers inflammatory responses. They began by using animal models, and later studies tissue samples from patients, to examine the different stages of chronic intestinal diseases, State-of-the-art single-cell sequencing showed that -- compared to healthy tissue -- a much larger number of unexpected cell types in the inflamed gut have binding sites (receptors) for oncostatin M. At the same time, additional immune cells start producing the inflammatory protein. Interestingly, interleukin-22, which normally protects tissue, also makes the gut lining more sensitive to oncostatin M by increasing the number of its receptors. ""These two immune messengers work together and amplify the inflammation, drawing more immune cells into the intestine, like a fire that keeps getting more fuel and spreads,"" as Ahmed Hegazy relates. ""In our models, we specifically blocked the binding sites for oncostatin M and saw a clear reduction in both chronic inflammation and the associated of cancer.""

Targeted therapy for high-risk patients in sight

The researchers found a particularly high number of receptors for the messenger molecule oncostatin M around the tumors in tissue samples from patients with colorectal cancer caused by chronic intestinal inflammation -- but not in the surrounding healthy tissue. This observation suggests that this signaling pathway may help promote cancer development. However, chronic inflammation does not always lead to bowel cancer, and not every patient is affected in the same way. ""Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are highly complex and differ from person to person. That's exactly what makes them so difficult to treat and predict treatment,"" says Prof. Britta Siegmund, Director of the Clinic for Gastroenterology, Infectiology and Rheumatology. ""Thanks to the role of oncostatin M and its amplifying interaction with interleukin-22, which we have now identified, we have a clearer understanding of what drives chronic inflammation in some patients. This opens up the door to developing and testing a new therapeutic approach.""

The team's experimental findings may soon translate into a real-world therapy: by specifically disrupting the harmful interaction between the immune messengers interleukin-22 and oncostatin M. ""Our results provide a strong scientific basis for developing targeted treatments against this inflammation-promoting mechanism in chronic inflammatory bowel disease -- particularly in patients with more severe forms of the illness,"" explains Ahmed Hegazy. A clinical trial is already underway to test an antibody that blocks the receptors for Oncostatin M.

Researchers at Swansea University have discovered that baboons walk in lines, not for safety or strategy, but simply to stay close to their friends.

Baboons often travel in structured line formations known as 'progressions' as they move through their home range. Previous studies offered conflicting explanations for this behavior. Some proposed that the order was random, while others argued that baboons strategically positioned themselves, with vulnerable individuals walking in the center to reduce their risk of attack.

Now, using high-resolution GPS tracking, researchers from Swansea University have re-examined this behavior in a group of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) on South Africa's Cape Peninsula. Their findings, published in the journal Behavioral Ecology, reveal that baboon movement patterns are driven by social bonds rather than survival strategies.

The team analysed 78 travel progressions over 36 days and showed that the order in which the individual baboons travelled were not random.

The researchers tested four potential explanations for the baboon progression order:

After analysing the data, the researchers found that the baboons' movement patterns were driven solely by their social relationships.

Dr Andrew King, Associate Professor at Swansea University said: ""Surprisingly, the consistent order we see for the baboons we studied isn't about avoiding danger like we see in prey animals when they position themselves in the middle of their social group, or for better access to food or water like we see in like we see in the movements of plains zebra. Instead, it's driven by who they're socially bonded with. They simply move with their friends, and this produces a consistent order.

""In the baboon group we studied, the more socially connected, higher-ranking individuals usually walk in the middle of the group, while lower-ranking baboons are often out in front or at the rear. During these group movements -- like heading to a familiar sleeping spot -- it's likely that the group already knows where they're going. So, the baboons at the front aren't really leading; they're just out ahead.""

This finding introduces the concept of a 'social spandrel'. In buildings, spandrels are the triangular spaces that emerge as by-products when arches are placed side by side. In biology, a spandrel refers to a trait that arises not because it was directly selected for, but as a side effect of something else. In this case, the consistent travel patterns among baboons emerge naturally from their social affiliations with each other, and not as an evolved strategy for safety or success.

Marco Fele, the study's lead author and PhD student at Swansea University, said: ""We know that strong social bonds are important for baboons -- they're linked to longer lives and greater reproductive success. But in this context, those bonds aren't serving a specific purpose. The travel order we see is simply a by-product of those relationships, not a strategy with immediate benefits. Our study highlights the potential for these kinds of spandrels in collective animal behaviour.""

Every five minutes, 50 people are bitten by a snake worldwide; four will be permanently disabled and one will die. In the time-critical situation following a bite, identifying the snake venom making its way through your system is vital to saving lives and providing the best treatment.

Most approaches to diagnose and treat snake venom, a WHO neglected tropical disease, rely on antibodies. Antibody assays have several challenges associated with them, including high costs, lengthy procedures, and inconsistencies, and yet there are not robust, low-cost, and widely available alternatives to antibody-based approaches.

In this new research paper, published in ACS Biomacromolecules, Warwick researchers have shown the first proof of concept for a cheap and rapid alternative -- a glycopolymer-based ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) test to detect snake venom. They showcase a version of this diagnostic assay in the paper that specifically detects Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom.

Dr. Alex Baker, Assistant Professor at Warwick, lead researcher of the Baker Humanitarian Chemistry Group and senior author of the paper said: ""Snake venoms are complex and detecting the toxins at work is challenging but essential to save lives. We've produced an assay using synthetic sugars that mimic the sugars in our bodies that the toxins naturally bind to and an amplification system that makes this rapid test visible. This method lays the foundations for the rapid and cheap detection of snakebite beyond antibody-based techniques, potentially improving improve patient outcomes.""

Western Diamondback Rattlesnake venom has evolved to bind to specific sugar molecules on the surface of cells in the body, such as red blood cells and platelets. Specifically, the toxin binds to galactose-terminal glycans (sugar chains ending in galactose). Binding to these glycans allows the venom to disrupt blood clotting or interfere with the immune responses leading to disability and death.

To create the venom assay for Crotalus atrox venom, the team engineered synthetic chains of sugar-like units (glycopolymers), to mimic the natural sugar receptors targeted by venom proteins. The synthetic sugars were attached to gold nanoparticles to amplify the response and make the reaction visible, creating a test that changes colour when venom toxins bind to the synthetic sugars.

Mahdi Hezwani, first author and alumni of Dr Baker's research group said: ""This assay could be a real game-changer for snake envenomation. Venoms from other snake species do not interact with glycans in the body. For example, when we tested venom from the Indian Cobra (Naja naja) we did not see binding to the synthetic glycans that bind to C.atrox venom. Hence this assay shows promise to be able to distinguish between different snake venoms based on their sugar-binding properties.""

This is the first example of a diagnosis test using sugars for detecting snake venom in a rapid detection system, and builds on the work of this Warwick research group using a glyconanoparticle platform in COVID-19 detection.

This new assay is faster, cheaper, easier to store, is modifiable since the sugars can be custom-made to recognise a specific toxin and is an example of the bold, innovative solutions that will continue to be made possible through The University of Warwick's new STEM Connect programme.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Geological time capsule highlights Great Barrier Reef's resilience","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250602155513.htm","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 01:17:53 GMT","

New research led by the University of Sydney adds to our understanding of how rapidly rising sea levels due to climate change foreshadow the end of the Great Barrier Reef as we know it.

The findings suggest the reef can withstand rising sea levels in isolation but is vulnerable to associated environmental stressors arising from global climate change.

Led by Professor Jody Webster from the School of Geosciences, the research was published today in Nature Communications. It draws from a geological time capsule of fossil reef cores, extracted from the seabed under the Great Barrier Reef.

The findings suggest rapid sea level rise in isolation did not spell the end of the reef's predecessor, Reef 4. Rather, associated environmental stressors like poor water quality and warming climates led, in combination, to its demise about 10,000 years ago (towards the end of the last ice age).

The ensuing one to two thousand years saw Reef 4 transition. Its shallow reef ecosystem moved landward to reestablish itself as the Great Barrier Reef we know today.

""This research shows us a healthy, active barrier reef can grow well in response to quite fast sea level rises,"" said Professor Webster. ""It's the combination of additional environmental stressors, on top of rapid sea level rise, that lead to its demise.

The findings lend weight to already grave concerns about the Great Barrier Reef.

""The modern reef faces rising sea levels, more heat waves and extensive bleaching, along with increasing sediment and nutrient input. This combination, on top of rising sea levels, is of deep concern. If the current trajectory continues, we should be concerned about whether the Great Barrier Reef will survive the next 50 to 100 years in its current state.

""It won't die but its characteristics may change. We will see a different collection of coral species, perhaps simpler and not as structurally complex.""

Learning from the 'proto-Great Barrier Reef'

The 15 to 20-metre cores underpinning this research comprise a mix of fossil coral, algae and sediments. They reveal how the reef's previous incarnations responded to rapid sea level rise. The cores analysed for this research focus on how the reef ecosystem evolved between 13,000 to 10,000 years ago.

Of particular interest to Professor Webster's team was the period known as Meltwater pulse 1B, between 11,450 and 11,100 years ago, when sea levels rose very rapidly.

""This 350-year period is crucial; it covers a time when global sea levels rose very rapidly,"" Professor Webster said. ""It's a period when polar ice sheets are thought to have experienced accelerated melting due to warming temperatures. Based on records from Barbados, we previously thought sea levels were rising by about 40 millimetres a year at this time.

""Our research shows the rise wasn't so large and fast. It was more likely to have been in the order of three to five millimetres a year, comparable to what we're experiencing today.""

Extracted by a drilling ship from beneath the Great Barrier Reef's shelf edge at a depth of 40 to 50 metres, the cores offered new insight into how Reef 4, also known as the proto-Great Barrier Reef, was impacted by rising sea levels.

""Reef 4 is very exciting,"" Professor Webster said. ""It had a similar morphology and mix of coral reef communities to the modern Great Barrier Reef. The types of algae and corals, and their growth rates, are comparable.

""Understanding the environmental changes that influenced it, and led to its ultimate demise, therefore offers clues on what might happen to the modern reef.""

Professor Webster and colleagues used radiometric dating and reef habitat information to accurately pinpoint core samples pertaining to Meltwater pulse 1B.

The cores underpinning this research were obtained under the International Ocean Discovery Program International Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), an international marine research collaboration involving 21 nations.

Professor Webster said his latest research highlights the importance of IODP and shows the value of these records, obtained by drilling deep beneath the seabed. They provide paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental data, going far further back in time than instrumental records which go back only 50 to 100 years.

""These data allow us to more precisely understand how reef and coastal ecosystems have responded to rapid environmental changes, like the rises in sea level and temperature we face today.""

Professor Webster completed this research in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Tokyo, Australian National University, Nagoya University, the University of Granada and Aix-Marseille University.

Between upgrades and breakdowns to cellphones, tablets, laptops, and appliances, so many electronics are getting tossed in the trash that they've taken on a name of their own: e-waste.

According to a 2024 report issued by the United Nations, the amount of e-waste worldwide has almost doubled in the past 12 years, from 34 billion to 62 billion kilograms -- the equivalent of 1.55 million shipping trucks -- and it's estimated to hit 82 billion kilograms by 2030. Just 13.8 billion kilograms -- about 20 percent of the total -- is expected to be recycled, a number projected to remain flat.

Put simply, we're throwing away more and more electronics, and recycling isn't keeping up. But a new study in Advanced Materials by two Virginia Tech research teams offers a potential solution to the e-waste problem: a recyclable material that could make electronics easier to break down and reuse.

Chemistry and engineering have an answer

Michael Bartlett, associate professor of mechanical engineering, and Josh Worch, assistant professor of chemistry, come from different fields, but together they created a new class of circuit materials. With significant work from their team of postdoctoral and graduate student researchers, including Dong Hae Ho, Meng Jiang, and Ravi Tutika, the new circuits are recyclable, electrically conductive, reconfigurable, and self-healing after damage. Yet they retain the strength and durability of traditional circuit board plastics -- features rarely found together in a single material.

The new material starts with a vitrimer, a dynamic polymer that can be reshaped and recycled. This versatile material is combined with droplets of liquid metal that do the work of carrying the electric current, the way rigid metals do in a traditional circuit.

This is a fundamentally different approach from other recyclable or flexible electronics. By combining the high-performance, adaptable polymers with electrically conductive liquid metals, the new circuit holds up under a host of challenges.

""Our material is unlike conventional electronic composites,"" said Bartlett. ""The circuit boards are remarkably resilient and functional. Even under mechanical deformation or damage, they still work.""

A second life

Recycling traditional circuit boards involves several energy-intensive deconstruction steps and still yields large amounts of waste. Billions of dollars of valuable metal components are lost in the process.

Recycling the team's circuit board is straightforward and can be accomplished in multiple ways.

""Traditional circuit boards are made from permanent thermosets that are incredibly difficult to recycle,"" said Worch. ""Here, our dynamic composite material can be healed or reshaped if damaged by applying heat, and the electrical performance will not suffer. Modern circuit boards simply cannot do this.""

The vitrimer circuit boards also can be deconstructed at their end of life using alkaline hydrolysis, enabling recovery of key components such as the liquid metal and LEDs. Fully reusing all components of the conductive composites in a closed-loop process remains a goal for future research.

While it may not be possible to curb the amount of electronics that are discarded by the world's consumers, this work represents a key step toward keeping more electronics out of landfills.

This research was supported by Virginia Tech through the Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science and Bartlett's National Science Foundation Early Faculty Career Development (CAREER) award.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Clinical research on psychedelics gets a boost from new study","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603114816.htm","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 17:29:23 GMT","

As psychedelics gain traction as potential treatments for mental health disorders, an international study led by researchers at McGill University, Imperial College London, and the University of Exeter stands to improve the rigour and reliability of clinical research.

Up to now, psychedelic clinical trials have had what has been widely acknowledged as a critical flaw: the failure to properly account for how a person's mindset and surroundings influence the effects of psychedelics such as MDMA and psilocybin. This gap has led to inconsistent study results, making regulatory approval more difficult.

To address this, the researchers conducted a Delphi consensus study, bringing together 89 experts from 17 countries for a multi-round debate. The result is the Reporting of Setting in Psychedelic Clinical Trials (ReSPCT) guidelines, published in Nature Medicine, a 30-item checklist, representing the first global agreement on which psychosocial factors have the greatest impact on a psychedelic experience.

""For decades, we've known that psychedelics don't work in isolation. The person's mindset, the therapy room, even the music playing all influence outcomes,"" said co-lead author Chloé Pronovost-Morgan, a researcher at McGill University and Imperial College London. ""Two trials using the same psychedelic drug, at the same dose, can produce completely different results depending on the environment.""

This approach challenges the way psychoactive drugs are typically studied, where scientists try to control or eliminate outside variables to isolate a drug's effects. These guidelines recognize that context is crucial and should be studied directly.

Why guidelines matter

By offering a standard framework for evaluating and reporting these variables, the guidelines aim to make trial outcomes more consistent and comparable across studies.

Leor Roseman from the University of Exeter is co-senior author and said: ""Having clear guidelines for contextual considerations is essential to understand the effects of psychedelics and how they work differently from other psychiatric medications. Our guidelines will also help in replicating results and understanding the true therapeutic potential of psychedelics.""

The lack of standards has had consequences beyond the research lab, Pronovost-Morgan explained. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently rejected MDMA-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing inconsistent reporting across trials as a key reason for the decision.

""There is immense public interest in psychedelic therapies, particularly for individuals suffering from debilitating mental health conditions like PTSD, depression and anxiety, which have not responded to existing treatments,"" said co-senior author Kyle Greenway, Assistant Professor in McGill's Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry and a researcher at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.

""Our guidelines offer a new gold standard for psychedelic research, helping bring these treatments to those who need them most.""

The research team is organizing a three-day workshop in October, funded by McGill's Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative, where leading experts in psychedelics and neuroscience will discuss how the guidelines can be integrated into research and clinical practice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ultra-thin lenses that make infrared light visible","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250602155511.htm","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 01:18:28 GMT","

Lenses are the most widely used optical devices. Camera lens or objectives, for example, produce a sharp photo or video by directing light at a focal point. The speed of evolution made in the field of optics in recent decades is exemplified by the transformation of conventional bulky cameras into today's compact smartphone cameras.

Even high-performance smartphone cameras still require a stack of lenses that often account for the thickest part of the phone. This size constraint is an inherent feature of classic lens design -- a thick lens is crucial for bending light to capture a sharp image on the camera sensor.

Major strides in the field of optics over the past ten years have sought to overcome this limitation and have come up with a solution in the form of metalenses. They are flat, perform in the same way as normal lenses and are not only 40 times thinner than an average human hair but also lightweight as they do not need to be made of glass.

A special metasurface composed of structures a mere hundred nanometres in width and height (one nanometre is one billionth of a metre) modifies the direction of light. Using such nanostructures researchers can radically reduce the size of a lens and make it more compact.

When combined with special materials, these nanostructures can be used to explore other unusual properties of light. One example is nonlinear optics, where light is converted from one colour into another. A green laser pen works according to this principle: infrared light goes through a high-quality crystalline material and generates light of half the wavelength -- in this case green light. One well-known material that produces such effects is lithium niobate. This is used in the telecommunications industry to create components that interface electronics with optical fibres.

Rachel Grange, a professor at the Institute for Quantum Electronics at ETH Zurich, conducts research into the fabrication of nanostructures with such materials. She and her team have developed a new process that allows lithium niobate to be used to create metalenses. The study has recently been published in the journal Advanced Materials.

For her new method, the physicist combines chemical synthesis with precision nanoengineering. ""The solution containing the precursors for lithium niobate crystals can be stamped while still in a liquid state. It works in a similar way to Gutenberg's printing press,"" co-first author Ülle-Linda Talts, a doctoral student working with Rachel Grange, explains. Once the material is heated to 600°C, it takes on crystalline properties that enable the conversion of light as in the case of the green laser pen.

The process has several advantages. Producing lithium niobate nanostructures is difficult using conventional methods as it is exceptionally stable and hard. According to the researchers, this technique is suitable for mass production as an inverse mould can be used multiple times, allowing the printing of as many metalenses as needed. It is also much more cost-effective and faster to fabricate than other lithium niobate miniaturised optical devices.

Ultra-thin lenses that generate new light

Using this technique, the ETH researchers in Grange's group succeeded in creating the first lithium niobate metalenses with precisely engineered nanostructures. While functioning as normal light focusing lenses, these devices can simultaneously change the wavelength of laser light. When infrared light with a wavelength of 800 nanometres is sent through the metalens, visible radiation with a wavelength of 400 nanometres emerges on the other side and is directed at a designated point.

This magic of light conversion, as Rachel Grange calls it, is only made possible by the special structure of the ultra-thin metalens and its composition of a material that allows the occurrence of what is known as the nonlinear optical effect. This effect is not limited to a defined laser wavelength, making the process highly versatile in a broad range of applications.

From counterfeit-proof banknotes to next-generation microscopy tools

Metalenses and similar hologram-generating nanostructures could be used as security features to render banknotes and securities counterfeit-proof and to guarantee the authenticity of artworks. Their exact structures are too small to be seen using visible light, while their nonlinear material properties allow highly reliable authentication.

Researchers can also use simple camera detectors to convert and steer the emission of laser light to make infrared light -- in sensors, for example -- visible. Or for reducing the equipment needed for deep-UV light patterning in state-of-the-art electronics fabrication.

The field of such ultra-thin optical elements -- known as metasurfaces -- is a relatively young branch of research at the interface between physics, materials science and chemistry. ""We have only scratched the surface so far and are very excited to see how much of an impact this type of new cost-effective technology will have in the future,"" emphasises Grange.

Metrics details

Despite substantial progress in artificial intelligence (AI) for generative chemistry, few novel AI-discovered or AI-designed drugs have reached human clinical trials. Here we present the results of the first phase 2a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and efficacy of rentosertib (formerly ISM001-055), a first-in-class AI-generated small-molecule inhibitor of TNIK, a first-in-class target in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) discovered using generative AI. IPF is an age-related progressive lung condition with no current therapies available that reverse the degenerative course of disease. Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with 30 mg rentosertib once daily (QD, n = 18), 30 mg rentosertib twice daily (BID, n = 18), 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18) or placebo (n = 17). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who have at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, which was similar across all treatment arms (72.2% in patients receiving 30 mg rentosertib QD (n = 13/18), 83.3% for 30 mg rentosertib BID (n = 15/18), 83.3% for 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 15/18) and 70.6% for placebo (n = 12/17)). Treatment-related serious adverse event rates were low and comparable across treatment groups, with the most common events leading to treatment discontinuation related to liver toxicity or diarrhea. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic dynamics (Cmax, Ctrough, tmax, AUC0–t/τ/∞ and t1/2), changes in lung function as measured by forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, forced expiry in 1 s and change in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in 6-min walk distance and the number and hospitalization duration of acute exacerbations of IPF. We observed increased forced vital capacity at the highest dosage with a mean change of +98.4 ml (95% confidence interval 10.9 to 185.9) for patients in the 60 mg rentosertib QD group, compared with −20.3 ml (95% confidence interval −116.1 to 75.6) for the placebo group. These results suggest that targeting TNIK with rentosertib is safe and well tolerated and warrants further investigation in larger-scale clinical trials of longer duration. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT05938920.

The process of developing novel therapeutics is increasingly slow and costly1, with an average of US$2–3 billion spent over the course of 10–15 years to bring a new drug to market2. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated proof-of-concept innovation and potential to accelerate and decrease costs across all stages of pharmaceutical research and development by facilitating disease-associated target prioritization3,4,5, compound design and optimization6,7,8,9,10, and clinical trial performance11,12,13,14,15. Shifting more of the time-, material- and labor-intensive steps of drug discovery to AI platforms enables more rapid nomination of therapeutic candidate compounds that explore the possible chemical space more thoroughly16,17 and with a concomitant reduction in hands-on screening18,19, thus allowing more preclinical candidate compounds to enter clinical testing and, eventually, clinical practice.

Despite these advancements, few AI-discovered or AI-designed drugs have reached clinical trials. AI-discovered drugs have experienced similar levels of phase 2 trial failure as non-AI-discovered drugs20,21, and none has so far progressed through phase 3 trials21. The question of whether AI can impart meaningful, sustained disruption to drug development has remained unanswered21.

As an answer to this question, our group used generative AI-driven discovery tools22,23 to identify Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) de novo as a critical regulator of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathology as it orchestrates multiple profibrotic and proinflammatory cellular programs9. Our approach resulted in the first antifibrotic, small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, rentosertib (formerly ISM001-055), for the treatment of IPF designed by generative AI. We reported the development and positive phase 0 and 1 trial results of rentosertib9 (NCT05154240 and CTR20221542 (accessed via http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/)), the first report of a targeted TNIK inhibitor entering clinical testing, which found rentosertib to be safe and well tolerated by healthy individuals, exhibiting a favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in both trials9. This was also, importantly, the first reported instance of AI platform-enabled discovery of both a disease-associated target and a compound for that target. Our generative AI-powered approach streamlined preclinical candidate nomination to a mere 18 months and completion of phase 0/1 clinical testing to under 30 months from the initiation of target discovery, representing a revolutionary shift in the streamlining of drug discovery9.

IPF is an age-related, progressive lung disease diagnosed by excluding other potential causes of interstitial lung disease (for example, environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or drug toxicities)24 and marked by interstitial pneumonia, dyspnea and cough25, histologically characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling26,27,28,29. Affecting between 10 and 60 per 100,000 individuals in the USA, with an approximately tenfold greater incidence in those over 65, IPF occurs at a rate similar to stomach, brain and testicular cancers25. The median survival time after diagnosis is 2–4 years despite widespread availability of targeted antifibrotic therapies26,30, highlighting the ongoing need for novel, effective therapies to treat IPF. The current standard-of-care (SOC) therapy regimen to treat IPF includes either nintedanib, a broadly acting inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases31, or pirfenidone, an inhibitor of TGFβ-mediated fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition32. Clinical trials investigating these two drugs in patients with IPF have demonstrated only a slowing of disease progression33,34, as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) and self-reported quality of life (QOL) metrics, and unclear benefit to survival26, making the development of therapies that can restore lung function and reverse the course of disease a priority.

Here, we present the results of a phase 2a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and impact on FVC of rentosertib at a range of doses for up to 12 weeks in patients with IPF. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints and analyses were designed to further measure lung function, QOL metrics and cellular phenotypes associated with rentosertib treatment and response.

Among the 128 patients screened for inclusion, 71 (55.5%) patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 17), 30 mg rentosertib once daily (QD, n = 18), 30 mg rentosertib twice daily (BID, n = 18) or 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18) (Extended Data Fig. 1). The most common reason for screening-based exclusion was obstructive pulmonary disease comorbidity indicated by forced expiry in 1 s (FEV1)/FVC less than 0.7 at visit 1 (baseline) or diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) percent of predicted normal falling outside the range of ≥25% and <80% at baseline. Patients were also excluded for a recent history of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (within 4 weeks) at visit 1 (baseline) or before visit 2 (week 1). The intention-to-treat population included 71 patients, and 55 (77%) completed the 12-week placebo-controlled period (15 (88%) in the placebo group, 16 (89%) in the 30 mg rentosertib QD group, 12 (67%) in the 30 mg rentosertib BID group and 12 (67%) in the 60 mg rentosertib QD group). Overall, 16 (22.5%) patients discontinued treatment before the conclusion of the 12-week study due to either adverse events (AEs) or other withdrawal; 2 from placebo, 2 from 30 mg rentosertib QD, 6 from 30 mg rentosertib BID and 6 from 60 mg rentosertib QD groups. All patients were included in the safety and efficacy analyses (Fig. 1).

Of 128 patients screened for inclusion, 71 were randomized to receive 30 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18), 30 mg rentosertib BID (n = 18), 60 mg rentosertib QD (n = 18), or placebo (n = 17) over the course of 12 weeks. Sixteen patients discontinued treatment prior to the end of treatment.

Source data

Clinical and demographic characteristics, including age, body mass index (BMI) and baseline lung function, were similar across treatment groups (Table 1).

The rates of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were similar across all treatment groups (13/18 (72.2%) in the 30 mg rentosertib QD group, 15/18 (83.3%) in the 30 mg rentosertib BID group, 15/18 (83.3%) in the 60 mg rentosertib QD group and 12/17 (70.6%) in the placebo group) (Table 2), with similar incidence for patients concurrently taking SOC antifibrotic therapy or not (Supplementary Table 1). Treatment-related AEs were more common among patients who received rentosertib compared with placebo, with 5/17 (29.4%) in the placebo group versus 9/18 (50.0%) in the 30 mg QD group, 11/18 (61.1%) in the 30 mg BID group, and 14/18 (77.8%) in the 60 mg QD group. Of these, few were serious AEs (SAEs), with no treatment-related SAEs reported in the placebo group, 1/18 (5.6%) of the rentosertib 30 mg QD group, 2/18 (11.1%) in the 30 mg BID group and 2/18 (11.1%) in the 60 mg QD group (Table 2). The most common TEAEs were hypokalemia (2 in placebo (11.8%), 3 in 30 mg QD (16.7%), 5 in 30 mg BID (27.8%) and 3 in 60 mg QD (20.4%)), hepatic function abnormal (2 in placebo (11.8%), 2 in 30 mg QD (11.1%), 4 in 30 mg BID (22.2%), diarrhea (0 in placebo, 2 in 30 mg QD (11.1%), 3 in 30 mg BID (16.7%) and 5 in 60 mg QD (27.8%)) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (1 in placebo (5.9%), 1 in 30 mg QD (5.6%), 1 in 30 mg BID (5.6%), 6 in 60 mg QD (33.3%) and 3 in 60 mg QD (16.7%)). A complete listing of TEAEs is presented in Supplementary Table 2.

The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was AEs (12/16 (75%)), and the treatment of 7 of the 12 patients was discontinued for AEs due to liver injury or dysfunction (0/18 (0%) in the 30 mg QD group, 4/18 (22.2%) in the 30 mg BID group and 3/18 (17%) in the 60 mg QD group) (Supplementary Table 3). Four of the seven (57.1%) total participants who withdrew because of liver toxicity were concurrently administered nintedanib antifibrotic therapy. Three of the four (75%) remaining discontinuations were due to patient withdrawal from the trial (3/71 patients (4.2%)). One patient died of heart failure before the week 12 end-of-treatment (EOT) visit determined to be unrelated to the trial owing to a history of degenerative aortic valve disease, aortic valve incompetence, left ventricular dysfunction, aortic dilatation, pulmonary hypertension, increased blood glucose and hypercholesterolemia, as well as a lack of other AEs reported and no notable findings for vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or laboratory tests since randomization. A complete listing of patients whose treatment was discontinued due to TEAE is presented in Supplementary Table 4.

FVC is the gold-standard metric for assessing the lung function of patients with IPF and response to therapeutic intervention33,34,35. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients who received placebo experienced deteriorating FVC with a mean change of −20.3 ml (95% confidence interval (CI) −116.1 to 75.6). Patients who received 30 mg rentosertib QD showed a similar mean reduction in FVC of −27.0 ml (95% CI −88.8 to 34.8), patients who received 30 mg rentosertib BID experienced a mean change of +19.7 ml (95% CI −60.5 to 99.9) and patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD showed improved FVC, with and +98.4 ml (95% CI 10.9 to 185.9) (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD not concurrently taking SOC antifibrotic therapy exhibited significant improvement in FVC (+187.8 ml, 95% CI 68.6 to 306.9 ml), whereas patients concurrently taking 60 mg rentosertib QD with either nintedanib or pirfenidone did not exhibit significant changes in FVC (Extended Data Fig. 3).

The changes in DLCO and FEV1 were relatively small and similar across treatment regimens (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). Changes in self-reported QOL and physical ability metrics, such as responses to the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and 6-min walk distance (6MWD), respectively, were likewise similar across treatment groups (Extended Data Fig. 4f–i), although our modeling indicated a significant increase of least-squares mean change of the LCQ scores of patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib compared with those receiving placebo (two-sided P = 0.0495).

Three patients (16.7%) receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD and one patient (5.9%) receiving placebo experienced acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) (Supplementary Table 5). The patients in the 60 mg QD group were all hospitalized in response to their acute exacerbations with a mean duration of 23.3 days, whereas the patient in the placebo group was not hospitalized.

A PK analysis of rentosertib concentration in the blood plasma of patients with IPF after single and multiple doses shows a favorable PK profile, with greater exposure in patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD compared with patients receiving 30 mg rentosertib QD or 30 mg rentosertib BID, peaking 1 h after administration (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Table 6). The area under the plasma–concentration curve (AUC0–t), measuring total exposure to the drug to the last available time point, was greater for the 60 mg rentosertib QD at both week 0 (first dose) and week 12 (EOT; arithmetic mean 1,630 and 3,450 h ng−1 ml−1, respectively) than for 30 mg rentosertib BID (315 and 1,390 h ng−1 ml−1) and 30 mg rentosertib QD (553 and 788 h ng−1 ml−1) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 6). The steady state was achieved at week 2, and no obvious drug accumulation was observed by week 12. The geometric mean half-life (t1/2) ranged from 10.9 to 12.0 h at week 12.

a–c, Pharmacokinetic dynamics of rentosertib in patient sera collected predose and periodically throughout 24 h posttreatment at week 0 (a), at 0 h posttreatment at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (b) and 48 h after administration at week 12 (c). d, AUC0–t of rentosertib exposure; n = 22 in 30 mg QD, n = 21 in 30 mg BID, n = 20 in 60 mg QD. e, Cmax of rentosertib exposure; n = 22 in 30 mg QD, n = 21 in 30 mg BID, n = 20 in 60 mg QD. f, Ctrough of rentosertib exposure in patient sera collected pretreatment at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All data represent arithmetic mean ± s.d.

A higher AUC0–t and t1/2 at week 12 for all dosages indicates an increased exposure to rentosertib with increases time on treatment (Fig. 3a,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Change in patients' FVC from baseline to week 12 was positively correlated with AUC0–t and trough concentration (Ctrough) (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Not surprisingly, the Cmax exposure was greatest in patients receiving the 60 mg QD dose, with both 30 mg QD and 30 mg BID showing similarly lower Cmax (Fig. 3e), whereas Ctrough was similar between 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD dosages (Fig. 3f). Together, the PK dynamics suggest that higher dosage leads to increased exposure from higher initial net absorption, with a more pronounced effect by the end of the treatment period associated with slower clearance.

We performed proteomic profiling of patient serum samples to understand the mechanism of action of rentosertib, guide development of biomarkers of response and evaluate the hypothesis that inhibition of TNIK may target biological aging36. We identified a total of 2,841 proteins using the Olink Explore 3072 panel across serum samples collected from patients in all treatment groups at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Using a linear regression model to evaluate time-dependent effects of rentosertib treatment on protein expression changes, we found that treatment duration substantially impacted protein expression patterns, with 20, 82 and 192 proteins significantly changing with treatment at weeks 2, 4 and 12, respectively (Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P value <0.1) (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Paired statistical testing to assess dose-associated changes in protein expression compared with placebo identified 1, 8 and 22 high-confidence (Padj < 0.05) differentially abundant proteins in sera from patients receiving 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD rentosertib, respectively, using a generalized linear model (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Tables 7–9). Restricting analysis of differential proteins from baseline to week 12, the number of significantly altered proteins increased substantially with higher dosing: 0, 39 and 115 in the 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD groups, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Together, this suggests that the duration of rentosertib treatment and the dose are associated with changes in serum protein profiles.

Downregulated proteins associated with 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD treatment include known fibrosis-associated proteins such as MMP10, PTPRZ1, COL1A1, FAP, FN1, ROBO2, ASPN and LTBP2 (Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Tables 7–10). Analyzing the differentially abundant proteins to find association with change in FVC found that ASPN, PTPRZ1, MMP10 and CHAD were both significantly inversely correlated to change in FVC (P < 0.05) and significantly downregulated after administration of rentosertib at the week 12 time point, suggesting an array of potential biomarkers for response to treatment (Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Tables 7–9). Pathway enrichment analysis identified extracellular matrix organization as the most downregulated Reactome pathway gene set in both treatment groups, suggesting a reduction in excessive extracellular matrix production (Fig. 4e,f).

We queried diverse published gene expression datasets profiling the tissue of patients with IPF and that of healthy individuals using our AI-powered target discovery platform, PandaOmics37, for expression patterns of these top genes to validate their relevance to IPF. COL1A1, MMP10 and FAP were found to be universally upregulated in IPF patient samples compared with healthy individuals, and FN1 was upregulated in most datasets (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

We further found that the abundance at week 12 of proteins previously reported to be associated with lung function38 and transplant-free survival39 in patients with IPF, such as ADAMTSL2, COL6A3, CCN3, COL24A1, KRT19 and LTBP2, were associated change in FVC (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The expression of inflammation-associated pathways, other immune-related proteins, such as IL-10 and CD5, and other extracellular matrix-related proteins, such as COL6A3, were found to have significant associations with time on treatment and change in FVC, further suggesting that TNIK plays a diverse role in various aging-related dysregulated pathways36 (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 8).

In this phase 2a study, treatment with rentosertib at 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD over 12 weeks was safe and well tolerated. Treatment-related SAEs were rare, with a similarly low rate across treatment and placebo groups. The most common TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were liver toxicity related and occurred mostly in patients who were also treated with nintedanib antifibrotic therapy, although notably not pirfenidone. In addition to liver toxicities, diarrhea and hypokalemia were among the most common TEAEs among participants treated with rentosertib. To determine the respective and synergistic contributions of rentosertib and SOC antifibrotic therapies to liver and gastrointestinal toxicity, as well as any potential effects on absorption or trough levels, we require further drug–drug interaction studies and assessment in a larger cohort of mixed SOC antifibrotic recipients and nonrecipients.

Treatment with 60 mg rentosertib QD over 12 weeks was associated with a trend toward an increase in FVC in patients with IPF. The 60 mg rentosertib QD dose exhibited the greatest mean improvement in lung function, as measured by FVC, whereas patients receiving placebo experienced an average decline in FVC. Patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD experienced a mean increase in FVC percentage change of 2.82% by our modeling, meeting the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) reported for FVC in IPF of 2–6% (ref. 40). Subgrouping patients by concurrent SOC antifibrotic treatment showed patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD without SOC antifibrotic exhibited the strongest increase in FVC, suggesting potential interaction between the drugs that will be investigated in future trials. The incongruity of increased FVC with stable DLCO may be attributed to low numbers of patients in each treatment arm and the inherent variability of DLCO measurement41.

The impact of rentosertib treatment on QOL metrics was largely inconclusive, with large variances within treatment arms, although our modeling found that patient-reported coughing-related QOL (via LCQ) was significantly improved in patients receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD. As various QOL metrics integrate the functionality of a number of organ systems, of which lung health is one contributing factor, a lack of difference among the treatment groups may be due to the relatively short data collection period and small cohort size.

AE-IPF is a strong indication of dismal patient prognosis42 with a median survival of 2.2 months after onset43, and incidence informs long-term therapeutic efficacy. Three acute exacerbations occurred in the 60 mg rentosertib arm and one in the placebo arm; however, a 12-week study is a relatively short time frame to capture such long-term disease events or trajectory44. An unintended consequence of rentosertib's potential immunomodulatory mechanism of action9 may be a dampened site-specific immune response, potentially leading to increased susceptibility to infection, a known trigger for a subset of AE-IPF45,46. Because AE-IPF is a clinically important occurrence, we intend to assess its incidence in longer trials with larger cohorts in the future, which would assess patients for at least 12 months to more fully capture the incidence of AE-IPF and other potential AEs.

Assaying the serum proteome in patients provided insight into changes in circulating proteins associated with higher doses of rentosertib. The top up- and downregulated proteins showed high overlap between the 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD doses, with downregulated proteins enriched for association with extracellular matrix organization, a key feature of fibrotic progression in IPF. Moreover, a number of the top downregulated proteins are known to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis: MMP1047, LTBP239,48,49, KRT1939 and COL24A139 have been nominated as biomarkers for IPF and transplant-free survival; PTPRZ150 activates β-catenin signaling, which contributes to IPF development51, and BHLHE40 regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in IPF via β-catenin52; COL1A1 is a key component of dysregulated extracellular matrix deposition characteristic of fibrosis53,54,55; ASPN plays a role in myofibroblast transformation56 and may play a central role in IPF tissue remodeling55,57; circulating ROBO2 is associated with poor IPF prognosis58; FAP is expressed exclusively in fibrotic loci in the lungs of patients with IPF59; and CHAD binds to type II collagen in cartilaginous fibrotic loci60,61. Downregulation of this IPF-associated protein profile supports the hypothesis that inhibition of TNIK modulates IPF pathophysiological pathways and points to a potential serum protein signature as a biomarker for response to rentosertib treatment.

The limitations of this study include the small cohort size of each arm, the geographical and demographic homogeneity of the participants (all were residents of China of similar race) and a short period of follow-up, which limit the assessment of long-term safety and efficacy. Despite the short duration and the number of withdrawals from the trial across all arms (n = 16/71 (22.5%)), the results are encouraging for additional study of this drug candidate and target, suggesting that rentosertib is generally safe and potentially effective and, more broadly, that using AI in both target identification and in drug design may enhance the efficiency of the drug development process. Longer phase 2 or 3 trials studying rentosertib in a larger, heterogeneous sample of patients with IPF from around the globe are warranted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of rentosertib treatment for IPF.

This phase 2a, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multidose trial of rentosertib in adults with IPF was performed at 21 sites across China beginning 19 July 2023 and running through 11 June 2024. Adults with IPF were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio via interactive response technology to receive oral rentosertib (at a dose of 30 mg (QD), 30 mg (BID) or 60 mg (QD)) or placebo (QD) for 12 weeks, along with the continued use of SOC medications (Fig. 1). Patient screening occurred, on average, 30 days before the first dosing at the second visit. Patients were clinically evaluated on day 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12 (end of treatment) and week 13 (end of study). The study treatment rentosertib was provided by Insilico Medicine or a designated contract research organization, packaged and labeled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice. Resupply to the sites was managed via an interactive response technology system, which also monitored expiry dates of supplies available at the sites. Access to the randomization codes was controlled and documented.

The trial was conducted following the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The institutional review board or ethics committee at participating centers approved protocols and adhered to local laws before initiation of the clinical trial. All patients in this study provided written informed consent. Trial management and data processing, summarization and analyses were conducted by Fortrea Clinical Pharmacology Services, Leeds, UK.

Authors used by the study sponsor were involved in the trial design, collection, analysis and data interpretation. Subjects, investigators, site study staff, reviewers and everyone involved in study conduct or analysis were blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after data freeze. Bioanalytics staff were allowed to identify samples from subjects assigned to placebo treatment but did not disclose randomization until trial unblinding. These authors contributed to manuscript preparation across all iterations of the manuscript. The first and last authors of this study vouch for the completeness of all data reported in this publication.

Eligible patients were 40 years of age or older with an IPF diagnosis as defined by the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines62. Enrolled patients presented with stable IPF and were deemed suitable for study participation on the basis of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG and laboratory evaluation. Patients previously receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone were enrolled if their antifibrotic therapy had been stable for >8 weeks before the first (screening) visit. Eligible patients had to meet all three of the following criteria during the screening visit: (1) FVC >40% predicted of normal, (2) DLCO corrected for hemoglobin ≥25% and <80% predicted of normal, and (3) FEV1/FVC ratio >0.7 based on prebronchodilator value. Patients were excluded for concomitant respiratory disorders or health concerns, including, but not limited to, cystic fibrosis, active aspergillosis, active tuberculosis, confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at visits 1 or 2 or severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization within 6 months of visit 1 or long COVID-19, clinically relevant or severe pulmonary hypertension, acute IPF exacerbation within 4 months before visit 1 and/or during the screening period, upper or lower respiratory tract infection that has not fully resolved within 4 weeks before visit 1 and/or before visit 2 (day 1), active on the lung transplantation register or expected to become active on the lung transplant register within 6 months before visit 1, a history of lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplant, current smoker, BMI >40 kg m−2, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT ≥1.5 times upper level of normal or total bilirubin ≥1.5 times upper level of normal at visit 1, eGFR ≤60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula) at visit 1, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure >160 mmHg or diastolic pressure >95 mmHg despite treatment with antihypertensive treatments) at visit 1, unstable cardiac angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months before visit 1, taking oral corticosteroids, any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years before visit 1, known hypersensitivity or contraindications to serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, any condition or treatment possibly affecting drug absorption (for example, gastrectomy or metoclopramide), taking restricted medications (for example, moderate-to-strong CYP3A4–CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers or medications primarily metabolized by CYP3A4–CYP1A2) or consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pomelo, Seville orange or Seville orange-containing products within 48 h before day 1, substantial trauma or major surgery within 3 months before visit 1 or planned major surgery during the study and 12-lead ECG demonstrating corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) >450 ms for males and >470 ms for females, or a QRS interval >120 ms at visit 1. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the associated study protocol.

Given an approximate sample size of 15 subjects per treatment arm, there exists a 90% probability of observing at least one AE if the true population rate is approximately 15%, which is sufficient to assess the feasibility of safety parameters.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered rentosertib for up to 12 weeks in adult patients with IPF compared with placebo. The primary endpoint for this study was the percentage of patients who have at least one TEAE. Patients were continually monitored for AEs during the 12 weeks of rentosertib treatment and for 1 week after administration of the final dose, with study drug-related SAE and AEs of special interest collected if they occurred beyond the study period.

The secondary efficacy endpoints measured the relative and percent change in FVC from week 0/visit 2 up to week 12. The absolute and relative change in FVC (%) predicted from week 0/visit 2 up to week 12 as well as the change in DLCO (%) predicted from week 0 up to week 12 was also measured. Twenty-one subjects (29.6%) had FVC and FEV1 measured at baseline (randomization with spirometry equipment sourced from the local site meeting the 2019 American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guideline criteria)63, provided that the subject's baseline and end-of-treatment spirometry were performed with the same equipment. Fifty subjects (70.4%) had FVC and FEV1 measured at baseline/randomization with centrally sourced SpiroSphere devices (Clario) provided by the sponsor with study-specific training and proficiency tests to the operating staff to meet the 2019 ATS/ERS guideline criteria63 with central overread. All DLCO measurements were assessed with devices from each site according to the ATS/ERS guidelines64, and all measurements were conducted with the same equipment for each site. FVC MCID has been reported to be a change of 2–6% in patients with IPF40.

The change in LCQ, a 19-item questionnaire that assesses cough-related QOL65, from week 0 to weeks 4, 8 and 12 was also analyzed. The LCQ examines three domains (physical, psychological and social) related to the patient's experience within a 24-h time frame. The range for the total score on the LCQ is 3–21, with the sum of each domain score ranging from 1 to 7. A higher score indicates a better QOL, with an MCID reported to be a change of 1.3 points for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease66. The LCQ questionnaire has mainly been validated in disease settings such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease67, noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis68 and chronic cough69.

The change in 6MWD in meters from week 0 to week 12 was also evaluated.

Other secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic parameters of rentosertib and related metabolites after the first dose at visit 2 and the last dose at visit 6 (EOT). This study also collected data on the number of acute IPF exacerbations and the number of days hospitalized after acute IPF exacerbations from week 0 through week 12.

The exploratory endpoints analyzed include the change in IPF blood biomarkers after rentosertib treatment at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Changes in the blood proteome in treated patients were also measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12.

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was performed for endpoints including FVC. The model includes treatment as a fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate. LCQ scores were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures. FVC and other spirometry measurements were collected at baseline and at week 12, with all patients being measured at baseline and a total of 22 patients missing week 12 measurements (5 receiving 30 mg rentosertib QD, 6 receiving 30 mg rentosertib BID, 8 receiving 60 mg rentosertib QD and 3 receiving placebo). Missing values at week 12 were imputed using a multiple imputation method assuming missing at random. All statistical comparisons were made using two-sided tests. No statistical comparisons of AEs between treatment groups were performed. Given an approximate sample size of 15 subjects per treatment arm, there exists a 90% probability of observing at least one AE if the true population rate is approximately 15%, which was sufficient to assess the feasibility of safety parameters, although a sample size calculation based on statistical power considerations was not performed. Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the association between FVC change and AUC0–t or Ctrough.

The safety population included all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. The intent-to-treat population included any randomized subjects. The intent-to-treat population was used for summary of demographic and baseline characteristics and for analysis of secondary endpoints, except PK analysis. Assessment of PK parameters included subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one measurable concentration collected after dosing. Assessment of serum biomarkers was performed on subjects who had a predose baseline value and at least one value after treatment initiated.

For Olink proteomics analyses, we utilized a generalized linear mixed model to assess the association between each protein and dose or FVC change. The formula for modeling the treatment effect is

The lme4 package was used for the generalized linear mixed model analysis. For modeling the FVC changes, we conducted the statistical analyses in two steps. In the first step, we regressed the protein level (NPX) against the visit to obtain the slope of protein change rate for each individual. In the second step, we regressed the FVC changes against the slope of protein change rates obtained from the first step. This was conducted using the lm package. Pathway analyses were performed using the clusterProfiler R package, with Reactome processes70 as the curated pathway set.

Metrics details

Associations between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC) have been uncovered, but larger and more diverse studies are needed to assess their potential clinical use. We expanded upon 12 metagenomic datasets of patients with CRC (n = 930), adenomas (n = 210) and healthy control individuals (n = 976; total n = 2,116) with 6 new cohorts (n = 1,625) providing granular information on cancer stage and the anatomic location of tumors. We improved CRC prediction accuracy based solely on gut metagenomics (average area under the curve = 0.85) and highlighted the contribution of 19 newly profiled species and distinct Fusobacterium nucleatum clades. Specific gut species distinguish left-sided versus right-sided CRC (area under the curve = 0.66) with an enrichment of oral-typical microbes. We identified strain-specific CRC signatures with the commensal Ruminococcus bicirculans and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showing subclades associated with late-stage CRC. Our analysis confirms that the microbiome can be a clinical target for CRC screening and characterizes it as a biomarker for CRC progression.

CRC is the third most frequent and the second most lethal tumor type worldwide1. It has a 30% higher incidence in men2 and 60–65% of all CRC cases occur in individuals with no previous family history (sporadic cancers)3. Only 40% of cases are diagnosed before metastasis2, with highest survival rates when the tumor is diagnosed at an early stage and a 5-year survival rate for stage IV for colon and rectal cancer of 11% and 15%, respectively4. CRC originates in the epithelial layer of either the proximal or distal colon plus rectum5, usually referred to as right- and left-sided CRC, respectively. Progression from benign precursor lesion (adenoma) to a malignant tumor (carcinoma), termed the adenoma–carcinoma sequence, may take several years6 and is characterized by an accumulation of mutations in tumor cells5, impairment in the gut mucosal barrier and intestinal inflammation7,8.

Interest in the tumor microenvironment has increased alongside advances in distinguishing tumor histological features and expression patterns of CRC9, with the gut microbiome suggested as another important hallmark of cancer9. Specific microbes have been proposed as major contributors to carcinogenesis, particularly pks+ Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium nucleatum10,11. Several individual cohort studies and earlier meta-analyses have observed distinct microbiome signatures in patients with CRC when compared with patients with adenomas or healthy controls12,13,14,15,16,17, consistently across different countries and cohorts18,19,20. A few noteworthy metagenomic studies also interrogated microbiome changes along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence and according to primary neoplasia location15,21, and links between CRC and oral species have been suggested15. Further evidence points toward the enrichment of oral-typical microbes (at the genus level21) and of oral biofilm-forming species22 in the gut metagenomes of patients with proximal CRC. However, no metagenomic studies have gone beyond characterizing already well-known strain-specific factors influencing CRC risk (for example, pks island, fragilysin), and no untargeted searches for subspecies and strain-level genomic associations with CRC phenotypes are available. These gaps in the state-of-the-art currently limit the microbiome's potential to be used as a screening tool in clinical settings.

Here, we investigated gut microbiome composition along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence and across different primary tumor locations using a meta-analytical approach comprised of an unprecedented number of cohorts (12 public studies and 6 new cohorts generated in this study) and samples (2,116 from public studies and 1,625 from our new CRC cohorts). We also used new computational, statistical and machine learning (ML) strategies to achieve higher profiling resolution extended to previously unknown species and differentiated clades of F. nucleatum23.

We established a large and diverse set of gut metagenomic cohorts associated with sporadic CRC and with information on CRC stage (stages 0–IV) and primary tumor location (right-sided or left-sided). To this end, we sequenced 1,625 new stool metagenomes from 6 previously unpublished CRC cohorts (Methods) and integrated them with 2,116 stool metagenomes from 12 public studies. In total, we leveraged 1,471 samples from patients with CRC (1,191 with staging information and 989 with primary tumor location information), 702 from patients with colorectal adenoma and 1,568 from control participants, from 16 case-control and two CRC-only studies (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Four of the six newly sequenced cohorts (cohorts 1–4, n = 671) are part of the European ONCOBIOME initiative (Methods and ‘Data Availability'), whereas the fifth (cohort 5) is part of the Micro-N Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII) (n = 897)24. Cohort 6 included stool samples from CRC cases and controls (n = 18 and 39, respectively) from the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital and the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (Istanbul, Turkey). Considering the 3,741 metagenomes in the 18 integrated datasets, we gathered 94 stool metagenomes from patients with stage 0 CRC or carcinoma in situ, and more than 250 for each single stage from stage I to stage IV. In total, 344 samples were from individuals whose primary tumors originated in the right colon (cecum, ascending and transverse colon (10 cohorts)) and 645 samples were from patients whose primary tumors originated in the left colon and rectum (11 cohorts) (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2a). In addition, cohort 1 includes patients with stage IV CRC with either resected primary tumor (n = 68) or in situ primary tumor (n = 95).

Samples were profiled using MetaPhlAn 4 (ref. 25), which leverages species-level genome bins (SGB)26 to enumerate and quantify characterized (known SGBs (kSGBs) having at least one cultivated reference) and uncharacterized species (unknown SGBs (uSGbs) lacking cultured representatives). In total, we detected 3,866 bacterial, 15 eukaryotic and 23 archaeal SGBs. Some bacterial species spanned multiple SGBs, as was the case for CRC-associated F. nucleatum species for which five SGBs described known and unknown subspecies found by MetaPhlAn 4 (that is, SGB6001, SGB6007, SGB6011, SGB6013, SGB6014), with SGB6007 and SGB6013 recently independently investigated23 and corresponding to F. nucleatum subspecies animalis (Fna) clade 2 (C2) and Fna clade 1 (C1)23. To test the relevance of the presence and overall abundance of oral microbial species in the CRC gut ecosystem, we defined a panel of typically oral SGBs. These were defined on an independent set of 990 matched oral and stool samples from 495 healthy individuals in 5 public microbiome studies27 (Methods). In particular, we considered oral SGBs to be those prevalent (>20%) in the oral microbiome but not (<5%) in the gut microbiome (Methods and Supplementary Table 3).

Functional profiles were also generated with HUMAnN 3.6 (ref. 28), and used for a comprehensive analysis on UniRef90 (UR90) gene profiles and corresponding functional grouping according to MetaCyc Pathways, Enzyme Commission (EC) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. In addition, we investigated within-species phylogenetic structure for uSGBs using StrainPhlAn 4 (ref. 25) and evaluated the resulting 112 within-SGB phylogenies to assess differential strain carriage by CRC phenotypes and for subclade association with CRC-related microbial genes.

Consistent with previous reports18, gut microbial alpha-diversity was higher in CRC than controls in 9 of 16 cohorts (SMD > 0, only two with P < 0.05), but this was not a particularly strong effect according to the meta-analytic approach via standardized mean differences (SMD), which was not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05) (Fig. 1c,d, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 4). We observed no clear relationship between richness and clinical stage compared with controls. Estimated oral-to-gut microbiome score (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2a–e) was instead higher both in CRC cases (Hedges' SMD = 0.47, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1e) and in later CRC stages (Hedges' SMD = 0.14, P = 0.003). In addition, CRC originating from the right colon presented lower richness (Hedges' SMD = 0.25, P = 0.07) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 4) and a higher presence of orally derived SGBs than CRC originating from the left colon and rectum (Hedges' SMD = −0.23, P = 0.003) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 4).

Control and CRC microbiomes were clearly compositionally distinct, confirming previous findings (proportion of sum of squares R2 = 0.014, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) P ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 5). Stage 0–III microbiomes were not different from stage IV (R2 = 0.01, P ≥ 0.05), and stages 0–II (early) were not different from stages III–IV (late) (R2 = 0.01, Bray–Curtis; PERMANOVA P ≥ 0.05) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5). In addition, the microbiome of patients with adenoma did not differ significantly from controls (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting a more crucial role for the gut microbiome in the adenoma–carcinoma transition compared with earlier phases. Primary locations (right versus left) showed microbiome differences (R2 = 0.017, P = 0.002) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5) with no strain-level contribution to the separation (Fig. 1f and Methods). Altogether, the combined data support the potential of enriched oral microbial infiltration into the gut microbiome as a differentiator of CRC stages and locations (Fig. 1e,f).

ML applied to stool metagenomics can be a potential option for noninvasive CRC screening18,19,28. Here, we tested whether leveraging increased sample sizes and methods could further improve predictions of CRC cases. To do so, we exploited ML algorithms models18,28,29 in three different ways: (1) 10-fold cross-validation (CV) applied 20 times on each dataset separately (per-dataset CV); (2) a training–testing approach applied to pairs of distinct datasets (between-dataset CV); and (3) a leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) setting, in which the classifier was trained on all but one dataset and tested on the left-out dataset (iterated over each left-out dataset) (Methods and Fig. 2a).

a, Cross-prediction matrix of the ML classifier trained and tested to predict CRC versus control samples. Dataset-wise CV AUCs are reported along the diagonal. Off-diagonal cells report performances of a classifier trained on the cohort on the row and tested on the cohort on the column. Bottom six rows report different LODO validations obtained by training a classifier on all the cohorts but one and testing on the left-out cohort (column), on the complete taxonomic profiles (All SGBs), the subset of oral SGBs (Oral SGBs), the subset of all SGBs except the oral SGBs (Nonoral SGBs), gene families clustered according to the EC numbers (EC genes) and MetaCyc pathways (Pathways), respectively, and a filtered set of gene families (Genes) (Methods). b, Significance levels of meta-analysis on microbial taxa and pathways between controls and CRC. The x axis shows the SMD and the y axis shows −log10(q). Positive values of Hedges' g SMD indicate a positive association with CRC (higher abundance in CRC than controls), while negative values indicate a positive association with controls (higher abundance in controls than CRC). Associations with q < 0.1 are reported in blue. I2 values for heterogeneity in meta-analysis are reported if ≥50% c, Twenty strongest SGBs associated with CRC and ten with controls. Each line on the y axis reports the set of single-dataset and Hedges' model SMD (values on the x axis, with the same directions as in b, represented by symbols and diamonds, respectively. Significant single-dataset comparisons (q < 0.1) are colored dark gray. Only significant Hedges' g significant values (q < 0.1) are reported. SMD values corrected for age, sex and BMI (Methods) are indicated by a star (colored blue when q < 0.1). Oral SGBs are highlighted in bold. g, group.

Predictions of CRC status using a LODO approach achieved the highest and most stable area under the curve (AUC) values (average AUC = 0.85, ranging from 0.71 to 0.97) (Fig. 2a) and were an improvement compared with previous studies (average LODO AUC = 0.81)18. Predictions based on CV were, as expected, generally high but variable across datasets (average AUC ± s.d. = 0.87 ± 0.09, ranging from 0.68 to 0.96), with similar results for between-dataset CV (average AUC > 0.72 ± 0.11) (Fig. 2a).

We then tested the use of only oral and nonoral SGBs for CRC case versus control classification and obtained similar AUC values to the model considering all SGBs (average LODO AUC = 0.83 compared with 0.85 when considering only oral SGBs and 0.79 when considering nonoral SGBs) (Fig. 2a), confirming that a large part—but not all—of the predictive power of the microbiome for CRC lies in the presence of oral-typical taxa in the stool. By contrast, ML models using different sets of microbiome functional features were less predictive (average LODO AUC of 0.68 to 0.72). These results reinforce the potential of predictive tools applied to stool metagenomics to be useful for CRC screening when trained on large and diverse datasets and highlight the predictive importance of oral species present in the gut during CRC.

We next aimed to pinpoint specific microbiome biomarkers associated with CRC using the increased power of our multicohort framework (Methods). We identified 125 SGBs with increases relative abundance in CRC (q < 0.1, 106 kSGBs and 19 uSGBs) and 83 SGBs more abundant in controls (53 kSGBs and 30 uSGBs) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 6); none of the eukaryotic species were differentially abundant (Supplementary Table 7). Bacterial biomarkers for CRC encompassed not only known associations, such as Parvimonas micra, Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (SMD = 0.63, 0.59 and 0.58, respectively)18, but also newly associated SGBs such as multiple genomically distinct F. nucleatum SGBs (SGB6007 (Fna C2 in ref. 23), F. nucleatum animalis, SGB6014 F. nucleatum vincentii, SGB6011 F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum (F. nucleatum sensu stricto), SGB6001 F. nucleatum polymorphum, SGB6013 (Fna C1 in ref. 23) F. nucleatum vincentii; SMD = 0.54, 0.5, 0.47, 0.43, and 0.34, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 6), two Bacteroides fragilis SGBs (SGB1853 and SGB1855 group; SMD = 0.32, q < 0.1) and two Hungatella hathewayi SGBs (SGB4741 and SGB4742; SMD = 0.33 and 0.27, q < 0.1) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 6). Of the 19 associated uSGBs, two (SGB63163 and SGB63167) were assigned at the phylum level (Firmicutes), four (SGB3996, SGB4367, SGB14306 and SGB14315) at the class level (Clostridia) and nine at the family level. Only four SGBs were uncharacterized at the species level (that is, belonging to known genera): Solobacterium SGB6833 (distinct form the previously associated Solobacterium moorei18), Peptostreptococcus SGB749 and two Porphyromonas SGBs. The effect sizes of the signature identified via meta-analysis significantly correlated with the average ranks of the LODO-evaluated ML models (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.41, P < 0.001) (Extended Data Fig. 4), thus supporting the robustness and consistency of the two independent approaches.

A considerable fraction of the identified CRC gut biomarkers were oral-typical species: 21 of the 125 SGBs (16.8%) positively associated with CRC were oral-typical, in contrast to 34 of 488 (7.0%) nonsignificantly associated with CRC (Fisher's test, P < 0.01). No oral SGB was associated with controls and a greater proportion of oral SGBs were associated with CRC at lower q thresholds (18 of 90 at q < 0.05). By reconstructing strain- and subspecies-level phylogenies for oral-typical species associated with CRC via PhyloPhlAn 3 (ref. 30) using metagenome-assembled genomes and isolates, we further identified several subclades of taxa that appear to be more prevalent in the oral cavity or the gut, including clades of F. nucleatum SGB6007 and three Veillonella species (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Within oral species, there is thus evidence of genomic adaptation to the intestinal environment. In addition, to better characterize the tropism of the 21 oral SGBs that are more abundant in CRC (Extended Data Fig. 5a), we exploited datasets with dental plaque and tongue dorsum metagenomes from the same individuals31. We determined that 11 SGBs were more abundant in the dental plaque (7 of the top 8 species), whereas 5 were more abundant in the tongue dorsum (Extended Data Fig. 5a), thus hinting at a potential major contribution of biofilm-forming microbes in the intestinal CRC microbiome.

To test whether the microbiome biomarkers for CRC were associated with the presence of the primary tumor in the gut, we evaluated the microbiome potential to discriminate between patients with stage IV CRC who had an in situ primary tumor and patients with resected primary tumor from the AtezoTRIBE study. We obtained a LODO AUC = 0.78 with a classifier trained on all the other studies for distinguishing between cases and controls. In addition, 13 (11 oral) of the 20 SGBs most associated with CRC (Fig. 2b) were also significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant when the primary tumor is present rather than resected (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). Overall, this reinforces the relevance of oral-to-gut introgression by oral commensals18 and that the primary tumor microenvironment determines the overall stool microbiome signature in CRC.

We investigated the microbiome's functional repertoire alteration in CRC-affected individuals (Supplementary Table 6). In agreement with previous work18, the cutC gene showed higher abundance in CRC-associated metagenomes (CRC versus control SMD = 0.28; q = 0.001) (Supplementary Table 6). In total, 241 MetaCyc pathways were also positively associated with CRC (q < 0.1) and 68 with controls (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 6). At the enzyme level, sulfur-producing enzymes were associated with CRC (including EC 4.4.1.2 homocysteine desulfhydrase (SMD = 0.52, q < 0.001) and EC 1.8.1.8 protein disulfide reductase (SMD = 0.41, q < 0.001)), consistent with previous work32 (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 6). In addition, the association between CRC and two pathways involved in the production of oleate in aerobes (PWY-6282 (SMD = 0.4, q < 0.1) and PWY-7664 (SMD = 0.9, q < 0.1)) (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 6) corroborated a previous hypothesis of an association between oleate and the proliferation of cancerous cells33.

We then tested whether increased ammonia levels are characteristic of CRC tumor microenvironments34 and found several pathways and enzymes involved in ammonia production or sequestration that were significantly altered in the presence of CRC. In particular, l-histidine degradation pathways were more frequently encoded in CRC metagenomes (meta-analysis SMD = 0.41, 0.32, respectively, q < 0.1) (Supplementary Table 6). The first step of this pathway involves the enzyme histidase (EC 4.3.1.3) cleaving an amino group off l-histidine to create urocanate and ammonia as by-products, and this histidase was similarly enriched in CRC (SMD = 0.46, q < 0.1), late CRC (SMD = 0.18, P = 0.02) and metastatic CRC metagenomes (SMD = 0.35, q < 0.1). In addition, a second ammonia lyase enzyme, methylaspartate ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.2), was also highly associated with CRC metagenomes (SMD = 0.45, q < 0.1) and the opposite for l-histidine biosynthesis (SMD = −0.33, q < 0.1) (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Table 6). The tumor microenvironment of CRC was previously characterized as having increased levels of host-produced ammonia, leading to T cell exhaustion34, but our results suggest a potential role for gut microbiota in ammonia regulation in the tumor microenvironment.

To assess whether CRC-associated gut microbiome alterations are stage specific, we considered samples in each stage separately as well as combined into early (0–II) versus late (III–IV) CRC. We observed no strong differences when discriminating between healthy individuals and patients with colorectal adenoma (Fig. 3a). By contrast, controls and adenomas were distinct when contrasted to early or late CRC stage metagenomes (Fig. 3a) with the highest AUC values obtained when comparing stage II and stage IV against controls (average AUC of 0.88 and 0.86, respectively) and adenomas (average AUC of 0.7 and 0.81) (Fig. 3a). The high AUC values obtained when classifying controls versus early stages individually confirm that the microbiome already differentiates at the beginning of the disease. Single stages were also partly distinguishable among themselves (AUC of 0.65 and 0.71 for stage I versus stage II and for stage I versus stage IV, respectively) (Fig. 3a).

Each cell contains the AUC from a random forest validated in LODO, tested on the study reported in the row and trained on the remaining studies. The last five rows of the matrix report the average LODO AUC values predicted using oral microbes, all SGBs except the oral ones, EC profiles, pathways profiles and a subset of the gene families (Methods). b,c, Significant species (Hedges' model effect size P < 0.01, none presented q < 0.1) found in association either with earlier or later stages in meta-analysis considering the following comparisons (all presented I2 < 50%). b, Stages 0–II versus stages III–IV. c, Stages 0–III versus stage IV. The shape of each point indicates the dataset-specific effect size for each species, and the blue diamonds indicate Hedges' model effect size on SMD. P values were computed via two-tailed t-test. SMD values were corrected for age, sex and BMI and indicated by a star (blue if P < 0.01). Oral SGBs are highlighted in bold. g, group.

We then investigated which microbial SGBs were differentially abundant in early and late CRC stages, as well as in metastatic CRC. We found 17 SGBs associated with late CRC, but only four associated with early CRC (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 6). Among the former were five SGBs of oral origin: Slackia exigua SGB14784, P. micra SGB6653, Solobacterium SGB6833, Dialister pneumosintes SGB5842 and Streptococcus mutans SGB8000. Interestingly, P. micra SGB6653 was already increased in stage I, along with G. morbillorum SGB7295, while F. nucleatum SGB6007, despite being significantly increased in stage I, appeared to be consistently more abundant starting in stage II of CRC (Supplementary Table 8). We note that stage-specific taxa are usually part of the whole CRC versus healthy state signature (8 of the 17 significant SGBs between early versus late CRC) indicating a continuum in microbiome trends along stages rather than distinct configurations.

Among the nine SGBs significantly more abundant in stage IV, H. hathewayi SGB4741 showed the greatest increase in abundance (Fig. 3c) with Methanobrevibacter smithii SGB714 also among the top associated species (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 6).

Considering pathways, we found four pathways differential between early versus late CRC (P < 0.01) (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 6), while 14 were increased in stage IV versus all the other stages combined (q < 0.1) (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Although few microbial pathways were found to be associated with late or early CRC stages, we confirmed the previously reported association between methane metabolism and stage IV CRC15 (METHANOGENESIS-PWY, SMD = 0.4, P < 0.01) (Supplementary Table 6).

We then investigated SGBs showing particularly consistent trends of increased or decreased abundance across all CRC stages (Methods, Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9). Two such examples were P. micra SGB6653 and F. nucleatum SGB6007, in which the abundance started to increase at stage I (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9). Conversely, Akkermansia muciniphila (SGB9226 and SGB9228) and Parabacteroides distasonis SGB1934 were generally more abundant in later stages of CRC (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9). These results suggest that the microbiome changes in late-stage CRC17,18,19 occur predominantly on a continuum and become more pronounced as the cancer progresses (Fig. 4b).

a, Linear mixed model coefficients (in the heatmap cells) showing the associations between each microbial species and each stage when compared with controls. Positive values (from orange to brown) indicate increased stage SGB abundances compared with in controls, while negative coefficients (blue) indicate decreased abundances. Significant associations (q < 0.1) are indicated by a star. Associations also found significant in either right- or left-sided CRC for each stage (q < 0.1) are indicated by a right- or left-pointing triangle, respectively. Oral SGBs are highlighted in bold.

Common signature SGBs are in shown orange (q < 0.1 and P < 0.01, respectively); SGBs significant in the cancer stages meta-analysis are shown in green (P < 0.01); SGBs significant in the meta-analysis for tumor location are shown in blue (q < 0.1); and SGBs not significant in both analyses are shown in gray. Asin-sqrt rel. ab., arcsine square root transformed relative abundance; C, Candidatus; g, group; Intest., ; N.T., not tested in the corresponding analysis.

Because cardiometabolic disorders and CRC share many risk factors35, we quantified the overlap in microbial biomarkers between adenoma and CRC stages with respect to oral species, other human diseases and cardiometabolic markers36 (Fig. 4c and Methods). SGBs characteristic of CRC stages I–IV included ~25% of species associated with cardiometabolic risk; stage 0 CRC shared the highest proportion of oral bacteria compared with the other stages (58%); stage I CRC showed the highest percentage of species in common with poor cardiometabolic health (27%) (Fig. 4c). All CRC stages shared SGBs with Crohn's disease (CD) and immune-mediated diseases (Fig. 4c), while stage IV shared 21% of SGBs with poor cardiometabolic health markers and less with immune-mediated diseases (Fig. 4c). Importantly, the microbial signatures of these three conditions have only two SGBs in common (H. hathewayi SGB4741 and Enterocloster aldensis SGB476). Overall, these results indicate a high proportion of SGBs associated with poor cardiometabolic health in all stages of CRC and in adenomas, and a high degree of oral species during CRC development, which is also shared across inflammatory diseases (intestinal or systemic)37,38, and generalized inflammatory conditions characterizing metastatic tumors.

We found that differences in the mucosal microbiome according to primary tumor location21,22 extend to stool metagenomics (average AUC = 0.66 across cohorts) when using all SGBs (min = 0.58, max = 0.77) and similarly when limited to oral SGBs (average AUC = 0.6) (Fig. 4d). This underscores a difference in microbiome composition that can be relevant for side-specific mechanistic models.

Among the 61 tumor location differential SGBs (q < 0.1), we found that three oral-typical SGBs (Veillonella parvula SGB6939, Veillonella atypica SGB6936 and Trueperella pyogenes SGB17137) were significantly increased in right-sided CRC (Fig. 4e Supplementary Table 6). In addition, seven of the ten SGBs associated with right-sided CRC (q < 0.1) were nonoral SGBs. Among these, we identified Streptococcus parasanguinis SGB8071, which was shown to form biofilms with Veillonella spp.39, suggesting that such interactions may be more characteristic of right-sided CRC22. Importantly, only a few SGBs were found in common when comparing the signature for primary tumor location with CRC stages: Christensenellaceae NSJ_44 SGB7265 and P. micra SGB6653 when considering early versus late stages (Fig. 4f), and Clostridia SGB15390, Clostridium sp. Marseille P3244 SGB29302 and GB45495 SGB63167 when considering nonmetastatic versus metastatic CRC (Fig. 4f). We observed a similar behavior also when considering microbial pathways (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 10), reinforcing the notion that primary tumor location is a subtle but detectable factor to account for when studying gut microbiome alterations in patients with CRC.

We then investigated within-species differential gene carriage and diverging phylogenetic features among strains associated with CRC status and stage. We assessed differential gene family carriage (UniRef90s) for 179 SGBs detectable at sufficient prevalence using generalized linear models (GLMs). This identified 62 species that are typically not differentially abundant between cancer conditions, but rather whose strains differentially carried at least one gene family (UR90) in CRC (GLM false discovery rate (FDR) global q < 0.05 and absolute coefficient estimate >1) (Methods and Supplementary Table 9). Many of the species containing the most genetically differential strains were also identified as nonoral CRC-associated, including species of the genus Klebsiella, E. coli, B. fragilis and H. hathewayi (Fig. 5a). Nine of the 20 species with the highest number of differentially carried genes had genes enriched in both CRC and controls, highlighting the degree to which strains in the same SGB can differ in functional potential during CRC. Intriguingly, several species carrying a subset of genes solely in CRC were more typically quantified as human commensals, such as Odoribacter splanchnicus and Dorea longicatena, suggesting that some strains of these species may be unusually detrimental or CRC-responsive.

a, Top 20 species by the number of significantly differentially carried genes among their strains in CRC (FDR global q < 0.05 and absolute GLM coefficient estimate >1), likely representing species diversity. For the top 20 species, we quantified the number of genes they were differentially carrying along with the dispersion of such genes in CRC and healthy subjects as quantified by Anpan. Tick marks indicate individual genes. b, GO terms identified as having the highest ratio of significantly called UniRef90s (genes) in CRC to total genes defined in the term. GO terms are drawn from biological processes (BP) and molecular functions (MF) and are split across known gene families (annotated directly to GO by HUMAnN and predicted from FUGAsseM, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/fugassem/) using samples with paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to assess the likely function of undescribed gene families. (1) Respiratory electron transport chain; (2) bacterial-type flagellum-dependent cell motility; (3) bacterial-type flagellum organization; (4) amino acid transmembrane transport; (5) site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (adenine-specific) activity; (6) phosphorelay sensor kinase activity; (7) oxidoreductase activity, acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors; and (8) NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) activity. c, Carriage of genes previously known to associate broadly with CRC; colibactin, fragilysin and cutC genes, by specific clades' strains in the CRC ecosystem as quantified by Anpan's gene model. Although these genes did not show significance when assessed in species, they did at the global level (for example, when considering total carriage of the function in CRC metagenomes). d, The significant genes involved in the carbon–nitrogen GO term (b) were expanded and broken down by species carrying the genes. For each species-gene pair, we quantified the prevalence of the gene's carriage in healthy controls and CRC cases. Many of the genes predicted to be in this category were annotated by FUGAsseM and as such are predictions of the potential function but are otherwise genes of unknown function. AA, amino acid; ETC, electron transport chain; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; TMA, trimethylamine.

We then identified pathways specific to CRC-enriched or CRC-depleted strains using a subset of these differential genes that possessed at least some functional characterization. Many molecular functions were altered in CRC-associated microbes. Among the known functions identified using HUMAnN28 (Methods), the SOS response (GO:0009432)—a broad term for cellular response to DNA damage—was more frequently carried by Streptococcus equinus strains in CRC. Gene families from Tyzzerella nexilis and Butyricimonas virosa were also predicted to fall in this GO term (Methods) and be differentially carried in CRC. Consistent with community-wide results, we also found that succinate dehydrogenase activity was more encoded by Parasutterella excrementihominis strains in CRC, which also fits the hypothesis that this fatty acid is more readily available in the CRC-associated ecosystem40 (Fig. 5b).

Although not significant, the carriage of colibactin-producing genes by E. coli and Klebsiella spp. was increased in CRC (Anpan GLM; q > 0.01 and abs(coefficient estimate) < 1 (a measure of effect size)). This could indicate several potential hypotheses including: (1) that we did not capture the correct time point for an impact of pks+ E coli on CRC progression; (2) low levels of this gene are always encoded and activation is required for the toxicity41; or (3) colibactin is responsible for a minority of CRCs (Fig. 5c). We propose similar hypotheses for the B. fragilis toxin fragilysin, for which the gene was not enriched in CRC (Fig. 5c). Finally, no significant enrichment of cutC-related enzymes was observed, suggesting that the increased prevalence of this gene was due to the increased abundance of the species carrying this gene, and not the selection for this gene in a species (Fig. 5c).

Carbon–nitrogen lyase carriage was also of interest (Fig. 5b,d), because genes in this molecular function produce ammonia. Increased ammonia levels have been shown to contribute to T cell exhaustion and suppressed immune activity in CRC, and recently the microbiome was potentially implicated in this process in mice34. Here, we identified five species encoding genes involved in ammonia production in the CRC ecosystem, including Klebsiella oxytoca, O. splanchnicus, Bacteroides intestinalis, P. excrementihominis and Clostridioides difficile (Fig. 5d). These included the argininosuccinate lyase gene, which was carried by P. excrementihominis (Fig. 5d) and has ammonia as a known product of its molecular activity34.

We then expanded the gene carriage model that indicated the likelihood of distinct strain carriage in species in the CRC ecosystem, with a complementary within-species phylogenetic model via dominant strain profiling at single-nucleotide resolution using StrainPhlAn 4 (ref. 25). This identified several species with an expected log point-wise predictive density (ELPD) of 4, thus carrying dominant strains in distinct phylogenetic lineages in CRC (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10), including early–late (Supplementary Table 10) and nonmetastatic–metastatic comparisons (Supplementary Table 10). We considered a clade significant if the phylogenetic model improved ELPD over a base GLM (the same model without phylogenetic information) by more than a factor of 2. Eight species exhibited differential strain carriage in the broad definition of CRC (stages 0–IV) (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Table 10 and Methods), while only two species were associated with primary tumor location (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10), four with early–late (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10) and 27 with metastasis (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10). Of these associations, only three were identified in species that were also overall significantly differentially abundant (SMD q < 0.1) in the same contrast (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Tables 6 and 9), indicating that subspecies phylogenetic differentiation can be driven orthogonally to the enrichment or depletion of species inhabiting these ecosystems.

a, Several species exhibited within-species subclade associations with CRC, late CRC, metastatic CRC and the primary tumor location (right or transverse colon versus left colon or rectum). Only two of the associations were identified in species that were themselves differentially abundant with CRC in the meta-analysis, emphasizing the different pressures on colonization and growth versus phylogeny and evolution. Species are shown if the GLM improvement with phylogeny was greater than an ELPD of 4. Points are colored by the Hedges' g value of the species-level meta-analysis in the given comparison, and the number of tips in the analysis is presented in the barplot, colored by CRC or control, early or late stages of CRC or right- or left-sided. Error bars represent 95% CI. b, Within-species subclade clustering obtained via Anpan analysis with CRC as the outcome of interest. Here, we highlighted two examples of Lachnospira eligens and E. rectale (full model results from Anpan in Supplementary Table 10) exhibiting phylogenetically distinct subclades associated with CRC or healthy individuals. For each cladogram, the inner ring is colored by CRC or control, tips are colored by stage and the outer ring is the mean posterior phylogenetic effect as calculated by Anpan's phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) model with covariates of age, sex and study. c,d, Within-CRC comparisons had more significant hits than global analysis (CRC or control). Here, we present some of the top hits from the model with Collinsella aerofaciens SGB14546, Clostridium fessum SGB4705 and F. prausnitzii 15318 (c) for the metastatic comparisons, and R. bicirculans SGB4262 (d) in late stages. Similar to b, the inner ring is the CRC stage, while tips are metastatic status and early or late, respectively, and the outer ring is the mean posterior phylogenetic effect (full model results from Anpan are given in Supplementary Table 10). e, Significant gene carriage differences by taxon associations in R. bicirculans (Anpan, q < 0.05 and abs(estimate) > 1). Genes differentially carried by R. bicirculans included those in carbohydrate metabolism, DNA mobility, and response to oxidative environments; all genes were found to be more present in late-stage CRC (III–IV) than in early-stage CRC (0–III).

Specifically, after controlling for sex, age and study, we identified both Lachnospira eligens (formerly Eubacterium eligens) and Eubacterium rectale strain phylogenies as differential in CRC (Fig. 6b). Although E. rectale has previously been shown to exhibit distinct genetics by geographic origin42, we did control for study as proxy of geographic location, thus indicating that this species presents further genetic differentiation in CRC in addition to geography. The Eubacterium genus is generally considered health-associated43, although some publications have hypothesized a potential role for Eubacterium spp. in cancer44, and others indicated anti-proliferation activity in culture45. Genetic differentiation among Eubacterium strains may thus help to explain these disagreements. Among other clades, many strains associated with CRC were in uSGBs, including several from Ruminococcaceae (SGB15265, SGB15260, SGB4181) and one from Lachnospiraceae (SGB5089) (Fig. 6a) families, indicating that not yet fully identified species may contribute to the tumor microenvironment.

The strongest signals from this phylogenetic lineage analysis differentiated early and late CRC, as well as metastatic and nonmetastatic CRC (Fig. 6a). All species identified as having subclades associated with early or late CRC were also identified in the metastatic–nonmetastatic comparisons, likely indicating that stage IV is a driver of these differences, which can also be observed across the two highlighted species, R. bicirculans (Fig. 6d) and Clostridium fessum (Fig. 6c). In addition, R. bicirculans was a top hit in both models and was found through the gene carriage model to also carry genes in CRC (Anpan taxon-wise q < 0.1 and abs(estimate) > 1) (Fig. 6d). Of potential interest, we identified several genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism as having higher carriage by R. bicirculans strains in later stages of CRC (Fig. 6e), for which it is known that carbohydrate metabolism is altered, and hypothesized that Firmicutes-specific metabolism could promote tumor differentiation46.

Noninvasive, early CRC screening and the identification of consistent alterations in microbial components of the tumor microenvironment and bowel still have substantial room for improvement. Metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiome was shown to be highly useful for both tasks. Here, we expanded on previous metagenomic work12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,28 to: (1) improve the accuracy and generalizability of metagenomic-based classifiers across populations; (2) identify additional relevant microbial biomarkers of tumor presence; (3) assess how tumor stage and other clinical variables are linked with specific microbiome configurations; and (4) investigate whether and how strain-level microbial features are linked with tumor presence and stage. By leveraging a total of 3,741 samples from 18 cohorts and applying new strain-level computational methodologies, our study has power and resolution to assess these clinically relevant outcomes.

Reproducibility of microbiome signatures in new cohorts and populations is particularly relevant for clinical screening. Based on our results, new cohorts should expect to observe an AUC of ~0.85 in CRC classification based on metagenomics, and this baseline value will further improve as more diverse and larger datasets are incorporated and as uncharacterized species are profiled by sensitive taxonomic profiling approaches25. We found all five SGBs assigned to the F. nucleatum species to be more abundant in CRC than controls, namely F. nucleatum subsp. animalis, vincentii, nucleatum, polymorphum, and a second SGB of vincentii, in decreasing order of association strength. This was in addition to other well-characterized CRC-associated microbes such as P. micra and B. fragilis. We also identified 19 additional uncharacterized SGBs with neither cultivated strains nor taxonomically defined species, highlighting a more complex CRC-associated microbial signature than previously appreciated. Our study also demonstrates that the in situ primary tumor is linked to the usual stool CRC microbiome signature, independent of the sidedness, confirming previous evidence that the primary tumor harbors usual CRC biomarkers, such as F. nucleatum47.

Investigations of the gut microbiome changes during early, late and metastatic CRC are key to better characterizing progression along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence. Although interstage microbiome shifts along with CRC progression are not as strong as those observed between CRC and controls, we found several biomarkers for late and metastatic CRC, as well as several microbial species consistently and monotonically increasing (or decreasing) from control to precursor lesion to bona fide cancer or advanced disease. In particular, late-stage CRC was found to be enriched in oral-derived species, such as P. micra—already involved in stimulation of tissue invasion pathways48—and H. hathewayi, which was shown to promote intestinal cell proliferation in in vitro experiments49. Compared with the other stages, metastatic CRC presented a higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii, supporting previous findings that link methane producers with stage IV CRC15. On primary tumor location, we found that the stool samples derived from patients with CRC originating from the right-sided and transverse colon were also consistently enriched in oral species. Because several oral microorganisms form biofilms when they accumulate in the oral cavity50, they may show the same capacity when they grow in the gut, which is consistent with previous observations of the tumor-free mucosa in patients with right-sided CRC22. Coupled with the observation that left-side originating tumors are more enriched in unclassified Clostridia species, this outcome indicates the potential for small differences in gut microbes based on the location of the primary tumor, which could be related to variation in the tumor microenvironment, and carcinogenic triggers.

Prokaryotic species are remarkably genetically and functionally diverse26, and part of the microbiome–CRC link may be because of differences among strains or lineages in SGBs. This study performed a comprehensive strain-level analysis for CRC and found several relevant associations, including the case of otherwise-typical gut clades exhibiting differential dominant strain genetics in CRC, as well as CRC-associated species showing increased encoding of some accessory genes. Such associations were stronger than those for genes known to be directly involved in carcinogenesis (for example, pks island and fragilysin), suggesting more prevalent shifts in microbiome composition for several genes potentially relevant to adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. Dominant strain carriage was particularly associated with CRC stages, with many species (27 of the 213 tested) having significant phylogenetic associations with metastatic disease, all of which were independent of significant species-level abundance changes during CRC. Although even larger investigations are needed to assess the extent to which these strain associations are clinically relevant, they provide targeted potential mechanisms to be validated.

We found several common patterns across multiple lines of investigation. These included the role of orally derived bacteria in shaping the gut microbiome in CRC, as previously observed at lower resolution18. We not only strengthened the notion that the number and cumulative abundance of orally derived species are significantly higher in CRC samples than controls and adenomas, but also found that later stages of CRC were particularly enriched for oral species. Similarly, to a lesser extent, patients with right-sided CRC presented a higher number of oral-typical commensals in the gut than left-sided CRC individuals. However, many additional nonoral bacteria were also associated with CRC, including those that have been previously associated with high cardiometabolic risk36. Interestingly, both adenoma and later cancer stages were enriched in species linked with poor cardiometabolic health and immune-mediated diseases, possibly indicating a role for such species as proinflammatory risk factors in CRC.

Despite reported evidence that microbiome changes along CRC stages act more like a continuum than as discrete and highly differentiating configurations, we still lack better characterization of the gut microbiome significantly associated with single-stage transition and of its potential impact on the development of distant metastasis. The increased availability of stool-based metagenomic screening tests can be further exploited in new large cohorts to also improve the detection of early-phase microbiome changes occurring in this transition. Our data suggest that translation into clinical application is an option ready to be explored.

Our study has some limitations in respect to being an association-based study, thus limiting our conclusions in determining any causal relationship between microbiome configurations and tumor progression and onset, for which, however, independent evidence has been reported10,11.

Overall, our study reinforces the robust identification of microbiome biomarkers that can be used in stool-based screening strategies and identifies compositional and structural characteristics of the microbiome associated with disease progression to be prioritized for mechanistic studies.

In this study, we performed a pooled analysis expanding the set of publicly available gut microbiome sporadic CRC cohorts with six newly collected and sequenced in house cohorts (cohort 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), for a total of 1,625 new shotgun gut metagenomes. In total, 555 such new microbiome samples were collected, consistently sequenced and profiled under the ONCOBIOME Consortium, a European effort to unravel associations between intestinal microbiome alterations and different cancer types (https://www.oncobiome.eu). Samples from cohort 5 derived from a subpopulation of the NHSII24,51, and cohort 6 includes CRC samples and controls collected at the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital and the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (Istanbul, Turkey).

Cohort 1 includes stool samples from 163 Italian patients with stage IV CRC enrolled in a multicenter phase II clinical trial (AtezoTRIBE, collected in the University Hospital of Pisa, Italy, NCT number: NCT03721653). Cohort 2 and cohort 3 (COLOBIOME and IIGM-CZ) comprise fecal samples from the Czech Republic collected by two different research institutes (Masaryk University in collaboration with Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute in Brno and Institute of Experimental Medicine in Prague; n = 204 and 124, respectively). Cohort 4 expands a previous Italian cohort at IIGM18 with 101 new samples. Cohort 5 includes fecal samples from 448 healthy individuals, 435 patients with adenoma and 14 patients with CRC from NHSII. Cohort 6 includes 18 patients with CRC and 39 control individuals from the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital and the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (Istanbul, Turkey). Public data considered here include four cohorts from China16,52,53,54, and eight cohorts from Austria, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United States12,13,14,15,17,18,19,55, respectively (‘Data Availability').

In total, we considered 1,471 CRC samples, 1,191 of which have detailed information about the stage of the disease. The combined dataset comprises 94 stage 0, 253 stage I, 257 stage II, 286 stage III, 301 stage IV CRC cases (for 280 CRC samples staging was not available). In addition, 344 stool samples derived from patients with right-sided CRC, and 645 from patients with left-sided CRC. A detailed description of the cohorts included in this study is provided in the following sections and in Supplementary Table 1.

Tumor staging was defined based on the TNM and AJCC systems56. The TNM system measures via a three-index method the amount of growth and spreading of a tumor in a patient. In particular, it accounts for growth of the tumor to the intestinal wall or nearby organs, with no invasion of lymph nodes (T), the amount of invasion of regional lymph nodes (N) and metastases (M) in distant sites. When TNM was available, we converted it to stage, namely stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III and stage IV56. We then considered stage 0–II as early-stage CRC and stage III–IV as late-stage CRC. In addition, we refer to stage IV CRC as metastatic CRC. CRC was categorized based on primary tumor location in two main classes: right-sided CRC, namely originating from the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure and transverse colon; and left-sided CRC, namely originating from the splenic flexure, descending or sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid junction and rectum57.

AtezoTRIBE (NCT03721653) is a prospective phase II clinical trial to study upfront systemic regimens in patients with unresectable stage IV CRC. Patients were not subjected to any other treatment at the time of the first stool sample collection. In total, we analyzed 56 patients presenting right-sided CRC and 91 with left-sided CRC. A further 16 samples with uncertain tumor location were considered only to study microbial trends in stages of CRC analysis. Sample collection followed the same procedure as described for cohort 3.

AtezoTRIBE is a multicenter study and the protocol was approved by the ethics committees at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Participants gave written informed consent before enrollment.

Patients were enrolled at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (Brno, Czech Republic) from 2015 to 2019, as reported previously21. Patient inclusion criteria were: (1) scheduled for resection based on preliminary screening (such as a colonoscopy), (2) no neoadjuvant treatment, (3) no previous CRC diagnosis and (4) with confirmed stage 0–IV CRC without multiplicities (single tumor). Stool samples were collected from untreated patients before the scheduled surgery. Patients performed the collection at home, the morning of their hospitalization for the surgery, using DNA-free cotton swabs (Deltalab) and brought the samples to the hospital, where they were immediately frozen at −80 °C until further processing. In total, this cohort comprises 2 adenomas, 8 stage 0, 42 stage I, 66 stage II, 58 stage III, and 27 stage IV CRC samples. Sixty-four samples derived from individuals affected with CRC primary location in the cecum or ascending colon, 21 from individuals with CRC primary location in the transverse colon and 107 from individuals with CRC primary location in the splenic flexure descending, sigmoid, rectosigmoid or rectum. Patients provided written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Stool specimens and clinical and demographic data were collected from 124 Czech individuals recruited in two hospitals in Prague and one in Plzen, Czech Republic58. The individuals included in this study, like those of cohort 4, were not included in a CRC screening program, but because they were considered at risk for CRC and thus recommended to have a colonoscopy test. Based on colonoscopy results, participants were divided into: (1) 59 patients with CRC; (2) 19 patients with colorectal adenoma (13 nonadvanced and 6 advanced adenomas; no serrated lesions were collected); and (3) 38 colonoscopy-negative individuals and with 8 hyperplastic polyps58. All the samples from CRC cases were collected at diagnosis, before any treatment.

Naturally evacuated fecal samples were obtained from all participants previously instructed to self-collect the specimen at home. Stool samples were collected in nucleic acid collection and transport tubes with RNA stabilizing solution (Norgen Biotek) and returned to the endoscopy unit. Patients performed the collection at home before their hospitalization for the surgery and brought the samples to the hospital, where they were immediately frozen at –80 °C until DNA extraction.

This cohort expands our previously published cohort (cohort 1 in ref. 18) and comprises 181 stool samples from Clinica S. Rita, Vercelli, Italy, of which 59 were from controls, 36 were from patients with adenomas and 86 were CRC samples (2 stage 0, 16 stage I, 25 stage II, 30 stage III and 5 stage IV)58. Among the CRC cases, 30 had tumors originating from the right colon, 6 from the transverse and 49 from the left colon or rectum. All the samples were from sporadic CRC cases, collected at diagnosis before any treatment. Samples were collected in the same way as cohort 3.

The local ethics committees of Azienda Ospedaliera SS. Antonio e Biagio e C. Arrigo of Alessandria (Italy, protocol no. Colorectal miRNA CEC2014), AOU Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino (Italy), the Institute of Experimental Medicine of Prague (Czech Republic), Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (protocol no. 2018/865/MOU) and Masaryk University of Brno (Czech Republic, protocol no. EKV2019-044) approved the study (cohorts 2, 3 and 4). All patients gave written informed consent following the Declaration of Helsinki before participating in the study.

NHSII is a cross-sectional, prospective study of CRC-related gut microbial composition. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and those of participating registries as required. Participants provided written informed consent before study enrollment and stool collection. Specifically, this study recruited a subpopulation of NHSII24,51, a long-running prospective cohort from the United States. All participants contributed a stool sample, with the research aiming to investigate the role of the gut microbiome specifically in participants with recent adenomas. The adenoma (n = 435) and CRC cases (n = 14) in the study were one-to-one matched with healthy control samples (n = 448) based on age at stool collection, ethnicity, month of collection, state of residence and total number of, reason for and date of recent endoscopy. For a subset of cases (n = 39) the matching criteria for ethnicity (expanded definition of Caucasian) and age at collection were relaxed. Adenomas were further defined as high or low risk based on the location, number and histology of the cells. The CRC samples ranged from all stages and were limited as only a limited number of participants in NHSII have been diagnosed with CRC and recently contributed a stool sample. Previously stored, Genotek's OMNIgene fixed, and −80 °C frozen stool samples were processed and sequenced for shotgun metagenomics at Diversigen.

Patients with CRC were recruited at the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital while healthy volunteers contributing to science used as controls were recruited at the Department of Medical Biology, Yeditepe University (both in Istanbul, Turkey). Naturally evacuated fecal samples were obtained from subjects previously instructed to self-collect the specimen at home. For patients with CRC, collection was performed before surgical resection. Samples from participants who had used antibiotics within 1 month before the sample collection were excluded. Samples were collected in nucleic acid collection and transport tubes with RNA stabilizing solution (Norgen Biotek). Stool aliquots (200 μl) were stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul Turkey (ref no. 351, 19/11/2020).

DNA was extracted from stool samples with the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen), and sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep, (M) Tagmentation kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's guidelines. The library pool was subjected to a cleaning step with 0.7× Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (Illumina) at the University of Trento sequencing facility. Sequenced metagenomes were preprocessed using the pipeline available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing for: (1) removal of low-quality reads (quality <20), too short fragments (length <75 bp), and reads with two or more ambiguous nucleotides; (2) host contaminant DNA removal using Bowtie 2 (ref. 59) (--sensitive-local) for the phiX174 Illumina spike-in and human-associated reads (hg19); and (3) creation of paired forward and reverse and unpaired reads output files. Once preprocessed, ONCOBIOME samples presented an average of 37 million reads.

Stool DNA extraction and library preparation followed the procedure described for the ONCOBIOME cohorts. A final clean-up of the library pool was performed with 0.6× AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter), and then resuspended with one-third of the initial pool volume. Sequencing was performed with a NovaSeq 6000 at the IIGM sequencing facility. Cohort 6 was preprocessed with the same pipeline used for the ONCOBIOME studies.

For DNA extraction and sequencing, samples were sent to Diversigen and all steps were completed according to their standardized DEEPSEQ protocol. Briefly, samples were extracted with the PowerSoil Pro (Qiagen) kit using the automated high-throughput method on the QiaCube HT (Qiagen). This used Powerbead Pro Plates (Qiagen) with 0.5 and 0.1 mm ceramic beads, but otherwise followed the manufacturer's protocol. DNA amount and quality were assessed with a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen) post extraction. Libraries were prepared with a modified protocol from the Nextera Library Prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq using paired-end 2 × 150 reads (Illumina). Sequenced samples were then filtered for host contamination via the KeandData pipeline (https://github.com/biobakery/kneaddata). In particular, this pipeline consists of three main steps: a first trimming of poor-quality reads with trimmomatic60, specifically we applied a sliding window trim removing reads after four subsequent bases had a Phred score of 20 or less, and then reads with fewer than 60 base pairs were removed. Next, we filtered repetitive reads with the tandem repeats finder61, and removed adapters with trimmomatic. Finally, host and common sequencing components decontamination was completed with Bowtie 2 against PhiX and the human genome (hg37).

We applied MetaPhlAn 4 (v.4.0.0, database vJan21, with the ‘--statq 0.1')25 and HUMAnN 3.6 (ref. 28) profiling tools to produce microbial taxonomic and functional profiles, respectively. In addition, StrainPhlAn 4 (v.4.0.3)25 was run to generate dominant single nucleotide variant profiles for any species that passed the filtering steps in StrainPhlAn (213; species are filtered for sufficient markers and samples to run the tool). Newly sequenced samples and public data considered in this study were profiled consistently.

We considered metagenomic samples from 11 public CRC–control studies, 8 of which had already been included in previous meta-analyses18,19. Metadata for these cohorts were available in the curatedMetagenomicData27 package and the metagenomes were available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with the following accession codes: PRJEB7774 for Feng, Q. (2015)12; PRJNA531273, PRJNA397112 for Gupta, A. (2019)13; metagenomic data for Obón-Santacana, M. (2022)55 was requested from the authors of the study; PRJNA447983 for Thomas, A.M. (2019)18; PRJEB12449 for Vogtmann, E. (2016)14; PRJEB27928 for Wirbel, J. (2019)19; DRA006684 and DRA008156 for Yachida, S. (2019)15; PRJEB10878 for Yu, J. (2017)16; and PRJEB6070 for Zeller, G. (2014)17. Metagenomic samples for three additional public studies (Liu, N.N. (2022)54, Yang, J. (2020)52 and Yang, Y. (2021)53) were available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (accession numbers: PRJNA731589, PRJNA429097 and PRJNA763023, respectively).

This cohort12 comprises 154 Austrian individuals (61 controls, 47 adenomas and 46 CRC). Staging was available for 45 CRC (7 stage 0, 17 stage I, 9 stage II, 11 stage III and 1 stage IV), with 8 right-sided CRC and 38 left-sided CRC. Patients did not receive antibiotics in the 3 months before collection of the stool sample.

This cohort13 includes 60 stool samples from the same number of individuals from India (equally distributed between Bhopal and Kerala) divided into 30 controls and 30 CRC cases. All the fecal samples in this cohort were collected from people who were not subject to antibiotics close to the sampling date and had not been diagnosed with other diseases.

This cohort54 comprises 164 stool samples from an equal number of individuals from China (85 controls and 79 CRC cases). The cohort derives from the ‘Chinese cohort in Shanghai (CHN_SH)', whose patients were sampled after CRC diagnosis and before any treatment. All the cases include exclusively sporadic CRC. Control individuals were recruited in the Taizhou Imaging Study. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and case or control condition were retrieved from the original publication and the corresponding ENA portal project (PRJNA731589).

This cohort55 includes a subset of the participants in the COLSCREEN study. In total, 156 participants were selected (51 controls, 54 high-risk lesions and 51 CRC) and stool samples collected. Participants were asked to collect the stool sample 1 week before colonoscopy preparation and participants who reported use of antibiotics or probiotics within 1 month before sample collection were excluded.

This is ‘cohort 2' of the study18 and comprises 60 stool samples, collected from the same number of individuals recruited at the European Oncology Institute in Milan, Italy. In particular, the cohort consisted of 28 controls and 32 CRC cases for which no staging or primary tumor location information was available. No subjects reported antibiotic use in the 6 months before the sampling. For CRC cases, sampling was performed before surgery or any cancer treatment.

In total, 110 stool samples were collected from an equal number of US individuals divided into 58 controls and 52 CRC cases (12 stage II, 21 stage III and 18 stage IV; 15 right-sided CRC, 32 left-sided CRC). CRC samples were collected before surgery or any other cancer treatment14.

This cohort19 comprises 125 stool samples, collected from the same number of German individuals. The cohort included 65 controls and 60 CRC cases (3 stage 0, 15 stage I, 20 stage II, 10 stage III and 12 stage IV; 15 right-sided CRC and 42 left-sided CRC). CRC samples were recruited in the ColoCare study and fecal samples were collected after colonoscopy. Control samples were recruited in the PRÄVENT study.

This cohort52 includes 193 stool samples, collected from the same number of individuals and included 95 controls and 98 CRC cases from China (23 stage I, 36 stage II, 31 stage III and 8 stage IV). Stool samples were excluded if individuals used antibiotics, were subjected to radiotherapy or corticosteroids in the month before the sampling. Age, sex, case or control, TNM, stage and primary location were obtained from the original publication and the corresponding ENA portal project (PRJNA429097).

This cohort53 comprises 200 stool samples from the same number of individuals from the Fudan cohort (China) and includes 100 controls and 100 CRC cases. Only samples from individuals who did not use antibiotics or probiotics for 1 month before recruitment were included in the study. CRC stool samples were collected before colonoscopy or other cancer therapies and surgery. Only sporadic CRC cases were included, with no history of inflammation-associated CRC, intestinal bowel syndrome or other cancers. Disease categories (CRC or control) were retrieved from the original publication; raw metagenomes were obtained from the ENA portal accession number PRJNA763023.

This study15 comprises 616 stool samples from the same number of Japanese individuals subjected to colonoscopy. The cohort included 291 controls, 67 adenomas, and 258 CRC cases (73 Stage 0, 75 Stage I, 36 Stage II, 52 Stage III, and 22 Stage IV; 83 right-sided CRC, and 167 left-sided). Only sporadic CRC cases were considered, with no inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or abdominal surgical history.

This cohort16 comprises 128 samples from the same number of individuals, collected in Hong Kong, China, and included 53 controls and 75 CRC cases (12 Stage I, 24 Stage II, 24 Stage III, and 8 Stage IV; 11 right-sided and 54 left-sided CRC).

This cohort17 includes stool samples from 156 individuals from France, with 61 controls, 42 adenomas, 53 CRC cases (15 Stage I, 7 Stage II, 10 Stage III, and 21 Stage IV; 17 were right-sided CRC and 36 were left-sided CRC). Samples were collected before colonoscopy.

For the definition of the oral signature, we collected the data available from 5 datasets for a total of 495 healthy individuals for whom both stool and oral (either from saliva or tongue dorsum) samples were available for the same subject and time point. The identified datasets are: BritoIL_2016 (116 participants, stool and saliva)62, FerrettiP_2018 (20 participants, stool and tongue dorsum)63, HMP_2012 (85 participants with stool and tongue dorsum samples)31, KartalE_2022 (39 participants, stool and saliva)64 and NagataN_2022 (235 participants, stool and saliva)65. The oral signature was defined based on the distribution of specific microbial species that met the following criteria: (1) present exclusively in the oral cavity of at least 20% of participants; (2) found in both the oral cavity and stool of fewer participants than those that were exclusively oral; and (3) present exclusively in stool in fewer than 5% of participants. These constraints resulted in a signature of 235 oral-typical species (Supplementary Table 3).

To assess alpha-diversity we used the Shannon index (vegan R package) and the richness computed as the number of species present in a sample. Dimensionality reduction was been performed using the Rtsne function from the Rtsne R package, providing the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix as input. PERMANOVA was performed using the adonis2 function from the vegan R package with 999 permutations and blocked for study of origin by the setBlocks function, with and without including age, sex and BMI in the model. The distance matrix used both for the multidimensional scaling and the PERMANOVA is based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix estimated with the vegdist function from the vegan R package. We reported R2 for each test. Comparisons with P ≤ 0.01 were considered significant.

To quantify gut colonization by typically oral commensal species (defined in the previous section), we developed two quantitative scores. The ‘oral-to-gut score' for each stool sample sums the relative abundance of the oral SGBs present. The ‘oral-to-gut richness,' in contrast, counts the number of distinct oral SGBs present in each stool sample.

Because this work is a multicohort study and a batch effect exists in data from different origins, we used the meta-analysis of SMDs computed in each dataset instead of effect sizes computed from batch-effect corrected data as the primary approach for biomarker discovery. Our choice is motivated by the fact that correcting for batch effect is a difficult task, because of both incomplete information on batch effects (not only between cohorts, but also within cohorts), and the lack of a consensus approach for batch correction in microbiome studies. In particular, SMDs were computed with Hedges' method66 which adds a correction for low sample bias to Cohen's d estimator. Meta-analysis was performed using the metacont function from the meta R package. Between-study variance (𝜏2) was estimated via restricted maximum likelihood and CIs of the summary effect were adjusted with the Hartung and Knapp method67. This procedure was applied to all microbiome features with at least 10% prevalence and present in at least five samples in one of the testing sets when at least three studies presented a minimum of ten samples for each class. Adjusted P values (q values, in the text) were computed via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Significance was determined as Benjamini–Hochberg q < 0.1 or P < 0.01. Meta-analysis of standardized linear model estimates was applied to determine the effect sizes corrected for age, sex and BMI. Per-cohort linear models were fitted for each feature relative abundance (arcsine square root transformed) with the additive effect of age, sex and BMI. Once standardized by the standard error, we performed standard meta-analysis as described above.

For the ML analysis, we used the random forest classifier as implemented in the metaml tool (https://github.com/SegataLab/metaml)29. An ensemble of 1,000 trees with a minimum of 5 samples per leaf (grid-search optimal max features per split to consider in CV, and no other normalization performed) was trained and tested in the following settings on the data: (1) per-dataset CV (10-fold CV repeated 20 times); (2) across-study prediction (for each pair of studies the classifier is trained on one and tested on the other); and (3) LODO approach (each cohort becomes the testing set while all the others are used for training). CV comparisons were considered when presenting at least 15 samples for each class in one cohort, whereas between-dataset CV and LODO comparisons were considered when 15 samples were available in each class both in the training and validation sets. NHSII was included in the training set for comparison of controls versus CRC in LODO, but was not considered a validation cohort for the unbalanced sample sizes between the two classes. This setup was extensively applied in previous works18,28, allowing for robust comparison of our results with those in the literature. Relative abundance profiles (values in the [0, 1] range) were previously arcsine square root transformed. When testing for oral-typical or non-oral species, after selection, we rescaled the relative abundance to [0,1], and then transformed via arcsine square root. No other feature selection was performed otherwise.

For the reasons mentioned above, we decided not to integrate the studies in a single large cohort and perform batch-effect correction, previous to ML. Our approach treats each study independently and tests the strength of the trained model in the same study (per-dataset CV), in a different study (across-studies prediction) or in the left-out study when validated in LODO. This ensures that batch-effect correction does not introduce favorable bias in the classification tasks.

Linear mixed models, via the MaAsLin 2 R package68, were iteratively applied fitting each microbial abundance profile (after arcsine square root transformation) with sample condition (control, adenoma, CRC stage 0, I, II, III, IV) as the fixed effect, and originating cohort as the random effect. The MaAsLin 2 ‘LM' model uses the lmer function from the lmerTest R package. Correction of the P values of the coefficients from the models was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, as obtained from MaAsLin 2. For the fitting of each model, species were considered if they were at least 10% prevalent across all controls, adenoma and stages 0–IV. Concordant signature between stages was computed by applying the Jaccard similarity, which consists of the number of elements in the intersection between the signatures deriving from each stage, divided by the number of elements in the union between them. We applied MaAsLin 2 with the same setting to test SGB differential abundant between primary tumor locations in stage IV CRC. In both analyses, only associations with q < 0.1 were considered significant.

To complete subspecies clade-level association analysis with CRC, we used Anpan (v.0.3.0, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/anpan)69, an R package that quantifies the associations between differential gene carriage, subspecies phylogenetic structure and host phenotypic outcomes. The gene model in Anpan addresses two key issues: robust and accurate detection of species whose genes are well-covered in shotgun metagenomes; and sensitive detection of consistently associated genes with phenotypic outcomes. Anpan first filters samples to remove any without enough species-specific gene coverage to accurately assess gene-level effects. A GLM was then used to model each gene's association with the outcome (accounting for metadata covariates), followed by FDR correction. Here, our outcomes of interest were CRC or control, early- or late-stage CRC and primary tumor location (right-sided versus left-sided), adjusted for age, sex and study (which accounts for the geographic location of collection).

From the predicted genes with Anpan, we first quantified the number of significant hits per species, with a significance threshold of an absolute coefficient of 2 and q < 0.05. Next, we regrouped the UniRef90 genes to GO terms by direct matching. We also used annotations from FUGAsseM to add predicted GO term annotations based on metagenomic and metatranscriptomic covariation patterns. Specifically, FUGAsseM predicts the functions of uncharacterized gene products in the context of microbial communities by integrating multiple types of community-wide evidence. It extends ‘guilt by association' approaches by building an individual random forest classifier predicting gene function based on each data type, followed by an ensemble tier that builds an integrated classifier combining the learning results from the first tier. As a result, putative functional annotations are assigned to uncharacterized proteins that achieve high prediction probability.

Next, we assessed the phylogenetic associations with our outcomes of interest. StrainPhlAn trees (http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/strainphlan/) were used as input to phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models to assess phylogenetic associations with the outcomes. Phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models are probabilistic models that account for phylogenetic structure by encoding the tree structure as a correlation matrix. For these models, we also used age and sex as covariates and study as an offset variable. We referred to associations as hits if the phylogenetic model improved the ELPD over a base GLM (the same model except without phylogenetic information) by more than 2. ELPD is a model comparison metric akin to the Akaike information criterion.

We tested whether the inclusion of strain-related microbial features in a PERMANOVA leads to improvement in the model association or prediction. Because phylogenetic information was already tested via anpan, we developed a complementary approach for defining strain-level features based on strain preferences for a given nucleotide in marker genes. In particular, starting from StrainPhlAn 4 reconstructed multiple sequence alignments of the marker genes for the 213 SGBs, we selected genetic positions in marker genes with binary entropy at least 0.5 (to remove positions with little strain-level variability), by selecting those that presented the minimum number of gaps in clusters of 1-ANI (average nucleotide identity) ≤0.05 (to remove features very correlated to each other). We then expanded each position into five features using one-hot encoding, one for each nucleotide and one representing a gap. The value in each of these features can be either 1 when the corresponding nucleotide or gap is present in that position, or 0 otherwise. In this way, we obtained a total of 1,382,825 features across all the SGBs. Given the large number of features produced, we then applied an additional set of thresholds based on prevalence and removing collinear ones. In particular, features with <20% prevalence or prevalence >80% in the controls and CRC samples were removed, ensuring that very rare or too common base preferences were not considered, thus obtaining 42,094 features. We then removed features highly correlated (Pearson correlation >0.5) with any other feature, selecting the first occurrence as the representative and discarding all other features that correlated with it with a higher absolute Pearson coefficient than the threshold selected (0.5). This step produced a set of 2,722 features for the 0.5 Pearson correlation threshold. PERMANOVA tests with this feature set were performed as described earlier in Methods, specifying Jaccard as the distance measure.

The cardiometabolic microbial signature was estimated, as reported in our previous work25,36, as the species most associated with the set of cardiometabolic indices defined in ref. 36. In brief, partial Spearman correlations were computed between each SGB and the set of indices associated with cardiometabolic risk, correcting for sex, age and BMI. Partial correlations were ranked and averaged first in each category and then across categories to derive a global rank. Ranks ranged between 0 and 1 for the most favorable and unfavorable species, respectively, and we considered those SGBs with a rank above the third quartile of the distribution. We identified 115 SGBs representing a higher cardiometabolic risk and that account for 2.97% of the detected SGBs across all analyzed cohorts.

We compared the signatures found for CRC in meta-analysis with signatures for other disease types or groups or diseases. Specifically, we searched in the curatedMetagenomicData 3 repository for case-control studies for T2D (control n = 882, cases n = 750, four cohorts)70,71,72,73, ulcerative colitis (n = 247 and 84), CD (n = 291 and 83, three cohorts in total)38,74,75, inflammatory diseases (including asthma, Behcet syndrome, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and myalgic encephalomyelitis, n = 918 and 827, five cohorts)76,77,78,79,80. IBD was obtained with a quarry of ulcerative colitis and CD. We profiled their reads with MetaPhlAn 4. Then, to compare the microbial signature associated with CRC, we arcsine square root transformed all the MetaPhlAn 4 SGB-level relative abundances, we performed a meta-analysis of SMDs computed starting from a linear regression linking the disease state to the SGB transformed abundance and adjusted by country to take into account potential population effect. SMDs and uncertainty estimations were meta-analyzed via inverse variance weighting using Paule–Mandel heterogeneity. From the resulting tables, signatures for the six disease types were retrieved by selecting those SGBs having an FDR for the meta-analysis P value <0.1 and being found in a minimum of three datasets.

a) Richness of microbial enzymes and pathways in controls, adenomas, the different CRC stages and primary tumor locations. The abbreviations used in this plot follow the ones in Main Fig. 1. In particular, C: control, A: adenoma; 0: CRC Stage 0; I: CRC Stage I; II: CRC Stage II; III: CRC Stage III; IV: CRC Stage IV; R: right-sided CRC; L: left-sided CRC. b) t-SNE based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for taxonomic and functional profiles. The samples are colored according to CRC staging in the first row (light-green for controls, light-blue for adenomas, orange for early-CRC and brown for late-CRC), while they are colored according to primary tumor location in the second row (red for right-sided CRC and blue for left-sided CRC). The cohort derivation (either from ONCOBIOME, NHSII or public studies) is indicated as the shape of each point (triangle for ONCOBIOME, square for NHSII and a circle for public cohorts).

A) CRC sample relative abundance (%) of highly prevalent oral species (at least 10% in CRC). Each column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to an SGB. The upper threshold in the heatmap color scale corresponds to the 99th percentile of oral species relative abundance in CRC samples. Relative abundance values higher than this threshold are represented with the same color. B) Exclusive and common prevalence of SGBs in the oral cavity and in the stool samples of the cohorts used for the definition of the oral SGB list and (C) trend in the number of SGBs in the list at different thresholds of exclusive oral prevalence and exclusive stool prevalence. D) Distribution of the cumulative relative abundances of species categorized as oral or non-oral. E) Meta-analysis effect sizes (Hedges' g) of the oral-to-gut score computed based on different thresholds of the ‘Exclusive oral prevalence'.

A) The left-most phylogenetic tree shows the relationships between F. nucleatum SGBs and previously characterized F. nucleatum subspecies. Each leaf represents either an isolated genome (circle) or a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG, reported as a triangle), as available in the Jun23 release of the MetaPhlAn 4 database. The color of the leaf corresponds to the assigned SGB. Phylogenies were reconstructed using PhyloPhlAn 3. The correspondence between F. nucleatum SGBs and F. nucleatum subspecies is the following: subspecies hwasookii corresponds to SGB5997, subspecies polymorphum to SGB6001, subspecies animalis to SGB6007 (previously Fna C2, in 26), subspecies nucleatum to SGB6011 (Fusobacterium nucleatum sensu stricto), subspecies vincentii to both SGB6013 (previously Fna C1, in 26) and SGB6014, Fusobacterium simiae to SGB6018 and subspecies polymorphum to SGB101482. The right-most tree reports in addition the body site of origin from which the genomes were reconstructed. B) Phylogenetic reconstruction via PhyloPhlAn 3 of isolate and MAGs either derived from oral, stool, or unknown body site for Fusobacterium nucleatum SGB6007 (F. nucleatum subspecies animalis), Veillonella atypica SGB6936, Veillonella rogosae SGB6956, Veillonella dispar SGB6952, Streptococcus mutans SGB8000, and Streptococcus parasanguinis SGB8071. SGBs with ELPD > 8 from the PGLMM with body-site of origin as target variable are marked with an asterisk.

Correlation of the effect sizes estimated via meta-analysis (Hedges' g SMD values, on the x-axis) with the average ranked feature importance derived from the machine learning (LODO, on the y-axis). Significant SGBs detected via the meta-analysis for the comparisons tested in the manuscript (controls vs CRC, early stages CRC vs late stages CRC, non-metastatic vs stage IV CRC and right-sided vs left-sided CRC) are in black (q < 0.1) and red (P < 0.01). The comparison controls vs CRC showed the highest Spearman's correlation coefficient (0.41), with right-CRC vs left-CRC Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.21. This confirms the stronger biomarkers obtained by these comparisons, while the comparisons on stages presented non-significant correlation coefficients (Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.06 and 0.05 for early-stages vs late-stages and non-metastatic vs metastatic CRC, respectively).

A) Differential abundant oral SGBs in the signature of CRC between the oral plaque and tongue dorsum in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) study. We selected 86 participants of the HMP study with matched microbiome samples for the two oral cavity sites. Differential abundance analysis was performed via Wilcoxon signed-rank test and adjusted p-values (q) were computed via Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction. q < 0.001 is indicated with ‘***'. log2 fold-change (FC) between average relative abundances (RA) in the two sites is reported in the heatmap. Positive values of the RA log2 FC indicate increased relative abundance in the plaque, while negative in the tongue dorsum subsite. B-D) Validation of the machine learning and CRC gut microbiome signature between patients with in situ or resected primary tumor in the AtezoTRIBE study.

Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model q < 0.1) between controls and CRC. Associations with CRC present Hedges' g SMD > 0, and associations with controls present Hedges' g SMD < 0. Significant single-dataset comparison (q < 0.1) is reported in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (q ≥ 0.1) is in lighter gray.

A) Meta-analysis of sulfur-related pathways for controls vs CRC. Hedges' g meta-analysis SMD and 95% confidence intervals are reported in the first plot. Significance level is indicated via a color gradient. P-values have been adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling FDR. Single cohort effect size levels are reported in the heatmap, ranging from dark blue for SMD = −1.5 to dark red for SMD = 1.5. Mean difference in abundance with species contribution for each pathway is reported in the stacked barplot on the right. B-C) Overview of histidine-related microbiome pathways and their associations with CRC, staging and primary tumor location. B) Meta-analysis of histidine-related pathways for controls vs CRC, early CRC (Stages 0-II) vs late CRC (Stages III-IV), non-metastatic CRC (Stages 0-III) vs metastatic CRC (Stage IV), and right-sided CRC and left-sided CRC. Hedges' g meta-analysis SMD and 95% confidence intervals are reported in the first plot. Significance level is indicated via a color gradient. P-values have been adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling FDR. Single cohort effect size levels are reported in the heatmap, ranging from dark blue for SMD = −1.5 to dark red for SMD = 1.5. Mean difference in abundance with species contribution for each pathway is reported in the stacked barplot on the right. C) Visual representation of the biochemical mechanisms that lead to L-glutamate production from L-histidine, with the production as a side product of ammonium.

A) Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model P < 0.01) between early (stages 0-II) and late (stages III-IV) CRC. Associations with CRC Stage III-IV present Hedges' g SMD > 0, and associations with CRC Stages 0-II present Hedges' SMD < 0. Significant single-dataset comparison (P < 0.01) is reported in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (P ≥ 0.01) is in lighter gray. B) Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model q < 0.1) between non-metastatic (stages 0-III) and metastatic (stage IV) CRC. Associations with stage IV present SMD > 0, and associations with CRC Stages 0-III present SMD < 0. Significant single-dataset comparison (q < 0.1) is marked in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (q ≥ 0.1) are in lighter gray.

Each line-plot represents the trends of an SGB in adenoma and the different stages of CRC in relation to controls' abundances. Each point in the line is the coefficient from the linear mixed model (MaAsLin2) run to determine the association for each SGB and the different stages. Non-significant coefficients (q ≥ 0.1) are reported with a violet circle, while significant coefficients (either positive or negative, q < 0.1) are reported as a brown diamond. The x-axis of each line plot indicate the control, adenoma or stage: C for control, A for adenoma; 0 for CRC Stage 0; I for CRC Stage I; II for CRC Stage II; III for CRC Stage III; IV for CRC Stage IV.

Differentially abundant microbial pathways (meta-analysis model P < 0.01) between right-sided and left-sided CRC. Pathways associated with right-sided CRC present SMD < 0, and pathways associated with left-sided CRC present SMD > 0. Significant single-dataset comparisons (P < 0.01) are marked in dark gray, while non-significant single-dataset associations (P ≥ 0.01) are in lighter gray.

In the bustling Jatinegara market in Jakarta, cages are stacked three metres high, holding creatures from all corners of Indonesia and beyond. Bats, raccoon dogs, macaques and songbirds — sold as pets or food — are crammed together, their musky odours mingling with the stench of urine and faeces in the damp tropical air.

For decades, public-health experts have warned about the risks of infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans in markets such as Jatinegara, which are part of a global industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. These markets remain “the best way of transmitting diseases”, says James Wood, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Jatinegara's location, in an international travel hub with a population of 11 million people, increases that risk considerably.

Will bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising

Will bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising

The world is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which many researchers say probably started, or was at least amplified, at a market selling live animals in Wuhan, China1,2. Yet the wildlife trade still thrives in many parts of the globe. China banned the farming and trading of most wildlife species for food in 2020, but these practices have simply gone underground. “We are back to business as usual,” says Vincent Nijman, a conservation biologist at Oxford Brookes University, UK, with “millions and millions of animals being traded on a daily basis”.

The wildlife trade acts as a vast global network of unregulated natural laboratories, through which potential pathogens freely circulate, evolve and ultimately congregate in urban centres, says Andrew Cunningham, a wildlife epidemiologist at the Institute of Zoology in London. “It's the scariest thing we are doing,” he says.

Before the pandemic, there was a strong emphasis on identifying new viruses in the wild. These efforts were driven by the idea that it might be possible to predict which viruses could spark major disease outbreaks. But many researchers now say that this assumption was flawed.

Increasingly, scientists are looking to human–wildlife interfaces — including markets and the trade networks that supply them — as crucial sites for the study of zoonoses, human diseases caused by pathogens that normally infect other species. A handful of research groups are now working to understand how pathogens jump between species, why some jumps cause outbreaks and others don't, and what kinds of intervention can reduce the risks. But such work is costly, can be dangerous and demands sustained support, which has become increasingly hard to secure.

Without investing in such research, “you're really flying blind”, says Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. “You're making recommendations that may not be the most appropriate.”

In the veterinary room of Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, Tran Nam Trieu carefully lifts a Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) onto an examination table. The creature is curled into a ball, its scales subtly rising and falling with each breath. Confiscated near the border with China in early 2023, it is now in the care of Save Vietnam's Wildlife, a non-profit conservation organization that runs a rescue centre at the park. Delicately unrolling it, Trieu, a veterinary surgeon, reveals its soft pink belly and the wound from an amputation; its left hind leg was damaged in a snare.

The enormous demand in China for pangolin meat and scales — believed, without evidence, to cure a wide range of ailments — has made these creatures the poster child of the illegal wildlife trade. And studies of confiscated pangolins in China have detected several types of coronavirus that share up to 92% of their genome with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-193. Although too distantly related to have given rise to SARS-CoV-2, the viruses sometimes cause COVID-19-like symptoms in these animals and might have the potential to infect humans.

Other coronaviruses found in these pangolins are relatives of those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The virus spike proteins have a feature known as a furin cleavage site4, thought to be crucial for the viruses to replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract. The presence of a similar feature in SARS-CoV-2 has contributed to the suspicion that the virus might have been engineered by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — although it could also have arisen naturally.

Wood recognizes the “small possibility” that research-associated activities could have triggered the pandemic. But that “should not prevent us from focusing on the bigger picture”, he says: the wildlife trade poses a much greater zoonotic risk than do lab accidents.

25 million deaths: what could happen if the US ends global health funding

25 million deaths: what could happen if the US ends global health funding

To gauge those risks, Nguyen Thi Thanh Nga, a researcher at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Hanoi, and her colleagues are working to identify potential pathogens circulating in trafficked pangolins in Vietnam — a major transit hub for moving wildlife into China — and exploring how these microorganisms relate to those found in source and destination countries. Of 246 pangolins confiscated across Vietnam between 2015 and 2018 — many from the rescue centre in Cuc Phuong — 7 were infected with coronaviruses, although none had signs of respiratory or other systemic illnesses5. Partial sequences of these viruses closely resemble those of viruses found in pangolins seized in China.

Pangolins further upstream in the supply chain, however, seemed unaffected: none of the 334 pangolins confiscated from smugglers or rescued from the wild in Malaysia between 2009 and 2019 tested positive for coronaviruses6.

The increasing detection rate of coronaviruses along the supply chain is consistent with another study by WCS researchers, on rats captured and sold for food in Vietnam7. The team found that the proportion of rats that tested positive for coronaviruses was tenfold higher at the markets and restaurants where they're sold than in the fields where they're caught.

Some researchers are working to get a better handle on the human behaviours that help zoonotic viruses to thrive and spread. In 2017, Jusuf Kalengkongan, a behavioural scientist and founder of the Sulawesi Bat Conservation organization in Airmadidi, Indonesia, spent months living among wildlife hunters in villages in the province of Southeast Sulawesi. Capturing and handling bats can be dangerous work, he says, and some hunters develop fevers when wounds from a scratch or bite become infected. Rather than seeking hospital care, they typically take herbs and over-the-counter medications, he says. Village elders recalled a mysterious disease outbreak in which dozens of people died in a few weeks, Kalengkongan says.

Hung Nguyen-Viet, an animal-health specialist at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, is leading a similar project in Vietnam. Researching trade networks, he says, is sensitive work that requires significant trust-building. A key question his team seeks to answer is: what do people do when the wild animals they capture fall ill? Some people choose to eat them, whereas others try to sell them to unsuspecting customers at a market far away, says Nguyen-Viet. Few, he says, would report it to the authorities, for fear of consequences to their livelihoods.

Medical anthropologist Hannah Brown at the University of Durham, UK, says that attempts to regulate the wildlife trade need to take these fears seriously, or risk pushing the activity further underground. This happened when the consumption of wild-animal meat was banned in West Africa during the 2014–16 Ebola epidemic, which was suspected — but never proved — to have been caused by the eating of bats. Ten years on, says Brown, people there are still negatively affected by the policy and remain suspicious of the authorities and international researchers.

Some scientists have managed to cultivate the trust of wildlife traders in Indonesia. At the Langowan market in North Sulawesi, which sells both wild-animal meat and live animals, Tiltje Ransaleleh asks vendors about their supplies, the species they've sold and their origins. Beneath a canopy of red fabric that wards off the tropical Sun, Ransaleleh, a zoologist at Sam Ratulangi University in Manado, Indonesia, and her colleagues collect swab samples from bats lining the wooden stalls.

Her team has mapped an intricate network of supply chains and identified the intermediaries — who purchase wild animals (including up to one million bats a year) from hunters and transport them to markets — as a potential vehicle for disease transmission8. One insight gleaned, she says, is that festive periods are the riskiest, when sales can surge to 5 times their usual volume, with more than 10,000 bats sold in a single day at Langowan.

These in-depth studies of trade networks and human behaviour are essential for tracking the movement of wild animals and the potential pathogens they carry, says Stephen Luby, a disease ecologist at Stanford University in California.

Metrics details

On September 16th, 2023, an anomalous 10.88 mHz seismic signal was observed globally, persisting for 9 days. One month later an identical signal appeared, lasting for another week. Several studies have theorized that these signals were produced by seiches which formed after two landslide-generated mega-tsunamis in an East Greenland fjord. This theory is supported by seismic inversions, and analytical and numerical modeling, but no direct observations have been made. Here, we present primary observations of this phenomenon using data from the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission. By ruling out other oceanographic processes, we validate the seiche theory of previous authors and independently estimate its initial amplitude at 7.9 m using Bayesian machine learning and seismic data. This study demonstrates the value of satellite altimetry for studying fast oceanic processes and extreme events, while also highlighting the need for specialized methods to address the altimetric data's limitations, namely temporal sparsity. These data and approaches will help in understanding future unseen extremes driven by climate change.

Extreme events are evolving as a direct consequence of climate change, leading to the emergence of new, previously unobserved phenomena1,2. In remote regions like the Arctic, where in situ measurements are sparse, scientists depend on analytical and numerical models to explore these events. However, modeling in such regions presents significant challenges due to the uncertainties in the data required to calibrate and validate these models3. Consequently, large simplifications are often necessary, potentially resulting in substantial discrepancies between observed and modeled phenomena.

The mysterious 10.88 mHz very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, which appeared following a tsunamigenic landslide in the Dickson fjord, Greenland, on September 16th, 2023, and the subsequent interdisciplinary scientific efforts to determine its origin, underscore these challenges. Two independent studies4,5 have hypothesized that the signal was driven by a standing wave, or seiche, which formed in the aftermath of the tsunami. While it is well-documented that seiches can form in resonant enclosed and semi-enclosed basins6, the loading-induced tilt they produce has only been observed locally (<30 km) and for short durations (<1 h)5,7. Moreover, no prior evidence exists of persistent fluid sloshing (lasting several days) without an external driver. The 9-day attenuation of the globally detected VLP seismic signal is thus highly anomalous. Even more curious was the reappearance of the signal on October 11th, 2023, as noted by ref. 5, with approximately half the magnitude and duration of the initial event. This recurrence coincided with a second tsunamigenic landslide in the same gully in the Dickson fjord.

The rock-ice avalanches and subsequent tsunamis from both events have been well-documented through a combination of satellite and field observations, including evidence of tsunami run-up within the fjord and as far away as the research station at Ella \(\varnothing\), over 72 km away4,5 (Section “Tsunami Information”, and Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, evidence for the seiche has, by necessity, relied solely on a combination of analytical and numerical models, supplemented by seismic observations. While the seismic amplitudes are well reproduced, significant discrepancies remain between these studies in the estimated initial amplitude of the seiche (ranging from 2.6 m to 7.4–8.8 m). Even more perplexing is the fact that the earth-shaking seiche was not observed by the Danish military whilst surveying the fjord on September 19th5. Hence, empirical observations are essential not only to confirm the existence of the seiche but also to validate the models and refine our understanding of the event dynamics.

To support the conclusions that the 10.88 mHz VLP signal was produced by a seiche in the Dickson fjord the authors of ref. 4,5 applied two independent approaches. Both studies identify the observed radiation pattern of seismic Rayleigh and Love waves to be consistent with an oscillating single force perpendicular to the Dickson fjord. Seismic Rayleigh waves exhibit elliptical, rolling motion with both vertical and radial displacement, propagating radially from the source. Love waves exhibit purely transverse motion perpendicular to their propagation direction. Additionally, both groups identify seismic source locations near the Dickson fjord. Here we present a much abbreviated summary of the additional methods and evidence.

By performing a seismic inversion on three sets of teleseismic arrays, the authors of ref. 4 isolate a predominantly horizontal and perpendicular force to the Dickson fjord. This finding serves as the basis of a simple analytical model of the sloshing physics by considering a simplified rectangular fjord geometry of 2 × 20 km. Using the single force inversion, they identify an initial horizontal force of ~160 GN, which leads to an estimated initial amplitude of 2.6 m. While a 2-d finite difference modeling approach was applied in the simplified rectangular geometry, this model only serves to illustrate that the fundamental-mode oscillation can form. Much effort is devoted to identifying the physical drivers of the observed damping, which, due to our approach not requiring these, we do not discuss further.

The large interdisciplinary team in ref. 5 use a combination of high-resolution numerical simulation and analytical modeling to corroborate their claims. Two numerical approaches are considered, however, their preferred approach employs a nonlinear hydrostatic model implemented in HySea8 which treats the landslide as a granular flow. Using a fine grid spacing of 3 m, the simulation stabilizes into a slowly decaying seiche after ~5 min with an initial amplitude of 7.4 m. Notably, the first eigenmode has an oscillation frequency of 11.45 mHz (85 s), which differs from the observed VLP signal frequency of 10.88 mHz (92 s). This numerical simulation is then employed as a source time function to generate global seismic waveforms. Through direct comparison of the simulated envelope, the authors find good agreement between the synthetic and observed signal attenuation. An analytical model is also utilized, using a more realistic simplified geometry than in ref. 4. The authors identify the initial force to be 500 GN, significantly larger than the 160 GN estimate in ref. 4. This yields an estimated initial seiche amplitude of 8.8 meters.

While both studies provide compelling evidence that the source of the persistent 10.88 mHz signal was a seiche originating in the Dickson fjord, significantly different values are obtained for the initial amplitude of the seiche (2.6 m vs. 7.4–8.8 m). Both studies attribute these discrepancies to unmodelled effects. We note that both studies consider significantly different simplified fjord geometries, e.g.,4 assume a fjord width of 2 km, and a length of 20 km, and5 assume a width of 2.7–2.88 km (depending on the figure) and a length of 10 km. Naturally, these choices will lead to different analytical estimates of seiche amplitudes.

Here, we offer a completely different approach—using primary observations of this phenomenon to answer these questions. Using these data in conjunction with seismic observations, we estimate initial amplitudes of the September and October seiche events and compare these results with the prior studies. These observations and estimates provide conclusive evidence for the existence of this phenomena.

In contrast to in-situ devices, satellite altimetry provides near-global measurements, albeit with an inevitable trade-off in temporal sampling9. After more than 30 years, these data have revolutionized our understanding of many oceanic and climatic processes10. However, significant challenges arise in the study of extreme events due to a combination of the temporal sparsity, and the 1-d nature of the observations. Conventional Nadir altimeters sample data directly beneath the spacecraft, producing 1-d profiles along the sea-surface. This sampling severely limits the ability to draw conclusions regarding the spatial dynamics of extremes, and often leaves events unobserved altogether.

The wide-swath Surface Water Ocean Topography mission, launched on December 15th, 2022, has overcome many of these deficiencies11. Unlike conventional Nadir altimeters, the KaRIn instrument onboard SWOT provides ultra-high resolution 2-d measurements of ocean surfaces extending 50 km on either side of the spacecraft12. SWOT provides high accuracy measurements directly up to coastlines, and uniquely into fjords, with an effective pixelcloud resolution of 2.5 m along-track and a variable resolution ranging from 10 m to 70 m in the cross-track direction11. These measurements have low instrumental noise of less than 0.4 cm13. An overview of these sampling characteristics and an example of a single SWOT pass over the Dickson fjord is shown in Fig. 1C. The pixelcloud contains more than 300,000 measurements and provides complete coverage of the study region.

After transitioning to the Science orbit phase of the SWOT mission, SWOT made several observations of the Dickson fjord shortly after the occurrence of both tsunamigenic landslides. For the September 16th event, these passes occurred 0.5-days, 1.5-days, and 4.8-days after the VLP developed. For the October 11th event, only a single “usable” pass existed 0.5 days after the VLP began.

SWOT pixelcloud observations of the Dickson fjord for both the September and October events are shown in Fig. 2. For the October 12th observation (0.5 days post-tsunami), a large negative cross-channel slope (relative to the line \(\overline{{X}_{1}{X}_{2}}\)) can be observed across the minor-axis of the fjord. Here we refer to the longitudinal-axis of the fjord as the major axis with the minor axis sitting perpendicular to it. While some noise artifacts exist around 27°W, the spatial distribution of resonant nodes is in good agreement with the high-resolution tsunami simulation in ref. 5.

B, C, D Consecutive SWOT observations of the fjord 0.5 days, 1.5 days, and 4.8 days after the September 16th event respectively.

Unfortunately, strong noise artifacts muddle large portions of the September 17th and 18th observations. However, on September 17th (0.5 days post-tsunami), a cross-channel slope can be observed antiphase to both the October 11th and September 18th observations. Due to the noise artifacts on September 18th, estimates of the slope are not accurate. A description of the possible sources of these artifacts is given in Section “SWOT Data and Processing”. The September 21st observations exhibit almost no noise artifacts and a very shallow negative cross-channel slope. The spatial distribution of nodes is consistent with those observed on October 12th and the tsunami simulation in ref. 5. We note that significant discrepancies exist between the simulated and observed sea-surface, particularly in the upper reaches of the fjord. Here, the SWOT observations suggest the presence of a persistent water build-up which appears to go unmodeled due to boundary choices.

The SWOT data alone cannot estimate the total amplitude of the seiche as the observations could have occurred at any phase of the oscillation period. To overcome this, SWOT observations are referenced to seismic data from the II.ALE seismic station located at 82.5033°N 62.3500°W (1322.9 km away). The II.ALE station sits directly adjacent to the Love node and is thus characterized by almost exclusively Rayleigh waves as shown in Fig. 1B, D. The measured vertical displacement at II.ALE is filtered between 10 and 13 mHz, and shown for both events in Fig. 3A, B. SWOT observations are shown as vertical lines. We estimate a phase speed of 4.03 km s−1 using a heterogeneous Earth model14, and an approximate distance from the seismic source of 1409.5 km computed using the same heterogenous Earth model (see Section “Seismic Attribution” for details, and Supplementary Fig. 1 for relative location). Estimates of the uncertainty in this value, as well as validation using synthetic data are also provided in Section “Seismic Attribution”. The relative magnitude and phase of the seiche can be directly determined through comparisons with the observed ground motion. Snapshots of the observed vertical VLP signal with SWOT observations highlighted are shown in Fig. 3C–F. The SWOT observed cross-channel slopes, computed between points X1 and X2 which gave rise to these signals are plotted directly below in Fig. 3G–J. The observed cross-channel slopes nicely correspond to the vertical displacement produced at station II.ALE. That is, negative cross-channel slopes (from X1 to X2) are associated with a negative vertical displacement and vice versa. The magnitudes also show good agreement. We note that this is exactly what is expected from the horizontal force produced by the seiche oscillation (Section “Simple Analytical Seiche”)5.

C–F Normalized vertical (\(\hat{Z}\)) displacement VLP signals with signals observed by SWOT shown as vertical lines. Observed magnitudes relative to the maximum amplitude are shown. G–J Corresponding SWOT cross-channel observations from X1 to X2. Slope estimates and associated Bayesian R2 values from a Bayesian linear model are provided (Section “Bayesian Regression”).

To validate these observations, the normalized VLP signal is used to estimate the initial amplitude of the seiche. Estimated slopes are computed using a Bayesian linear model (Section “Bayesian Regression”). Uncertainty estimates are obtained at both the parameter level, alongside estimates of the noise content of the data. Due to the fact that each study assumes a different width and length of the fjord, we instead consider each estimate in terms of the corresponding cross-channel slope at maximum amplitude (MXCS). For5 their initial amplitude estimate of 7.4–8.8 m translates to an MXCS of 2.56–3.13 m km−1, and the initial amplitude estimate of 2.6 m by ref. 4 yields an MXCS of 1.3 m km−1. Using the SWOT observations from September 17th we estimate the MXCS to be 1.83 ± 0.59 m km−1. This value sits in between the estimates of both previous studies, however, the analytical estimate by ref. 4 sits at the very bottom of the confidence intervals, and the numerical estimate from ref. 5 just outside the top. Data from September 18th and 21st were not utilized due to large relative uncertainties and low Bayesian R2 scores15 (see Section “Bayesian Regression”). For the October event, we estimate the MXCS to be 1.37 ± 0.13 m km−1. The fact that the October 12th observations occurred near a local minimum in the seiche's oscillation allows for tighter uncertainty estimation.

While the SWOT data provides an unprecedented look at the instantaneous water levels in the Dickson fjord, it is only that; a snapshot. The observed cross-channel slopes conform to our expectation of a standing wave oscillating perpendicular to the major-axis of the fjord. However, there are other geophysical phenomena which can give rise to large cross-channel slopes in enclosed basins, namely tides16 and wind-driven circulation (Ekman transport)17. Consideration is given to each of these possible causes.

While tides are obviously not the source of the ~92-s seismic signal, due to the sparsity of the SWOT measurements, tidally driven cross-channel slopes could lead to false conclusions about the presence of a seiche in the SWOT data. As there is only one tide gauge in the region, insufficient in situ information exists to rule this out. Additionally, small fjords are poorly resolved by state-of-the-art global tide models due to interpolation and can thus not be relied upon18,19. We instead directly analyze the SWOT pixel cloud data obtained over the year following the two events using a spatially coherent Bayesian harmonic analysis procedure20. This procedure has been shown to improve tidal estimation over conventional least-squares approaches for sparse reference series and in complex coastal regions. A complete description of our implementation is given in Section “Tidal Estimation”.

Figure 4 shows empirical estimates of the amplitude and phase lag of the dominant lunar ocean tide, M2. Pixelcloud data is obtained and analyzed from October 20th, 2023 to November 1st, 2024. Due to the presence of winter sea ice and errors in the SWOT data, we identified only 23 usable passes. This limited data is insufficient to resolve additional tides, however, suffices for M2. As expected, both amplitude and phase exhibit small linear trends along the major-axis of the fjord and estimates are in good agreement with the CTD gauge (Fig. 4). Along the cross-channel direction, a slight rise in amplitude (5–10 cm) is seen in the center of the fjord but tapers off closer to the shores. This behavior may influence the curvature of the cross-channel profile, but will not induce the linear slope observed. The derived phase lags are uniformly distributed along the minor-axis of the fjord. Due to the fact that cross-channel variations in phase lag give rise to cross-channel slopes, we conclude that the observed slope in the SWOT data is not tidally driven.

A Estimated amplitudes, and B corresponding phase lags. Estimates are only made for points which have at least 23 measurements. Inset plots show how the amplitude and phase vary along the Rayleigh (blue, left to right) and Love (orange, bottom to top) nodes respectively. The M2 amplitude and phase lag computed from the depth measurements at the conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) station are shown by the square. Horizontal lines showing the average VB, Finite Element Solution 2022 (FES), and CTD estimates are shown.

As noted in ref. 4, an ~6 h modulation of the seismic signal can be observed. While this appears tidally correlated, the behavior is actually opposite of what is expected from a simple traveling wave. A proposed mechanism for this is given in Section “Tidal Modulation of the Seiche”.

Ekman transport occurs as a consequence of sustained wind-stress21. In the Northern hemisphere, the Coriolis effect causes water to propagate 90° clockwise to the incident wind direction. We evaluate the wind-speed and direction from the CTD atmospheric station shown in Fig. 1A. Results are shown in Fig. 5. Observations over the duration of the first VLP signal in September show that all SWOT measurements occur after sustained periods of southerly winds at ~5 knots. This wind-stress can induce a build-up of water in the westerly direction, but should not induce a cross-channel slope. The observations on October 12th follow yet another sustained period of Southerly wind, this time with a higher magnitude of ~10 knots. The SWOT observations occur as the wind is switching direction at low magnitudes (<5 knots). While sustained winds in the North-Western direction could give rise to cross-channel slopes, the low magnitude and short-duration of this change are unlikely to give rise to the large (2 m) cross-channel slope observed.

Our study provides direct observational evidence of the seiche in the Dickson fjord. Based on the seismic attribution, and systematic ruling out of other dynamic phenomena, we conclude that the observed variability in the SWOT data is consistent with that of a slowly decaying seiche. Thus, this study corroborates the numerical and analytical evidence given in ref. 4, 5, that the globally observed VLP signal which originated on September 16th, 2023, was due to a seiche which formed after a megatsunami. Additionally, we conclude that the smaller VLP signal observed on October 11th, was also a seiche originating from a smaller tsunami in the very same fjord. Notably, a short period seiche persisting for several days without an external driver has not previously been observed.

Using an empirical and completely independent approach, we estimate the maximum cross-channel slope (MXCS) of the September seiche to be 1.83 ± 0.59 m km−1. This value falls between the analytical estimate of ref. 4 at 1.3 m km−1 and the numerical/analytical estimates of ref. 5, which range from 2.56 to 3.13 m km−1. Due to the relatively large uncertainty, our empirical estimate–when considered in isolation–provides limited insight into the true initial value. However, our analysis of the October VLP signal produced an estimate of the October seiche's MXCS at 1.37 ± 0.13 m km−1. The smaller uncertainty in this case, owing to the October 12th observation occurring near a local minimum of the vertical displacement, gives greater confidence in this estimate.

Seismic data from the II.ALE and IU.SFJD stations show that the initial magnitude of the October VLP signal was approximately twice that of the September event (3 μm vs. 1.5 μm at II.ALE). Since the horizontal force is proportional to the average cross-channel slope (see Section “Simple Analytical Seiche”), we made a second estimate of the September MXCS to be 2.74 ± 0.26 m km−1. This value closely aligns with the numerical/analytical estimates of 2.56–3.13 m km−1 reported by ref. 5. Therefore, based on the relative magnitudes of the two forces at adjacent seismic stations, and the robust estimate of the October 12th event, we conclude that the numerical and analytical estimates by ref. 5 are in good agreement with the real data. Furthermore, we argue that the estimate provided in ref. 4 likely underestimates the true magnitude due to inaccuracies in the assumed fjord geometry, and the underestimation of the initial force at only 160 GN. If we consider a mean fjord width of 2.88 km as in ref. 5, our empirical estimate suggests the tsunami stabilizes into an initially 7.9 m tall seiche.

This study highlights the value of wide-swath satellite altimetry in characterizing extreme events and oceanic phenomena more generally. Due to their short-periods, seiches have long been difficult to study from conventional altimeters. The spatial resolution of SWOT provides opportunities in this area, as well as for studying other fast-moving oceanic processes such as storm surge, and even large waves. As shown, these data also provide the opportunity to connect and understand the complex interactions between climate change and the different components of the geosphere. However, this work also emphasizes the importance of specialized, interdisciplinary methods to address the intrinsic limitations of these data, particularly the challenges posed by temporal sparsity. The SWOT data at its present level of processing, is not trivial to work with. Dedicated efforts are needed to improve reprocessing of these data in fjords. Additionally, open-source tools that bridge the gap between raw data and analysis pipelines are essential for enabling non-expert users to utilize these data.

While sufficient observational and bathymetric data existed to recreate the observed seiche dynamics numerically, for many remote regions this is not the case3. Indeed, while the effects of climate change are felt globally, the largest and fastest changes are often in these regions22. As such, while we echo the claims from previous authors about the need for more in-situ sea-level gauge sensors, we believe a follow-on to the SWOT mission and investment in future wide-swath and ideally non-sun-synchronous altimetry missions is also critical to monitoring these effects. Above all, designing orbits to achieve higher temporal sampling at lower latitudes should be prioritized as it presently limits the study of extremes. Furthermore, we stress that a key tool for identifying these events is the accurate computation of sea-level anomalies (SLA) by applying different geophysical corrections. Due to the complex and narrow geometries of fjords, and a lack of historical altimetric measurements, tidal estimates in these regions are poor18. Additionally, we find that even when accurate SLA estimates can be obtained, the mean SLA of the fjord does not exhibit signs of seiching. This underscores the importance of accounting for small-scale spatial variances which SWOT and future wide-swath altimetry missions have the potential to address.

Pixelcloud data from the SWOT mission are obtained through open Earth Access (last accessed on February 3rd, 2025). We utilize the version 2.0, HR pixecloud data with shortname “SWOT_L2_HR_PIXC_2.0” in the earthaccess API. The SWOT high-rate pixel cloud data is also available at: https://doi.org/10.5067/SWOT-PIXC-2.0. We note that all data utilized in the present manuscript is included in the replication materials also. At the time of access, the level 2.0 data constitutes the highest processing level available. The Dickson fjord landslides in September and October of 2023 occurred shortly after the transition of SWOT to the Science phase. The SWOT Science phase is characterized by a 20.86 day repeat orbit with 10-day sub-cycles. The orbit is at an inclination of 77.6°, and is thus non-sun-synchronous, which reduces tidal aliasing. A consequence of the 10 day sub-cycles is that repeat measurements occur in groups leading to relatively short measurement gaps at some portions of the cycle, and complete gaps in the other. Data for the September and October events were obtained by filtering all available passes between September 16–26, and October 10–18th, respectively. We select all passes which fall into the bounding box given in Table S1. For the September period, this yields 5 initial passes occuring 0.5 days, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days after the event, respectively. Similarly, for the October period, 2 initial passes are identified at 0.5 days and 6 days post-tsunami. We process the SWOT data in two stages, first through manual inspection and then using a standard preprocessing procedure.

Prior to processing each pass we perform a manual inspection. Due to limitations in the L2 processing algorithms applied to SWOT data, entire passes can be contaminated to the point where the data becomes unusable. An example of this contamination can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 2. These errors are visually obvious and are manually flagged and removed through visual inspection. This yields a final set of observations for the September event 0.5 days, 2 days, and 5 days, and only a single observation for the October event taken 0.5 days post-tsunami.

All standard geophysical corrections are applied including wet and dry troposphere delays and cross-over corrections. Unlike the Cal/Val SWOT orbit, the cross-over correction for the Science phase is much more accurate due to the significant reduction in time between crossovers. Geoid corrections are applied based on the EGM2008 geoid model. Due to interpolation errors with the default FES2022 tidal corrections, a specialized approach is needed to handle tides. A comprehensive discussion on how tides are dealt with is given in Sections “Tidal Estimation” and “Tidal Validation”. After applying the geophysical corrections, we filter out all measurement values with sea-surface heights exceeding  ±4 m. This threshold was empircally determined following manual inspection of the dataset employed for tidal estimation. Due to retracking issues, spurious observations exist over the fjord which exceed this 4 m threshold and are thus filtered out to avoid biasing estimates. To obtain perceptually uniform sea-surface height maps which can be compared between passes, we set the center of each colormap to be the midpoint of the cross-channel slope. Due to small inaccuracies with the tidal corrections described in Sections “Tidal Estimation” and “Tidal Validation”, we found this procedure to be more robust.

Due to the presence of noise artifacts in some of the SWOT measurements, we rely on estimates of the cross-channel slope between the points X1 and X2 for our analysis. We note that the slice between these points is perpendicular to both the long-axis of the fjord, and the Love node shown in Fig. 2. As a consequence of the nonuniform sampling of the pixelcloud data, it is necessary to define a tolerance which defines how far a point can be from the defined cross-section to be included. We experimented with several tolerance values but converged on a value of 333 m on either side of the defined cross-section. An example of this is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, with ~8000 measurements shown. This choice provides a representative 666 m swath (≈5% of the fjord length) with which to estimate the variability/uncertainty of the cross-channel slope. A description of the Bayesian linear model employed for this procedure is given in Section “Bayesian Regression”.

Pixelcloud data is also used to estimate the M2 tide throughout the Dickson fjord. Due to the severe aliasing produced by the irregular temporal sampling, we make use of all available data. The presence of winter sea ice creates further difficulties as the inclusion of these data will severely degrade the accuracy of tidal estimation. As before, we locate all passes which intersect with the study region (Table S1) between October 20th 2023, and November 1st, 2024. This yields an initial dataset of 241 passes. After manual filtering and removal of passes containing sea-ice, this leaves only 23 high-quality passes which are employed for tidal estimation. We apply the same geophysical corrections as before. In order to obtain time-series which can be fed to our spatially coherent Bayesian harmonic analysis we bin the nonuniformly sampled pixel cloud data into a fixed grid with a 100 m × 100 m resolution. Experiments were conducted at variable resolutions and this was found to yield a good balance between high resolution, and reduced sensitivity to noise. Data points in each bin are averaged. The total number of data per bin is variable, thus, we restrict our analysis to bins which contain at least 23 measurements. This threshold is empirically defined based on the fact that the usage of fewer than 23 measurements in testing produced spurious tidal estimates in some regions.

Seismic data are accessed using the Federation of Digital Seismic Networks web service client for Obspy23. As both4 and5 provide a comprehensive analysis of the long-period seismic signal, we choose to focus on two representative stations: II.ALE24, and IU.SFJD25. In order to isolate the energy associated with the VLP, data are shown after being bandpassed between 10 and 12 mHz. All additional filtering parameters needed to replicate our results are provided in the “seismic_attribution.ipynb” notebook.

Seismic attribution is performed using data from the II.ALE seismic station. The station is situated 1322.9 km away from the landslide source at 82.5033°N 62.3500°W. The station sits directly adjacent to the Love node (160°) which runs perpendicular to the major-axis of the fjord (Fig. 1B). As a consequence, this station receives almost exclusively Rayleigh waves which is reflected by the dominant vertical component of the VLP signal shown in Fig. 1D. Referencing the SWOT observations to these waveforms requires the accurate identification of the phase velocity and source location of the VLP signal.

To compute the Rayleigh wave phase velocity, we utilize a heterogeneous Earth model as in ref. 5. To obtain the phase velocity of the 10.88 mHz signal we interpolate from the 10 mHz and 15 mHz LITHO1.0 velocity models14. Integrating over the path between the Dickson fjord and the II.ALE station we obtain a mean phase velocity of 4.0393 km s−1.

Due to uncertainties in the computed phase velocity, the source location of the VLP signal is not necessarily given by the center of the Dickson fjord. Indeed, both4 and ref. 5 identify source locations which are nearby, but away from the fjord itself. Using the same heterogeneous Earth model and a Fast Marching method for beamforming, a source location 92.4 km from the landslide location at 72.2°N 25.1°W is identified5. This source location is ~1409.5 km away from the II.ALE seismic station. Combined with the computed phase velocity, this yields a travel time of 348.97 s.

To test our hypothesis that the phase velocity and source location obtained using the heterogeneous Earth model are appropriate for seismic attribution we compare our approach to an independent forward modeling exercise carried out in ref. 5. Using their 3 m HySEA simulation of the seiche as a source time function, synthetic 3-component Green's functions are computed using the Syngine web service and convolved to approximate the displacement signals at the II.ALE station. In order to align the two signals, the authors identify an ~350 s shift empirically. This value is in agreement with the 348.97 s travel-time computed using the heterogeneous Earth model and beam forming. This agreement between two completely independent methods confirms the validity of the 348.97 s Rayleigh wave travel time to II.ALE for seismic attribution.

While our estimated Rayleigh wave travel time is in good agreement with the empirical estimate by ref. 5, this represents an important source of uncertainty in the estimation of the seiche amplitude. No comprehensive approach exists for the quantification of Rayleigh wave phase velocity or beamforming location uncertainties26. As such, we provide a lower-bound on our uncertainty estimate using the discrepancy between our estimate of 348.97 s and the empirical estimate of 350 s by ref. 5. If we assume a 92-s period of oscillation, this yields an approximate error of 2.12 %. Further uncertainties exist due to the fact that near the point source, the phase is governed by a Bessel function rather than a complex exponential as utilized. Whilst the uncertainty this introduces is difficult to estimate, it is important that this is acknowledged27. Additionally, testing of homogeneous Earth models yielded different estimates of both source location and velocities, yielding variable results. We found the agreement between these models and the empirically estimated wave travel time to generally be worse and thus did not consider them further.

Both cross-channel slope and tidal estimation are performed using a Bayesian linear model. Our selection of a Bayesian approach reflects our objective to accurately quantify the uncertainty in the estimated parameters and the SWOT data themselves. Unlike conventional least-squares estimation and other frequentist variants, which provide point estimates of the parameters, a Bayesian approach considers (and computes with) the probability distributions of the parameters. By representing our parameters of interest as probability distributions, the uncertainty associated with parameters in our model is explicitly represented, thus informing a calibrated measure of uncertainty over the target variables. As will be shown, the selection of appropriate priors can yield further advantages such as natural parameter shrinkage and increased robustness to noise. Shrinkage refers to reducing the magnitude of parameters which do not contribute to the solution. This favors simpler models unless the data justify additional complexity.

Consider the linear model given by \({y}_{i}={w}^{{\mathsf{T}}}{x}_{i}+{\epsilon }_{i}\). Here, yi is the ith SWOT sea-surface height measurement, w is a vector of the estimated weights (corresponding to the entries of the design matrix X), xi is the ith row of an M × N design matrix X, and ϵi is the residual. Here, M is the total number of measurements, and N is the number of input functions (described below). Linear models of this form are employed for both cross-channel slope and tidal estimation. As will be described, in our Bayesian formulation, the inferred elements of the weight vector w govern the shape of the various distributions used in the model. The parametric form for these distributions, and their justification, is given at length below alongside the variational inference procedure. The tidal estimation procedure is provided in Section “Tidal Estimation”.

To estimate the cross-channel slope we perform a standard Bayesian linear regression on the instantaneous sea-surface height cross-sections from each pass. The ith row of the design matrix X is simply given by xi = [1, xi], where the entry 1 corresponds to the bias (intercept), and xi the distance along the line \(\overline{{X}_{1}{X}_{2}}\). Here, the observation yi is the corresponding SWOT measurement with distance xi along \(\overline{{X}_{1}{X}_{2}}\).

Here we provide a brief overview of the Bayesian model utilized and the variational inference method. A complete derivation of variational inference can be found in ref. 28 and a more detailed exposition of the Bayesian linear model, used here, can be found in the appendix of ref. 29. The basis of our analysis is Bayes' theorem, which provides a framework for updating our prior beliefs p(θ) about the distribution of all parameters (and hyperparameters), based on a set of observations \(Y={[{y}_{0},{y}_{1},\ldots,{y}_{N}]}^{T}\) and the design matrix X. A hyper-parameter is itself a parameter, that governs the probability distribution of another parameter. For example, the mean and variance of a Gaussian are the hyperparameters which define the distribution over another variable. By extension, a hyper-hyperparameter describes a variable that controls the distribution over a hyper-parameter. This yields a posterior distribution which describes our final beliefs over θ and is given by

where θ is the set of parameters and hyperparameters of the model, p(θ) is the prior, p(Y∣X, θ) the (data) likelihood, and p(Y) the marginal likelihood which acts as a normalizing term in the inference (as it does not depend upon θ). Here we provide a brief overview of the different components of Bayesian analysis.

The likelihood p(Y∣X, θ) describes the likelihood that the observed data occurred, given our model. Here, the model is defined by both the design matrix, and our prior assumptions about the parameters θ. We take the likelihood term to be of Gaussian form, equivalent to a least-squares error assumption. In our analysis, we weight the squared residual between observed yi and model prediction, by a scalar hyper-parameter β, which represents the precision, or inverse (co)variance of the noise. Discussion and validation of this modeling decision in the context of SWOT based tidal analysis is provided in ref. 20. This has the effect of weighting how tightly our model should fit the data based on how noisy the data is. This assumption yields a Gaussian likelihood term of the form:

where we see the likelihood only depends upon w and β. The error functional Ey is given by

Central to Bayesian inference is the usage of priors. Priors are distributions over the parameters included in a model, and reflect our initial expectation of the functional forms and values the parameters should have. Here we describe the choice of these priors for both parameters and hyperparameters, and describe how they impact the resultant model. Under the mean-field approximation, we assume the prior over all parameters θ can be factorized as

where α = {αj} is a set of hyperparameters which governs the scale of the multi-variate Gaussian over the weights w. We now treat each term individually.

The model weights p(w∣α) come from a zero-mean Gaussian prior, with precisions (inverse variance) α. This choice serves two purposes. First, a Gaussian is the least informative distribution for a quantity which can be either positive or negative, and is thus unbiased in this way29. This is important as both cross-channel slopes and quadrature tidal amplitudes can be positive or negative. Second, weights will only be significantly non-zero if the data requires it. Conventionally, this is referred to as an Automatic Relevance Determination prior, as it induces shrinkage over the model weights, which do not significantly aid the model in fitting the data. Using this, for an individual weight wj, the prior has the form

The set of weight precisions α, which govern the scale of the weights w, are drawn from a Gamma distribution, which models the distribution over non-negative precisions. In addition to non-negativity, this choice is made for several reasons. First, a Gamma hyperprior is conjugate with the Gaussian prior over the weights which will be useful when performing inference. A conjugate prior for a given likelihood function is a prior that results in a posterior distribution that is of the same family as the prior. A Gamma prior also implicitly encourages smaller weight magnitudes, leading to natural shrinkage and promoting sparsity in the inferred weights. Uninformative hyper-hyperparameters a0 = 10−2 and b0 = 10−4 which set the shape and scale of the Gamma are selected to yield a vague prior over each αj defined as

A vague or uninformative prior simply means the assumed distribution is broad. This imposes minimal assumptions regarding the parameter values, whilst still providing natural parameter shrinkage30. This is favorable to a uniform prior which implicitly restricts parameter values and can lead to improper posteriors.

The scalar noise precision β (inverse variance) of the residual ϵ is also modeled as a hyperparameter within the model. Given the least-squares assumption of a Gaussian residual, we once again adopt a Gamma prior over β. The values of the shape and scale parameters are identical to those used in Equation (6), but are defined by the hyper-hyperparameters c0 = 10−2 and d0 = 10−4 such that

Models are initialized using a maximum-likelihood (ML) solution such that

The ML solution is then used to initialize the residual precision hyper-parameter, β, such that:

The ML solution provides an initial estimate that follows from the likelihood, ensuring that we start in an informative region of parameter space. This is useful for initializing the noise precision, β, and helps the variational updates from settling into poor local minima. While absolute guarantees depend on problem-specific properties, ML initialization is a well-established heuristic that improves the stability and efficiency of variational inference.

Fully Bayesian solutions are obtained by marginalizing over the posterior distributions of the parameters. The difficulty arises when computing the posterior distribution, which analytically is almost always intractable. Hence, sample based approaches such as Markov-Chain Monte Carlo are often employed. While these methods are good at approximating the true posterior, they scale poorly with the number of parameters included. Further, convergence is not easily assessed. Here, we adopt an approximate inference approach, called variational Bayes, referred to herein as VB. VB is a computationally tractable alternative to MCMC, bringing both scalability and a principled approach to assess whether convergence has been achieved. These attributes are particularly important for the tidal estimation procedure, as with over 300,000 individual locations, assessing convergence manually is intractable. The objective of our analysis is to infer the distributions over the individual elements of θ. The basic idea of VB is to adopt analytical approximations for each distribution, which can be optimized in an iterative and computationally tractable way. We first introduce an approximate posterior q(θ∣Y). The functional form of this posterior is chosen to be conjugate with the prior over θ such that q(θ∣Y) factorizes as

This choice follows from the mean-field approximation, which assumes our latent parameters to be mutually independent. This selection is deliberate, as it allows for analytical marginalization over the parameter posteriors, making inference computationally efficient. However, it also neglects correlations between parameters, potentially underestimating uncertainty in the presence of strong multicollinearity. Despite this, the approach has been extensively validated for both trend extraction and tidal estimation and is thus sufficient for these tasks20,29.

Our objective in VB is to minimize the difference between the approximate posterior q(θ∣Y), and the true posterior p(θ∣Y). This difference can be assessed by considering our observable, the data evidence p(Y). Using our approximate posterior, we can rewrite the log evidence p(Y) as the sum of two separable terms such that

This is the fundamental equation of VB and is composed of two terms. The first term is the negative variational free energy, referred to as the evidence lower bound. This provides a strict lower bound on the model evidence. The second term is the Kullback-Liebler divergence between the approximate and true posteriors over θ. This term provides natural model shrinkage as it increases with the number of free parameters θ. It can be seen that maximizing F(p, q) will result in the approximate posterior being as close as possible to the true posterior. Due to the fact that q(θ∣Y) can be factored as Eq. (10), F(p, q) can be maximized by iteratively optimizing each of q(θ∣Y), q(α∣Y), q(β∣Y) separately. Update equations for this procedure can be found in ref. 31. An implementation of this approach can be found in the replication notebooks “Fjord_Tides.ipynb” and “seismic_attribution.ipynb"".

To evaluate the quality of the Bayesian regression we utilize the Bayesian R2 proposed in ref. 15. This is necessary as the variance of the predicted values, can be greater than the variance of the data, thus rendering the conventional R2 definition nonsensical. The modified Bayes R2 is simply given by

where Var(residual) is the expected variance of the errors as given by the model.

Due to the extreme sparsity of available SWOT data (less than 25 measurements over a full year), extreme care is needed when performing tidal harmonic analysis20. Harmonic analysis assumes tides can be described by the superposition of waves at discrete tidal frequencies. These frequencies exist at harmonics of the motions between the Earth, Moon, and Sun and are described as constituents. In total, there are hundreds of possible constituents, however, for practical purposes we need only concern ourselves with a few. Given n constituents, the kth constituent with frequency ωk has a corresponding tidal wave of

Comparisons of tidal constituents are done in terms of the amplitude \({C}_{k}=\sqrt{{A}_{k}^{2}+{B}_{k}^{2}}\) and phase \({\phi }_{k}=\arctan {A}_{k}/{B}_{k}\). Modern tidal analysis is carried out in the time-domain using least-squares estimation, and can thus be applied to irregularly sampled time-series. To accomplish this we define the tidal estimation problem as a general linear model, such that the observed sea-level, yi, at any time is given by \({y}_{i}={w}^{{\mathsf{T}}}{x}_{i}+{\epsilon }_{i}\). Here, xi is the ith row of an M × N matrix of basis functions where M is the number of measurements and N = 2n + 1 with n equal to the number of constituents, w is a set of inferred weights, and ϵi is the non-tidal residual. From this, we define a design matrix X given by

where 1 corresponds to the bias, and the remaining values the quadrature amplitudes. The extreme sparsity of the Dickson fjord reference series is such that only the dominant lunar tide, M2, can be reliably estimated as shown in ref. 18. Even though we are only interested in M2, it is necessary to include additional constituents in the analysis to “soak” up the contributions of additional constituents18,20. After considerable experimentation, and validation against the in situ gauge measurements, it was found that the best M2 estimation was obtained by using the semi-diurnal M2, N2, S2, and diurnal K1, and O1 constituents in the analysis. Supplementary Table 2 provides the associated periods and origins of each constituent. Section “Tidal Validation”, discusses validation with the in-situ CTD observations and the FES2022 tidal model.

Conventional harmonic analysis only considers measurements from a single spatial location. Due to the spatial coherence of the oceanic response to tidal forcing32, this procedure leaves considerable information out. SWOT data provides a complete picture of the instantaneous sea-surface height throughout the Dickson fjord which can be exploited using an appropriate method. Here, we adopt the spatially coherent harmonic analysis procedure in ref. 20. Readers are referred to ref. 20 for a complete description of the procedure. However, the basic idea is to simultaneously estimate the quadrature amplitudes across a set of adjacent points by assuming that the amplitude at any point Pj,k is given by the amplitude w0,0 of the central point P0,0 with a small offset denoted wj,k. The linear model can be expanded to

where Yj,k is the observation at point Pj,k, X0,0 and Xj,k are the design matrices for points P0,0 and Pj,k respectively, and ρ represents the probability that the observations Yj,k are correlated with y0,0. The scalar ρ is obtained by taking the Fischer transform of the Pearson's correlation coefficient r between Y0,0 and Yj,k, such that \({z}^{{\prime} }=.5[\ln (1+r)-\ln (1-r)]\), and \(\rho=1-\Phi ({z}^{{\prime} })\) with \(\Phi={{{\mathcal{N}}}}(0,1)\). By including the probability that the observations are correlated, ρ, we impose an assumption that points with more similar time-series will have similar tides. Furthermore, in the limit where Yj,k = Y0,0, the quadrature amplitude Yj,k = X0,0w0,0. We can further restrict the functional form of the relationship between adjacent locations to boost the ratio of data to parameters. As validated in ref. 20, we approximate the relationship between quadrature amplitudes in adjacent locations to be linear, such that

where dx and dy are the normalized distances between points along the horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, taken to be (−1, 0, 1) for convenience when using gridded SWOT data. This approach effectively doubles the ratio of data to parameters and was found to improve uncertainty estimation20. By virtue of using gridded data with a resolution of 100 m, the assumption of linearity between neighboring quadrature amplitudes is more than sufficient.

While the spatially coherent harmonic analysis can be used in tandem with any estimator, here we make use of the variational Bayesian (VB) estimator described above in Section “Bayesian Regression”. This choice is based on the following reasons. First,20 find the VB approach to be less sensitive to both stationary (Gaussian) and non-stationary noise artifacts. Second, VB provides natural parameter shrinkage, which is helpful for reducing so-called cross-talk between constituents left out of the analysis. Lastly, the implicit uncertainty information is helpful in assessing the quality of the tidal estimates. The analysis shown in Fig. 4 only includes locations which have at least 23 observations. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows the distribution of SWOT measurements, which can be used for tidal estimation through the fjord. A complete implementation of this approach, and code to replicate all tidal estimation is given in “Fjord_Tides.ipynb”.

Tidal validation is carried out for both the SWOT derived tidal estimates, and the standard tidal estimates from FES202233 using the in-situ CTD gauge as a ground truth34. For each constituent k, models (VB or FES) are assessed using the root-mean-squared error, defined as

where the overbar indicates the average over a complete cycle (e.g., 0 → 2π). This metric reflects the combined error in predicted sea-level height introduced by both amplitude and phase errors. We also introduce a secondary metric, the relative RMS error, which weights the RMS error relative to the magnitude of the CTD gauge constituent RRMSk = RMSk/Ak,CTD. Comparisons between RMS and relative RMS error are provided in Supplementary Fig. 6. For the SWOT estimates, the median amplitude and phase for the entire fjord are used. As noted above, we only include the constituents M2, N2, S2, K1, and O1 in the analysis due to the limited SWOT data. For these constituents, it can be seen that M2 yields significant improvements over FES2022 of 52%. The SWOT derived N2, S2, K1, and O1 in contrast are relatively inaccurate, due to the smaller amplitudes and longer alias periods. Similar results have been found for early SWOT data by ref. 18. In their work additional constituents were also included to yield superior M2 accuracy. When correcting the SWOT data, we utilize just the M2 from SWOT, alongside S2, N2, O1, and K1 from FES2022. As can be seen in the relative RMS panel, many of the additional FES2022 constituents exceed 20% relative RMS error within the Dickson fjord. In order to avoid introducing potential biases from incorrect tidal corrections, we do not include constituents above this 20% threshold. To combat any residual tidal variability we instead define the center of the colormap to be the midpoint of the cross-channel slope.

It is important to note that there are large seasonal changes in tides within arctic regions35. Due to the limited SWOT data available, and the relatively short CTD gauge deployment (≈2 months), the extent of this variability is difficult to estimate. However, since the CTD gauge was deployed during both events, validation with this gauge is appropriate as we wish to have accurate tidal estimates during this period. As more SWOT data becomes available, the accuracy of tidal estimates will improve. It is unlikely that these improved estimates will change the conclusions made by this study, as we are primarily interested in the cross-channel slope, and find no evidence of this being tidally driven based on inspection of the M2 tide. However, improved tidal estimation could prove useful for understanding how the tide itself modulates the period of the seiche, and thus impacts its dynamics and dissipation.

In order to estimate the total seiche amplitude, and to relate the September and October events using the observed seismic observations, we consider a theoretical seiche acting on a simplified fjord geometry. We adopt the notation and fjord geometry employed in ref. 5 for consistency. Here, we assume the seiche to act as an oscillating horizontal force directed N160°E (perpendicular to the Dickson fjord). Due to discrepancies between the defined geometries given in ref. 4, 5 we avoid prescribing values for the precise fjord dimensions except where necessary. The sloshing of the seiche produces a shift of the center of mass of the body of water x, and can be written as

Here Δx is the amplitude of the horizontal oscillation and ω ≈ 2π/92 Hz is the frequency of oscillation. As described in ref. 5, the amplitude of the Rayleigh waves produced is proportional to the magnitude of the horizontal force. Hence, we write Δx in terms of the total force F. Taking the second derivative of the position of the center of mass we find

It can be seen that the maximum force occurs at the maximum displacement Δx of the center of mass. Using SWOT data we can only observe the cross channel slope. As such, it is useful to relate the force back to the surface displacement Δz such that

Equation (19) can be rewritten in terms of the vertical displacement Δz as

We recognize that the surface displacement Δz = SL where S is the cross-channel slope. Thus, the force F can be written in terms of the cross-channel slope with

Thus, we have shown that the force is directly proportional to the cross-channel slope. This allows for the direct comparison between events.

In-situ measurements are provided by the CTD station located in the inner portion of the Dickson fjord (as shown in Fig. 1A and can be accessed at ref. 34). The station provides both standard meteorological and oceanic variables. The CTD gauge is mounted on the fjord wall, inside a HDPE tube to protect it from ice in winter. Here, we only make use of the wind speed and direction, density, and water depth measurements. Data are sampled at 15-min intervals, which creates severe aliasing issues for observing the 92 s VLP signal. Due to the location of the device in the inner fjord, the seiche signal magnitude decreases beneath pre-event noise levels after only a few hours and is thus unobservable in the data (See Supplementary Fig. 5).

Here we present a brief overview of the Dickson fjord. A more comprehensive description of the physiography and climate of the fjord system can be found in ref. 5. The Dickson fjord sits at the terminus of the Hissinger Glacier in the northernmost area of the Kong Oscar fjord system situated in East Greenland (See Supplementary Fig. 1). The fjord itself sits deep in the Arctic Circle, and is thus characterized by sea-ice over much of the year. Sea ice dissipates in July and then forms again in October. The fjord fills a U-shaped valley basin, with multiple smaller glaciers situated on each side. The fjord itself is 38 km long and between 2.5 and 3.2 km wide. The depth ranges from 150–200 m to 700 m from West to East with an approximate depth of 540 m in the center of the fjord across from the landslide location. Bathymetry estimates are taken from a 2018 survey by the National Danish Hydrographic Office at a resolution of 15 m. We note that no data exists between 150 and 300 m of the coast due to the limitations of the survey vessel. This missing data creates large uncertainties in these regions, which can significantly influence numerical simulations.

Both tsunamis originated from landslides occurring in the same gully situated beneath an unnamed glacier5. These landslides were caused by debuttressing of the glacier following glacial thinning over the past decade. Direct observation of landslide scarring and dirtying of the glacier using satellite imagery by both4,5 confirms this theory. Additionally,5 evaluate the landslide dynamics of the September 16th landslide via seismic inversion. While the October 11th event did not produce a new landslide scar, a Sentinel-2 image showed significantly more erosion than was present after the September 16th event.

Empirical evidence of the two tsunamis is given by a combination of nearby in-situ sensors, and observed run-up height. Using satellite imagery, both4,5 observe an initially 200 m run-up height near the location of the slide, with an average of 60 m run-ups being observed through the remainder of the fjord for the September 16th event. Tsunami run-up for the October 11th even was only observed 200 m west of the gully ~75% of the magnitude of the September event in this location (60 m vs 80 m). Almost 72 km at the Ella \(\varnothing\) research station, the initial run-up height was in excess of 4 km creating significant local damage. The location of Ella \(\varnothing\) relative to the Dickson fjord is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. To our knowledge, no information exists regarding the run-up at Ella \(\varnothing\) for the October 11th event due to arctic winter darkness.

While the following results do not impact the conclusions made in this manuscript regarding the initial size of the seiche, they point to an interesting mechanism of seiche dissipation. The authors of ref. 4 observed an ~6 h modulation of the seiche frequency ranging from 10.874 to 10.879 mHz which they attribute to tidal influences (their Supplementary Fig. S1C). They suggest a possible mechanism is the change of depth modulating the speed of the wave c through the relationship \(c=\sqrt{gH}\) where g is the gravitational acceleration and H is the depth. However, a simple inspection of both the September and October VLP signals shows that the seiche actually behaves in the opposite manner (e.g., longer periods at higher tides). We here suggest an alternative mechanism; stratification. In semi-enclosed basins (defined as having an open-boundary for waves to radiate into the sea), the seiche wave speed is modulated by stratification through \(\sqrt{gH\Delta \rho /\rho }\) where ρ is the average density, and Δρ = ρ2 − ρ1 is the density difference from top (ρ1) to bottom (ρ2)36. Inspection of the correlation between surface-water elevation and density ρ shows a strong positive correlation (Supplementary Fig. 7). Based on this observation we proposed the following explanation. At low tide, the water column is strongly stratified with fresh (less dense) glacial runoff sitting on top, and denser salty water sitting beneath Δρ > 1. As the tide comes in, the water column mixes, leading to the observed higher density ρ at the surface and thus less stratification Δρ < 1. Due to the fact that the fjord is quite deep  ≈500 m, the impact of Δρ ≫ ΔH as observed. Due to the fact that the CTD gauge only provides observations at the surface, it is impossible to conclude definitively that the density fluctuations observed are indicative of the stratification between ρ1 and ρ2. Hence, further simulated study is needed to validate this hypothesis.

Metrics details

The detection of low-mass exoplanets (≤10 Earth masses (M⊕)) yields fundamental inputs for current theories of planet formation and evolution, and supplies critical information for the planned direct-imaging missions that aim to detect and characterize Earth-like planets in the habitable zones around solar-like stars. However, the most efficient detection techniques available for low-mass exoplanets (that is, photometric transit and radial velocity methods) are heavily biased towards the detection of short-period planets (for example, ≤100 days) and strongly favour late-type stars. Here we report the discovery of Kepler-725 c, a 10 ± 3 M⊕ exoplanet within the habitable zone of the late G-type dwarf Kepler-725. Through analysis of the transit timing variations of the relatively short-period (39.64 days) warm Jupiter Kepler-725 b, we find that Kepler-725 c has a period of 207.5 days and travels in an eccentric orbit (with an eccentricity of 0.44 ± 0.02 and an orbital semi-major axis of 0.674 ± 0.002 au), receiving a time-averaged insolation of 1.4 times the Earth's value. This discovery demonstrates that the transit timing variation method enables the detection and accurate mass measurement of a super-Earth/mini-Neptune within a solar-like star's habitable zone. Similar searches for such exoplanets could be conducted in other exoplanetary systems in the era of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and upcoming PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars and Earth 2.0 missions.

The contour in each panel encloses 68.3% credible region. The green dashed lines enclose the 68.3% credible intervals.

Seven optimum solutions for the three-planet framework that can well reproduce the observed TTV signals of Kepler-725 b are identified.

The contours in each panel enclose 68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7% credible regions, respectively. While the green dashed lines enclose the 68.3% credible intervals.

Only known low-mass planets (gray filled circle + cross) that have mass measured with precision better than 33% and radius measured with precision better than 33% are shown (source: TEPCat). The different lines represent the theoretical models of various compositions for exoplanets. All error bars represent 1-standard deviation.

The concentration of neurotransmitters inside synaptic vesicles (SVs) underlies the quantal nature of synaptic transmission. Uptake of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter, is driven by membrane potential. To prevent nonquantal efflux of glutamate after SV exocytosis, the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are allosterically inhibited by the neutral pH of the synaptic cleft. To elucidate the mechanism, we determined high-resolution structures of rat VGLUT2 with a cyclic analog of glutamate. We propose a mechanism of substrate recognition in which a positively charged cytoplasmic vestibule electrostatically attracts the negatively charged substrate. We also identify modification of VGLUT2 by palmitoylation and find that this promotes retrieval of the transporter after exocytosis. The structure also reveals an extensive network of electrostatic interactions that forms the cytoplasmic gate. Functional analysis of a mutant that disrupts the network shows how this cytoplasmic gate confers the allosteric requirement for lumenal H+ required to restrict VGLUT activity to SVs.

Sequence alignment of selected VGLUT homologs (line 1-5), other human SLC17 family members (line 6-11) and DgoT from E. coli demonstrates conservation across evolution and the SLC17 family of organic anion transporters. The sequences are listed in order of their sequence identity to rat VGLUT2, as in Fig. 4a. Residues are colored based on their sequence conservation, with red the most conserved and no color the least. This figure was generated with ALINE58.

Untransfected (UN) HEK293T cells and HEK293T cells transfected with internalization-defective wild-type (WT) VGLUT2, R88K VGLUT2 and empty vector (EV) were loaded with 3H-aspartate (a) or 3H-glutamate (b) and the efflux monitored at pH 7.4 and 5.5. Neither WT nor R88K VGLUT2 mediate the flux of aspartate. c, Effect of mutations on the surface expression of VGLUT2. HEK cells were transfected with WT, mutant VGLUT2 or empty vector (EV), biotinylated and the total protein (input) or the biotinylated fraction (isolated with streptavidin) immunoblotted for VGLUT2. The quantitation of fluorescent western analysis from 3 biological replicates is shown below as % WT. The data indicate mean ± SEM. **, p<0.01; ****, p<0.0001; ns, not significant by one-way ANOVA.

a, b, Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and SDS-PAGE of WT (a) and R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2 (b) in complex with an Fab show high purity and homogeneity. Green indicates Fab alone, red VGLUT2 with Fab. c, Glutamate uptake by purified VGLUT2 reconstituted into liposomes with TF0F1 ATP synthase. The R184Q/E191Q mutant shows significantly less glutamate uptake than WT. The activity was measured as ATP-driven 3H-glutamate uptake for 15 min at 29 °C. The ionophores nigericin and valinomycin (100 nM each) were used to dissipate ΔpH and ΔΨ, respectively. d, The assay for efflux from transfected HEK cells shows that the R184Q/E191Q double mutant confers robust glutamate flux. Error bars indicate SEM. n=3 biological replicates.

a, Details of the data processing strategy are described in the Methods section. Briefly, 3 rounds of 3D classifications were carried out in RELION to select high quality particles in the same conformation. The resulting particle stack was then refined and polished in RELION. To obtain the final map, polished particles were refined using RELION 3D auto-refine with a manually generated mask including only the VGLUT2 and Fab or using the nonuniformal refinement strategy in cryoSPARC with an automatically generated mask. Both maps resulted in similar resolution and quality. Final maps were then sharpened using Phenix Auto-sharpening and used for refinement and model building. Statistics of the final map were calculated using Phenix_comprehensive_validation tool51 and reported in Table 1. b, Sharpened coulombic density map of R184Q/E191Q was of sufficient quality to resolve the side chains of most residues. The coulombic potential density map is shown in gray mesh and model colored as in Fig. 2.

a and b, Docking of ACPD and glutamate. ACPD pose from the solved R184Q/E191Q-ACPD complex is shown in transparent green, interacting sidechains in blue (N domain) or pink (C domain) for R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2 (a), and green (N domain) or orange (C domain) for wild-type VGLUT2 (b). Best ACPD poses from flexible and rigid mode docking into R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2 are overlaid in opaque green and dark green, respectively. These poses are virtually identical, with all three functional groups in the same location as the solved pose (transparent). b, Best glutamate pose from flexible mode docking into WT VGLUT2, shown in opaque gray. The location within the binding pocket is similar to the solved pose of ACPD (transparent green); there is an average distance of 1.5 Å between the corresponding carboxyl groups of glutamate and ACPD near R88 and 2 Å between the corresponding carboxyl groups of glutamate and ACPD near R322. c, Position of aspartate at the beginning of an 800 ns simulation, determined by first placing functional groups in positions similar to the solved ACPD then choosing favorable rotamers. d-g, Tracking substrate recognition by MD simulation. d, Distance between the amine group of the ligand and the ring of F326 (dotted trace) or the sidechain oxygen atom of N450 (solid trace) is shown for the 800 ns R184Q/E191Q VGLUT2-ACPD simulation (green), the 1000 ns WT VGLUT2-glutamate simulation (gray), and the 800 ns WT VGLUT2-aspartate simulation (cyan). Gray bars indicate the time at which the snapshots on the left (e-g) were taken. ACPD adopts two stable poses during the simulation, with the amine pointed either towards the F326 ring (e, top) or away from it and towards N450, which also removed one interaction between the carboxyl and R88 (e, bottom). f, Glutamate adopts a single stable pose during the simulation. g, Aspartate is unable to interact with both arginines simultaneously and does not adopt a single stable pose. h, Root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of each ligand during its simulation. Numbers indicate Å.

Metrics details

Caloric restriction and methionine restriction-driven enhanced lifespan and healthspan induces ‘browning' of white adipose tissue, a metabolic response that increases heat production to defend core body temperature. However, how specific dietary amino acids control adipose thermogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified that weight loss induced by caloric restriction in humans reduces thiol-containing sulfur amino acid cysteine in white adipose tissue. Systemic cysteine depletion in mice causes lethal weight loss with increased fat utilization and browning of adipocytes that is rescued upon restoration of cysteine in diet. Mechanistically, cysteine-restriction-induced adipose browning and weight loss requires sympathetic nervous system-derived noradrenaline signalling via β3-adrenergic-receptors that is independent of FGF21 and UCP1. In obese mice, cysteine deprivation induced rapid adipose browning, increased energy expenditure leading to 30% weight loss and reversed metabolic inflammation. These findings establish that cysteine is essential for organismal metabolism as removal of cysteine in the host triggers adipose browning and rapid weight loss.

The Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE-II) clinical trial in healthy adults demonstrated that a simple 14% reduction of calories for 2 years without specific dietary prescription to alter macronutrient intake or meal timings can reprogramme the immunometabolic axis to promote healthspan1,2,3. Thus, harnessing the pathways engaged by caloric restriction (CR) in humans may expand the current armament of therapeutics against metabolic and immune dysfunction. Induction of negative energy balance and resultant activation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by CR is thought to underlie some of its beneficial effects on healthspan1. However, it has also been suggested that CR-induced metabolic effects may be due to decreased protein intake in food-restricted animal models4,5. Adding back individual amino acids to calorie-restricted Drosophila abolished the longevity effects, and traced to the limitation of methionine, an important node for lifespan extension5. Indeed, methionine restriction (MR) in rodents increases lifespan6 with enhanced insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue thermogenesis and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation7. Surprisingly, in long-lived Drosophila fed an MR diet, adding back methionine did not rescue the pro-longevity effect of diet, and it was hypothesized that activation of the methionine cycle may impact longevity5. Commercial MR diets contain 0.17% methionine compared with normal levels of 0.86%, but notably, the MR diets also lack cystine8,9, another sulfur-containing amino acid (SAA), which is required for protein synthesis, including synthesis of glutathione, taurine, CoA and iron–sulfur clusters10,11. Of note, in rats, MR-induced anti-adiposity and pro-metabolic effects, including reduction of leptin, insulin, IGF1 and elevation of adiponectin, were reversed when animals were supplemented with cysteine in the diet12. Furthermore, cysteine supplementation in MR rats did not restore low methionine, suggesting no increase in the methionine cycle12, where homocysteine is converted into methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT)10. The existence of the trans-sulfuration pathway (TSP) in mammals indicates that in case of dietary cysteine scarcity, the host shuttles homocysteine from the methionine cycle via the production of cystathionine, which is then hydrolysed into cysteine by the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH)10,13. Cysteine is an ancient molecule that evolved to allow early life to transition from anoxic hydrothermal vents into oxidizing cooler environment14,15. Thus, cysteine, the only thiol-containing proteinogenic amino acid, is essential for disulfide bond formation and redox signalling, including nucleophilic catalysis10,13. It remains unclear whether cysteine specifically controls organismal metabolism and whether sustained CR in healthy humans can help understand the fundamental relationship between energy balance and SAA homeostasis pathways that converge to improve healthspan and lifespan.

Adipose tissue regulates organismal metabolism by orchestrating inter-organ communication required for healthy longevity. To study the mechanisms that drive CR's beneficial effects on human metabolism, we conducted an unbiased metabolomics analysis of the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SFAT) of participants in the CALERIE-II trial at baseline and 1 year after 15% achieved CR and weight loss1,2,3. The partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLSDA) of abdominal SFAT biopsies revealed that 1 year of mild sustained CR substantially altered the adipose tissue metabolome (Fig. 1a). The unbiased metabolite sets enrichment analyses demonstrated significant increases in cysteine, methionine and taurine metabolism, which indicates rewiring of cysteine metabolism (Fig. 1b,c). Further analyses of our previously reported RNA sequencing data of humans that underwent CR1,2. revealed that compared to baseline, 1 and 2 years of CR in humans increased the adipose expression of CTH (Fig. 1d) with a concomitant reduction in the expression of BHMT (Fig. 1e). These data suggest that rewiring of cysteine metabolism may involve reduction in methionine cycle and changes in trans-sulfuration pathway metabolites (Fig. 1c). Notably, previous studies have found that long-lived rodents upregulate metabolites in TSP that generates cysteine from methionine16,17. Consistent with our findings in humans that underwent CR, data from multiple lifespan-extending interventions in rodents identified upregulation of CTH as a common signature or potential biomarker of longevity18.

Source data

Metabolomic analyses revealed that despite an increase in CTH expression post-CR, adipose cysteine levels were significantly reduced upon CR (Fig. 1f) with no change in homocysteine and cystathionine (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Consistent with the reduced expression of BHMT in methionine cycle, there was a decline in concentration of dimethylglycine (DMG) (Fig. 1f). CR caused a reduction in cysteine derived metabolites, γ-glutamyl–cysteine (γ-Glu–Cys), glutathione (GSH) and cysteinyl glycine (Cys–Gly) (Fig. 1g). Collectively, these results suggests that food restriction that resulted in 15% CR in humans reduces enzymes and metabolites that feed into methionine cycle and lowers cysteine (Fig. 1c).

Cysteine is thought to be biochemically irreplaceable because methionine, the other sole proteinogenic SAA, lacks a thiol group and hence cannot form complexes with metals to control redox chemistry19. To determine whether cysteine is required for survival and organismal metabolism, we created a loss of function model where cysteine becomes an essential amino acid requiring acquisition from the diet by deletion of CTH (Cth−/− mice) (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Cysteine deficiency was thus induced by feeding adult Cth−/− mice a custom amino acid diet that only lacks cystine (cystine-free (CysF) diet), whereas control mice were fed an isocaloric diet that contained cystine (CTRL diet) (Fig. 1h). Utilizing this model, we found that mice with cysteine deficiency rapidly lost ~25–30% body weight within 1 week compared to littermate Cth+/+ mice fed a CysF diet or Cth−/− fed a control diet (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Upon clinical examination of the cysteine-deficient mice, 30% weight loss is considered a moribund state that required euthanasia. The weight loss in mice lacking CTH and cystine in the diet was associated with significant fat mass loss relative to lean mass (Extended Data Fig. 1d) in cysteine-deficient animals. Pair feeding of cystine depleted diet fed animals produced similar weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 1e). This rapid weight loss was not due to malaise or behavioural alteration, as Cth−/−CysF mice displayed normal activity and a slight reduction in food intake in the first 2 days after CysF diet switch that was not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 1f and link of video file of cage activity). The Cth-deficient mice on the control diet were indistinguishable from control littermates in parameters indicative of health, they displayed higher nest building and no change in grip strength, gait, ledge test, hindlimb clasping and displayed no clinical kyphosis (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). Furthermore, compared with Cth−/− mice on control diet, the analyses of liver, heart, lungs and kidneys of Cth−/−CysF mice did not reveal pathological lesions indicative of tissue dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Notably, restoration of up to 75% cystine levels in the diet of Cth−/− CysF mice that were undergoing weight loss was sufficient to completely rescue the body weight over three weight-loss cysteine-depletion cycles, demonstrating the specificity and essentiality of cysteine for the organism (Fig. 1j).

To identify changes in metabolites upon cysteine-deprivation-induced fat mass loss, we conducted serum and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SFAT) metabolomics analyses (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Compared with Cth-deficient mice fed a normal diet, the Cth−/−CysF mice had reduced cystine levels, suggesting that cysteine deficiency is maintained by a reduction in systemic cystine levels (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Cysteine depletion also elevated the cystathionine and l-serine levels, compared to control diet fed animals (Fig. 1k). Other SAA metabolites such as methionine, homocysteine (HCys) and glutamic acid were not significantly changed (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Taurine levels in the Cth-deficient mice on a cystine-free diet also did not change compared with control animals. Notably, the γ-glutamyl peptide analogues of cysteine and GSH such as 2-aminobutyric acid (2AB) and ophthalmic acid (OA or γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyryl-glycine) were increased in the serum of cysteine-deficient mice (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Notably, in subcutaneous and brown adipose (BAT) depots and in liver, cysteine deficiency induces total glutathione (GSH) and oxidized GSH (GSSG) depletion (Fig. 1m,n and Extended Data Fig. 2b,d).The increase in γ-glutamyl peptides (2AB and OA) in cysteine-limiting conditions in vivo is consistent with studies that show that GCLC can synthesize γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyryl-glycine in a GSH-independent manner and prevents ferroptosis by lowering glutamate generated oxidative stress20. OA is a GSH analogue in which the cysteine group is replaced by l-2-aminobutyrate (2AB). On a normal cysteine-replete diet, 2AB is produced from 2-oxobutyrate (2OB) and glutamate in the presence of aminotransferases21. Thus, the increase in 2AB despite the removal of cystine in diet could be due to an alternative pathway of deamination of threonine into 2AB22. Indeed, l-threonine levels are increased upon cysteine depletion in mice (Fig. 1n). Previous studies found that GSH can inhibit glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC)23,24 regulating its production by a feedback mechanism. Thus, the removal of cysteine and reduction of GSH may release this disinhibition (Fig. 1m). Consistent with this hypothesis and elevated OA levels, Gclc and Gss expression were increased in cysteine-starved mice (Fig. 1o). The increased OA production versus GSH production reveals adaptive changes induced by systemic cysteine deficiency. Cysteine is required for protein synthesis. However, in mice where cysteine is depleted for 5 days, protein synthesis was not impaired in subcutaneous, visceral, brown adipose depots and in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Cysteine is also required for Fe–S clusters21,25. The RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of genes involved in Fe–S cluster assembly, including Bola3, was unimpaired or increased during cysteine depletion25 (Fig. 1p and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Consistent with the association between increased Bola3 and adipose browning in a cysteine-deficient state, adipose-specific deletion of Bola3 decreases energy expenditure (EE) and increases adiposity in mice upon aging26. Upon short-term cysteine starvation, Fe–S clusters are preserved in adipose depots. Additionally, cysteine is crucial for coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis. We observed a significant reduction in CoA levels in BAT and liver upon cysteine starvation (Fig. 1q). The in vivo spin trapping and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed that cysteine deficiency significantly increased lipid-derived radicals in BAT with undetectable signals in white adipose tissue (WAT) (Fig. 1r and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Also, given aconitase is regulated by reversible oxidation of (4Fe–4S)2+ and cysteine residues, depletion of cysteine also reduced aconitase activity in SFAT with no change in BAT (Fig. 1s). Together, these data demonstrate that removing cysteine causes lethal weight loss and induces adaptive changes in organismal metabolism, including upregulation of Gclc, elevated γ-glutamyl peptides with depletion of CoA and GSH (Fig. 1l,m,q and Extended Data Fig. 2d).

The decrease in fat mass during cysteine deficiency is driven by loss of all major fat depots including subcutaneous fat (SFAT), visceral epididymal/ovarian adipose fat (VFAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Histological analyses revealed that this reduction in adipose tissue size is associated with transformation of white adipose depots into a BAT-like appearance, with the formation of multilocular adipocytes, enlarged nuclei, and high UCP1 expression, a phenomenon known as ‘browning' that increases thermogenesis27,28 (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Of note, the SFAT browning in cysteine-deficient mice was reduced upon cystine-restoration in diet (Fig. 2b). Similar response was observed in visceral fat (VFAT) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Consistent with the browning of SFAT, the cysteine-deficient animals showed significantly increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (Fig. 2c) and thermogenic marker genes (Fig. 2d). The UCP1 and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) induction upon cysteine deficiency in adipose tissue was reversed by cysteine repletion (Fig. 2c). Consistent with 30% weight loss at day 5, the glycerol concentrations were depleted in the sera of cysteine-deficient mice and were restored by cysteine-repletion-induced weight regain (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The differentiation of Cth-deficient preadipocytes to mature adipocytes and subsequent exposure to cysteine-free culture conditions did not affect their thermogenic genes or UCP1, suggesting that a non-cell autonomous mechanism may control adipocyte browning (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

We next investigated whether changes in energy absorption, energy intake or EE contribute to cysteine-depletion-induced weight loss. Analysis of energy absorption by faecal bomb calorimetry revealed no significant difference in control and cysteine-deficient mice (Fig. 2e). Moreover, although the cumulative food intake over 5 days of weight loss was not statistically different (Fig. 2f), the cumulative food intake in the first 2 days (Extended Data Fig. 3e) after switching to CysF diet was lower (P < 0.05), which may contribute to early weight loss. Calculation of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or representation of the data as regression between EE and body mass, demonstrated that EE was increased in cysteine-deprived animals during the dark cycle (Fig. 2g) and not in the light cycle (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g). In addition, there was no difference in locomotor activity between control or cysteine-deficient mice (Extended Data Fig. 3h), suggesting that cysteine depletion increases EE. Of note, the increase in EE was supported by increased fat utilization, as the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in cysteine-deprived animals was significantly reduced (Extended Data Fig. 3i,j).

We next determined the specificity of cysteine on mechanisms that may contribute to rapid weight loss. Weight regain after cysteine repletion substantially reversed adipose browning (Fig. 2b,h and Extended Data Fig. 3b) and normalized the glycerol, ATGL and UCP1 levels in adipose tissue. (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c). Furthermore, replacement of single amino acid cysteine, also reversed the cysteine-starvation-driven reduction in RER, suggesting restoration of organismal metabolism to normal carbohydrate utilization instead of fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 2i). Of note, cysteine repletion significantly increased food intake for the first two days, suggesting that animals can sense cystine in diet and compensate via hyperphagia to restore bodyweight setpoint (Fig. 2j). The EE upon cysteine replacement was not significantly different during weight rebound (Fig. 2k). These data suggest that cysteine replacement can reverse weight loss by mechanisms that involve reduced adipose browning and decreased fat utilization while change in EE alone does not account for rapid weight restoration.

We conducted the RNA sequencing of the major adipose depots to investigate the mechanisms that control adipose tissue browning and associated remodelling. As displayed by the heatmap, cysteine deficiency profoundly altered the transcriptome of adipose tissue (Extended Data Fig. 3k). Gene set enrichment analysis comparing Cth−/− CTRL and Cth−/− CysF identified that the top downregulated pathways were involved in the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, highlighting the broad remodelling of the adipose tissue (Extended Data Fig. 3l). In addition, multiple metabolic pathways seemed to be regulated by cysteine deficiency within the SFAT with ‘respiratory electron transport chain and heat production' as the top pathway induced during cysteine deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3l). Indeed, numerous genes identified by the ‘thermogenesis' Gene Ontology term pathway such as Ucp1, Cidea, Cox7a1, Cox8b, Dio2, Eva1, Pgc1, Elovl3 and Slc27a2, were differentially expressed comparing Cth+/+ CysF and Cth−/− CysF in the SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 3m). These results demonstrate that cysteine depletion activates the thermogenic transcriptional programme.

To investigate the cellular basis of adipose tissue remodelling during cysteine deficiency, we isolated the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) by enzymatic digestion and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of SFAT. We isolated SVF cells from Cth+/+ and Cth−/− fed CTRL or CysF diet with each sample pooled from four animals (Extended Data Fig. 4a). A total of 4,666 cells in Cth+/+ CTRL; 5,658 cells in Cth+/+ CysF; 4,756 cells in Cth−/− CTRL; and 3,786 cells in Cth−/− CysF were analysed for scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Consistent with previous results29,30, the unbiased clustering revealed 15 distinct cell populations including αβ T cells, γδ T cells, ILC2s and natural killer (NK) T cells, B cells, reticulocytes, mesothelial-like cells, Schwann cells and several myeloid clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4b–d). Comparison of Cth−/− CysF with other groups revealed dramatic changes in cellular composition (Fig. 2l). Particularly, loss of clusters 0, 1 and 2 were apparent upon cysteine deficiency (Fig. 2l). Of note, these clusters contained the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes induced by β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316243 (ref. 31) (Extended Data Fig. 4e), highlighting the potential role of sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-derived noradrenaline (NA) in regulating the effects of cysteine deficiency. By expression of Pdgfra, we identified these clusters as enriched for adipocyte progenitors (Fig. 2m). We conducted a pseudotime analysis to place these clusters on a trajectory and illuminate their cell lineage. Trajectory analysis based on pseudotime suggested that cluster 2 may differentiate into two separate preadipocyte clusters, clusters 0 and 1 (Fig. 2m). Cth−/− CysF animals proportionally lost clusters 0 and 1, while relatively maintaining cluster 2 compared with the other groups (Fig. 2m), suggesting that more differentiated preadipocytes are mobilized during cysteine deficiency. Indeed, cluster 2 expressed Dpp4, an early progenitor marker that has been shown to give rise to different committed preadipoctyes32 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Cluster 0 was enriched for both Icam1 and F3, which are expressed by committed adipogenic and antiadipogenic preadipocytes, respectively29,32 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Cd9, a fibrogenic marker in preadipocytes31,33, along with the collagen gene, Col5a3, were broadly expressed across clusters 0 and 1, and was specifically lost by day 4 of inducing cysteine deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). The loss of these preadipocyte clusters were orthogonally validated by FACS (Extended Data Fig. 4h). We next sought to identify beige/brown adipocyte precursors in our scRNA-seq dataset to understand whether there was an increased commitment towards brown adipocytes. Clearly, Tagln or Sm22, which has been previously described in beige adipocytes34,35, is specifically expressed by a subset of cells in cluster 1 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Of note, these Tagln-expressing cells are lost with cysteine deficiency (Fig. 2l). Given the strong browning phenotype observed on day 6, it is possible that these cells become mobilized and differentiate early on during cysteine deficiency, leading to the absence of these cells as mature adipocytes are not captured within the SVF. Indeed, when we performed pathways analysis on cluster1, comparing gene expression of Cth−/− CysF with Cth−/− CTRL, we found that one of the top upregulated pathways was ‘adipogenesis' (Extended Data Fig. 4i). Furthermore, examination of the expression of stem associated markers and mature adipocyte markers in the adipocyte progenitor clusters revealed a clear downregulation of stem markers and an increase in mature adipocyte markers, suggesting that cysteine deficiency was driving the maturation of progenitor cells (Fig. 2m and Extended Data Fig. 4j). However, given the robust transformation of the adipose tissue during cysteine deficiency towards browning, it is unlikely that mobilization of brown precursors alone is mediating this response. Previous studies have found that in certain models, beige adipocytes can originate from pre-existing white adipocytes, in addition to de novo adipogenesis36. The potential role of cysteine in the trans-differentiation of mature white adipocytes into brown-like adipocytes needs to be further examined using future lineage-tracking studies.

To determine the mechanism of adipose thermogenesis caused by cysteine starvation, we next investigated the processes upstream of increased fatty acid oxidation. We measured the lipolysis regulators, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (pHSL) and ATGL and found that cysteine deficiency increased ATGL expression without consistently affecting pHSL levels (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ATGL preferentially catalysers the first step of triglyceride hydrolysis, whereas the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) has a much broader range of substrates with a preference for diacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters37. Given a dramatic browning response in WAT post-cysteine deficiency, the increased ATGL is consistent with previous work that shows BAT relies heavily on the action of ATGL to mobilize lipid substrates for thermogenesis38. This is further supported by a decrease in most lipid species, particularly triglycerides and diacylglycerol in the BAT of cysteine-deficient mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Considering dramatic adipose tissue browning and elevated UCP1 expression upon cysteine starvation, we next sought to investigate whether this is a homeostatic response to defend core body temperature (CBT) or whether temperature setpoint is perturbed to causes hyperthermia. We measured CBT utilizing loggers surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity in Cth−/− mice on CTRL or CysF diet over 6 days when animals lose weight. Of note, despite conversion of WAT into brown-like thermogenic fat, the CBT was not different between control and cysteine-deficient mice (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). These data suggest that either cysteine- may signal the host to defend CBT within tight normal physiological range or any metabolic heat that is generated is dissipated due to the animal housing in the sub-thermoneutral temperature. To confirm adipose thermogenesis in vivo, we utilized a highly sensitive and specific magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method called biosensor imaging of redundant deviation in shifts (BIRDS)39 to determine the temperature of BAT in Cth+/+ and Cth−/− animals after 6 days of CysF diet. This method relies on measuring the chemical shift of the four nonexchangeable methyl groups from an exogenous contrast agent, TmDOTMA, which has a high-temperature sensitivity (0.7 ppm per °C). The TmDOTMA− methyl resonance has ultrafast relaxation times (<5 ms), allowing high signal-to-noise ratio by rapid repetition for superior signal averaging39. The temperature was calculated from the chemical shift of the TmDOTMA− methyl resonance according to (equation (1) and Methods). Compared to cysteine-replete animals, the in vivo local temperature in BAT of cysteine-deficient mice was significantly greater than surrounding tissue (Fig. 3c,d), suggesting increased thermogenesis.

Changes in nutritional stress induced by CR, MR or low-protein diets upregulate the expression of FGF21, which, when overexpressed, increases lifespan and also upregulates EE40,41. The induction of cysteine deficiency in Cth-deficient mice caused a dramatic increase in the FGF21 concentration in blood (Fig. 3e) and Fgf21 expression in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 5f), which was reversed by cysteine-repletion-induced weight restoration (Fig. 3e). Similar to FGF21, the hormone GDF15, can also be induced by cellular or nutritional stress-mediated signalling42. Cysteine depletion at day 4 after weight loss significantly increased GDF15, which was not restored after cysteine-repletion-induced weight regain (Fig. 3f). Given the cysteine-repleted diet switch increases food intake, the higher GDF15 levels during weight rebound are likely insufficient to cause food aversion. Notably, recent studies suggest elevated endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress in Bhmt−/− mice with reduced methionine cycle, is associated with increased FGF21 and adipose browning43. Cysteine deficiency led to induction of ER-stress proteins CHOP, calnexin, IRE1α and BIP (Fig. 3g). However, deletion of CHOP in cysteine-starved Cth−/− mice did not rescue weight loss (Fig. 3h) nor did it alter the FGF21 and GDF15 serum levels (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h) demonstrating that induction of the CHOP-dependent ER-stress response does not drive cysteine's metabolic and neuroendocrine effect.

Given that cysteine specifically regulated FGF21 during weight loss and regain (Fig. 3e), we generated Fgf21−/−Cth−/− double knockout (DKO) mice to test whether FGF21 controls adipose browning and weight loss in cysteine-starved mice. In the absence of FGF21, cysteine deficiency-induced weight loss and reduction in adiposity in Cth−/− mice were blunted, but the weight-loss trajectory continued and was not rescued (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 5i). The Fgf21−/−Cth−/− DKO mice had lower EE compared to Cth−/− mice on the CysF diet (Fig. 3j). However, the RER was not different, indicating that Fgf21−/−Cth−/− mice still substantially utilized fat as an energy source (Extended Data Fig. 5j). This was supported by maintenance of lipolysis signalling observed by levels of pHSL and ATGL in Cth−/− mice, but reduced UCP1 protein and mRNA expression in WAT of Fgf21−/−Cth−/− (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 5k). Of note, the WAT of Fgf21−/−Cth−/− DKO mice maintained classical multilocular browning characteristics (Fig. 3l) suggesting that FGF21 is not required for adipose browning. These results suggest that FGF21 is partially required for weight loss but does not mediate lipid mobilization or adipose browning caused by cysteine deficiency.

Cysteine deprivation revealed a metabolic crisis that may signal the host to activate thermogenic mechanisms. However, across animal vivarium, including ours, mice are housed at sub-thermoneutral 20 °C temperatures and are constantly under thermogenic stress due to slight cold challenge28. To further confirm that mice were indeed inducing thermogenesis to defend CBT, we housed cysteine-deficient animals at 30 °C thermoneutrality. The cysteine deficiency in Cth−/− mice housed at 30 °C also led to similar weight loss as 20 °C with significant browning of adipose tissue (Fig. 3m,n and Extended Data Fig. 5l). The degree of browning and gene expression of Ucp1 and Elovl3 in CysF Cth-deficient mice at thermoneutrality were relatively lower than inductions observed at 20 °C (Fig. 3o). Furthermore, expression of genes involved with lipid regulation and browning such as Prdm16, Ppargc1a, Ppara, Pparg and Cpt1 (Fig. 3p) were significantly increased in SFAT, suggesting that even at thermoneutral temperatures, Cth−/− CysF-fed mice activate fat metabolism and have increased thermogenesis caused by cysteine deficiency. In addition, compared to controls, the cysteine-deficient mice at thermoneutrality retained higher Ucp1 expression in BAT (Extended Data Fig. 5m). Together, cysteine-depletion-induced weight loss and adipose browning are maintained at thermoneutrality.

The liver is believed to be the primary organ responsible for maintaining systemic cysteine homeostasis10,13. Immunoblot analyses confirmed the highest CTH expression in the liver, followed by the kidney, thymus and adipose tissue (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Given that CR in humans lowers cysteine levels in adipose tissue; we generated adipocyte- and hepatocyte-specific Cth-deficient mice to explore the cell-type-specific mechanism of cysteine in weight loss (Fig. 4a–h). As expected, liver-specific deletion of Cth did not alter CTH expression in the kidney and adipose-specific ablation of Cth maintained the expression in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Neither liver- nor adipose-specific deletion of Cth led to a reduction in serum cysteine levels (Fig. 4c,d,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d) or caused fat mass loss when cysteine was restricted in the diet (Fig. 4e,f).

Further liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses of sera from hepatocyte-specific Cth-deficient mice maintained on CysF diet showed no changes in cystathionine, γ-glutamyl-dipeptides, cysteine or cystine (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with low CTH activity, livers of the CysF-fed mice (Alb-Cre:Cthf/f, CysF) had lower levels of cysteine, cystathionine, S-adenosyl homocysteine, 2AB and ophthalmate (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g and Supplementary Table 4). Of note, the levels of cystathionine and cysteine/cystine in subcutaneous adipose tissue of liver-specific Cth-deficient mice were unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i and Supplementary Table 5). Consistent with these data, no change in serum cysteine/cystine were detected in adipose tissue specific Cth−/− mice that had no weight loss on a cysteine-free diet (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 6j and Supplementary Table 6). The TSP metabolites can potentially be generated by the gut microbiota19. The Cth−/− animals co-housed together with Cth+/+ mice still maintained weight loss when fed a CysF diet, suggesting that microbiota derived metabolites do not account for the weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 6k). These results demonstrates that Cth across multiple tissues may defend systemic cysteine pool to prevent uncontrolled thermogenesis and death when cysteine content is low in diet.

Given that UCP1 is a canonical regulator of non-shivering adipose thermogenesis44,45 and as cysteine elimination induced UCP1 expression in WAT, we next deleted UCP1 in cysteine-deficient mice to determine its role in adipose browning. Notably, we found that Cth−/−Ucp1−/− double knockout (DKO) mice had equivalent food intake (Extended Data Fig. 6l), lost weight at a similar rate to its Cth−/− littermates on a CysF diet and displayed similar browning-like features with multilocular adipocytes (Fig. 4i,j). The ablation of UCP1 in cysteine-deficient mice lowered EE during dark and light cycles (Fig. 4k,l) but did not affect the CBT (Fig. 4m). Despite similar body weight loss and browning phenotype, Cth−/− and Cth−/−Ucp1−/− DKO mice show significant differences in the interaction between EE and body weight (Fig. 4l). Therefore, UCP1 depletion and other parameters such as body composition may account for this significant difference in the correlative trend between EE and body weight. The lack of UCP1 in Cth-deficient mice undergoing cysteine starvation displayed elevated ATGL and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, suggesting increased lipolytic signalling (Fig. 4n,o). Despite lack of UCP1, gene expression indicative of the thermogenic programme, such as Ppargc1, Cidea and Cpt1 are significantly increased in Cth−/−Ucp1−/− DKO mice compared to Cth−/− in the BAT after 6 days of CysF diet (Fig. 4p). Furthermore, gene expression of other mediators of the thermogenic genes such as Acadm, Cox7a1, Elovl3 and Slc27a2 are also significantly increased in Cth−/−Ucp1−/− DKO mice compared to Cth−/− animals fed cysteine-restricted diet (Fig. 4p). UCP1-independent thermogenesis has been reported previously46. The futile creatine cycle is proposed to regulate UCP1-independent thermogenesis47. Compared to control animals, the creatine cycle genes Ckb and Alpl were not significantly different in SFAT of cysteine-deficient animals (Extended Data Fig. 6m). The creatine synthesis genes, Gatm and Gamt were significantly reduced with cysteine deficiency in SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6m). The expression of one of the creatine kinases that utilizes ATP, Ckmt2 and the transporter for creatine, Slc6a8 were also not differentially regulated in SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6m). Notably, Slc6a8, Ckmt1 and Ckmt2 expression was increased in BAT of Cth−/−Ucp1−/− animals compared to cysteine-deficient animals (Fig. 4q), suggesting a potential role of these effectors in BAT thermogenesis in the cysteine-starvation model.

The alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic regulatory genes Atp2a2 and Ryr2 that control calcium cycling48 were not impacted by cysteine deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 6n). Similarly, Sarcolipin and Atp2a2, which can increase muscle driven thermogenesis49 were also not affected in skeletal muscle of Cth-deficient mice lacking cysteine (Extended Data Fig. 6o). The futile lipid cycle is also implicated in UCP1 independent thermogenesis50. Of note, Cth−/− mice on a CysF diet have significantly elevated expression of Dgat1, Pnpla2 and Gk with no change in Lipe in SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6p). The expression of these genes was also induced in absence of UCP1 in BAT and SFAT (Extended Data Fig. 6q,r). However, absence of association between changes in gene expression of major UCP1 independent regulators does not rule out causal role of some of these mechanisms in cysteine-deprivation-driven adipose browning. These results suggest that systemic cysteine deficiency-induced thermogenesis depends mainly on an as-of-yet unknown non-canonical UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.

As cysteine-elimination-induced adipocyte browning is non-cell autonomous (Extended Data Fig. 3d), we evaluated upstream mechanisms that control cysteine-starvation-induced thermogenesis. We conducted an unbiased whole-brain activity mapping screen to determine the circuitry responsible for regulating the thermogenic induction. Using whole-brain immunolabelling and clearing tandem iDISCO+51, we mapped the differential expression of the immediate–early gene c-Fos (Fig. 5a). Subsequently, we quantified c-Fos positive cells across brain regions and registered them to the Allen Brain Atlas with CLEARMAP52. Notably, key components of the canonical thermogenesis circuitry (Fig. 5a–d) were significantly activated upon 5 days of exposure to a cysteine-free diet.

In brief, thermogenic signals seem to converge in the dorsal lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN), a critical hub that integrates inputs related to both environmental temperature changes and internal metabolic shifts53. From the LPBN, thermogenic signals are relayed to the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a key sensory integrator that regulates thermogenesis54,55. The MPOA then initiates a thermogenic response primarily through activation of the SNS. This response can be mediated by direct monosynaptic projections from the MPOA to premotor regions involved in sympathetic activation or through polysynaptic pathways involving the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) adjacent to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)56,57,58. All these regions were significantly activated (Fig. 5c,d). These findings support the role of the SNS in mediating cysteine-dependent thermogenesis. By activating this well-established thermogenic circuitry, cysteine deficiency induces a potent metabolic response, highlighting a critical mechanism by which systemic amino acid depletion can modulate EE and adipose browning. This underscores the broader physiological relevance of cysteine metabolism in energy homeostasis and thermoregulation.

Upstream of lipolysis, nonshivering thermogenesis is mainly activated by the SNS-derived adipose noradrenaline59. Mass-spectrometric analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue (Fig. 5e), including imaging mass spectrometry of BAT (Extended Data Fig. 7a) revealed that cysteine-starvation-induced browning is associated with increased NA concentrations. This was coupled with a significant reduction in NA-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase-a (Maoa) (Fig. 5f), without affecting catechol-o-methyl transferase (Comt), suggesting increased adipose NA bioavailability (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Finally, to test whether SNS-derived NA is required for adipose browning, the inhibition of β3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) by L748337 in Cth-deficient mice lacking cysteine-protected animals against weight loss (Fig. 5g), despite having a similar food intake (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Inhibition of β3-adrenergic signalling blunted adipose browning (Fig. 5h) and lowered Ucp1 (Fig. 5i), as well as lipolysis inducers pHSL and ATGL that are downstream of ADRB3 signalling (Fig. 5j,k). This was consistent with our unbiased RNA sequencing analyses that showed that cysteine-regulated adipose clusters contained the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes induced by β3-adrenergic receptor agonist (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Together our findings suggest that cysteine-depletion-induced browning is non-cell autonomous and lack of cysteine drives increased SNS activity leading to augmented ADRB3-mediated NA signalling that controls adipose browning to weight loss.

We next tested whether cysteine deficiency could be utilized to induce an adaptive thermogenic mechanism for fat mass reduction in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. The Cth−/− mice that had been fed HFD for 12 weeks were switched to an isocaloric HFD containing (HFD-CTRL) or lacking cystine (HFD-CysF). The Cth−/− mice fed a HFD-CysF diet were able to lose approximately 30% body weight within 1 week despite maintaining a high calorie intake (Fig. 6a). This weight loss was associated with major reductions in fat mass (Extended Data Fig. 7d). With weight loss, cysteine-deficient mice had reduced fasting glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 6b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7e) and increased EE (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Furthermore, cysteine deficiency in obese mice reduced RER suggesting higher fat utilization (Fig. 6e). Notably, immunohistological analysis of the white adipose depots demonstrated that cysteine deficiency induced browning even while on HFD with increased expression of UCP1 in SFAT and VFAT (Fig. 6f). Additionally, consistent with improvement of metabolic function in obesity, the gene expression of inflammasome components Il1b, Il18, Nlrp3, Casp1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Tnf were reduced in F4/80+CD11b+ adipose tissue macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (Fig. 6g) These results demonstrate that induction of cysteine deficiency can cause rapid weight loss in mouse model of diet-induced obesity, opening new avenues for future drug development for excess weight loss.

Adipose tissue regulates metabolism by orchestrating inter-organ communication required for healthy longevity60. Analyses of adipose tissue of humans that underwent moderate CR in free-living conditions have highlighted genes and pathways that link energy metabolism and inflammation to influence healthspan1,2. In rodents, restriction of calories up to 40% reduces CBT and induces browning of the adipose tissue of mice reared in sub-thermoneutral temperature61. The CR in humans upregulated the fatty acid oxidation and futile lipid cycling induced-thermogenic pathways but UCP1 was undetectable in adipose tissue of CALERIE-II participants1. Similarly, weight loss in obese humans is not associated with classical UCP1 adipose tissue browning62. This suggests that alternative UCP1-independent mechanisms maybe at play in human in response to CR. In this regard, reduction of CBT63 and increased FGF21 is a common link between CR and MR-induced adipose browning and increased longevity7,41,61. Our studies demonstrated that reduction of cysteine and subsequent rewiring of downstream cysteine metabolism is linked to adipose browning and weight loss.

Expression and activity of the TSP genes CBS and CTH increase when cysteine is low10. Indeed, during CR, the TSP is induced to defend against the depletion of cysteine levels. MR regimens that improve lifespan are also restricted or deficient in cysteine12, and it is unclear whether MR or cysteine restriction drives pro-longevity effects. Thus, to understand the metabolic requirement of dietary non-essential amino acid such as cysteine, a genetic mouse model is required that lacks Cth in conjunction with restriction of cysteine. Notably, previously reported Cth mutant mice originally generated on a 129SvEv mouse strain maintained on cysteine-replete normal chow diet were reported to display hypertension and motor dysfunction characteristic of neurodegenerative changes in corpus striatum64,65. Using this same model cysteine depletion in this global Cth-deficient mice also causes weight loss and adipose tissue browning together with decrease of CoA levels similar to our findings66. We also demonstrate that conditional deletion of Cth (on a pure C57/B6 background) in adipose tissue and liver is not sufficient to induces weight loss and cause adipose browning as other tissues compensate to maintain to systemic cysteine concentrations after cysteine elimination in the diet. Our data establish that systemic cysteine depletion drives adipose tissue thermogenesis without causing behavioural defects or pathological lesions.

While it is still unclear why cysteine deficiency triggers the activation of adipose browning, the mechanism of thermogenesis depends on upstream SNS-mediated sympathetic β3-adrenergic signalling and partially requires FGF21 and can be successfully maintained even in the absence of UCP1 and at thermoneutrality. Future studies of specific ablation of UCP1-independent thermogenic genes in Cth−/− mice on cysteine restriction are required to determine the causal downstream pathway that causes thermogenesis. The model of cysteine-deprivation-induced strong browning response may thus allow the discovery of an alternate UCP1-independent mechanism of adipose tissue thermogenesis.

In healthy humans undergoing CR, consistent with reduced cysteine, glutathione, a major redox regulator, was reduced in adipose tissue. The Cth-deficient mice on a cysteine-free diet show a decrease in CoA and GSH with a compensatory increase in Gclc, Gss and accumulation of γ-glutamyl-peptides. Despite increased oxidative stress, the adipose tissue histology, RNA sequencing and lipidomic analysis of BAT did not reveal overt ferroptosis in cysteine-depletion-induced weight loss. Future studies may reveal cysteine-dependent alternative protective mechanisms that control redox balance and ferroptosis while sustaining UCP1-independent thermogenesis.

Taken together, this study expands our understanding of pathways activated by pro-longevity dietary interventions that confer metabolic adaptation required to maintain tissue homeostasis. Thus, the manipulation of TSP activity to drive adipose tissue browning also has implications for developing interventions that control adiposity and promote longevity. In humans, restriction of methionine and cysteine increased FGF21 and caused a reduction in body weight with improvement of metabolic parameters67. Similar to our findings, the metabolic benefits of methionine and cysteine dietary restriction in humans were greater than MR alone67. Here, based on human dietary restriction studies and mouse models of cysteine deficiency, we demonstrate that cysteine is essential for organismal metabolism as its absence triggers adipose browning with progressive weight loss.

The participants in this study were part of the CALERIE Phase 2 study68, which was a multicentre, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial by recruitment of non-obese healthy individuals. Overall, 238 adults participated at three different locations: Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Washington University and Tufts University (NCT00427193, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov). Duke University served as a coordinating centre. Participants were randomly assigned to of 25% CR or ad libitum caloric intake for 2 years. CR group participants actually reached 14% of CR1,3. Men were between 21 and 50 years old and women were between 21 and 47 years old. Their body mass index was between 22.0 and 27.9 kg m–2 at the initial visit. Samples were collected at baseline, 1 year and 2 years of intervention. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy was performed on a portion of CR group participants and used for RNA sequencing and metabolomics in this study. All studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Pennington institutional review board with written informed consent from all participants.

All mice were on a C57BL/6J (B6) genetic background. Cth−/− mice (C57BL/6NTac-Cthtm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu/Ieg) were purchased from the European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository. Breeding these mice to Flipase transgenic mice from The Jackson Laboratories generated Cthfl/fl mice, which were crossed to Adipoq-cre and Albumin-cre, purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Ucp1−/− and CHOP−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories and crossed to Cth−/− mice. Fgf21−/− mice were kindly provided by S. Kliewer (UT Southwestern) as described previously40 and crossed to Cth−/− mice. All mice used in this study were housed in specific-pathogen-free facilities in ventilated cage racks that deliver HEPA-filtered air to each cage with free access to sterile water through a Hydropac system at Yale School of Medicine. Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard vivarium chow (Harlan 2018s), unless a special diet was provided, and housed under a 12-h light–dark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity conditions (approximately 22 °C and 60% humidity). Unless stated, male mice were used for the experiments, aged 3–5 months at the start of the experiment. All experiments and animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. Animals were either allocated to experimental groups depending on their genotype or randomly when working with the same genotype.

For cysteine-deficiency studies, mice were fed either a control diet (511387), CysF diet (510027), HFD-CTRL diet (511412) or HFD-CysF diet (511411) purchased from Dyets, for 6 days unless specified otherwise. For pair-feeding studies, mice were provided with either ad libitum or 2.22–2.27 g of diet daily.

Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and optionally frozen and stored at −80 °C. Samples were left on ice, vortexing every 10 min for 30 min. For tissue samples, snap-frozen tissues were ground by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies (and source) were diluted 1:1,000 and used to measure protein expression: β-actin (Cell Signalling 4967), pHSL p660 (Cell Signalling 4126), ATGL (Cell Signalling 2439S), UCP1 (Abcam ab10983), CTH (Novus H00001491-M03), tubulin (Abcam ab7291), HSL (Cell Signalling 4107), TH (Cell Signalling 2792), IRE1a (Cell Signalling 3294), Calnexin (Novus NB300-518), BiP (Cell Signalling 3177), CHOP (Cell Signalling 2895), HSP90 (Cell Signalling 4874), anti-puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich MABE343) and HSP40 (Cell Signalling 4868); followed by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted 1:5,000 (anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signalling 7074) or peroxidase AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-035-003)).

Cells or ground tissue (described above) were collected in STAT-60 (Tel-test). RNA from cells were extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy micro kits following the manufacturer's instructions. For tissue samples, RNA was extracted using Zymo mini kits following the manufacturer's instructions. During RNA extraction, DNA was digested using RNase free DNase set (QIAGEN). Synthesis of complementary DNA was performed using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using Power SYBR Green detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Light Cycler 480 II (Roche). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

Cth−/− HFD-CTRL and HFD-CysF mice were fasted 14 h before glucose tolerance test. Glucose was given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection based on body weight (0.4 g kg−1). Cth−/− CTRL and CysF mice were fasted for 4 h. Glucose was given by i.p. based on lean mass determined by EchoMRI (2 g kg−1 lean mass). Blood glucose levels were measured by handheld glucometer (Breeze, Bayer Health Care).

Adipose tissue was digested at 37 °C in HBSS (Life Technologies) + 0.1% collagenase I or II (Worthington Biochemicals). The SVF was collected by centrifugation, washed and filtered using 100-μm and 70-μm strainers. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then for surface markers, including anti-CD45-BV711 (BioLegend, 103147) or anti-CD45-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, 103114), anti-CD3-Perp-Cy5.5 (BioLegend, 100327), anti-B220-AF488 (BioLegend, 103225), anti-CD11b-BV711 (BioLegend, 101241), anti-F4/80-BV421 (BioLegend, 123132), anti-Ly6G-AF700 (BioLegend, 127622), anti-Siglec F-AF647 (BD, 562680), anti-CD24-PerCp-Cy5.5 (eBioscience, 45-0242-80), anti-F3-PE (R&D, FAB3178P), anti-CD31-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-0311-81), anti-Pdgfra-BV605 (BioLegend, 135916), anti-Dpp4-FITC (BioLegend, 137805) and anti-CD9-APC (BioLegend, 124813). Antibodies were diluted 1:200. Cells were fixed in 2% PFA. Samples were acquired on a custom LSR II or sorted with a FACSARIA cell sorter, using Diva software (v.8.0.1). Data were analysed in FlowJo (v.10.3).

For SVF, female Cth+/+ and Cth−/− mice were fed CTRL of CysF diet for 4 days. SFAT was collected, with lymph nodes removed, pooled and digested. Isolated cells were subjected to droplet-based 3′ end massively parallel scRNA-seq using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent kits as per manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics). The libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq3000 instrument (Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, barcode processing and single-cell 3′ counting was performed using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics). The Cell Ranger count was used to align samples to the reference genome (mm10), quantify reads, and filter reads with a quality score below 30. The Seurat package in R was used for subsequent analysis31. Cells with mitochondrial content greater than 0.05% were removed and data were normalized using a scaling factor of 10,000, and number of unique molecular identifiers (nUMI) was regressed with a negative binomial model. Principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed using the top 3,000 most variable genes and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) analysis was performed with the top 20 principal components. Clustering was performed using a resolution of 0.4. The highly variable genes were selected using the FindVariableFeatures function with mean >0.0125 or <3 and dispersion >0.5. These genes are used in performing the linear dimensionality reduction. PCA was performed before clustering and the first 20 principal components were used based on the ElbowPlot. Clustering was performed using the FindClusters function, which works on k-nearest neighbour graph model with granularity ranging 0.1–0.9 and selected 0.4 for the downstream clustering. For identifying the biomarkers for each cluster, we performed differential expression between each cluster to all other clusters, identifying positive markers for that cluster. To understand the trajectory of the adipocyte progenitors, we used Monocle2 to analyse scRNA-seq data of clusters 0, 1 and 2 (ref. 69).

Snap-frozen tissues were ground by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in STAT-60. RNA was extracted using Zymo mini kits. RNA was sequenced on a HiSeq2500. The quality of raw reads was assessed with FastQC. Raw reads were mapped to the GENCODE vM9 mouse reference genome (GENCODE) using STAR Aligner with the following options: –outFilterMultimapNmax 15 –outFilterMismatchNmax 6 –outSAMstrandField All –outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate –quantMode TranscriptomeSAM. The quality control of mapped reads was performed using in-house scripts that employ Picard tools. The list of rRNA genomic intervals that we used for this quality control was prepared on the basis of UCSC mm10 rRNA annotation file (UCSC) and GENCODE primary assembly annotation for vM9 (GENCODE). rRNA intervals from these two annotations were combined and merged to obtain the final list of rRNA intervals. These intervals were used for the calculation of the percentage of reads mapped to rRNA genomic loci. Strand specificity of the RNA-seq experiment was determined using an in-house script, on the basis of Picard mapping statistics. Expression quantification was performed using RSEM. For the assessment of expression of mitochondrial genes, we used all genes annotated on the mitochondrial chromosome in the GENCODE vM9 mouse reference genome. PCA was performed in R. For PCA, the donor effect was removed using the ComBat function from the sva R-package. Gene differential expression was calculated using DESeq2. Pathway analysis was conducted using fgsea (fast GSEA) R-package (fgsea) with the minimum of 15 and maximum of 500 genes in a pathway and with 1 million of permutations. For the pathway analysis, we used the Canonical Pathways from the MSigDB C2 pathway set (MSigDB1 and MSigDB2), v.6.1. The elimination of redundant significantly regulated pathways (adjusted P < 0.05) was carried out using an in-house Python script in the following way. We considered all ordered pairs of pathways, where the first pathway had normalized enrichment score equal to or greater than the second pathway. For each ordered pair of pathways, we analysed the leading gene sets of these pathways. The leading gene sets were obtained using fgsea. If at least one of the leading gene sets in a pair of pathways had more than 60% of genes in common with the other leading gene set, then we eliminated the second pathway in the pair.

Frozen tissues or serum samples, together with internal standard compounds (mentioned below), was subjected to sonication in 500 μl of ice-cold methanol. To this, an equal volume of ultrapure water (LC–MS grade, Wako) and 0.4 volume of chloroform were added. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 15,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was then filtered using an ultrafiltration tube (Ultrafree MC-PLHCC, Human Metabolome Technologies), and the filtrate was concentrated by nitrogen spraying (aluminium block bath with nitrogen gas spraying system, DTU-1BN/EN1-36, TAITEC). The concentrated filtrate was dissolved in 50 μl of ultrapure water and utilized for ion chromatography (IC)–MS and LC–MS/MS analysis. Methionine sulfone and 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid were employed as internal standards for cationic and anionic metabolites, respectively. The recovery rate (%) of the standards in each sample measurement was calculated to correct for the loss of endogenous metabolites during sample preparation.

Anionic metabolites were detected using an orbitrap-type MS (Q-Exactive focus; Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a high-performance IC system (ICS-5000+, Thermo Fisher Scientific) that allows for highly selective and sensitive metabolite quantification through IC separation and a Fourier transfer MS principle. The IC system included a modified Thermo Scientific Dionex AERS 500 anion electrolytic suppressor, which converted the potassium hydroxide gradient into pure water before the sample entered the mass spectrometer. Separation was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Dionex IonPac AS11-HC column with a particle size of 4 μm. The IC flow rate was 0.25 ml min−1, supplemented post-column with a makeup flow of 0.18 ml min−1 methanol. The potassium hydroxide gradient conditions for IC separation were as follows: from 1 mM to 100 mM (0–40 min), to 100 mM (40–50 min) and to 1 mM (50.1–60 min), with a column temperature of 30 °C. The Q-Exactive focus mass spectrometer was operated in the ESI-negative mode for all detections. A full mass scan (m/z 70–900) was performed at a resolution of 70,000. The automatic gain control target was set at 3 × 106 ions, and the maximum ion injection time was 100 ms. The source ionization parameters were optimized with a spray voltage of 3 kV, and other parameters were as follows: transfer temperature of 320 °C; S-Lens level of 50, heater temperature of 300 °C; sheath gas of 36 and Aux gas of 10.

Cationic metabolites were measured using LC–MS/MS. The LC–MS-8060 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu corporation) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source was employed to perform multiple reaction monitoring in positive and negative ESI modes. The samples were separated on a Discovery HS F5-3 column (2.1 mm internal diameter × 150 mm length, 3-μm particle, Sigma-Aldrich) using a step gradient of mobile phase A (0.1% formate) and mobile phase B (0.1% acetonitrile) with varying ratios: 100:0 (0–5 min), 75:25 (5–11 min), 65:35 (11–15 min), 5:95 (15–20 min) and 100:0 (20–25 min). The flow rate was set at 0.25 ml min−1 and the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C.

For low concentration monoamine measurements, extracted tissue metabolites by abovementioned protocol were injected with an autosampler (M-510, Eicom) into a HPLC unit (Eicom) coupled to an ECD (ECD-300, Eicom). The samples were resolved on the Eicompak SC-5ODS column (φ3.0 × 150 mm, Eicom), using an isocratic mobile phase (5 mg l−1 EDTA-2Na, 220 mg l−1 sodium 1-octanesulfonate in acetate/citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 3.5)/methanol (83:17, v/v)), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 and a column temperature of 25 °C. At the ECD, analytes were subjected to oxidation reactions within the ECD unit with WE-3G graphite electrode (applied potential is +750 mV against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Resulting chromatograms were analysed using the software EPC-300 (Eicom).

To extract total lipids, frozen tissues were mixed with 500 μl of 1-butanol/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 5 mM ammonium formate. The mixture was vortexed for 10 s, sonicated for 15 min in a sonic water bath and then centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 20 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 0.2-ml glass insert with a Teflon insert cap for LC ESI–MS analysis.

For lipidomic analysis, a Q-Exactive focus orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was connected to an HPLC system (Ultimate3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were separated on a Thermo Scientific Accucore C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 2.6 μm) using a step gradient of mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (2 mM ammonium formate in acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol/water, ratios of 10:88:2, v/v/v, with 0.02% formic acid). The gradient ratios used were 65:35 (0 min), 40:60 (0–4 min), 15:85 (4–12 min), 0:100 (12–21 min), 0:100 (21–24 min), 65:35 (24–24.1 min) and 100:0 (24.1–28 min) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1 and a column temperature of 35 °C. The Q-Exactive focus mass spectrometer operated in both positive and negative ESI modes. It performed a full mass scan (m/z 250–1,100), followed by three rapid data-dependent MS/MS scans, at resolutions of 70,000 and 17,500, respectively. The automatic gain control target was set at 1 × 106 ions, and the maximum ion injection time was 100 ms. The source ionization parameters included a spray voltage of 3 kV, transfer tube temperature of 285 °C, S-Lens level of 45, heater temperature of 370 °C, sheath gas at 60 and auxiliary gas at 20. The acquired data were analysed using LipidSearch software (Mitsui Knowledge Industry) for major phospholipids (PLs). The search parameters for LipidSearch software were as follows: precursor mass tolerance of 3 ppm, product mass tolerance of 7 ppm and m-score threshold of 3.

The tissue block was frozen and secured onto a disc using a cryoembedding medium (Super Cryoembedding Medium, SECTION-LAB), then equilibrated at −16 °C in cryostats (Leica Biosystems). Tissue sections, 8-µm thick, were cut and mounted onto conductive indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Matsunami Glass Industries). A solution of tetrafluoroborate salts of 2,4-diphenyl-pyrylium (DPP) (1.3 mg ml−1 in methanol) for on-tissue derivatization of monoamines and DHB-matrix (50 mg ml−1 in 80% ethanol) were manually sprayed onto the tissue using an airbrush (Procon Boy FWA platinum; Mr Hobby). The manual spray was performed at room temperature, applying 40 μl mm−2 with a distance of approximately 50 mm. The samples were analysed using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The raster scan pitch was set at 50 µm. Signals of noradrenaline-DPP (m/z 384 > 232) were monitored with a precursor ion isolation width of m/z 1.0 and a normalized collision energy of 45%. Ion images were reconstructed using ImageQuest v.1.1.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% PFA. Brains were then put through a 24 h post-fixing period, after which, immunolabelling and whole-brain clearing were performed according to previously established protocols. Antibodies used for c-Fos labelling were Synaptic Systems rabbit c-Fos 226008 (primary) and Alexa-Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (secondary), respectively. Fos labelling studies were next analysed using ClearMap52. For acquisition, cleared samples were imaged in a sagittal orientation (left lateral side up) on a light-sheet microscope (Miltenyi Blaze) equipped with a sCMOS camera and LVMI-Fluor ×4 objective lens equipped with a 6-mm working distance dipping cap. Inspector Microscope controller software was used. Samples were scanned in the 640 nm channel. Images were taken every 6 μm and reconstructed with ClearMap software52 for quantification or Imaris v.10.1 software for visualization. The 480-nm channel was used with a ×1.3 objective lens for autofluorescence.

Animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane, first at a rate of 2–3% and maintained at 0.5–2% in oxygen during surgery. Mice were kept on a heating pad throughout surgery. Mice were injected with buprenorphine and bupivacaine as pre-emptive analgesia. A small ventral incision of 1 cm was made after clipping hair and disinfection with betadine and 70% ethanol. DST nano-T temperature loggers (Star-Oddi) were placed in the peritoneal cavity, and abdominal muscle and skin were sutured closed. After surgery, mice were singly housed and provided with Meloxicam for 48 h. After 7 days, sutures were removed. Ten days after surgery, mice were started on CTRL or CysF diet, and loggers were removed for data collection after killing. Loggers were programmed to take temperature readings every 30 min.

The EE, RER, activity and food intake of mice were monitored using the TSE PhenoMaster System (v.3.0.3) Indirect Calorimetry System. Each mouse was housed in individual chambers for 3 days for acclimation and switched to experimental diet for 6 days. Each parameter was measured every 30 min. EE and RER were calculated based on the oxygen consumption (O2) and carbon dioxide production (CO2). Mouse activity was detected by infra-red sensors, and food intake and water consumption were measured via weight sensors on food and water dispensers located in the cage.

The parameters of body composition were measured in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI; Echo Medical Systems). The amount of fat mass, lean mass and free water were measured by the analysis. For the analysis, each mouse was placed in an acrylic tube with breathing holes and the tube was inserted in the MRI machine. The analysis per mouse takes approximately 90 s and automatically calculated numerical results were analysed.

Mice were acclimated in climate chambers (model 7000-10, Caron) at either 30 °C or 20 °C, with humidity maintained at 50% under a 12 h light–dark cycle. After 1 week acclimation, mice were switched to either CTRL or CysF diet for 6 days, while maintained in the climate chambers. Mice were handled daily to measure body weight.

Faeces were collected daily over the course of CTRL or CysF feeding. Samples were dried for 72 h. Faecal bomb calorimetry was performed at UT Southwestern Medical Center Metabolic Phenotyping Core using a Parr 6200 Isoperibol Calorimeter equipped with a 6510 Parr Water Handling.

After blood collection by cardiac puncture, samples were allowed to clot for 2 h. Serum was collected after centrifugation. FGF21 and GDF15 levels in the serum were measured by ELISA (R&D). Cysteine levels were determined by competitive EIA (LS-Bio). Glycerol levels were determined by colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Snap-frozen tissues were homogenized in PBS supplemented with EDTA and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were filtered through 10 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filters (Millipore). Total GSH and GSSG levels were determined by colorimetric assay (Cayman Chemical). Coenzyme A levels were measured by fluorometric assay (Abcam). Data were normalized to protein concentration, determined beforehand with colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad).

SUnSET assay was performed to assess protein synthesis70. Mice were injected with puromycin (Invivogen) (40 nmol g−1 body weight). Mice were killed 30 min after administration and tissues were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were processed for western blotting to assess incorporation of puromycin in newly synthesized proteins.

Mice were administered twice daily L748337 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (5 mg kg−1) by i.p. injection. Mice were weighed daily and assessed for their health.

Tissues were collected in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 5-μm thick sections. Tissues were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or stained for UCP1 (Abcam) and goat anti-rabbit HRP (DAKO) and developed for colour using Abcam DAB substrate kit.

The animals were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber and then kept at 2–3% during surgery. The animal was laid back on a microwaveable heating pad. Before incision, a single dose of bupivacaine was given for analgesia. A 1–2-cm midline incision was made on the neck to expose the jugular vein. Another small incision (<1 cm) was made at the back of the neck. A sterile polyurethane or silicone catheter with a metal guide was inserted from the back of the neck, where the vascular port was fixed to the jugular vein. Before implantation the port and the catheter were flushed with heparinized saline (25 IU ml−1). The jugular vein was catheterized toward the heart. The skin was closed with surgical sutures after application of triple antibiotic ointment and the vascular port was fixed. The duration of the surgical procedure was 15–20 min.

TmDOTMA− was purchased from Macrocyclics. Temperature mapping with BIRDS was performed on a 9.4T Bruker scanner. The respiration rate was monitored during the entire duration of the experiment. A 200 mM TmDOTMA− solution was infused at a rate of 60 to 80 µl h−1 for 1–2 h. The infusion rate was adjusted according to animal physiology. The T2-weighted MR images were acquired with a field of view of 23 × 23 mm2, 128 × 128 matrix, 23 slices of 0.5-mm thickness, TR = 3 s and TE = 9 ms. The extremely short T1 and T2 relaxation times (<5 ms) of the TmDOTMA− methyl group allowed ultrafast temperature mapping with BIRDS using 3D chemical shift imaging (CSI) acquisition with a short TR (10 ms) and wide bandwidths (±150 ppm). Temperature mapping with BIRDS was started immediately after detection of global MR signal of TmDOTMA− methyl group, at about 1 h after the start of the infusion. The CSI was acquired using a field of view of 23 × 15 × 23 mm3, 809 spherical encoding steps, 21 min acquisition and reconstructed to 23 × 15 × 23, with a voxel resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. Selective excitation of the TmDOTMA− methyl group was achieved using a single-band, 200-µs Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) RF pulse. The MR spectrum in each voxel was line broadened (200 Hz) and phased (zero-order) in MATLAB (MathWorks), and the corresponding temperature Tc was calculated from the chemical shift \({\delta }_{C{H}_{3}}\) of the TmDOTMA− methyl group according to

where δ0 = −103.0 ppm and the coefficients a0 = 34.45 ± 0.01, a1 = 1.460 ± 0.003 and a2 = 0.0152 ± 0.0009 were calculated from the linear least-squares fit of temperature as a function of chemical shift \({\delta }_{C{H}_{3}}\). Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t-test with two tails, with P < 0.05 used as a cutoff for significance.

POBN (α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone, Enzo) was used for spin trapping; POBN was dissolved in saline and administered i.p. at 500 mg kg−1 body weight. Tissue samples (VFAT, SFAT and BAT) were collected 45 min after injection, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until EPR measurements. Lipid extraction was performed using chloroform:methanol (2:1) (Folch extraction) as described previously71. All EPR spectra were recorded in a quartz flat cell using an X-band EMX plus EPR Spectroscope (parameters: 3,480 ± 80 G scan width, 105 receiver gain and 20 mW microwave power; time constant of 1,310 ms and conversion time of 655 ms).

Aconitase activity was measured with an Aconitase Assay kit (Cayman). Freshly collected SFAT and VFAT samples were measured at 500 μg total protein pe ml, and BAT samples were measured at 100 μg total protein per ml. All results were normalized to 500 μg ml−1 total protein concentration. The standard protocol provided with the kits was followed.

Stromal vascular fraction from visceral depots of Cth−/− was isolated as previously described. Cells were plated in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) and expanded for 3–5 days. Adipocyte differentiation was induced with growth medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg ml−1), rosiglitazone (1 μM), iso-butyl-methylxanthine (0.5 mM) and dexamethasone (1 μM) for 48 h. Cells were maintained on differentiation medium containing insulin (5 μg ml−1) and rosiglitazone (1 μM) for 96 h. Fully differentiated cells were then treated with various concentrations of cystine (0–200 μM) for 48 h, in cystine and methionine-free DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 200 μM methionine.

Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Data were analysed with GraphPad (v.9.4.0) or R (v.3.4.2). Statistical differences between groups were calculated by unpaired two-tailed t-tests. For comparing groups over time, mice were individually tracked, and groups were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak's correction for multiple comparisons. For all experiments P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in the field. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Some mice were excluded from the study due to abnormal health conditions or reaching the humane end point.

Percentage body weight change over 6 days of diet. f) Accumulated food intake of Cth+/+ and Cth−/− mice over 6 days of CysF feeding measured in metabolic cages (n = 10 Cth+/+ and n = 12 Cth−/−). Cage image and video show that Cth−/− mice on CysF diet at day 5 have normal activity. g) Qualitative assessment of nest building (score from 0 to 4) and presence (score=1) or absence (score=0) of kyphosis in WT and Cth−/− mice (n = 12/group). h) Gait assessment, ledge test and hindlimb clasping test were performed to measure motor coordination in WT and Cth−/− mice. Mice were scored from 0 (normal behaviour) to 1 (abnormal behaviour) (n = 12/group). i) Representative H&E-stained sections of kidney, lung, heart, and liver from female Cth−/− mice fed control diet or cystine-deficient diet for 6 days, lack notable pathologic changes and do not differ in microscopic changes by diet in the tissues examined. C = renal cortex, M = renal medulla A = airway, P = pulmonary artery, > = central vein, and * = portal triad. Kidney scale bars=200 μm, lung, heart, liver scale bars= 100μm. Data are expressed as mean±SEM. Statistical differences were calculated by 2-way ANOVA with Sidak's correction for multiple comparisons, or by unpaired two-tailed t-tests.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","“Mario Kart World” Devs Broke Their Own Rule on Who Gets to Drive","https://www.wired.com/story/mario-kart-world-everyone-gets-to-drive/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Conkdor, an ostrich-like enemy that made its debut in Super Mario 3D World, should not be able to drive. First, it is a bird. Second, it has no hands. But in Mario Kart World, Conkdor can race alongside Mario on bikes, cars, and magic carpets, just like everyone else.

This newfound ability of dozens of new characters to compete in the game is a first for the series, and a change that required the developers to rethink how they approached playable characters.

“I have to say that in previous Mario Kart titles, we had to consider whether or not that character would be able to drive,” producer Kosuke Yabuki told WIRED during a translated interview. “My old way of thinking was, well, surely they would need to have hands and feet to be able to drive.”

As a Switch 2 launch title, Mario Kart World heralds the next generation of the series, and it does so with a huge cast of playable racers. At least 50 characters have been confirmed so far, and many variations of those characters exist with costume changes. Yabuki says that when deciding on the game's cast, the team first had to consider if players would like new characters and, more importantly, if they'd use them. Nintendo wants players to be surprised by who they can play as, but that's not all: “If you're playing a match, would it be fun to see that character alongside you,” Yabuki says.

That may explain much of the game's new cast, which includes several characters lacking feet, hands, or both. Yabuki mentions Goomba, the series' iconic, grumpy fanged foes, or Pokey, a cacti character made of stacked spikey balls: “OK, sure, they can drive,” Yabuki says.

“I probably wouldn't be able to even explain how they drive exactly in this setting,” Yabuki adds, “but so long as we're surprising and delighting people, I think that's the important part.” The game's cow character is already a huge hit with players since her reveal. Yabuki expects that other new characters will be popular as well.

“I'm sure that we'll see a lot of players that are choosing to race as the cow or the penguin,” Yabuki says, “but this is still a Mario Kart game. I hope that everyone remembers to play Peach and Mario as well.”

Mario Kart World's huge cast is necessary now that its races can accommodate up to 24 players; the most recent Switch version of the game, Mario Kart 8, allowed only 12 players per round. Yabuki says the team decided early on that it would be doubling the number of racers for this game. “We knew that with a vast world that is interconnected and covered in all of these different routes, we needed a large number of simultaneous players to give a populated and fun feeling to that big a space,” he says.

That required some additional balancing. A race with 24 people can quickly go off the rails. “If we didn't adjust anything else, you'd be receiving too many attacks and it would be too stressful of a gameplay experience,” Yabuki says. The same goes for crashes or spinouts, which have been adjusted so when players lose speed, they're different depending on the event. “Certainly, we have to think about the chaos element as well,” Yabuki says. “Sometimes, a free for all is a really fun experience too.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","'Mario Kart World' Races Are More Chaotic—and Better—Than Ever","https://www.wired.com/story/mario-kart-world-first-impressions/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

When working on the first Mario Kart game for Switch 2, Nintendo decided against sticking to numbered sequels, opting instead to call what would have been the series' ninth entry Mario Kart World. It signaled the team's ambition to try a more modern approach to the popular franchise.

Mario Kart World is the Switch 2's most high-profile launch title, and it's the series' newest game in roughly a decade. That's a lot of pressure even for a Nintendo flagship property, but Mario Kart World does not disappoint. During a private hands-on event held in New York, WIRED spent several hours with the game's single and multiplayer modes, including its Knockout tour, battles, and vast open areas. While it wasn't enough for a full review of the game, the time we spent with Mario Kart World offered a promising look at the Switch 2's debut.

The biggest change to the game is right there in the title: an interconnected world map, Free Roam, that players can explore every part of, even outside of races. In other words, players can drive everywhere, from beachy tracks to snowy mountains, offroad or on. Hidden throughout the game's world are special challenges and unlockables, including drive-throughs that grant certain characters new outfits.

That world feels impressive in scope and unlike any of the previous games in the series, where the most exploring players could do involved hunting for shortcuts to use in races. While it's possible to stick to roads and highways the whole time you spend in Mario Kart World, the real joy here is in charting your own path between grand prix.

“The first thing that we had to think about was how to build in all of these racing routes all over that world like a network that overlays it,” producer Kosuke Yabuki said, through a translator, at the event. “So in thinking of that network of all of these connected routes, we had to consider them one by one and make sure that each one was pleasurable and interesting, and that it would offer a lot of value and fun for the player no matter which way they went.”

Keeping the world interesting meant creating variety in these routes, Yabuki says, whether that was a large road or smaller, forest trails. “We're certainly not bound by thinking about real-life geography, where we're using islands and towns exactly as they might appear somewhere.”

Yabuki says the team didn't want to use the phrase “open world” to describe the experience, because it's a term too broad for what they wanted to accomplish. “The beginning of this project really was thinking about that vast interconnected world,” Yabuki says. “How do we layer on top of that all of the experiences that you're accustomed to having in a Mario Kart game as well.”

Part of that meant that players need to be able to quickly grasp its mechanics, which means the act of racing itself is as basic as pressing a button to hit the gas. More advanced techniques exist for players who get the handle of things, including grinding on walls and railings and jump-boosting your way out of attacks.

Mario Kart World's competitions feel more chaotic than previous entries, in large part due to the fact that the races have doubled in size. Now, up to 24 players battle for first place; previous games allowed for 12 players per race. During the circuits we played, that meant that very rarely did a race feel like an easy win. A first-place cruise can be easily slapped away with well-timed attacks from opponents or, more terrifying, a blue shell.

But the game also makes recovering from a low ranking during the same run entirely possible—as long as you've got enough time to score a few items and keep your kart steady. If races aren't your speed when it comes to rivalry, Mario Kart World also includes some familiar battle modes, like balloon popping. It's simple, but a fun challenge: attack the other racer's balloons on their kart without getting yours popped, while everyone zooms around and fights for items.

The game's best offering for competition by far, however, is its Knockout Tour—one long elimination race where players need to achieve a certain placing to continue, until a winner is crowned. The pressure to place adds a thrilling sense of urgency that normal races don't always achieve, as every moment counts, and mistakes will cost you.

There's a great deal of potential for online play in Mario Kart World, including with the Switch 2's GameChat and camera options—as long as your friends and family are able to grab the compatible hardware. With the impact of tariffs on the upcoming launch, as well as questions of whether retailers will be able to stock enough consoles to meet demand, it's still unclear how accessible the Switch 2, game, or accessories will be when the new platform launches this Thursday.

With the help of the James Webb Space Telescope, a team of astronomers has broken the record for the oldest, most distant galaxy detected to date by humans.

In a preprint study, still awaiting peer review and publication in a journal, astronomers describe this primitive galaxy, giving it the name MoM z14. According to the researchers' calculations, this “cosmic miracle” originated 280 million years after the Big Bang, beating the record set by the discovery just last year of JADES-GS-Z14-0, a galaxy created 290 million years after the origin of the universe.

To put these measurements in context, the current age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. Earth has an approximate age of 4.543 billion years. No one expected the James Webb Space Telescope to have the potential to observe things so close in age to the Big Bang just three and a half years after launch.

A brief reminder about distances relative to space-time. Because light travels at a finite speed of 300,000 meters per second, and because space is expanding, observing light from very distant objects is equivalent to seeing what they were like long ago. For example, when we say that MoM z14 is roughly 13.5 billion years old, that means you would have to travel 13.5 billion years at the speed of light to reach it. So far, there is no point detected by a scientific instrument farther away, and at the same time, older, than this one.

The James Webb Space Telescope, with its ability to peer deep into distant space, allows us to study some aspects of the universe in its early stages. How does it do this? By infrared sensors. Due to the expansion of the universe, almost all the galaxies we see from Earth are moving away from us. So, from our point of view, their light appears to have a longer wavelength because it is stretched by this movement. We call this “redshift”: Their wavelengths are redder because they are longer, and so shift towards the red end of the light spectrum. The earlier an object was created, and therefore the farther away it is, having expanded outwards for a longer period of time, the greater the redshift.

The James Webb Space Telescope was able to determine that MoM z14 is 50 times smaller than the Milky Way, and also detected the presence of nitrogen and carbon in the galaxy. This is significant because, despite being only 280 million years older than the Big Bang, this shows that MoM z14 does not belong to the first generation of galaxies formed, since stars in these galaxies would be made up only of hydrogen and helium, the elements that predominantly made up the early universe. Heavier elements only arrived later, after being produced in stars.

Can the James Webb cross that threshold and find the first generation of galaxies? Such discoveries could be a long way off, but we have to keep looking.

I bought my first ebike over five years ago, and it cost about the same as the Level 3, the brand-new all-in-one commuter from Aventon. It was a very fun ride when it was working, but it wasn't a great bike. I got a month or two of mileage before it needed a new motor and brakes.

I say this because the main concern I have with entry-level, direct-to-consumer ebikes is their durability. Aventon has, time and time again, provided our team with review units that look great, work well, and don't break down in catastrophic ways. After a few dozen miles on this new commuter, I can say it's a great beginner ebike for most people.

There are very few affordable ebike brands that compete with Aventon's level of quality, usability, and reliability. Add to that built-in fenders, lights, a 70-mile battery, and easy tracking features, and it rolls past a lot of the pack.

A good commuter ebike, while heavy, should feel rigid and tough enough to take city-wide abuse, and that's one place where Aventon, with its dual-wall aluminum frame design around the battery, excels. The large step-through model feels as solid as a motor scooter when you lift it off its kickstand, and it doesn't flex at all when my 210-pound, 6'2” frame takes the saddle.

One thing I love about Aventon is that the brand's engineers clearly pay attention to what cyclists actually use on their bikes: The Level 3 has built-in fenders, lights (including rear turn signals) and shocks up front and in the seat post. You get a robust but oddly sleek-looking rear rack to strap things like saddle bags or a milk carton to. The included pedals have studs that make them grip your feet a bit better than the flat pedals that come with most ebikes.

A color screen in the middle of the handlebars tells you your range, current power setting, but oddly not the time—something that Aventon's spokesperson says might be added in the future with a software update (it's there on the smaller screen on other bikes it makes).

All of this makes for a very easy “get on, ride” experience. Beyond adjusting how high the seat is, there really isn't too much to do but strap on a helmet, check the tire pressures, and hit the road.

I love step-through ebike frames, not just because it allows my much-shorter wife to borrow the bike when she's wearing a skirt, but also because when a bike is this heavy (67 lbs), it makes it much easier to balance and hop on and off of. I never felt sketchy hitting an intersection or trying to keep my bike upright when I had a saddle bag full of groceries.

The gearing and drivetrain is entry-level Shimano Altus stuff and includes an 8-speed trigger-controlled transmission. It also comes with decent Kenda tires that provide plenty of grip, even on slippery Portland roads.

There is a built-in 4G connection that allows you to GPS track the bike—nice for thefts and also in case you, like me, forget where you parked your bike at the Portland Timbers game. The 500W motor was more than powerful enough to get me over hills, even with gear or food in tow.

Even for my large, 210-pound body, the range proved more than enough for long commuting rides. I took it over 20 miles across town in a single session, over big hills, and still ended at my destination with over 20 percent battery. If I hadn't ran the bike at full speed the entire way, and had pedaled more on the flats instead of using the thumb throttle, I would easily have made it with half my battery left.

Most folks aren't riding 40 miles a day on their ebikes. They're just riding a few, and this bike is more than capable of doing that. The included charging brick easily charges the bike in a few hours, you will only really need to charge once a week if you're doing a shorter commute or just riding a bit around town.

There aren't a lot of downsides to this model, but the main one is the gearing. I just wish that the top gear allowed me to keep up with the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit on the motor with more ease; I sometimes felt like I was pedaling like a crazed hamster when trying to go max speed.

At lower speeds and assistance rates, the gearing works just fine, so you're better off riding slower when you want to pedal, and using the thumb throttle to go full speed. I generally prefer mid-drive ebikes for this reason; they use the actual drivetrain of your bike to deliver the power, rather than a motor on the hub of the rear wheel, so things pair better together. That said, it's nice to have the option of a thumb throttle when you're feeling lazy and just want a glorified electric scooter to take you home, which isn't offered by mid-drive ebikes.

For daily commuting, trips to the farmers market, and occasional long weekend rides, the Aventon Level 3 is a great choice. The price is right, the specs are solid, and it's a confidence-inducing ride that has every feature most folks will need. Just snag a good helmet and a solid bike lock. These bikes look more expensive than they are.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How the Farm Industry Spied on Animal Rights Activists and Pushed the FBI to Treat Them as Terrorists","https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-wmdd-dxe-animal-agriculture-alliance/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 16:21:20 GMT","

Hundreds of emails and internal documents reviewed by WIRED reveal top lobbyists and representatives of America's agricultural industry led a persistent and often covert campaign to surveil, discredit, and suppress animal rights organizations for nearly a decade, while relying on corporate spies to infiltrate meetings and functionally serve as an informant for the FBI.

The documents, mostly obtained through public records requests by the nonprofit Property of the People, detail a secretive and long-running collaboration between the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate (WMDD)—whose scope today includes Palestinian rights activists and the recent wave of arson targeting Teslas—and the Animal Agriculture Alliance (AAA), a nonprofit trade group representing the interests of US farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, and others across America's food supply chain.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

Since at least 2018, documents show, the AAA has been supplying federal agents with intelligence on the activities of animal rights groups such as Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), with records of emails and meetings reflecting the industry's broader mission to convince authorities that activists are the preeminent “bioterrorism” threat to the United States. Spies working for the AAA during its collaboration with the FBI went undercover at activism meetings, obtaining photographs, audio recordings, and other strategic material. The group's ties with law enforcement were leveraged to help shield industry actors from public scrutiny, to press for investigations into its most powerful critics, and to reframe the purpose and efforts of animal rights protesters as a singular national security threat.

The records further show that state authorities have cited protests as a reason to conceal information about disease outbreaks at factory farms from the public.

Zoe Rosenberg, a UC Berkeley student and animal cruelty investigator at DxE, says she's hardly surprised that powerful private-sector groups are working to surveil the organization, but she finds their work with the police paradoxical. “If anyone should have the ear of law enforcement, it's animal cruelty investigators exposing rampant violations of the law leading to real animals suffering and dying horrific deaths,” she tells WIRED.

Profiled by WIRED in 2019, DxE is a grassroots animal rights organization dedicated to nonviolent direct actions, including covert operations that often involve rescuing animals and documenting practices at factory farms that the group considers inhumane.

Rosenberg, 22, is facing charges in California for removing four chickens from a slaughterhouse in Sonoma County in 2023. In addition to minor charges such as trespassing, she was also hit with a felony count of conspiracy to commit those misdemeanors—a discretionary charge that Sonoma County's prosecutor justified by portraying Rosenberg as a “biosecurity risk” in light of avian flu.

According to Rosenberg, DxE relies on biosecurity protocols that go “above and beyond” industry standards, including quarantining its investigators from birds for a full week before and after entering farms. “All of our investigators before entering a facility shower with hot water and soap and put on freshly washed clothes that have been washed thoroughly and dried on high heat to kill viruses and bacteria,” she says. “Everything is sanitized and then sanitized again upon leaving the facility.”

Rosenberg does not deny removing the chickens, which she named Poppy, Aster, Ivy, and Azalea. “Generally, if we feel an animal is going to die from neglect or maltreatment if we don't remove them from the facility, then we feel that it is justified and necessary to step in to save their life,” she says. Her attorney, Chris Carraway, says that DxE tried reporting allegations of health violations at the facility to “the point of futility.” Rosenberg says reporting alleged violations often leads to getting bounced between offices; a “never-ending loop of no one agency wanting to take responsibility and enforce animal welfare laws.”

The birds Rosenberg removed, she says, were all smaller and weaker than their flockmates, showing signs of what she believed to be infection and dehydration, along with open wounds and other visible injuries. Under veterinary care, Rosenberg says, Poppy was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, while Aster's feet were found to be “full of pus.” Each of the birds had contracted coccidiosis, she says, referring to a parasite that causes diarrhea, inflammation, and bleeding.

To gather intelligence on DxE, records show, the Animal Agriculture Alliance has surveilled the group for years. Confidential documents obtained separately by WIRED reveal undercover operators for the AAA embedded within the animal rights group and fed the trade organization daily reports about protests and meetings, as well as photographs, audio recordings, and other documentation.

During a November 2018 meeting, AAA board members discussed attending DxE events to develop “protective information,” adding they were already in contact with a “security company” that had previously attended DxE's training. At a manager's meeting the following April, the group disclosed that it wanted to “hire someone” to attend a DxE conference in Berkeley, California. Minutes from that meeting show the “total price would be about $4,500.” A confidential report, authored several months later by an undercover on assignment from private intelligence firm Afimac Global, reveals the results of the operation. (Another confidential report—not attributed to a specific intelligence firm—shows the AAA would again infiltrate a DxE conference in 2021. The report identifies members of DxE and other attendees, including Rosenberg, and describes interviews with activists and observations about their protest activities.)

Afimac did not respond to a request for comment.

At a regulatory conference in early 2018, the AAA had delivered a talk on “Bioterrorism and activist groups.” Internal AAA documents show that, within a few months, the FBI contacted AAA with a request. “They reached out to us a few weeks ago and asked for records of activist incidents on farms,” say notes from a meeting that May. At the same meeting, members discussed their difficulty getting prosecutors to charge activists with crimes, with one industry representative saying the issue was their lack of legal standing.

The rep suggested calling on law enforcement to deploy “terrorism” charges instead—as one national pork producer had reportedly considered. The AAA had already “been in contact with the FBI about this situation,” the notes claim.

In an email to WIRED, AAA spokesperson Emily Ellis denied the organization has a formal relationship with the FBI. “In the course of our work to support a secure food system, we have occasionally communicated with authorities to flag concerns where there is a potential risk to people, animals, or critical infrastructure.” The nonprofit declined to answer questions about its hiring of undercovers and did not respond when asked whether it had any specific evidence showing activists have caused outbreaks.

“The Alliance cannot speak to how law enforcement officials choose to communicate or act on information,” Ellis wrote. “We do not direct the actions of any government agency, and we categorically reject the suggestion that the Alliance instructs or influences the FBI or any such organization.”

Records show that in the spring of 2019, the AAA moved to establish a firmer connection with the FBI. In an email to the bureau that May, the group's then-president and CEO, Kay Johnson Smith, noted having met with Stephen Goldsmith, a veterinarian at the FBI's WMDD, a month earlier at a conference aimed at strengthening ties between the government and agriculture sector. The email goes on to remind Goldsmith of her presentation at the event concerning DxE; an “extremist group,” she wrote, “that has executed several mass protests on farms, in retail stores and in restaurants.” Smith then called on the WMDD to help the AAA share information about DxE “with law enforcement officials nationwide,” claiming the group is planning an “extremist campaign.”

Smith passed along an alert about an upcoming DxE protest, a march from a local police station to a nearby grocery store, asking if the FBI would connect the group “with law enforcement officials nationwide.” Goldsmith forwarded the alert to another FBI official who forwarded it along to several more, before it eventually reached a counterterrorism center in Washington and a federal investigator with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The WMDD issued an intelligence memo roughly three months later titled “Animal Rights Extremists Likely Increase the Spread of Virulent Newcastle Disease [vND] in California,” citing with “high confidence” claims that violent extremists were “likely” to “spread vND”—a highly contagious and often fatal disease that affects birds—“in the near term” by neglecting biosafety procedures. The FBI highlighted two instances in which it claimed there was “no evidence” of activists following proper protocols.”

Analysts at the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC), a multi-agency hub that supports law enforcement, soon threw cold water on the FBI's claims. “Animal rights activists are probably not responsible for any of the identified vND incidents” in the state, the NCRIC said less than four months later, citing federal scientific research. The agency further noted that despite law enforcement's claims that DxE “almost certainly” violated biosecurity protocols, police reports showed activists had taken “biosecurity precautions to prevent contamination or spread of disease.”

If the activists were to engage in criminal activity, the NCRIC decided, the crimes were likely to be “non-violent” and “low level.”

That same fall, Goldsmith's chemical-biological countermeasure unit within the WMDD quietly circulated a presentation to state law enforcement officials pointing to “unsubstantiated reports” that PETA, the animal rights nonprofit, had played some sort of role in the 2015 avian flu outbreak—allegedly collecting “contaminated carcasses” in an effort to spread the virus. Goldsmith had already previously dismissed a similar claim while working for the same unit four years prior. (A trade publication paraphrased the FBI official in 2015 telling a crowd “there is no evidence of that actually happening.”)

Goldsmith did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment about any specific groups but noted it frequently shares information with members of the private sector. “Our goal is to protect our communities from unlawful activity while at the same time upholding the Constitution,” the agency said in an emailed statement. “The FBI focuses on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. The FBI can never open an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity.”

By the end of 2019, the Animal Agriculture Alliance was relying heavily on “bioterrorism” claims to justify further calls for law enforcement intervention. To gain the attention of local police in California and the state's Rural Crimes Task Force, the AAA contacted Michael Payne, an outreach coordinator at the Western Institute for Food Safety and Security at UC Davis. One of its members, they said, had heard from an unidentified trucker who was growing increasingly frustrated with animal rights activists. And the driver's concerns extended to “bioterrorism.”

The activists were taking photos of the driver's truck, the AAA said, and “feeding his pigs grapes.”

Payne had previously attended a presentation by the AAA on “dealing with animal rights activists,” according to emails between them. He'd later invited the AAA to collaborate on a range of dairy-farm proposals in California, alongside multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.

Neither Payne nor UC Davis responded to requests for comment. Nor did the California Rural Crime Prevention Task Force. Attempts to reach Payne by phone were unsuccessful.

Months after the FBI circulated its now-disputed assessment of activists spreading the virulent Newcastle disease, Payne issued a memo under the rural taskforce's letterhead encouraging his “FBI colleagues” to read an article translated and amplified by a Beijing-based podcast host. The article concerns Chinese “swine stir-fry syndicates” purportedly using drones to spread African swine flu in an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of pork.

Payne suggests weaponizing the allegations to achieve specific policy goals here in the US, such as allowing farmers to declare livestock facilities “no fly zones.” “Combined with the assessment from the FBI indicating activist trespass is a real and present biosecurity threat,” he writes, the Chinese pig-gang claims hand the industry “ammunition” to ensure sheriffs do a “proper job” when responding to complaints.

Significantly, the podcast host (whose blog was shared by Payne) openly rejected the pig-gang allegations, drawing attention to the Chinese government's ownership of the news outlet that originally reported the story, as well as counter-reporting by a “respected” independent outlet.

Payne's email notes that he forwarded the article to a slew of local sheriffs' departments, as well as the state's WMDD office, “which in turn passed it on to FBI HQ ‘for their situational awareness.'”

Information gathered on DxE's activities by the AAA was widely disseminated to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies around the US, as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In a February 2021 email, the group provided the WMDD office information on three events that DxE and other activist groups had planned, including a Zoom class and a vigil at a pork processing plant for Regan Russell, an activist killed in 2020 by a livestock transport truck outside an Ontario slaughterhouse.

Goldsmith circulated the AAA's tips to several FBI agents, as well as a supervising special inspector in the animal health branch of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Several federal agencies and at least 27 state and local police departments received the email. At least 10 agricultural trade groups and lobbyists were copied.

Ryan Shapiro, executive director at Property of the People, says the hundreds of records amassed by his organization offer an unprecedented look at how Big Ag lobbyists allegedly vied to conceal incidents of animal cruelty and disease and targeted law enforcement agencies specifically for capture. “This is a shameless assault on civil liberties, human health, and basic decency,” he says.

“There's an inherent relationship between cruelty and disease on factory farms,” says Shapiro, whose MIT doctoral dissertation explored the intersections of national security and controversies over animals. “When you have that many animals packed in so tightly they can't stand up, can't turn around, can't spread their limbs, and are pressed up against each other in their own filth, in their own sickness, of course disease is going to be rampant.”

The furor over DxE's activism within the animal agriculture industry reached a fever pitch two months later with the launch of Project Counterglow, an online interactive map of more than 27,500 farms and animal-ag facilities drawn from public regulatory and business records, reporting by individual activists, and artificial intelligence that scanned satellite imagery to reveal previously unknown facilities.

Citing Project Counterglow the following month, the Food Protection and Defense Institute, a university-based consortium working alongside the Department of Homeland Security, disclosed in a memo that the FBI and AAA had jointly “profiled the current risk environment” at an industry-government coordinating event within days of the map's launch. According to the memo, the FBI was in the process of supplying the AAA with a list of WMDD coordinators with whom members were encouraged to share knowledge about activists.

The FBI would eventually provide the group with a dedicated inbox to inform on DxE and other animal rights groups. In a 2023 email, the alliance reminded members to report “animal rights activity” directly to the FBI using the group's own “Activist Activity Notification Form” and the email address NF_ARVE_INTAKE@fbi.gov.

The Food Protection and Defense Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

Preventing animal rights activists from learning about outbreaks has at times taken priority over notifying the public about them.

Emails from 2023 show officials at the USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture discussing how best to delay news about a highly pathogenic avian flu detected at two Sonoma County farms; a state official having previously warned that “protesters” were likely to be in the area. The solution, put forth by a USDA official, was to simply not enter the information into the state's emergency management response system, delaying the alert for at least another three days.

“Much longer than that and it raises too many questions,” they said.

At least a quarter of a million birds were culled around the same time as the emails. And a year later, the CDFA released a report that pointed the finger at the protesters, alleging it was “plausible” they may have spread the virus.

Steve Lyle, a CDFA spokesperson, says the possibility of people showing up to a farm without proper biosecurity training always raises concerns about virus spread. “In any animal disease incident, more movement of people and equipment brings a greater risk of spread,” he says.

A “crisis response plan” crafted by Washington State livestock and agricultural groups, obtained through a public records request, notes that the federal government's policy is “to assume that any animal disease outbreak or large-scale food contamination incident is an intentional act until proven otherwise.”

When rumors about cattle being poisoned or intentionally infected with a virus began circulating around the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and other agencies, the claims were put to rest by the head of an field dairy investigative unit out of Washington State University, whose team had discovered a “serious outbreak” among several herds of yearling cattle.

The investigator noted that while a cattle owner was convinced the outbreak was “sabotage from animal rights activists,” other probable sources were clearly present. The investigator said his team had “spent a lot of time trying to convince [the ranchers] that the disease outbreak most likely had nothing to do with bioterrorism, and is most likely due to husbandry and management issues which we laid out very clearly for them.”

But ranchers, he said, seemed to “prefer to follow conspiracy.” After reading this, a WSDA official told others in the email chain to “keep this information private and not forward [it] on.”

Pressed by a reporter in 2021 as to why the WSDA kept no tally of livestock in the state, officials noted internally that, while the short answer was it's never been directed to, “privacy is very important to producers, especially with ongoing threats associated with agro-terrorism and activist groups.”

The AAA, meanwhile, has worked for years to keep its communications with the government secret from the public, moving documents subject to public records requests behind a “password protected link” in 2018, records show. That same year, it joined a coalition of food industry groups in filing an amicus brief with the US Supreme Court aimed at limiting public access to corporate records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)—expressing enthusiasm at the time that the court's conservative majority would back its play. “Animal activist groups routinely use FOIA to obtain confidential information submitted to the government,” a meeting agenda from the time reads.

The case, ultimately decided in the food industry's favor, redefined the meaning of “confidential” under FOIA to include information that the industry itself decided should be private.

In October 2024, Goldsmith attempted to intercede against a state-level records request by Property of the People, incorrectly informing the Washington State Department of Agriculture that the requester—Shapiro—was a member of a known criminal group.

Records later obtained by Shapiro under the state's public records act show Goldsmith telling the WSDA that the “timing” of his request was suspicious because it coincided with a recent bird flu outbreak. That outbreak occurred in an “unusual location in the building,” he said, and did not match the virus's “expected epidemiological pattern.” While stressing that there'd been a report of a simultaneous outbreak at another farm owned by the same company, Goldsmith also cited the AAA in his email as an organization monitoring “animal rights violent extremists.”

“Transparency is not terrorism,” says Shapiro, “and the FBI should not be taking marching orders from industry flacks.”

WSDA officials, while correcting Goldsmith's allegation that Shapiro is a member of a criminal group, advised the FBI not to mention the infected farm by name, providing Goldsmith and other FBI officials with a code word in case their communications were discovered through a public records request. A WSDA spokesperson tells WIRED that it is customary to do so when a farm is placed under quarantine, “to protect the identity of the operation, consistent with confidentiality provisions.” The FBI was later waived off by the WSDA entirely in an email emphasizing that the two cases Goldsmith thought potentially connected were “completely unrelated.”

“WSDA responded to the inquiry,” a spokesperson tells WIRED, adding that the strains of disease at the two locations were “genetically different” and “did not raise concerns.”

Indian grocery delivery startup KiranaPro has been hacked and all its data has been wiped, the company's founder confirmed to TechCrunch.

The destroyed data included the company's app code and its servers containing banks of sensitive customer information, including their names, mailing addresses, and payment details, KiranaPro co-founder and CEO Deepak Ravindran told TechCrunch.

The company's app is online but cannot process orders, TechCrunch has found.

Launched in December 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government's Open Network for Digital Commerce, allowing customers to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets.

KiranaPro has 55,000 customers, with 30,000-35,000 active buyers across 50 cities, who collectively place 2,000 orders daily, according to the company. Unlike a typical grocery delivery app, KiranaPro offers a voice-based interface that allows users to place orders from local shops using voice commands in languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, and English.

The startup planned to expand to 100 cities in the next 100 days before the incident happened, Ravindran said.

On May 26, KiranaPro executives became aware of the incident while logging into their Amazon Web Services account. Hackers had gained access to KiranaPro's root accounts on AWS and GitHub, Ravindran told TechCrunch.

Ravindran shared a couple of screenshots of the GitHub security logs and a file containing a sample of activity logs around the time of the incident, suggesting that the hacking happened after someone gained access to their systems via a former employee's account.

KiranaPro's chief technology officer Saurav Kumar told TechCrunch that the hack happened around May 24-25.

The startup said it used Google Authenticator for multi-factor authentication on its AWS account. Kumar told TechCrunch that the multi-factor code had changed when they tried to log into their AWS account last week, and all their Electric Compute Cloud (EC2) services, which let clients access virtual computers to run their applications, were deleted.

“We can only log in through the IAM [Identity and Access Management] account, through which we can see that the EC2 instances don't exist anymore, but we are not able to get any logs or anything because we don't have the root account,” he said.

KiranaPro has reached out to GitHub's support team to help identify the hacker's IP addresses and other traces of the incident, said Ravindran.

Similarly, Ravindran told TechCrunch that the startup is filing cases against its former employees, who he said had not submitted their credentials for accessing their GitHub accounts to check their logs.

It is unclear how the attack happened. Some of the biggest cyberattacks in recent years, such as LastPass, Change Healthcare, and Snowflake, were caused by credential theft, such as through password-stealing malware installed on an employee's laptop, and missing or unenforced multi-factor authentication. 

The companies were ultimately responsible for enforcing the security of their own systems, including whether their employees must use multi-factor authentication, and terminating accounts of former employees who no longer work at their company.

KiranaPro counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and BCG MD Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. The company has a team of 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala.

As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, an entirely new design inspired by the Vision Pro, and more.  

Here's a roundup of the most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Apple plans to rename its operating systems to reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple's entire ecosystem with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience.

Apple is also rumored to be releasing a gaming app that will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store's game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends.

Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake.

Apple could improve iPhone battery health with AI-powered battery management. This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged.

Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone.

One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The company stated in March that the new features are delayed. 

While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions.

Android users can now download Photoshop for mobile. Adobe announced on Tuesday that it's releasing the beta version of its Android Photoshop app, four months after the company launched its iPhone app.

The app offers a similar set of editing tools as the desktop version, including layering and masking, but is optimized for mobile screens. During the initial beta period, users will be able to access the app's features for free.

These features include the ability to combine and blend images using tools like selections, layers, and masks. Users can also use AI features like “Generative Fill” to add or transform elements. Parts of images can be quickly removed or replaced using the “Tap Select” tool, and users get access to a library of free Adobe Stock assets, as well as control layers and effects with blend modes and adjustment layers.

Users can also get rid of distractions with the “Spot Healing Brush” and refine images with the “Remove” and “Clone Stamp tools.” “Object Select” and “Magic Wand” features allow users to make more precise selections.

Adobe said it plans to bring additional capabilities to the app soon. 

By bringing Photoshop to mobile, Adobe is looking to attract new users, especially younger ones who are used to using their phones for creative purposes. As for people who already use Photoshop, Adobe says the mobile app makes the service more accessible for those who prefer to work on their phones.

Photoshop on Android (beta) is now available for devices running Android 11 or later, with a minimum of 6GB of RAM. Adobe notes that 8GB or more is recommended for optimal performance.

Unlike the Android app, the iPhone app launched with both free and paid features. Photoshop for iPhone also integrates with Photoshop on the web, for a fee. It's unknown when Adobe plans to bring this capability to the Android app.

TikTok announced on Tuesday that it's officially launching TikTok for Artists, a new music insights platform that is designed to help artists build their careers. The official launch comes two months after TikTok was spotted testing the platform in select countries. 

The tool is built to help artists and their teams better connect with fans, improve their promotional efforts, and inform content creation on TikTok. The platform gives artists, their labels, and their teams access to data about the performance of the artist's music and posts and TikTok. 

These metrics include the number of views, posts, and creator engagements per song, along with similar insights into post performance. Other insights include information about an artist's followers, such as their age, language, and gender.

TikTok for Artists also includes step-by-step guides to TikTok's tools and features, and additional support and resources, the company says.

In addition, TikTok announced that it's launching a new “Pre-Release” tool that allows artists to promote upcoming album releases on TikTok. The feature lets fans pre-save albums directly to their Spotify or Apple Music library, where they will become instantly available to listen to upon release.

TikTok plays a big part in driving music trends and viral songs, so it makes sense for the company to introduce a dedicated space to help artists better promote their content and drive fan engagement. TikTok for Artists could help artists expand their reach and grow their audience.

It's worth noting that the launch of TikTok for Artists comes eight months after ByteDance decided to shut down TikTok Music, a music-streaming service that was being tested in a handful of countries. At the time, the company said it decided to retire the service in order to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok's role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services.”

The events of the past year show that TikTok is no longer trying to compete with services like Spotify and Apple Music, and is instead going to focus on being a platform for music discovery and promotion.

TikTok for Artists is now available in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Morocco, United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. The platform will be rolling out in other countries soon, TikTok says.

Is there anything the user could do to modify the next steps, other than picking a word? Perhaps selecting some sort of valence related to metaphor or meaning? ""I want to pick 'pacify', but in the sense of calming down, not to utterly destroy.""

On a shorter horizon, I can tune the probability that on-path terms appear in the cloud. We store a larger pool of words than are displayed, and calculate lookaheads (and lookbacks from the target).

I'll also use this post to wish that more people would edit Wiktionary. It has such a good mission (information on all words) and yet there are only like 80 people editing on any given day or whatever. In some languages, it's even the best or most updated dictionary available. The barriers to entry and bureaucracy are really not high for HN audience types.

From the OP: ""This research and computational scale was made possible by $295k NSF SBIR seed funding (#2329817) and $150k Microsoft Azure compute resources."" Does that NSF funding mean it's open source? Also, I'm not 100% sure that the quote applies to all the research rather than just one component of it.> I'll also use this post to wish that more people would edit Wiktionary. It has such a good mission (information on all words) ...I support open source, contribute to it, and love the spirit of Wiktionary, I don't understand the practical reality of applying 'wisdom of the crowds' to a dictionary, especially the English edition, for two reasons:Definitions are highly accurate (complete, correct, consistent), highly precise things - otherwise, what is their value? Assuming Wiktionary is descriptive - reporting the words' actual usage - it takes quite a bit of scholarship, skill, and editorial resources not to mislead people. I can't just write what I think it means - the meaning to me might not match the meaning to the person at the next desk. It takes quite a bit of research, using powerful (and sometimes expensive) tools, and understanding of lexicography to be complete and also precisely correct, including usages in places and times that are mostly unknown to any particular author. Also, writing definitions is tricky: You are using words - which have those aformentioned problems with meaning - to define words. Also, any writing anywhere can be easily misinterpreted - skill and editors are needed to avoid misunderstanding. How is the accuracy and precision problem solved?Also, in English there are already many authoritative sources, many with a century of profesional lexicography behind them by the best in the business. Some are free. There are also meta-lookup engines such as Wordnik and OneLook. Why use Wiktionary? The few times I've compared definitions or etymologies, the authoritative sources almost always exceed or equal Wiktionary (though online copies of older print editions suffer from the minimalism caused by the constraint of printing costs). Arguably, there is nothing else both unabridged and free: Oxford unabridged costs $, so does Merriam-Webster (the free edition is abridged); American Heritage is free, but has the minimalism issue I mentioned above.

Years ago, I wrote a puzzlehunt puzzle that involved navigating through words where an edge existed if the two words formed a common 2-gram (that is, they often appeared one after another in a text dump of Wikipedia).For example, a fragment of the graph from the puzzle is: mit -> press -> office <- post <- blog.This work is obviously much more advanced, and it's very cool to see that they managed to make it work with semantic connections. I was able to get away with a much simpler approach since I only cared about 2-grams over a set of about 1000 words (I literally used a grep command over the entire text of the English wikipedia; it took about a day to run).But the core idea is shared: 1) wanting to build a graph representation of word connections for a puzzle, 2) it being way to much work to do that manually, 3) you would miss a bunch of edges if you did do it manually, so 4) use programming tools to construct a dataset, and then 5) the end result is surprisingly fun for the user because the dataset is comprehensive and it feels really natural.If anyone is curious, the puzzlehunt puzzle is here: https://dhashe.com/files/puzzles/word-wide-web.pdfAnd the solution is here: https://dhashe.com/files/puzzles/word-wide-web-sol.pdfAnd a fair warning to anyone unfamiliar with puzzlehunt puzzles: they do not come with instructions and it is very common to get stuck when solving them, especially when solving them alone. You have not completely solved a puzzlehunt puzzle until you extract an answer word or phrase  from the puzzle. This one has an extra layer after filling in the words in the graph.

You could either store the word graph as a partitioned set of S3 buckets, or have a back-end that serves individual words and does rate-limiting. I guess that the back-end might be better to avoid surprise egress charges from anyone trying to download the entire dataset.I want to try out the game but I'm discouraged by the download size.

We use the top google Ngrams in 2 ways. (a) we share it in the reference mode of our app, i.e. common words before or after; (b) we use longer N-grams, where possible, like a 4-gram, to choose literary examples that also show a common pattern.

Seriously, when is the last time a casual speaker, writer, or translator used “domicile” in place of “house” in your world? It's an archaic term appropriated into legal jargon. Flattening out  language and drawing lines between terms is funny to me.The only issue is normalizing “Thesaurus bashing” type mentalities - like this - to degrade the value of coherent, purposeful, meaningful use of English. It's an amalgamation language with extremely difficult fluency. It's rife with idioms and contradictory emotional context.Oh well, I can grasp that I tend to yell at clouds when it comes to this sort of thing. It doesn't change my opinion this is a harmful exercise and probably should not exist. There are few instances where playing a game will actually make one more stupid, but here we are.

Takeaways from our data-driven story on how and why Big Tech is aiming to reshape our energy grids around artificial intelligence.

After working on it for months, my colleague Casey Crownhart and I finally saw our story on AI's energy and emissions burden go live last week. 

The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used each time we interact with a chatbot, and then tally that up to understand why everyone from leaders of AI companies to officials at the White House wants to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process. 

It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI's energy appetite is full of holes. I encourage you to read the full story, which has some incredible graphics to help you understand everything from the energy used in a single query right up to what AI will require just three years from now (enough electricity to power 22% of US households, it turns out). But here are three takeaways I have after the project. 

We focused on measuring the energy requirements that go into using a chatbot, generating an image, and creating a video with AI. But these three uses are relatively small-scale compared with where AI is headed next. 

Lots of AI companies are building reasoning models, which “think” for longer and use more energy. They're building hardware devices, perhaps like the one Jony Ive has been working on (which OpenAI just acquired for $6.5 billion), that have AI constantly humming along in the background of our conversations. They're designing agents and digital clones of us to act on our behalf. All these trends point to a more energy-intensive future (which, again, helps explain why OpenAI and others are spending such inconceivable amounts of money on energy). 

But the fact that AI is in its infancy raises another point. The models, chips, and cooling methods behind this AI revolution could all grow more efficient over time, as my colleague Will Douglas Heaven explains. This future isn't predetermined.

The AI race is transforming northwestern Nevada into one of the world's largest data-center markets—and sparking fears of water strains in the nation's driest state.

When we tested the energy demands of various models, we found the energy required to produce even a low-quality, five-second video to be pretty shocking: It was 42,000 times more than the amount needed for a chatbot answer a question about a recipe, and enough to power a microwave for over an hour. If there's one type of AI whose energy appetite should worry you, it's this one. 

Soon after we published, Google debuted the latest iteration of its Veo model. People quickly created compilations of the most impressive clips (this one being the most shocking to me). Something we point out in the story is that Google (as well as OpenAI, which has its own video generator, Sora) denied our request for specific numbers on the energy their AI models use. Nonetheless, our reporting suggests it's very likely that high-definition video models like Veo and Sora are much larger, and much more energy-demanding, than the models we tested. 

I think the key to whether the use of AI video will produce indefensible clouds of emissions in the near future will be how it's used, and how it's priced. The example I linked shows a bunch of TikTok-style content, and I predict that if creating AI video is cheap enough, social video sites will be inundated with this type of content. 

We expected that a lot of readers would understandably think about this story in terms of their own individual footprint, wondering whether their AI usage is contributing to the climate crisis. Don't panic: It's likely that asking a chatbot for help with a travel plan does not meaningfully increase your carbon footprint. Video generation might. But after reporting on this for months, I think there are more important questions.

Consider, for example, the water being drained from aquifers in Nevada, the country's driest state, to power data centers that are drawn to the area by tax incentives and easy permitting processes, as detailed in an incredible story by James Temple. Or look at how Meta's largest data center project, in Louisiana, is relying on natural gas despite industry promises to use clean energy, per a story by David Rotman. Or the fact that nuclear energy is not the silver bullet that AI companies often make it out to be. 

There are global forces shaping how much energy AI companies are able to access and what types of sources will provide it. There is also very little transparency from leading AI companies on their current and future energy demands, even while they're asking for public support for these plans. Pondering your individual footprint can be a good thing to do, provided you remember that it's not so much your footprint as these other factors that are keeping climate researchers and energy experts we spoke to up at night.

The resurgence of the big-ticket romcom is well and truly under way amidst the wax and wane of the box office spectacle we usually cover here at io9. But sometimes a little movie magic comes along and makes even the most simple of meet-cute premises something surreal and mind bending–and that's definitely the case in Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie‘s new movie, Big Bold Beautiful Journey.

Directed by Kogonda, Big Bold Beautiful Journey follows two strangers, Sarah and David, who cross paths at a mutual friend's wedding. Moving on from their brief connection, they suddenly find themselves thrust back into each other's lives when the GPS system in David's car suddenly gets a bit 2001: A Space Odyssey and asks David if, well, he wants to go on a big, bold, beautiful journey.

But this isn't a more whimsical Her situation going on here–a suddenly sentient car system is the least surreal thing David and Sarah find themselves facing, when they find a magical doorway that lets them journey through time and space, and into pockets of their own histories alongside each other.

It's certainly makes for a trippy visual, and a fascinating way for Sarah and David's blossoming relationship to unfold as their histories, and all the joy and grief that comes with discovering someone's past, begin to replay out in front of them. That gag about the car exploding at the end being a bit too dramatic for two people who've just fallen through a gateway in time and space to play out the love story of a life-times is pretty good, too.

Big Bold Beautiful Journey hits theaters September 19.

I have played a lot—believe me when I say an ungodly amount—of Mario Kart in my life. I'm certain it would tally up to thousands of hours in total, spanning every version of the kart racer since the original Super Mario Kart released on SNES up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch. Despite having so much digital karting experience, I hardly consider myself an elite player who takes home first place every time, and yet I keep returning to get red-shelled over and over again for a simple reason: Mario Kart is pure, unpredictable fun. The new Mario Kart World for Switch 2 is no different.

Nintendo invited Gizmodo to play with the Switch 2 and Mario Kart World for nearly eight hours last week. Though it was an all-day affair, we only scratched the surface of what Mario Kart World offers. The launch game is familiar enough that anybody can dive right in and start lobbing items at opponents, but still packed with enough new stuff like a free roam mode that lets you explore a world map, 24-player races (up from 12), GameChat mode with support for video and voice chat using a Nintendo Switch 2 camera (or third-party webcam), and more.

To be clear: this is not a review of Mario Kart World. We'll have one when we've spent enough time playing the game and its many different modes and GameChat functionality. This is more of an extended first impressions.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Walmart

See Switch 2+ Mario Kart World Bundle at Walmart

When you've played every single Mario Kart game like I have, you might be thinking again? Surely, Nintendo has run out of ideas for the series, right? Not at all. Mario Kart World really highlights what the kart racer is about and how it has endured the test of time without getting stale. At its core, the gameplay hasn't changed—you select a Nintendo character, pick a kart or bike, and race against opponents in modes such as Grand Prix, versus, or battle mode.

The joy of Mario Kart is in how unpredictable and chaotic it gets. A single item like a blue shell that rips through the course to stun the person in first place or the Super Star that lets you become temporarily invincible to knock out opponents can take you from last to top three even when it feels like you're gonna lose. It's this mix of skill (driving, drifting, and now rail grinding) and strategic use of items that makes the series so accessible. Like previous entries, playing Mario Kart World brings you highs and lows and every emotion in between.

In Mario Kart World, Nintendo has dialed everything to eleven. Doubling the number of racers from 12 to 24 adds a new frenetic madness to the races. I love the redesigned Nintendo characters and their many outfits and vehicles to unlock. In particular, I have a soft spot for some of the '80s-inspired apparel and vehicles—there's one bike that looks like an old Sony boombox. And, of course, I just love that Nintendo added Cow (from the Moo Moo Meadows track) as a playable character. I have no doubt it's going to become an internet meme sensation.

In free roam mode, the world map feels alive thanks to ample amounts of NPC racers, and items and food (for redeeming new outfits) you can collect. While the Grand Prix brings all-new cups consisting of four races, and Battle Mode (Balloon Battle and Coin Runners), VS Races, and Time Trials all make a return, the new Knockout Tour mode is by far my favorite. As its name suggests, the mode is an elimination-style race with 24 racers, where the slowest racers are booted throughout various checkpoints—it's so intense and will have you shouting profanities at your TV even if you're mild-mannered. Also new is the ability to rail grind on various obstacles. It's not quite as easy to pull off—not at all like grinding in a Tony Hawk Pro Skater game—but timed right, it could help you edge out an opponent or dodge an incoming item.

We got to try several of the GameChat modes, including using the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera to show our faces during a four-player local co-op race. As my colleague Kyle Bar noted in his hands-on, the camera's image quality, despite being 1080p resolution, leaves a lot to be desired. In this co-op play of Mario Kart World, I was hoping the camera would be able to keep track of our faces the entire race, but it sometimes struggled to keep them in frame. It's nice to be able to gloat and flash a smug smile after winning a race or taking someone out with a carefully timed item without having to look over at them mid-game, but I'd hardly call it game-changing. Similarly, I'm not certain how well voice chat works. When placed in the dock, GameChat uses the microphones inside of the Switch 2, which does apply some noise reduction on background noises in your room to amplify your voice. But even in Nintendo's controlled demo, I found it slightly difficult to hear players “on the other side” clearly. Maybe this feature works better at home or with a pair of connected headphones, though.

There isn't much to complain about Mario Kart World—it's the perfect launch game for the Switch 2. The price of the game has been sparking controversy—it's $80 for the digital version, $90 for a physical game card, and $50 if you're lucky enough to snag it in the Mario Kart World Switch 2 bundle for $500—but there's so much content that I think the price is justified. I already know I'll be putting hundreds of hours into Mario Kart World, and Nintendo hasn't even announced any DLC for it. If there's one game that's a must-pickup for the Switch 2, it's definitely Mario Kart World—it's everything that makes a Nintendo game a Nintendo game.

When it comes to city-living, there's a number of ways you can get around. You've got the subways, maybe call an Uber or a cab, or perhaps even get yourself a bike. There's always walking, but that can take forever. The best option that's often forgotten is staring right in front of you—an electric scooter. Cruise around town like six times as fast as you can walk with the HiBoy electric scooter. Right now, Best Buy has it for $200 off (-40%). That brings it down from its usual price of $500 to just $300 for a limited time.

See at Best Buy

Perfect for city life, you can commute to and from work on the HiBoy electric scooter. You can cruise along up to a max speed of 19 mph (I'd like to see you even try to walk that fast) and the scooter folds up so you can carry it easily when going inside or transferring onto a train or bus. Plus, that makes it easy to store in a small apartment. The scooter itself weights 31.7 pounds and has a maximum carrying capacity of 220 pounds.

Not only are they just plain fun to ride, an electric scooter is a terrific way to help reduce your carbon footprint. On a single charge, you'll be able to reach an operating range of over 17 miles from your starting point. If you need to commute further than that, I'd probably recommend a car anyway.

The scooter is safe for city commuting. It has front, middle, and rear lights to ensure those you're sharing the road with can see you easily. And if you need to stop in somewhere that won't allow you to bring it in, you can lock your scooter outside. The HiBoy S2 app for both iPhone and Android can connect to your scooter and be used to lock it when not in use. You can also adjust settings like customized speed and cruise control.

The scooter comes in a slick, gray finish — appropriate for arriving at even the most professional office environments. The throttle on the right-hand side of the handle bars is easy to use and allows the rider to smoothly glide across any paved road or sidewalk.

Best Buy normally has this particular electric scooter — the HiBoy S2 — for an even $500. Right now, the price has been cut by a solid 40%, bringing it down to just $300. That makes for a total savings of $200. Do summer right this year by getting to where you need to be on a HiBoy electric scooter.

There's something oddly satisfying about snapping your phone onto a magnetic charger and watching it power up. There's no cable to fumble with, no ports to wear down, and no having to worry about whether your device is actually charging or not. You can just drop your device and go. And you can hurry about doing whatever it is you need to do for the day while your phone works its way back up to 100%.

See at Amazon

But if one charger is nice, how about two? Does that sweeten the deal? Sure, you might have to pay a little extra, but you could keep one in storage and one with you while you use it, just in case. And you can save some money by buying in bulk, too.

If you're ready to save, check out Amazon to get the Anker Zolo Magnetic Wireless Charger 2-Pack for just $27, down from its usual price of $40. That's $13 off and a discount of 33%.

If you're anything like the rest of us, your phone is your lifeline. They're like that for all of us. They're our alarm clocks, our calendars, our maps, and sometimes even our wallets. So when it's time to recharge, you want to do it as quickly as possible. Anker's magnetic chargers deliver 15W fast charging for MagSafe-compatible iPhones, which means you can top off your battery while you work, stream, or scroll without needing to babysit your phone. They stay in place, even if you pick your phone up mid-charge for a quick check-in. And let's face it, we all do that at one point or another.

The set includes two chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, which is already a pretty solid value before you even factor in the deal. Keep one on your desk and one by the bed, or toss one in your bag for travel. They're slim, low-profile, and play nicely with iPhone 12 through 16 models. Plus, they come backed by Anker's ActiveShield 2.0 tech, which constantly monitors temperature to help protect battery health over time.

If you're still plugging in a Lightning cable every night or juggling slow wireless chargers that overheat and disconnect, this is your sign to level up. With two high-speed magnetic chargers at this price, it's an easy and affordable win for your daily routine. For just less than $30, you can have as much additional power as you need, so make sure you jump on this deal while you can.

Nintendo's Switch 2 is a better handheld than the original Switch in both overt and subtle ways. The sticks aren't full-sized, but they tilt with just the right amount of force. The plastic has a subtle grainy texture that feels luxurious on my open palms. It's nearly as light and exactly as thin as the device from eight years ago, but it is much more powerful. Nintendo is desperate to prove its new design is worth the $450 asking price, but the real appeal for this console will lie beyond specs when it launches on June 5.

You can't comprehend the appeal of the Switch 2 until you have it in hand. Gizmodo Senior Editor of Consumer Tech Raymond Wong and I spent close to eight hours with Nintendo's Switch 2, with the vast majority of that time spent playing Mario Kart World. We also tested out the system's new GameChat feature for online play, local co-op with camera functionality, and the new Welcome Tour “game.” Both Gizmodo and io9 already shared their impressions of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls along with several launch and soon-to-launch Switch 2 games. The mouse controls are still a highlight. They're very responsive, and the individual Joy-Con 2 feels comfortable enough in the hand. The optical mouse system works equally well on a flat counter or your pants' legs.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Walmart

In my time playing around with the Switch 2, I started to feel like a beaver sliding comfortably into the same den I dug for the original Switch. You can take that statement two different ways. The Switch 2 isn't chock-full of original ideas save for a few select features—namely GameChat, mouse controls, and GameShare. Many of those new features simply enhance the best aspects of the original Switch. The Switch 2 is still the best console for having fun with friends.

Nintendo has a problem communicating what's different with its hardware this time around. The Japanese console maker's devices aren't normally made for people who understand the distinction between 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rates or VRR, which is short for variable refresh rate. (If you're curious, refresh rates refer to how many times a screen displays a new image per second, and variable refresh rate is a feature that allows a screen to support a wider range of frame rates, which cuts down on flickering). That lack of specs clarity is why Nintendo made Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. The game is an interactive instruction manual for the Switch 2 packed with minigames meant to showcase the hardware's improvements. Your tiny player character is plopped down on top of a literal Switch 2 handheld, like you're a tourist visiting a monument to Nintendo's grand vision. There are several islands sectioned off for the left and right Joy-Con 2, the main screen, and the dock, each containing their own minigames and quizzes. The maps include help guides and trivia to teach the layperson what certain Switch 2 tech jargon means and how the hardware works.

Some of the minigames are as granular as a quiz where you try to identify the difference between a scene running between 20 fps and 120 fps. Another offers a perspective of what 4K resolution looks like compared to the size of Super Mario Bros. on the NES—a mere 256 x 240 pixels. The game is one of the better ways to come to terms with many of these technological terms. I think Nintendo made a big mistake not packaging Welcome Tour with the console. Instead, you have to pay $10 for it separately.

Save for GameChat and mouse controls, the Switch 2 is a sequel console in every sense of the phrase. Mario Kart World may be a pretty game with some evocative animations for every powerslide and head-on collision with an incoming truck, but it's not the type of game to express the console's overt power. All that's left is specs. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are now big enough to fit adult-sized hands. The 1080p screen is brighter and more colorful than before, and we can't overstate the benefit of 4K support, especially as the screen resolution has become far more ubiquitous since 2017.

That stuff matters, but Nintendo has the difficult task of ensuring everyone knows that matters. Consider how the original Switch lasted eight years. Even at release, it was an underpowered console. As of May, Nintendo sold 152.12 million original Switch units, closest to its top-selling device ever, the Nintendo DS. Since it had been around so long, it seemed like everybody had an original Switch. It was so ubiquitous I could visit any friend's house and expect they'd at least have two Joy-Cons and a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to play around with. Nintendo's original Switch has been around for eight years and still costs $300. The new Switch 2 is still largely untested and costs $150 more.

What we still have yet to test is the new GameShare features. In some supported games, GameShare should let one Switch 2 share it for play with both original Switch and Switch 2 owners, even if they don't own that title. GameShare will only support a limited number of titles at launch, but it's a big reason why you should want to keep your eight-year-old console handy. The bigger Joy-Con 2s still support a similarly thin body that made the original so easy to schlep to a friend's house. Together, the features speak to Nintendo's real strength—its focus on playing with friends.

After my limited time with it, I already feel that the Switch 2 does everything the original Switch did, but better. It's larger and more comfortable with improved controls. It's more capable of playing demanding games—though we'll need to test out those titles for ourselves to know the true scope of the Switch 2's potential. But as I played Mario Kart World with four-player co-op—even on a single Joy-Con 2 and even when the frame rate took a major hit from running in four-player splitscreen—I was catapulted back into the same sense of joy I have playing Mario Kart 8 or Super Smash Bros. with friends on the couch. New features like having a live view camera in multiplayer can enhance that feeling of community, and perhaps more games can incorporate mouse controls into multiplayer. The Switch shines as the communal console, and when gaming is getting more expensive, we just hope Nintendo can remember where its handheld console truly shines.

Find out how to get rid of AI overviews and other unwanted parts of search.

Let's be honest about it. The web isn't what it used to be, and Google is the culprit — or at least one of them. The company has decided to push AI overviews and AI mode onto search users, regardless of the damage it causes to the user experience or the harm it may inflict on publishers and the entire open web.

The company recently announced that it's pushing AI Overviews, which appear above the organic search results, to even more countries and queries. These overviews are often comically wrong. For example, when I asked Google on Friday “Is today Friday,” it said:

“No, today is not Friday. Today is Friday, May 30, 2025.” Maybe that's a weird query, but the problem is that there's no expert standing behind whatever answer you get. We're supposed to trust Google as if it were a person with a ton of relevant experience... on everything!

The world's greatest librarian has decided that their experience sorting books qualifies them to be a reputable authority on everything. We just wanted directions to the right shelf, though!

Soon, it seems, the company may want to replace all of search, not just the top section, with AI chatter like you see in its AI Mode tab. It keeps users on the site where Google can keep 100 percent of the ad revenue rather than sending traffic away to publishers. Never mind that those publishers are the reason Google is a success in the first place and the reason its AI has training material.

Who will publish the content Google uses to train its AI if publishers can no longer profit from putting their content on the open web? I guess that's a tomorrow problem for one of the world's largest and most profitable companies.

Meanwhile, the presence of garbage clogging up our search results is a today problem for anyone who uses the web. Fortunately, I have one big solution and a few small ones.

Last year, I was so irritated by Google's AI Overview mode that, on my own time, I programmed a browser extension called “Bye, Bye Google AI,” which works in Chrome or Edge or any desktop browser that supports Chrome extensions. I am currently working on Firefox and Safari versions. The extension allows you to hide the AI Overview section from all of your queries and goes a step further, allowing you to hide other areas of the Google SERP that you may not want, such as the videos section, text ads, or “People Also Ask.”

Since I spent one Saturday afternoon programming it, Bye, Bye Google AI has been installed by 41,000 people. I regularly get thank you notes from people who are glad that they can use Google without the cruft on top of their search. And I get complaints from people who use Google in non-English languages which it did not initially support.

So I just updated Bye, Bye Google AI to version 1.5 which now supports 19 languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Mandarin (Trad + Simplified), Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Hindi, Thai, Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian, Dutch, Danish and Portuguese. You can also now hide the AI Mode tab, not just AI Overviews.



You can also avoid AI overviews if you remember to add “-noai” to all of your searches. That's 5 characters you have to remember to type every time you enter a query so it's some added work.

You can add &udm=14 to any Google search string to search Google's web tab. This is a tab that has no AI or video or other types of content. You can also configure Chrome browser to send all searches to the web tab if you search from the address bar. To do so:

1. Navigate to chrome://settings/searchEngines in Chrome or click Settings->Search Engine->Manage search engines and site search.



2. Click the Add button next to Site search



3. Fill in the fields in the dialog box as follows then click Add.



4. Select “Make default” from the three-dot menu next to the new entry.



While Google Chrome for the desktop makes it easy to change your address bar search or install extensions, Chrome for the phone is a different story. On Chrome for Android and iOS, you can't use extensions at all, and you can't manually enter in your own custom search engine (you can on Firefox).

Yes, you can select a custom search engine, but it has to be an existing engine on the Internet you've visited; you can't manually type in a search URL and, therefore, can't add the all-important ?udm=14 to the query string on your own. The good news: a site called tenbluelinks.org has created a solution. When you visit the site, it references an XML file that follows the OpenSearch format, telling your browser to add an engine called Google Web to your settings menu.

Here's how to do it in Chrome or Edge. Safari won't work.

1. Navigate to tenbluelinks.org The page looks like a normal page but has the HTML in its header.

2. Open a new tab and use it to search Google.com.

3. Go to your Settings Search menu. On Chrome, it's at Settings->Search engine and, on Edge, it's at Settings->General->Select search engine.



4. Select Google Web from the list.



Your browser will now search google.com/search?udm=14&q=[term] from your address bar. It will be sending these queries directly to Google. They will not pass through tenbluelinks.org and you will not have to visit that site again.

Demanding new Unreal Engine 5 game demo is causing problems for players on the green team.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The developers behind the demanding new open-world adventure game Hell Is Us have issued a workaround for Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 and RTX 40 users experiencing start-up crashes with their freshly released PC demo. In an update on the Steam page for Hell is Us, the devs suggest ratcheting down the graphics quality settings in the main menu of the demo to get past the cinematic intro, as well as turning off all forms of upscaling. Meanwhile, the Hell is Us team at Rogue Factor promises to continue investigating the problem.

🚨 Some players may experience crashes during the intro cinematic of the Hell is Us demo, especially on NVIDIA 4000/5000 series cards.🛠️ We're working on a fix, but in the meantime, a temporary workaround is available.👉 Details & steps here: https://t.co/vXOLPWEuqK pic.twitter.com/jw4D7NbFydJune 2, 2025

Hell is Us already has something of a hardware hog reputation, even though it won't be released until September 4, 2025. Germany's PCGH.de notes that the Unreal Engine 5-powered title “requires at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 for 4K/UHD at 30 frames per second” (machine translation).

We looked at the official recommended specs and, in terms of GPU muscle and VRAM, gamers are advised to equip an Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti (11GB) or AMD RX 6750 XT (12GB) to enjoy this title, some more fuel for the 8GB VRAM GPU fire. 32GB of system RAM is also a recommended requirement.



The temporary workaround for those facing crashing issues, shared by the Hell is Us team, is to first reduce all your graphics settings from the main menu and then deactivate all the upscaling features supported by the demo. That means turning off DLSS, XeSS, FSR, and more. See the screenshot above.

Once you have successfully navigated that menu configuration click-fest, seen the cinematic intro, and reached the point where you are in control of main character Rémi, feel free to crank your quality settings back up, say the devs.

Hell Is Us is a single-player action-adventure in a semi-open world with both melee combat and investigatory elements to enjoy. Check out the above video for a few minutes of ‘investigation gameplay.'

Available to pre-order on Steam/PC now, with the title unlocking on September 4, 2025, the game will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Hopefully, glaring issues like crashing in the intro when played on the PC's most popular, and some would say the best graphics cards, will be a distant memory by then.

This will make it harder for Chinese tech companies to design their own chips for manufacturing at TSMC.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Washington cracked down on semiconductor design software exports to China, banning companies like Synopsys and Cadence from issuing licenses to tech companies that use their software to build advanced chips. While this ban is unlikely to stop these companies from using the electronic design automation (EDA) software they already have, it will prevent them from getting updates and the required technical support needed to continue designing chips for manufacture in Taiwan, says the Financial Times.

Xiaomi is one of the bigger companies to be affected by this move, especially as it just launched the XRing 01 SoC, which uses a 3nm process node from TSMC. Lenovo, which took over IBM's Consumer PC business, and crypto mining hardware specialist Bitmain, also use American EDA software, so they're expected to be affected by this ban as well.

This will only impact the most advanced chips, especially those used for AI processing. Less advanced semiconductors, like those used for smartphones and other mobile devices, will likely be exempted, but we will only know for sure when the White House releases the document containing all the details of the ban.

Aside from that, China has also been working on its own EDA tools to reduce its reliance on American tech. Huawei is one of those, especially as it was one of the first major Chinese companies that received a blanket ban from the U.S..

Empyrean and Primarius Technologies also make their own respective EDA systems, while Semitronix focuses on electrical testing and semiconductor yield improvement. Chinese EDA systems still aren't on the cutting-edge of chip development, but sources say that they're good enough to work with older 7nm nodes and up.

The Financial Times also reported that smaller companies use pirated versions of EDA software from Synopsys and other U.S.-based companies. One analyst told the publication that it's easy to hack into the software to use and support it without a license, which is one of the reasons why the demand for these apps is lower compared to industry growth in China.

This ban will negatively affect China's capability to design and manufacture the most advanced chips in the short term, especially when paired with the various other sanctions that the U.S. has applied to the country. However, this will also provide Chinese companies with greater reason to push forward with their own innovations, potentially making them a threat to American technological supremacy in the long run.

CEO C.C. Wei says AI demand is consistently outpacing supply

Just days after TSMC was reported to be in talks with Washington over a planned fab expansion in the Middle East, company CEO C.C. Wei has quashed those rumors at the company's annual shareholders meeting. As noted by Reuters' Wen-Yee Lee on X, Wei said the company had no plans to set up fabs in the Middle East. He also addressed the issue of tariff impact, but said that while TSMC had some exposure to waning demand, AI demand was consistently outpacing supply.

Wei's comments on the Middle East follow a Bloomberg report that claimed TSMC was evaluating the possibility of opening a chip fab in the UAE. It was claimed TSMC had met with U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and a state-owned investment firm several times. The fab would have reportedly been the size of Fab 21 in Arizona.

Concerns cited included national security, given the significant influence of China and Iran in the region, as well as talent drain from other locations required to build the plant. Turns out, those concerns were academic, with TMSC clearly having ruled out the possibility, at least for now. According to ComputerBase, Wei stated a UAE fab would not fit the company's strategy, given that there are no large clients in the local region.

Reuters further reports that Wei addressed the impact of tariffs on the company, noting small but limited exposure he believes is likely to be offset by AI demand.

""Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly. That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters,"" he said. ""TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down.""

Wei went on to say that TSMC's business could be affected if demand drops, but claimed AI demand ""has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply.""

A report in May claimed that tariffs could increase tech prices by up to 70% across the globe. As Wei notes, TSMC faces no immediate exposure because its chips are exported to manufacturers, which incorporate them into their products. However, import duties on those could stifle demand, which could have a knock-on effect on TSMC, a problem that could take months to show up on the chipmaker's bottom line.

Despite Wei's assurances, the company did recently address the U.S. Commerce Department, following a call for public comments regarding tariffs on semiconductors arriving on U.S. shores. TSMC warned import duties on chips would significantly reduce demand for the electronic products sold by TSMC's customers, causing revenue decline and impacting investment on U.S. shores, notably its Arizona plant.

“Lower market demand for our leading U.S. customers' products may consequently reduce demand for TSMC's manufacturing capacity and service onshore,"" the company said, warning diminished demand could create uncertainty around the timeline and operation of the Arizona fab.

TSMC said ""tariffs that raise the cost of end consumer products will lower demand for such products and the semiconductor components they contain"" and called on the administration to avoid imposing any tariffs or restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside the U.S..

A new ban on the sale and licensing of semiconductor design software to China could hit the company hard when it comes to building more advanced semiconductors in the future. While a new FT report notes that China has usable software for the 7nm process and up, more advanced processes for use in AI aren't supported yet, possibly hampering China's longer-term semiconductor development.

Less advanced chips for smartphones and the like are not expected to be affected.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is touting the processor in the Nintendo Switch 2 ahead of the new console's launch on June 5, stating that it delivers ""performance, intelligence, and beauty in the palm of your hand.""He appeared in a ""special edition"" of Nintendo's ""Creator's Voice"" series. The appearance marks a rare discussion of technical specs and a rare inclusion of other partners in the discussion of Nintendo's hardware.

Huang said that the new Nvidia chip ""brings together three breakthroughs: the most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device, full hardware ray-tracing, high dynamic range for brighter highlights and deeper shadows, and an architecture that supports backward compatibility.""

Nintendo's hardware developers had already confirmed the use of DLSS, and Nvidia didn't delve too deeply into specs when discussing the chip in a blog post, focusing on RT cores and noting that the new chip offers ""10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch."" Huang also said the Switch 2 features dedicated AI processors to ""sharpen, animate, and enhance gameplay in real-time.""In May, Digital Foundry reported the official specs, including eight ARM Cortex A78C cores featuring the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set, a GPU based on Nvidia's two-generation-old Ampere architecture, and a memory subsystem powered by two 6GB LPDDR5X memory modules (12GB total) operating on a 128-bit memory interface. The console also has 256GB of UFS storage and has a microSD Express card slot that supports additional storage up to 2TB.

Much of the video is actually about Nvidia's part in building the original Switch and honoring Satoru Iwata, the fourth president of Nintendo, who oversaw the console's development but passed away before its launch.The Switch 2 is launching at $449.99 when it releases on Thursday (a bundle with Mario Kart World will cost $499.99 for a limited time). Pre-orders went quickly, though some brick-and-mortar stores may have stock on launch day.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) progression in patients with systemic sclerosis–associated ILD (SSc-ILD) did not predict subsequent progression at the next annual follow-up, with only 20% showing further progression. However, initial ILD progression was associated with an increased risk for mortality.

“These results challenge current treatment practices because, although initiating or escalating treatment should still be done in patients with ILD progression according to guidelines, our data suggest that treatment should be initiated or escalated in patients at risk of progression to prevent poor outcomes, although confirmation is needed to show a benefit of this strategy on improved outcome,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Anna-Maria Hoffmann-Vold, MD, Department of Rheumatology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. It was published online on May 14, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology. 

Only patients with consecutive lung function assessments were included, which may have enriched the sample with patients with severe or progressive ILD. Moreover, the findings may not be applicable to other types of ILD. Validation in more diverse populations may be needed as the study predominantly included White patients.

The study did not receive any specific funding. Several authors reported receiving speakers bureau and consulting fees, grants, and having other financial relationships with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen, Medscape, Genentech, Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Roche.

Relacorilant, a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, combined with nab-paclitaxel significantly improved progression-free survival in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The interim analysis also showed meaningful improvement in overall survival, with median survival extending from 11.50 to 15.97 months.

“Combined with the evidence from previous studies, our study supports relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel as a potential new standard of care for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, without the need for biomarker selection. This study is the first positive clinical trial conducted with registrational intent for a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with cancer,” authors of the study wrote.

Lead author Alexander B. Olawaiye, MD, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, both in Pittsburgh, presented the results of the study at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025. A paper on the study was published online in The Lancet on June 2.

The open-label design and applicability to patients with more than three lines of anticancer therapy were noted as limitations. While the risk of bias in progression-free survival assessment was mitigated by using blinded independent central review and a dual primary endpoint of overall survival, the median duration of the follow-up for overall survival was less than the estimated median overall survival in the relacorilant combination group at interim analysis. 

The study was funded by Corcept Therapeutics. The authors reported that adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0), with relatedness determined by the investigators. The funding source supported trial conduct, patient enrollment, and drug supply. The analysis, interpretation, writing, and submission decisions were the responsibility of the authors.

 June 03, 2025  

The French National Academy of Surgery recently held a session to review the potential complications of pregnancy in women with endometriosis. The discussion featured Louis Marcellin, MD, PhD, specialist in gynecology, obstetrics, and reproductive medicine at Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, one of France's largest academic hospital systems.

“We've only been actively examining the link between endometriosis and pregnancy for about 15 years,” Marcellin explained. “Endometriosis affects around 10% of women and is an inflammatory disease of the endometrium that can lead to serious health consequences. Until recently, it was unclear whether the condition had a direct impact on pregnancy. Since the fetal membranes and placenta interact with endometrial tissue affected by endometriosis, this could potentially result in adverse outcomes. These questions have prompted ongoing investigation.”

According to Marcellin, the issue can be approached from two distinct perspectives: “First, how might endometriosis affect the course of pregnancy? Could it be linked to obstetric complications such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, or preeclampsia? Second, how does pregnancy itself influence the progression of endometriosis over time?”

To evaluate whether endometriosis increases the risk for pregnancy complications, Marcellin referenced findings from a multicenter study conducted in 2022 in several regions of France, including the Paris metropolitan area, as part of a hospital-based clinical research program.

“We did not find a clear association between endometriosis and preterm birth,” he noted. However, he emphasized that pregnancy itself can exacerbate endometriosis in rare but potentially serious ways due to hormonal fluctuations.

“The hormonal environment of pregnancy can influence endometriotic lesions, which are highly responsive to hormonal changes. During pregnancy, these lesions can undergo a transformation known as decidualization, driven by increased hormone levels,” he explained. “This process can lead to serious complications depending on the anatomical location of the lesions. These include severe internal bleeding — referred to as spontaneous hemoperitoneum during pregnancy — which can be life-threatening. Lesions affecting the bowel may result in intestinal perforations, while in women with adenomyosis — a form of endometriosis within the uterine wall — there is a rare but real risk of uterine rupture. Though these events are uncommon, they can be unpredictable and clinically significant, so heightened awareness among obstetricians is essential.”

Despite these potential risks, Marcellin stressed that standard prenatal care protocols do not need to be adjusted for patients with endometriosis.

“These concerns should not change routine pregnancy monitoring,” he said. “In most cases, pregnancy proceeds normally, and endometriosis does not require more intensive medical oversight. The risk of complications is low, which is reassuring for both clinicians and patients.”

He also noted that there is no significant difference in pregnancy-related risk between ovarian endometriosis and deep infiltrating endometriosis, further supporting the use of standard care approaches.

Marcellin also addressed a common misconception that pregnancy cures endometriosis.

“That's been clearly debunked,” he said. “Endometriosis has become more common today partly because women are having fewer children, which increases menstrual exposure. In the past, with more frequent pregnancies and breastfeeding, women had fewer periods, which reduced the risk of developing endometriosis. It's true that progesterone, produced during pregnancy, can help alleviate symptoms and inflammation, but that does not constitute a cure.”

He also discussed adhesions, a frequent complication after surgical treatment for endometriosis, particularly colorectal surgery for digestive tract involvement.

“Adhesions are fibrous bands of tissue that form between organs, often due to peritoneal trauma from surgery, exposure to blood, or the healing process,” he explained. “These can complicate future surgeries, such as cesarean delivery, especially when the adhesions are located in front of the uterus. They tend to appear in areas that have already been operated on. For example, colorectal surgery for bowel endometriosis can lead to significant adhesions.”

Rigosertib, a polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor, demonstrated antitumor efficacy in patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) and advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with an objective response achieved in four of five patients.

“These initial results indicate rigosertib as a promising drug therapy for RDEB-SCC where there is a substantial unmet need and no approved therapies,” the study authors wrote. The study, they noted, was the “first clinical trial of any experimental cancer therapeutic in this rare and complicated monogenic disease.”

The study was led by Martin Laimer, Department of Dermatology and Allergology and EB House Austria, University Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria, and was published online on May 29 in British Journal of Dermatology.

Usefulness of imaging techniques in this study was limited, particularly because of the chronic inflammatory response in lesional skin that is inherent to RDEB.

The study was funded by Debra International through Debra Austria, Debra of America, Cure EB, and Debra UK. Laimer and three other authors reported receiving consulting fees and grants from Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. Two authors declared being employees of Onconova, which provided the study drug.

Body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic position, and mental health were key determinants of unhealthy gestational weight gain (GWG) among UK women.

""Our results may help inform organisations on which groups of women are at greater risk of unhealthy weight gain during pregnancy, such as those with mental health issues, unhealthy baseline BMI, and/or facing economic deprivation,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Petra A.T. Araujo, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. It was published online on May 23, 2025, in PLOS One.

Obtaining accurate GWG measurements posed challenges due to the varying timing of measurements and lack of universal pre-pregnancy weight data. The IOM-recommended criteria might not be optimal for non-US populations and do not initially account for ethnic differences. The study cohort lacked data on late third trimester weight, restricting the ability to assess the absolute GWG.

This study was supported by an Intermediate Research Fellowship from the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Oral lamivudine, an inflammasome inhibitor originally approved for suppressing HIV, was a relatively safe and effective treatment for improving visual acuity in adults with center-involving diabetic macular edema, a serious complication of diabetic retinopathy.

Continual intravitreous administration of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor drugs, “which requires frequent visits to doctors' offices, imposes a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems,” the researchers reported. “Repurposing existing drugs such as lamivudine enables potentially immediate translation to practice and could obviate the aforementioned challenges by reducing medication costs and eliminating intravitreous injection costs. Such an oral medication would also avoid the potentially blinding complications of intravitreous injections.”

“These findings open the door to a more accessible and less invasive treatment approach for DME [diabetic macular edema], with the potential to benefit millions of patients globally,” they added.

This study was led by Felipe Pereira of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It was published online on May 27, 2025, in Med.

The relatively small number of participants was a major limitation. The 8-week duration of the study — imposed because of safety concerns over lamivudine's potential toxicity — precluded assessment of its long-term efficacy and safety. This study took place at a single center in Brazil and involved participants whose characteristics differed from those from the historical cohort who were based in the United States.

This study received support from the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Latinofarma, the National Institutes of Health, and other sources. Some authors declared receiving consultancy fees, were named as inventors on matter-related patent applications, served as scientific consultants, and had other ties with many sources, including the funding agencies.

COMMENTARY

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthor


William G. Wilkoff, MD
Retired pediatrician
Disclosure: William G. Wilkoff, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

 |  June 03, 2025  

Disclosure: William G. Wilkoff, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

How much of yourself do you share with your patients and their parents? Your colleagues? Your partners? I'm not talking about time and energy. I'm asking about the stories you tell. I recently read an interview with the two physician authors who have just published a book titled Becoming a Better Physician. The subtitle of the book is “Insightful and Inspirational Stories from Attending Physicians, Residents and Medical Students.” In the interview in Harvard Medicine, the authors, Mark Goldstein, MD, and Kathy May Tran, MD, say that “openness was one of the primary goals when working on the book.” They observe that showing one's vulnerability is often interpreted as a sign of weakness, particularly among members of the medical profession.

Prompted by the general increase in burnout, the authors are hoping that by sharing their stories and the stories of other health professionals, more physicians will feel comfortable telling their stories and benefiting from the catharsis that often follows the telling.

Tran says she sees one of our roles as physicians as being storytellers. We elicit and listen to the stories of our patients, and then in turn take what we have learned about the patient using our knowledge and other diagnostic tools to construct a story which we then tell — but we are very reluctant to tell our own stories.

I completely agree with the authors about the cathartic benefits of storytelling, and I hope their book will encourage more physicians to tell their stories at every stage of their professional trajectories. However, the barriers to sharing are real and in some cases self-imposed. 

I'm told that before my time, in many communities, physicians traditionally took Wednesday afternoons off and played golf. I'm not sure if this is true, but I suspect that there were more opportunities back then for physicians to rub elbows and swap stories than there are now in the fast-paced, time-limited world of 21st century medicine.

Although there is currently a strong emphasis on care delivery by “the team,” and some of it is out of necessity, the practice of primary care pediatrics is still a stream of one-on-one encounters between the patient and the physician. Ironically, in an environment populated with scores of assistants and care seekers, the physician can often feel lonely.

Reading the stories of others who have walked the same walk can be enlightening and soothing, but it is really the process of sharing one's own story that can be the most therapeutic. Not everyone has the time, skill, or contacts that allow them to share their stories with a broader audience. Historically, keeping a diary provided a vehicle for expression; it can still have its benefits, but merely expressing yourself pales in comparison to the cathartic value of sharing your experience with a fellow traveler.

I was fortunate to have found someone to share my stories with while I was in medical school. That good fortune continues to be a reminder to me that we should be putting more emphasis on the topic of relationship-building as we prepare students for the challenges they may face on the path to a rewarding career in medicine.

As part of treating the overall well-being of your patients, it may be beneficial to recommend nutritional counseling. More insurance carriers are providing this service as a benefit.

When patients have conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or obesity, suggesting nutritional counseling could help your patients become more informed about making healthier choices. More health insurance plans cover nutritional counseling, although some may only provide coverage for specific conditions.

“Integrating nutritional counseling into routine clinical practice is essential and necessary to achieving optimal health outcomes,” said Scott Isaacs, MD, adjunct assistant professor of medicine, Emory University, and president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, who is based in Atlanta. “By ensuring that nutritional counseling is accessible, personalized, and supported by insurance, we empower our patients to prevent disease, effectively manage chronic conditions, and improve both quality of live and longevity.”

Nutritional counseling is a collaborative, patient-centered process led by registered dietitians or nutritionists, and it involves a comprehensive assessment of a patient's dietary habits (dietary history), medical history, cultural/ethnic preferences, and health goals, followed by personalized education and support, said Isaacs.

“Think of nutritional counseling as a way to translate medical advice into a meal plan that is realistic and achievable for an individual's life situation. Nutritional knowledge with practical tips helps patients make gradual, sustainable dietary changes,” he said. “This isn't about quick fixes, it's about building lifelong skills, making permanent lifestyle changes for better health.”

According to Isaacs, most health insurance plans, including those under the Affordable Care Act, cover nutritional counseling for preventive care and for patients with conditions like diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. “One of the most underused benefits is insurance-covered nutritional counseling,” he said. “I encourage clinicians to proactively inform patients that these services are likely included in their health plan.”

Although most insurance plans grant patients the self-refer option to a registered dietitian, some require a physician's referral, especially for specific diagnoses such as diabetes, obesity, or hypertension, said Isaacs. If a referral is needed, physicians should reassure patients that this is a routine process.

Nutrition counselling services are integral to holistic comprehensive care. Nutritional counseling can include:

Furthermore, medical specialists say that nutritional counseling can particularly be a win for those with specific health conditions.

“My perspective is that medical nutrition therapy is vital to overall patient care plans, especially in the setting such as celiac disease or short bowel syndrome,” said Lindsey Russell, MD, a gastroenterologist with the Center for Human Nutrition at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. “At Cleveland Clinic, we practice a multidisciplinary approach to treating chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, which includes registered dietitians as part of the treatment plan.”

Isaacs at Emory University said nutritional counseling is a proven, evidence-based approach for managing and preventing chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. “Nutritional counseling is not just about diet, it's about giving patients practical, sustainable strategies to improve their health,” he said.

Among the benefits of personalized dietary guidance, Isaacs said, is helping patients with weight management, blood glucose control, lipid management, reduce cardiovascular risk, and support long-term health and vitality.

Patients appreciate nutrition advice they receive from their physicians, and studies show that when doctors introduce such conversations, patients are more likely to adopt meaningful lifestyle tweaks. “By recommending nutritional counseling, we're not just treating disease, we're helping patients improve their health and quality of life,” Isaacs told Medscape Medical News.

Once a doctor encourages a patient to use their insurance coverage to see a registered dietician, follow-through should be part of the plan.

“I encourage my patients to be open about their experiences — what they have tried, what has worked, what hasn't, and most importantly, their motivation for change,” said Christopher Scuderi, DO, a family physician who practices at Millennium Physician Group in Jacksonville, Florida, “Having a clear ‘why' behind their goals makes a significant difference in maintaining long-term commitment.” 

In his experience as a family physician, Scuderi noted that patients struggling with weight loss often consult with him after trying multiple approaches on their own. “They frequently bring a wealth of questions, many stemming from misinformation found on social media. I have found that consulting a nutritionist can be especially helpful in addressing these concerns, providing sound guidance, and ensuring close follow-up,” he said.

In addition, during the last 2 years, Scuderi said he's noticed an uptick in patient interest in glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) medications. Due to this, it has been easier to approach the topic of nutrition counseling.

“I have found it increasingly easier to discuss weight management with patients. Many are particularly interested in GLP-1 medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound,” he said. “However, insurance coverage for these medications can be a significant barrier for many individuals.”

In conclusion, Isaacs at Emory University said “when nutrition is a routine part of medical care, it empowers patients to take charge of their health through the foods they eat every day.”

To facilitate the incorporation of nutritional counseling for a patient's care plan he recommends the following steps:

SAN DIEGO — While psoriasis is linked to higher rates of dementia, a new study suggested that older patients with psoriasis on systemic treatments may have a much lower risk than those not treated systemically.

In fact, the research hints — but doesn't prove — that the medications could lower the dementia risk even below that of the general population.

The study, which retrospectively evaluated US medical records of people aged 65-95 years from 2004 to 2024, found that patients with psoriasis on systemic therapies (n = 14,679) had a lower risk of developing dementia than those not on systemic treatment (n = 39,601) and lower than a matched general population group (5.77 million).

The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the treated psoriasis group vs the untreated group were 0.49 (0.39-0.61) for Alzheimer's disease, 0.65 (0.51-0.83) for vascular dementia, and 0.60 (0.53-0.68) for nonvascular dementia. For the treated group vs the matched general population, the aORs were 0.69 (0.54-0.86), 0.85 (0.65-1.10), and 0.85 (0.75-0.97), respectively.

The findings, presented at the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) 2025 Annual Meeting, are too preliminary to affect clinical practice. But the study does add to “a growing body of evidence linking chronic inflammation to neurodegeneration,” study lead author Madison Olexson, a dermatology research fellow at Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia, told Medscape Medical News.

“It reinforces [how] treating systemic diseases like psoriasis may not only improve cutaneous symptoms but may have extra-cutaneous benefits as well,” she said.

Several international reports have linked psoriasis with dementia, including a 2019 study that found an elevated risk associated with the skin disease and vascular dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21-2.47) and a 2023 study that identified an increased risk for dementia (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.35). Also, a 2019 study linked dementia to a higher risk for psoriasis (OR, 1.46).

Other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease have also been linked to higher incidence and risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, Olexson said. “This is believed to be linked to systemic inflammation and the sustained activity of proinflammatory cytokines such as [tumor necrosis factor] TNF alpha and [interleukin 17] IL-17, which can affect the brain and potentially lead to neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear.”

She added that “it's still a mystery whether psoriasis alone drives the development of dementia or if the increased likelihood is due to shared comorbidities or overlapping inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, we don't yet fully understand whether treatments provide direct cognitive protection or how long treatment needs to continue for maximal benefit.”

The researchers launched the new study “to address the limited and inconsistent data on whether psoriasis associates with dementia outcomes and systemic treatments for psoriasis could influence the likelihood of developing dementia,” Olexson said.

The study retrospectively tracked patients via the TriNetX research network database. Before propensity score matching, the mean age was 66.6 ± 8.9 years for non-treated patients and 67.8 ± 9.0 years for the general population.

Respectively, the groups were 42.8% and 51.7% women and 65.9% and 72.6% White. Data for the treated psoriasis group were not provided, but Olexson said their characteristics were similar.

The study included both biologic medications, which target specific immune pathways, and non-biologic systemic treatments. Patients were treated for a median of 4 years (for both). The biologics were adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, and brodalumab. The non-biologic treatments were methotrexate, apremilast, acitretin, and ultraviolet phototherapy.

Both drug classes were linked to lower risks for dementia at roughly the same rates, but it was not clear if specific medications may have greater effects.

The adjusted incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease were 1.9% vs 1.2% in the non-psoriasis group vs the treated psoriasis group. For vascular dementia, the rates were 1.2% vs 0.74%, respectively. For nonvascular dementia, they were 5.4% vs 3.7%, respectively.

For untreated patients with psoriasis vs treated patients with psoriasis, the adjusted incident rates were 1.7% and 0.84% for Alzheimer's disease, 1.1% and 0.72% for vascular dementia, and 5.1% and 3.1% for nonvascular dementia, respectively, which Olexson reported were statistically significant differences.

“Systemic therapies likely reduce neuroinflammation by suppressing inflammatory cytokines like TNF alpha and IL-17, both of which have been implicated in neurodegenerative processes,” Olexson said. “These cytokines can disrupt the blood-brain barrier, promote amyloid beta accumulation, and impair neuronal function. By modulating this inflammatory cascade, systemic treatments may protect against or slow the onset of dementia.”

Asked to comment on the results, Steven R. Feldman, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who was not involved in the study, noted that while the findings are “intriguing,” they come with caveats because of the observational study design.

“If patients with dementia aren't bothered by their psoriasis or aren't given biologics for that or some other reason, getting a biologic might be associated with less dementia,” he said in an interview. “It may be that having or not having dementia determines to some degree who gets a biologic, not that taking a biologic determines who gets dementia.”

Olexson agreed that the observational design has limitations. While cohorts were matched by demographics, body mass index, and several comorbidities, she said other factors such as disease severity, socioeconomic status, and access to care could play a role in the findings.

What's next? Moving forward, Olexson said, “We have plans to conduct prospective studies related to psoriasis and cognitive health at our institution.”

The study had no funding, and the authors, including Feldman, reported having no disclosures.

Walnut consumption modified the fecal microbiota and metabolome, improved insulin response and reduced gut permeability in adults with obesity, a small study showed.

“Less than 10% of adults are meeting their fiber needs each day, and walnuts are a source of dietary fiber, which helps nourish the gut microbiota,” study coauthor Hannah Hoscher, PhD, associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told Medscape Medical News.

Hoscher and her colleagues previously conducted a study on the effects of walnut consumption on the human intestinal microbiota “and found interesting results,” she said. Among 18 healthy men and women with a mean age of 53 years, “walnuts enriched intestinal microorganisms, including Roseburia that provide important gut-health promoting attributes, like short-chain fatty acid production. We also saw lower proinflammatory secondary bile acid concentrations in individuals that ate walnuts.”

The current study, presented at NUTRITION 2025 in Orlando, Florida, found similar benefits among 30 adults with obesity but without diabetes or gastrointestinal disease.

Walnut Halves, Walnut Oil, Corn Oil — Compared

The researchers aimed to determine the impact of walnut consumption on the gut microbiome, serum and fecal bile acid profiles, systemic inflammation, and oral glucose tolerance to a mixed-meal challenge.

Participants were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, crossover, complete feeding trial with three 3-week conditions, each identical except for walnut halves (WH), walnut oil (WO), or corn oil (CO) in the diet. A 3-week washout separated each condition.

“This was a fully controlled dietary feeding intervention,” Hoscher said. “We provided their breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinners — all of their foods and beverages during the three dietary intervention periods that lasted for 3 weeks each. Their base diet consisted of typical American foods that you would find in a grocery store in central Illinois.”

Fecal samples were collected on days 18-20. On day 20, participants underwent a 6-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (75 g glucose + treatment) with a fasting blood draw followed by blood sampling every 30 minutes.

The fecal microbiome and microbiota were assessed using metagenomic and amplicon sequencing, respectively. Fecal microbial metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Blood glucose, insulin, and inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) were quantified. Fecal and circulating bile acids were measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

Gut permeability was assessed by quantifying 24-hour urinary excretion of orally ingested sucralose and erythritol on day 21.

Linear mixed-effects models and repeated measures ANOVA were used for the statistical analysis.

The team found that Roseburia spp were greatest following WH (3.9%) vs WO (1.6) and CO (1.9); Lachnospiraceae UCG-001 and UCG-004 were also greatest with WH vs WO and CO.

WH fecal isobutyrate concentrations (5.41 µmol/g) were lower than WO (7.17 µmol/g) and CO (7.77). Similarly, fecal isovalerate concentrations were lowest with WH (7.84 µmol/g) vs WO (10.3µmol/g) and CO (11.6 µmol/g).

In contrast, indoles were highest in WH (36.8 µmol/g) vs WO (6.78 µmol/g) and CO (8.67µmol/g).

No differences in glucose concentrations were seen among groups. The 2-hour area under the curve (AUC) for insulin was lower with WH (469 µIU/mL/min) and WO (494) vs CO (604 µIU/mL/min).

The 4-hour AUC for glycolithocholic acid was lower with WH vs WO and CO. Furthermore, sucralose recovery was lowest following WH (10.5) vs WO (14.3) and CO (14.6).

“Our current efforts are focused on understanding connections between plasma bile acids and glycemic control (ie, blood glucose and insulin concentrations),” Hoscher said. “We are also interested in studying individualized or personalized responses, since people had different magnitudes of responses.”

In addition, she said, “as the gut microbiome is one of the factors that can underpin the physiological response to the diet, we are interested in determining if there are microbial signatures that are predictive of glycemic control.”

Because the research is still in the early stages, at this point, Hoscher simply encourages people to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts to meet their daily fiber recommendations and support their gut microbiome.

This study was funded by a USDA NIFA grant. No competing interests were reported.

In patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (CAD), a structured 75-minute weekly football training programme over 1 year led to improvements in maximum oxygen uptake, blood pressure, running performance, and other cardiovascular risk factors, with no concerning safety events.

""Football in this form offers an effective way of improving the unsatisfactory situation in secondary prevention. A decisive advantage of football is the existing nationwide infrastructure and, thus, the cost-effective possibility of making this physical activity accessible to all,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Bastian Schrader, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

This study was underpowered to assess differences in internal complications between the groups. Financial constraints prevented the use of heart rate monitors in the control group, although that could have enhanced the comparison of physical activity. The randomisation method may have introduced bias.

This study received funding from the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture and the German Heart Foundation. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A novel multicomponent messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, mRNA-1083, demonstrated noninferiority to standard influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in adults aged 50 years or older, eliciting higher immune responses against most influenza strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) and SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron XBB.1.5), according to a pivotal phase 3 study.

“As such, an annual vaccination campaign with a multicomponent vaccine could occur during the seasonal period when the burden of respiratory hospitalizations is the greatest, while allowing for a standalone COVID-19 vaccine option for additional doses or if the vaccine is updated in the interim should any antigenically divergent strain emerge,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Amanda K. Rudman Spergel, MD, Moderna Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was published online on May 7, 2025, in JAMA.

The efficacy of mRNA-1083 was not established in the study and requires further investigation. Although the diversity of the study population mirrored that of the general US population, the results may not be generalizable to other geographic areas.

Administration of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing cardiac surgery reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium by 38% but was associated with an increased risk for hypotension.

“This study found that postoperative or intraoperative of dexmedetomidine administration has a beneficial effect to reduce the incidence and length of postoperative delirium (POD),” the researchers reported. “This effect remains robust across various sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on the timing of administration, the age of patients, type of control group, or the scale used to assess the POD. However, it should be noted that dexmedetomidine use was associated with an increased risk of hypotension.”

The study was led by Ahmed Abdelaziz, MD, of the Medical Research Group of Egypt and the Negida Academy in Arlington, Massachusetts. It was published online on May 27, 2025, in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia.

The sedation dosages and durations varied due to the lack of a standardized anesthesia protocol. The effect of dexmedetomidine across different surgery types was not examined in the analysis, potentially affecting outcome reliability. The absence of data on extubation and intubation duration limited comprehensive evaluation.

Being a man can be detrimental to health. On average, men in the UK can expect to live 4 years less than women.

The government's intention to develop a first-ever men's health strategy for England this year is intended to narrow this longevity gap.

“We need to stop treating men's poorer health outcomes as inevitable or self-inflicted,” said Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York, York, England. “The men's health strategy is a turning point and a long overdue step. The UK has lacked a coherent national approach to men's health — and it shows,” he told Medscape News UK.

An ongoing 12-week consultation is calling on health professionals, academics, and members of the public to share their ideas on how to improve men's health.

Life expectancy at birth in the UK in 2021-2023 was 78.8 years for men and 82.8 years for women, according to the Office for National Statistics.

There's no single or simple reason why men die at a younger age. It's down to a combination of biologic, behavioural, and social factors.

Men are more likely than women to die early from cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, liver disease, and accidents.

Men also account for three out of four deaths by suicide.

“Women have a lower mortality rate for cardiovascular disease and certain cancers compared to men, partly due to the protective effects of oestrogen and a stronger immune system,” according to Roger Kirby, former president of the Royal Society of Medicine and a prominent writer on men's health.

“Women are screened for the most common forms of cancer — breast and cervix — as well as colon cancer, but men are only screened for colonic tumours,” he told Medscape News UK.

Research also suggests that men tend to pursue less healthy lifestyles than women.

“Men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and use drugs,” said Amy O'Connor, lead of Policy and Advocacy at men's health charity Movember. “Men are more likely to be classed as overweight or obese compared to women and die from substance abuse, self-harm, or violence.”

The gap in life expectancy is largely driven by preventable causes, according to Galdas. “Men are more likely to die prematurely from non-communicable diseases — heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions — which are all strongly linked to modifiable risk factors like smoking, poor diet, alcohol use, and physical inactivity.”

However, behaviour only tells part of the story, “Masculine gender norms that discourage vulnerability, emotional expression, and help-seeking are shaped by wider social and structural forces such as how boys are raised, how workplaces reward performance over wellbeing, how healthcare is delivered,” he said.

Also, healthcare systems often fail to engage men, “especially those facing additional barriers like poverty, discrimination, or isolation.” These are not just behavioural patterns; they're embedded in culture, policy, and systems. “Tackling them means addressing the structural roots of inequality, not just blaming men for the outcomes,” Galdas added.

This inequality can be seen across regions. In England, for example, life expectancy at birth for men ranged from 77.36 years in the Northeast to 80.32 years in the Southeast. Similar variations exist in Scotland, where life expectancy at birth is generally lower than the England average.

Many men struggle to seek help for health conditions when needed. “Also, when men seek help, they aren't always getting help that's tailored to them,” according to O'Connor. “We are calling for clinical training of healthcare professionals to understand how to respond when men come into clinical settings,” she told Medscape News UK. “If a man has a bad experience within the healthcare service, he is much less likely to go back, especially considering the barriers he may have had to overcome to seek help in the first place.”

She added: “We know there are men who are going into clinics who don't know their health risks or symptoms. How a man might communicate is really nuanced — he might be angry, or he might be silent. We are also advocating for more access to men's health checks and screening and early diagnosis programmes, as we know not enough men are taking advantage of their NHS health checks.”

Some countries — for example Ireland and Australia — already have dedicated men's health strategies.

Men's health advocates are calling for campaigns that are directly targeted at men that talk the language of men. They want to see health services and systems that actively engage men in the spaces they already occupy, such as sports clubs, workplaces, and online platforms.

Movember invests in community and sports programmes like, Ahead of the Game, which works with rugby league clubs to engage young men in talking about their mental health. “It could be that investment in gaming may be an opportunity to reach our young men who are spending time in that space,” O'Connor suggested.

“We need to challenge and reshape the norms around what it means to be a man,” said Galdas. “That includes promoting healthier, more flexible models of masculinity — ones that embrace self-care, openness, and asking for support.” Promoting healthy behaviours “should be seen as a strength, not a weakness.”

He added, “Men's health has often been described as a silent crisis, and the data shows there is very good reason for that. Improving men's health doesn't take anything away from women's health — it strengthens it. Gender-responsive approaches that support men lead to better outcomes not just for them, but for their families, communities, and workplaces.”

The Department of Health and Social Care is inviting anyone in England, including academics and health and social care professionals, to take part in its consultation, which runs until 17 July. The evidence gathered will inform a men's health strategy for England, anticipated by the end of 2025.

Intensive exercise- and sport changes the heart of an athlete. Research led by Amsterdam UMC shows that the hearts of female athletes have different characteristics than those of male athletes. Whereas a thickening in combination with a dilation of the heart muscle is characteristic in male top athletes, dilation of the heart chambers is mainly seen in female elite athletes. An important observation that can help doctors to better distinguish between normal sports-related changes and possible heart disease in female athletes. These results were published today in European Heart Journal Cardiovascular Imaging. 

Despite the growing attention for biological differences between men and women in healthcare, women are still often underexposed in medical research.

Women are still underrepresented in heart research, especially when it comes to sports cardiology research. But through our collaboration with the Dutch Olympic team, we have now also been able to gain knowledge from female elite athletes about adaptations in the morphology of the heart."" 

Harald Jorstad, sports cardiologist at Amsterdam UMC

With an MRI scan, the hearts of 173 female elite athletes were analysed down to the tissue level. Their hearts were compared to data from women who do not participate in professional sport. ""We saw that in women who participate in professional sports, the heart chambers in particular become wider, while the heart muscle thickens only to a limited extent, and the heart tissue otherwise contains normal characteristics. This is different from a male athlete's heart: the heart muscle is frequently thicker than the heart muscle of a 'normal' heart. A characteristic that you also see in heart disease,"" says Jorstad. A thickened heart muscle is therefore to be expected in male elite athletes, while it is not normal in female elite athletes, and in females could indicate heart disease. ""That is why it is important that we know from both men and women how the heart adapts through sport, and we know what is normal in an athlete,"" says Jorstad. 

 Not only are there differences between men and women in how the heart adapts, but there is also a difference between different types of athletes. Maarten van Diepen, physician-researcher in sports cardiology at Amsterdam UMC: ""Female endurance athletes, such as cyclists, had the largest heart chambers and the most heart muscle mass; more than strength athletes such as gymnasts. This shows that the way in which the heart of elite female athlete adapts also depends on the type of training load."" 

This research underlines the importance of including not only sports history but also biological sex when assessing the heart of an elite or highly active recreational athlete. ""This prevents heart disease in women from being overlooked. Or the other way around, that a healthy female athlete's heart is wrongly labeled as sick and the woman, for example, must stop with professional sport. More knowledge about the female athlete's heart helps doctors to better determine whether a heart is undergoing normal sports-related changes or whether further research into a possible heart disease is needed. This can ultimately help to better guide and protect female athletes, from professional to recreational, against heart problems,"" says Jorstad.

The first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) pivekimab sunirine (PVEK) demonstrated promising efficacy and high response rates for patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendric cell neoplasm (BPDCN), according to data from a Phase I/II study led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

These results suggest that PVEK should be considered a potential new standard treatment option for patients with BPDCN, a rare, aggressive blood cancer that involves the skin, bone marrow and lymph nodes.

Findings from the CADENZA study were presented today at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting by Naveen Pemmaraju, M.D., professor of Leukemia, who led the trial together with Naval Daver, M.D., professor of Leukemia.

As a frontline treatment in 33 newly diagnosed patients with BPDCN, researchers observed an overall response rate of 85%, including a complete response rate of 70% with a median overall survival of 16.6 months.

Patients with BPDCN are in need of improved frontline therapies to treat their disease, so we're very excited to see this trial going extremely well in terms of safety and efficacy. The responses we have observed make PVEK a strong candidate as a standard-of-care treatment.""

Naveen Pemmaraju, M.D., professor of Leukemia

The current standard-of-care treatment for patients with BPDCN is tagraxofusp-erzs, which targets CD123 found at high levels on certain cancer cells, including BPDCN. MD Anderson researchers helped advance tagraxofusp-erzs toward Food and Drug Administration approval in 2018.

PVEK represents a next generation of CD123-targeted treatment. As an ADC, it works by delivering a drug directly to cancer cells by targeting CD123 on the surface of BPDCN cells, resulting in death of the cancer cells.

The global multi-center trial enrolled a total of 84 adult patients with CD123-positive BPDCN. Of these patients, 33 patients were newly diagnosed, and 51 patients had relapsed or refractory BPDCN with one, two or three prior lines of therapy. Participants received the therapy intravenously on day one of a 21-day cycle in an outpatient setting.

The most common side effects included peripheral edema, which was reversible and found to be manageable.

Given the results of this trial, there is potential for investigating combination therapies of CD123-targeted agent PVEK with other treatments active in BPDCN in future clinical trials, Pemmaraju explained.

The clinical trial was funded by AbbVie. Pemmaraju has served on the advisory board and as a consultant for AbbVie. Daver has received research support and has served on the advisory board and as a consultant for AbbVie.

A new county-level dataset from Johns Hopkins University researchers reveals a national decline in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among U.S. children since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Out of 2,066 studied counties, 1,614 counties, 78%, reported drops in vaccinations and the average county-level vaccination rate fell 93.92% pre-pandemic to 91.26% post-pandemic-an average decline of 2.67%, moving further away from the 95% herd immunity threshold to predict or limit the spread of measles.

Only four of the 33 states in studied-California, Connecticut, Maine, and New York-reported an increase in the median county-level vaccination rate.

The data is published today in JAMA.

The data is released as more than one thousand measles cases have been reported this year in the United States. With the exception of 2019, this is the most cases reported in the U.S. in a single year in over three decades, with the vast majority of cases occurring in unvaccinated children.

""This open, high resolution dataset provides a critical resource to explore and better understand the country's vaccination landscape and its implications for the risk of measles spread,"" said senior author Lauren Gardner, director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering, an expert in using data and modeling to better understand the spread of disease. This work draws on her experience leading the data collection efforts behind the Johns Hopkins' COVID-19 dashboard that was relied upon globally during the pandemic.

Gardner created Johns Hopkins' COVID-19 dashboard that was relied upon globally to track cases during the pandemic.

The county-level vaccination data complements the state and national-level from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirming a widespread decline in MMR vaccination rates in the U.S. following the COVID-19 pandemic, while also revealing the significant heterogeneity of vaccination patterns within and across states.

The team collected county-level 2-dose MMR vaccination rates for kindergarteners from each state's department of health website from 2017 to 2024, where available. The dataset includes at least one year of vaccination data for 2,237 counties across 38 states.

Empathy is often seen as a natural and essential part of the patient encounter - but reality tends to look quite different. In a new doctoral thesis from Umeå University, doctors describe how not only time pressure, but also the structure of medical education and the culture of the workplace, can make it difficult to live up to the ideal.

In her thesis, Johanna von Knorring interviewed medical students, practicing doctors, and patients about how they experience and understand empathy in healthcare. The results show that empathy is relational and constantly changing - and that it is influenced by far more than an individual doctor's will or personality.

Participants in the study describe empathy as difficult to define, yet a natural part of a good healthcare encounter. It involves being present, listening actively and meeting the patient as a whole person - not just as a diagnosis. For patients, an empathetic approach can help create safety, trust and greater involvement in their own care.

Although empathy is considered an ideal, the study highlights how difficult it can be to achieve in everyday practice. Medical students say that empathy is given attention in the early stages of their education, but once they enter the clinical environment, they face a reality shaped by time constraints, documentation demands and a strong focus on technical and medical efficiency - all of which make it harder to remain empathetically present.

There is a clash between what you've been taught to strive for and what you're actually able to do in your daily work.""

Johanna von Knorring, doctoral student, Department of Clinical Sciences and the Industrial Doctoral School at Umeå University

Experienced doctors also describe how their empathy is negatively affected by the work environment, organisational conditions and a workplace culture that often prioritises efficiency over relational care. Many hope to serve as role models for younger colleagues - but find that there is limited space for reflection and discussion on patient interaction. At the same time, they emphasise that empathy does not disappear, but that it requires ongoing effort and support to be maintained.

Patients in the study show great understanding of the challenges faced by healthcare professionals but still call for a more person-centered approach - to be seen, heard and taken seriously. For them, empathy is not a bonus but a fundamental part of quality care.

In summary, the thesis shows that empathy does not simply emerge in the encounter between two individuals. It is shaped by the design of medical education, workplace cultures and the values embedded in the healthcare system.

""We need to understand empathy as something shaped and reshaped by its context. Creating better conditions for doctors to maintain and develop their empathy is a shared responsibility - one that rests with individuals, educational institutions and healthcare organisations,"" says Johanna von Knorring.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study: New mRNA vaccine is more scalable and adaptable to continuously evolving viruses","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250603/Study-New-mRNA-vaccine-is-more-scalable-and-adaptable-to-continuously-evolving-viruses.aspx","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:43:00 GMT","

A new type of mRNA vaccine is more scalable and adaptable to continuously evolving viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1, according to a study by researchers at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health and the Pennsylvania State University. The study was published today in npj Vaccines.

Though highly effective at inducing an immune response, current mRNA vaccines, such as those used to prevent COVID-19, present two significant challenges: the high amount of mRNA needed to produce them and the constantly evolving nature of the pathogen.

The virus changes, moving the goal post, and updating the vaccine takes some time.""

Suresh Kuchipudi, Ph.D., senior author, chair of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Pitt Public Health

To address these challenges, the researchers created a proof-of-concept COVID-19 vaccine using what's known as a ""trans-amplifying"" mRNA platform. In this approach, the mRNA is separated into two fragments-the antigen sequence and the replicase sequence-the latter of which can be produced in advance, saving crucial time in the event a new vaccine must be developed urgently and produced at scale.

Additionally, the researchers analyzed the spike-protein sequences of all known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 for commonalities, rendering what's known as a ""consensus spike protein"" as the basis for the vaccine's antigen.

In mice, the vaccine induced a robust immune response against many strains of SARS-CoV-2.

""This has the potential for more lasting immunity that would not require updating, because the vaccine has the potential to provide broad protection,"" said Kuchipudi. ""Additionally, this format requires an mRNA dose 40 times less than conventional vaccines, so this new approach significantly reduces the overall cost of the vaccine.""

The lessons learned from this study could inform more efficient vaccine development for other constantly evolving RNA viruses with pandemic potential, Kuchipudi said. ""We hope to apply the principles of this lower-cost, broad-protection antigen design to pressing challenges like bird flu.""

The LC regulates arousal and stress reactions, especially by releasing norepinephrine. In the context of anxiety-like behaviors, norepinephrine release from the LC can influence neuronal activity in the BLA.

Our research has demonstrated that norepinephrine can increase the gain of neuronal ensembles in the BLA, which is especially important during times of stress or worry. This modulation effectively makes specific ensembles more sensitive, resulting in the anxiety-like responses we see.

Norepinephrine from the LC functions as a crucial neuromodulator, amplifying the effect of stress on the amygdala, a central center for processing emotional reactions.

Neurons in the amygdala form ensembles that respond to certain stimuli—some respond to positive stimuli like sucrose, while others respond to negative stimuli like quinine. What is remarkable is how these ensembles work in opposition to one another.

For example, quinine can inhibit neurons that have been stimulated by sucrose and vice versa. We believe neuromodulation, particularly norepinephrine from the LC, is critical for controlling the activity of these ensembles.

This dynamic modulation scaling may help balance varying ensemble responses, regulating how an organism responds to both positive and negative stimuli. It could enable the brain to manage emotional reactions and behaviors in a context-dependent manner.

The LC is a difficult region to work with for a variety of reasons. It is located deep in the brain and contains a tiny number of neurons, making imaging and recording difficult. One of the most difficult issues we faced was capturing stable recordings of neural activity while concurrently activating these neurons.

To solve this, we employed multi-photon microscopy in conjunction with advanced lens techniques such as prism lenses to penetrate deep into the brain and record neuronal activity. Combining these technologies has enabled us to both stably record as well as manipulate LC neuron activity in an awake and behaving mouse.

Stressors, such as the odor of a predator odor to a rodent, trigger synchronized activity in the LC, leading to significant norepinephrine release. We believe this synchronized LC activity amplifies the gain of neural ensembles downstream in the amygdala, heightening their sensitivity.

Our findings indicate that the increased norepinephrine release enhances anxiety-like behaviors by intensifying neuronal responses in the amygdala. During stress, the synchronized firing of LC neurons plays a crucial role in generating excessive emotional responses, further promoting an anxious state.

Using optogenetics, we were able to directly stimulate the LC-amygdala pathway and study its impact on anxiety-like behavior.

When we engaged in this route, we saw an increase in anxiety-like behaviors, which is consistent with the involvement of norepinephrine in the amygdala. Interestingly, pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors caused a shift in how these neurons responded to stress, while a specific genetic knock out of beta-2 adrenergic receptors lead to more active coping behaviors rather than passive anxiety-like responses.

This demonstrates that norepinephrine receptors, particularly beta-adrenergic receptors, play a vital role in how the brain processes stress and anxiety.

In the amygdala, neurons respond to both positive and negative stimuli, such as sucrose and quinine. We discovered that these neurons frequently exhibit opposite activity patterns; when one group is activated, the other is suppressed.

For example, when sucrose-responsive neurons are excited, quinine-responsive neurons become inhibited, and vice versa. This mutual inhibition implies a tightly regulated mechanism in which opposing ensembles interact to maintain emotional balance. We suspect that interneurons or other intermediate processes are mediating this antagonistic interaction, although we are actively exploring.

Multi-photon microscopy and optogenetics enable us to precisely target and control specific neuronal ensembles in the amygdala while also observing how these changes affect behavior.

For example, by stimulating neurons that respond to sucrose or quinine, we were able to manipulate mouse behavior in response to these stimuli. Specifically activating sucrose-responsive neurons enhanced the mice's likelihood of consuming a liquid it previously found unpleasent, whereas activating quinine-responsive neurons reduced positive actions, such as licking for sucrose.

These techniques offer amazing accuracy, allowing us to investigate how single neurons and their connections influence behavior.

Anxiety-like actions are mostly driven by synchronous activity in LC and amygdala neurons. When the LC fires in a very synchronized manner, it causes a coordinated release of norepinephrine, which boosts the responsiveness of amygdale neurons. This increased neuronal synchronization improves emotional reactions, especially during stress.

Beta-adrenergic receptors, particularly the beta-2 subtype, are critical in mediating these actions. In tests where we shut down beta-2 receptors, we saw a decrease in anxiety-like behavior, indicating that these receptors are important in how the brain processes stress and regulates emotional responses.

A protein that gives fleas their bounce has been used to boot out bacteria cells, with lab results demonstrating the material's potential for preventing medical implant infection. 

The collaborative study led by researchers at RMIT University in Australia is the first reported use of antibacterial coatings made from resilin-mimetic proteins to fully block bacteria from attaching to a surface. 

Study lead author Professor Namita Roy Choudhury said the finding is a critical step towards their goal of creating smart surfaces that stop dangerous bacteria, especially antibiotic-resistant ones like MRSA, from growing on medical implants. 

This work shows how these coatings can be adjusted to effectively fight bacteria - not just in the short term, but possibly over a long period."" 

Professor Namita Roy Choudhury, lead author

Bacteria are often found on implants following surgery, despite sterilisation and infection controls. These can lead to infections requiring antibiotics, but with antibiotic resistance becoming more common, new preventative measures are needed. 

""Antibiotic resistance has prompted greater interest in the area of self-sterilising materials and easy preparation of antibacterial surfaces,"" Choudhury said. 

""Therefore, we designed this surface to completely prevent the initial attachment of the bacteria and biofilm formation to decrease the infection rates."" 

Choudhury said potential applications could include spray coatings for surgical tools, medical implants, catheters and wound dressings. 

Resilin, a protein found in insects, is known for its remarkable elasticity – it enables fleas to jump more than a hundred times their own height in microseconds – but it's also extremely resilient and biocompatible. 

""These exceptional properties and non-toxic nature make resilin and resilin-mimetic proteins ideal for many applications requiring flexible, durable materials and coatings,"" Choudhury said. 

""These applications range from tissue engineering and drug delivery to flexible electronics and sports equipment, but this is the first work published on its performance as an antibacterial coating."" 

The team created several forms of coating from altered forms of resilin, then tested their interactions with E.coli bacteria and human skin cells in lab conditions. 

The study showed how the altered proteins in nano droplet form known as coacervates were 100% effective at repelling the bacteria, while still integrating well with healthy human cells, a critical part of medical implant success. 

Study lead author from RMIT Dr Nisal Wanasingha said the nano droplets' high surface area made them especially good at interacting with and repelling bacteria. 

""Once they come in contact, the coating interacts with the negatively charged bacterial cell membranes through electrostatic forces, disrupting their integrity, leading to leakage of cellular contents and eventual cell death,"" he said. 

Wanasingha said the resilin-based coatings not only showed 100% effectiveness in stopping bacteria from attaching to the surface but also offered several advantages compared to traditional approaches. 

""Unlike antibiotics, which can lead to resistance, the mechanical disruption caused by the resilin coatings may prevent bacteria from establishing resistance mechanisms,"" he said. 

""Meanwhile, resilin's natural origin and biocompatibility reduce the risk of adverse reactions in human tissues and, being protein-based, are more environmentally friendly than alternatives based on silver nanoparticles."" 

Study co-author Professor Naba Dutta said resilin-mimetic protein is highly responsive to stimuli and changes in its environment, making it potentially tuneable for many functions. 

""These early results are very promising as a new way to help improve infection control in hospitals and other medical settings, but now more testing is needed to see how these coatings work against a wider range of harmful bacteria,"" Dutta said. 

""Future work includes attaching antimicrobial peptide segments during recombinant synthesis of resilin-mimics and incorporating additional antimicrobial agents to broaden the spectrum of activity."" 

Transitioning from lab research to clinical use will require ensuring the formula's stability and scalability, conducting extensive safety and efficacy trials, while developing affordable production methods for widespread distribution, he added. 

The study was in collaboration with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). 

The team used ANSTO's Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering facilities, and RMIT University's Micro Nano Research Facility and Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility. 

The work was funded by the Australia India Strategic Research Fund, Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering top-up Postgraduate Research Award (PGRA) and supported by the Australian Research Council.

In a new JNeurosci paper, Adrian Rothenfluh and colleagues from the University of Utah developed a fruit fly model of cocaine self-administration that can be used to explore the genetic underpinnings of cocaine addiction. 

To model voluntary cocaine intake in fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, the researchers first assessed cocaine consumption and preferences of this insect. Cocaine was innately aversive to fruit flies because it activated their bitter-sensing receptors. In other words, the fruit flies did not like cocaine's bitter taste. When the researchers mutated a gene for these receptors to reduce bitter perception, this made cocaine less aversive to the flies, and they began to approach a solution containing cocaine. Eventually, fruit flies with mutated receptors even preferred the cocaine solution over a sucrose solution. 

We have previously modeled alcohol self-administration in fruit flies, and this has revealed that humans and fruit flies share many of the same genes that drive alcohol consumption and addiction. So, it is reasonable to think that the genes involved with cocaine addiction in humans may also be involved in this fruit fly model.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers how HSV-1 disables the brain's antiviral defense","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250603/Study-uncovers-how-HSV-1-disables-the-brains-antiviral-defense.aspx","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:38:00 GMT","

Infections caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) can lead to HSV-1 encephalitis-a rare but deadly condition that inflames the brain. Despite decades of research, treatment options for this disease remain limited. HSV-1 has evolved alongside human hosts and developed strategies to evade immune responses, particularly in the brain. One key line of defense, the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme (APOBEC), a catalytic polypeptide-like family of proteins, can introduce mutations into viral DNA to prevent infection. However, HSV-1 is able to bypass this mechanism, with potentially life-threatening consequences.

To better understand this immune evasion, a new study led by Professor Yasushi Kawaguchi from the Division of Viral Pathogenesis, Department of Microbiology and Immunology at The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan, uncovers how HSV-1 disables the brain's antiviral defense-and how this defense can be restored. The study will be published in the journal Nature Microbiology on June 3, 2025, and offers a promising new therapeutic strategy for treating HSV-1 encephalitis by reactivating the host's intrinsic immune system.

The researchers identified a viral enzyme called uracil-DNA glycosylase (vUNG), which plays a key role in helping HSV-1 escape APOBEC1-mediated immunity. Once inside host cells, vUNG removes damaging mutations that APOBEC1 inserts into the viral genome, enabling HSV-1 to replicate freely in the brain.

But the team also discovered a way to disable this viral defense mechanism. By using a specially designed viral vector, the researchers were able to block vUNG activity, thereby restoring the protective effects of APOBEC1 and improving survival in infected mice. ""Our study provides the first in vivo evidence, in the context of human pathogenic virus, that an intrinsic antiviral resistance of the infected host can be revived by blocking a viral evasion factor, pointing to a new therapeutic avenue based on reactivating intrinsic immunity,"" explains Prof. Kawaguchi.

To understand how HSV-1 survives in the brain, the team investigated the molecular mechanisms of viral evasion involving vUNG. They found that the enzyme becomes functional through phosphorylation at a specific amino acid-serine 302. To test this, they engineered a mutant form of HSV-1 with altered serine 302, making the virus unable to activate vUNG. Mice infected with this mutant version had lower levels of brain infection and improved survival, confirming that phosphorylation is essential for the immune-suppressing action of vUNG. More importantly, the absence of active vUNG allowed APOBEC1 to do its job: inserting mutations into the viral genome to halt its replication.

Inspired by this, the team developed a gene therapy approach using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver vUNG inhibitor (UGI), a protein that blocks vUNG. When mice received this AAV-UGI vector before exposure to HSV-1, they were far more likely to survive.

However, when the mice lacking APOBEC1 received this treatment, the protective effect vanished, solidifying the importance of the APOBEC1-vUNG interaction in the disease process.

""Our findings offer a potential new approach to treat herpes simplex virus encephalitis, a life-threatening disease with limited therapeutic options,"" says Prof. Kawaguchi. ""By targeting the viral immune evasion mechanism, this research could contribute to the development of antiviral therapies that enhance the natural defenses in the body and improve patient outcomes in the near future.""

This study not only reveals the stealth tactics HSV-1 uses to persist in the brain but also introduces a new therapeutic concept-targeting viral immune evasion rather than the virus itself. By restoring natural antiviral immunity, strategies like AAV-UGI could reduce the need for high-dose antiviral drugs, minimize side effects, and help prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains. The approach may also have broader applications against other viruses that rely on similar immune evasion tactics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","THP regimen achieves high response rates in HER2 positive breast cancer patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250602/THP-regimen-achieves-high-response-rates-in-HER2-positive-breast-cancer-patients.aspx","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:17:00 GMT","

Patients with Stage II and III (early-stage) HER2+ breast cancer usually undergo pre-operative therapy with multi-agent chemotherapy in combination with anti-HER2 antibodies, followed by surgery. A less intensive, reduced chemotherapy treatment approach is currently being evaluated in the CompassHER2 pCR trial (EA1181, NCT04266249) by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN). While longer follow-up is needed to assess long-term outcomes, pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and predictors of pCR are being shared at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, detailing which patients may benefit most from the new approach.

Neoadjuvant treatment with 12 weeks of THP led to a pCR rate of 64% in patients with early-stage HER2-positive, ER-negative breast cancer at the time of surgery, compared to 33% for those with ER-positive tumors. We also found that among ER-positive breast cancers, lower level of ER expression resulted in higher pCR rates.""

Nadine M. Tung, MD, lead investigator, medical oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston

THP combines one chemotherapy drug (a taxane) with the HER2-targeting drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab. THP is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. Previous small studies have shown that patients with early-stage disease can also reach a pCR with less intensive therapies like THP.

CompassHER2 pCR (EA1181) is the first large-scale trial to evaluate this approach and its ultimate impact on survival. The regimen being assessed in this single-arm, non-randomized trial is 12 weeks of pre-operative THP (4 cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HP)) with weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) or docetaxel (q3w x 4), followed by surgery.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, patient enrollment in the trial was rapid, with 2175 participants joining between February 2020 and October 2023. Among them, 2141 started THP. Disease progression during THP occurred in only 16 patients (0.7%).

""If patients achieved a pCR, they did not receive any more chemotherapy, only HER2-directed antibodies after surgery, as well as radiation and endocrine therapy if indicated,"" said Dr. Tung. ""Ultimately, this trial should establish if patients who have no residual cancer at surgery after THP can forgo further chemotherapy.""

The primary endpoint is 3-year recurrence-free survival, which requires longer follow-up.

The pCR rates presented at ASCO (Abstract 501) are categorized by estrogen receptor (ER) status and other characteristics. A subset of 569 patients underwent biopsies for analysis using the HER2DX® pCR-score (Reveal Genomics®). This laboratory test assigns a low, medium, or high score based on tumor gene expression and clinical features.

It is already known that among HER2+ breast cancer tumors, those that are ER-negative have a higher pCR rate compared to those that are ER-positive. This study reveals several other predictors of pCR in patients with Stage II and III HER2+ breast cancer. These include:

The analysis did not find an association with the baseline clinical stage of disease.

While THP can cause a range of side effects, it is less toxic than regimens that contain multiple chemotherapy drugs.

""The findings from this trial may ultimately help clinicians identify which patients with HER2+ breast cancer could be spared from the toxicity of more intensive chemotherapy,"" said Dr. Tung.

Groundbreaking research reveals how gut microbes and dietary soy can influence the outcome of cancer treatments, paving the way for a new frontier in personalized oncology.

Study: Microbiome metabolism of dietary phytochemicals controls the anticancer activity of PI3K inhibitors. Image Credit: CI Photos / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Cell, researchers demonstrated that phytochemicals and their microbiome-derived compounds regulate the anticancer activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (PI3Ki).

The findings challenge previous assumptions by demonstrating that the effectiveness of these drugs is not primarily governed by dietary carbohydrate content, but by the presence or absence of certain plant-derived compounds and their microbial metabolites.

Dietary interventions influence drug response and disease progression. Preclinical studies suggest that diets can slow tumor growth and improve anticancer drug activity.

The ketogenic diet (KD) has drawn attention for its ability to enhance therapeutic responses, even in pancreatic cancer. While KD does not affect pancreatic tumor growth, it synergizes with chemotherapy and PI3Ki, slowing tumor growth and prolonging survival.

However, this study reveals that the mechanism of synergy is independent of carbohydrate restriction and instead relates to dietary phytochemical content and the gut microbiome.

Diets differ in several aspects beyond their macronutrient composition. For instance, standard rodent chow contains unrefined foods (e.g., soybean, fish), but a rodent KD contains purified components (e.g., milk-derived casein, oils).

These purified diets differ from chow in various dimensions. Importantly, both ketogenic and control purified diets lack many phytochemicals present in standard chow, which are abundant in plant-based ingredients like soy.

Identifying which aspects of diets drive outcomes is essential when comparing diets differing in multiple dimensions.

Researchers created a carbohydrate-rich control purified diet (CPD) that matched chow in macronutrients but used purified ingredients. This allowed for direct comparison with chow to isolate the effects of phytochemicals.

The anticancer activity of a PI3K alpha-specific inhibitor, alpelisib, was tested on pancreatic KPC allografts in mice using both CPD and KD diets.

While the diets did not directly reduce tumor size, both CPD and KD sensitized tumors to alpelisib. KD combined with alpelisib resulted in weight loss, whereas CPD allowed mice to maintain their body weight.

This suggested that alpelisib was better tolerated with CPD. Similar trends were observed with other PI3K inhibitors and in breast cancer models. CPD's improved tolerability emerged as a therapeutic advantage.

Researchers hypothesized that microbiome changes might underlie the diet-PI3Ki synergy. They tested this using mice fed chow or CPD, treated with or without alpelisib and/or an antibiotic cocktail (ANVM).

Antibiotics alone did not affect tumor growth, but in chow-fed mice, they enhanced the efficacy of alpelisib to levels comparable to those seen with CPD. This effect was not further improved when antibiotics were added to CPD.

Among individual antibiotics, ampicillin showed the strongest effects, while vancomycin and metronidazole exhibited weaker effects. Neomycin showed no benefit.

Both KD and CPD increased alpelisib serum levels. The antibiotic cocktail also raised alpelisib levels in chow-fed mice, with ampicillin having the most impact.

The team found that maintaining higher trough drug levels (not just peak levels) was crucial for effective tumor control.

They ruled out microbial metabolism as a major factor after finding no breakdown of alpelisib by fecal bacteria in vitro. Instead, intravenous studies showed that CPD and antibiotics slowed alpelisib clearance, pointing to altered host metabolism.

Liver gene expression analysis showed that CPD, KD, and antibiotics all suppressed several drug-processing genes, including Cyp3a11, the mouse equivalent of human CYP3A4.

Ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, further increased drug exposure in chow-fed mice, confirming the liver's role in metabolizing alpelisib. Similar effects were observed in cynomolgus monkeys.

Researchers speculated that soy in chow induced Cyp3a11. They replaced casein with soy protein in CPD, which decreased drug exposure. This might stem from the protein or phytochemicals in soy isolate.

To separate these variables, a new CPD was designed using a soy phytochemical extract, while maintaining casein as the protein source. This also decreased drug exposure, indicating the role of soy-derived compounds.

Further experiments revealed that interactions among phytochemicals, microbiota, and liver enzymes shape PI3Ki effectiveness. Surprisingly, isoflavones were not the key compound.

Using a bioassay-guided approach, researchers identified soyasapogenol B (SSBag), a soy-derived microbiome metabolite, as the active constituent. Soyasaponins from soy are converted into soyasapogenols by the microbiome.

Soy contains two soyasaponins—SSA and SSB—converted into SSAag and SSBag, respectively. These aglycones are not present in chow but accumulate in mice fed soy-rich diets with intact microbiota.

Both SSAag and SSBag activate mouse PXR, which controls drug-processing genes. SSAag showed stronger activation. Mice fed CPD with just 0.1% SSA had increased Cyp3a11 expression and alpelisib metabolism.

This diet reduced the anticancer efficacy of alpelisib. Antibiotics reversed these effects, confirming the microbiome's role in producing active soyasaponin metabolites.

This study confirms that the synergy between ketogenic diets and PI3K inhibitors depends not on low carbohydrate intake, but on the absence of specific phytochemicals that alter drug metabolism.

Microbiome-derived soyasapogenols activate liver enzymes that metabolize PI3K inhibitors, reducing their effectiveness. Diets free of these phytochemicals maintain higher drug levels and improve tumor control.

Future research should identify the bacteria responsible for soyasapogenin production and explore whether their presence correlates with drug exposure and treatment response in humans.

Species-specific differences in metabolism necessitate further investigation for human translation.

Today's launch of the BioResolve Protein A Affinity Columns will help to bring lifesaving therapies to patients, faster. One of the main bottlenecks in the development of biotherapeutics like monoclonal antibodies is the time required to identify and optimize a suitable cell line for antibody production,

We have solved for this by designing a novel, highly efficient particle with an immobilized Protein A surface, and combined this with MaxPeak Premier Hardware, resulting in the most sensitive protein A column on the market.”

Dr. Udit Batra, President and Chief Executive Officer, Waters Corporation

The BioResolve Protein A Affinity Columns have been designed to provide up to 7x improvements in sensitivity compared to the market leader. The novel, non-porous 3.5 μm particles allow accurate quantitation of antibody titers at lower concentrations and with less sample. In addition, the columns have been designed to couple with size exclusion chromatography columns to measure titer concentrations and aggregate analysis in a single run on any LC system.

""The new column will enhance our ability to support our clients in developing new medicines,” said Arnaud Delobel, R&D and Innovation Director, Quality Assistance. “It simplifies two-dimensional workflows for simultaneous titer and aggregate analysis, and can be readily integrated into new LC/MS setups to analyze in-process antibody samples without prior purification. By streamlining workflows and enabling simultaneous assessment of multiple critical quality attributes, it helps cut project turnaround times and ultimately supports faster time to market for biologics.”

This innovation furthers the Company's commitment to enhancing the analytical toolbox for biomolecule characterization, allowing scientists to speed up the development of safe, efficacious, and accessible biotherapeutics.

The columns are available in 2.1 x 20 mm and 3.9 x 5 mm formats and are available to order now.

Clairity, Inc., a digital health innovator advancing AI-driven healthcare solutions, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) De Novo authorization for CLAIRITY BREAST, a novel, image-based prognostic platform designed to predict five-year breast cancer risk from a routine screening mammogram. With this authorization, Clairity is planning to launch among leading health systems through 2025 – propelling a new era of precision medicine in breast cancer.

Each year, more than 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide, including over 370,000 cases in women in the United States. Early detection and risk reduction are powerful tools to save lives, but their most effective deployment depends on accurate risk assessment. Most risk assessment models rely heavily on age and family history to predict risk. However, 85% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history, and nearly half have no identifiable risk factors. In addition, traditional risk models, built on data from predominantly European Caucasian women, have not generalized well to women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

CLAIRITY BREAST analyzes subtle imaging features on screening mammograms that correlate with future breast cancer risk, making early risk prediction feasible based on a screening mammogram alone. The result is a validated five-year risk score delivered to healthcare providers through existing clinical infrastructures, supporting more personalized follow up care.

For more than 60 years, mammograms have saved lives by detecting early-stage cancers. Now, advancements in AI and computer vision can uncover hidden clues in the mammograms – invisible to the human eye – to help predict future risk. By delivering validated, equitable risk assessments, we can help expand access to life-saving early detection and prevention for women everywhere.""

Dr. Connie Lehman, Founder of Clairity, breast imaging specialist at Mass General Brigham

""Personalized, risk-based screening is critical to improving breast cancer outcomes, and AI tools offer us the best opportunity to fulfill that potential,"" said Dr. Robert A. Smith, Senior Vice President of Early Cancer Detection Science at the American Cancer Society. ""By integrating AI models that assess individual risk, we can better identify women at higher risk, and those who may benefit from supplemental screening methods, such as MRI, improving early detection and more effective prevention strategies.""

""Clairity's FDA authorization is a turning point for more women to access the scientific advances of AI-driven cancer risk prediction,"" said Larry Norton, Founding Scientific Director of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. ""Breast cancer is rising, especially among younger women, yet most risk models often miss those who will develop the disease. Now we can ensure more women get the right care at the right time.""

""What makes the availability of CLAIRITY BREAST a true sea change is that we're now predicting risk of future cancer from patterns in breast tissue, in an otherwise normal screening, before it's even there,"" said Jeff Luber, CEO of Clairity. ""CLAIRITY BREAST is designed to fit seamlessly into the current clinical infrastructure to help providers scale precision prevention – with the goal of reducing late-stage diagnoses, lowering costs, and saving more lives.""

The FDA De Novo authorization positions CLAIRITY BREAST as a first-in-class platform within the $63 billion global breast cancer prediction market, ushering in a new standard for personalized, risk-based screening and cancer prevention.

Certain medications used in the treatment of bone conditions, particularly when combined with corticosteroids, may significantly increase the risk of a rare but serious jaw disease. This finding comes from a study by the University of Oulu, which analyzed data from Finnish adult patients who began bone medication between 2013 and 2015. The researchers recommend more careful monitoring and consideration in the use of such medications.

The condition in question is so-called osteonecrosis of the jaw, in which the jawbone weakens and deteriorates as a result of the medication. The incidence of osteonecrosis was 0.3% among low-dose antiresorptive drug (AR) users and as high as 9% among those receiving high doses. Antiresorptive drugs are commonly used in Finland, particularly in the treatment of osteoporosis and in the prevention of bone metastases in patients with breast or prostate cancer. The most commonly used AR drugs are denosumab and bisphosphonates.

According to the study, the risk of jaw osteonecrosis was significantly higher in patients using denosumab. These users were up to five times more likely to suffer serious jaw damage than those taking bisphosphonates. When corticosteroids were also involved, the risk increased further: simultaneous use of corticosteroids in addition to AR drug increased the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw by 2 times in high-dose AR recipients and 6 times in low-dose AR recipients. Other significant risk factors for jaw osteonecrosis included male sex and a cancer diagnosis.

This is the first population-level study conducted in Finland on the incidence and risk factors of medication-related jaw osteonecrosis. The analysis covered data from nearly 60,000 Finnish patients.

Our study confirms that denosumab is associated with a significantly higher risk of jaw osteonecrosis compared to bisphosphonates, but the difference in risk between the two was surprisingly large. It was also particularly surprising how strongly the simultaneous use of corticosteroids increased the risk in patients on low-dose bone medication.”

Miika Kujanpää, doctoral researcher, University of Oulu and dentist

The researchers recommend that patient treatment plans be reviewed more carefully when multiple medications are in use, particularly denosumab and corticosteroids together. They also emphasise the role of oral health care in reducing risks – for example, the condition of teeth and gums should be checked both before and during bone medication treatment.

After downing China PR, 3-0, on May 31 in Minnesota, the USWNT takes on Jamaica on June 3 to finish the two-game set during this FIFA window. The match kicks off at Engerizer Park in St. Louis, Mo. at 7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET (TNT, Max, Universo and Peacock in Spanish and Westwood One Sports on radio).

These matches serve as yet another chance for USWNT head coach Emma Hayes and her staff to continue to evaluate the player pool in the lead up to the largest event in global women's sports in 2027 when the FIFA Women's World Cup comes to Brazil.

Here's what you need to know before watching the USA face Jamaica:

Forward Catarina Macario has been lights out scoring in the last three international windows since her return from injury. An ACL tear kept Macario away from the USWNT for two years, but she's come out hot for the USA.

However, that hasn't stopped Macario from wanting even more of her performance.

“Cat, she's been tough on herself,” Hayes said. “I mean, she got a goal and her all-round play was good. She wanted it at a higher level and that's okay. She can aspire to that, but she's a wonderful football player and we're blessed to have her.”

Macario, slotted as the No. 9, scored and assisted in the 3-0 win against China PR. It was Macario's third goal of 2025, making her the USWNT leading scorer of the year.

Legendary centerback Becky Sauerbrunn will be honored before kickoff in her hometown. Sauerbrunn retired at the end of 2024 after a 16-year career, which included two FIFA Women's World Cup championships and an Olympic gold medal in 2012.

Sauerbrunn's impact on the ethos of the USWNT has lasted, even if the defender hasn't played for the National Team since February 2024. Midfielder Lindsey Horan, when faced with making decisions, often asks herself, “What would Becky do?”

That's a legacy that a quiet leader like Sauerbrunn, a self-described “player's player” hoped to leave behind.

“I can say this without hesitation, I've got a locker room — not just the senior players — but less experienced players that talk about Becky in the highest esteem, both as a leader and as a human being,” Hayes said. “I don't think you could want anything more than that in life, and to have people talk about you like that.”

In addition to the pre-match ceremony honoring Sauerbrunn, the first 2,000 fans at Energizer Park will get a free bobblehead celebrating one of the USA's best all-time defenders.

Hayes' vision has been clear — continue to develop the USWNT player pool from young players to mainstays.

So, while the staff is on track to decide on the USA's core group of players that will represent team in World Cups and Olympics, she's called up younger rosters in 2025, allowing players to get exposure and experience at the international level.

While that comes with challenges, Hayes has preached patience, and it's now starting to yield results. In the fourth camp of the year, younger players like Lily Yohannes (17) and Claire Hutton (19), just to name a few, have shown well.

“When you're trying to put together so many new players, as a coach, you want to make sure that every time you're with them, you're making less and less tactical corrections,” Hayes said. “This week, we've made less than we've ever had to make.”

This will be just the sixth time the U.S. Women's National Team faces Jamaica. The Americans hold a 5W-0L-0D record over the Reggae Girlz. Each game, the U.S. has finished a shutout and scored at least four goals. In their first meeting in 1994, the USA won 10-0.

The most recent meeting, the U.S. won 5-0 in the 2022 Concacaf W Championship group stage, which clinched its berth to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Sophia Wilson, Rose Lavelle, Kristie Mewis and Trinity Rodman scored for the U.S. side.

This match may close this international window, but the USWNT will be back on together later this summer with three more matches.

First the Americans will take on the Republic of Ireland in a pair of friendlies on June 26 and 29 in Commerce City, Colo. and Cincinnati, Ohio, respectively. Then the USA will battle Canada — the USWNT's most frequent opponent — in the Nation's capital to round of the summer matches July 6.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Mauricio Pochettino takes notes from Emma Hayes as USMNT target World Cup glory","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/mauricio-pochettino-emma-hayes-usmnt-1187087","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 16:47:00 GMT","

As the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil rapidly nears, Mauricio Pochettino believes the U.S. Men's National Team doesn't have to look far for inspiration.

Since 2002, the USMNT has not reached further than the Round of 16 at a World Cup, with their best ever performance at the tournament, a third place finish, having come at the inaugural competition almost a century ago in 1930.

By comparison, the USWNT has been crowned World Cup winners on four occasions since the tournament debuted in 1991.

In a recent interview with USMNT legends Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast, Pochettino explained how he believes his side should look to the USWNT for inspiration as he works to help his side believe they can succeed at the World Cup.

“I think we have a good example to follow,” Pochettino said. “I've seen the Women's Team for the first time, winners of the World Cup, the mentality, and the belief. I talk a lot with Emma [Hayes]. We have a good example there.”

Pochettino believes the onus is on himself and his staff to help the USMNT follow in the footsteps of Hayes' side, in building their self-belief and confidence.

He explained how he sees that there is a winning culture embedded within American culture, citing the Olympics, business, and politics as examples. As such, Pochettino wants to help his team adopt a similar mentality, as the USWNT has already done, in order to help unlock their potential.

“We are here not to change the culture because your culture is amazing,” he said. “The most important thing is to try to be here and to build some things, some ideas, some philosophy to say, yes, that is a way to compete and to match the other big countries, because I think that is the culture of the country.”

Along with a winning mentality, Pochettino also believes it's his job to instill a culture of wanting to prioritize playing for your country, as he believes is already the case with other national teams, citing Argentina, England, and Spain as examples.

Looking back at some of the players he has coached, Pochettino noted how Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Kylian Mbappe are all “desperate” to represent their countries, adding that to them, it makes no difference whether the opportunity comes at a World Cup or in a friendly.

“For them, when they go, they don't see if it's a friendly game, it's an official game, it's a World Cup, it doesn't matter,” he said. “Because the possibility to defend one time, one time more, your flag, your shirt, is about feeling proud, you know about that.”

Pochettino went on to explain how he wants his players “to feel proud, to feel the passion, to be desperate to play, to put the ego aside when you arrive to the national team, outside. I think that is the most important thing, that I think is our responsibility.”

But while there is clearly a lot for the players to work on, Pochettino also noted how important it is that the pressure isn't too crushing.

“Soccer or football is about enjoying [yourself], it's about not putting too much pressure on the player because the player needs to perform and [have] more freedom, and they are, if they are happy, they can express their talent,” Pochettino explained.

Thankfully for the Argentine, he no longer has to wait to get to work instilling his values within his players. Having recently named his 27-man roster for their upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, Pochettino is hard at work preparing for their doubleheader, with one eye on the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which will kick off on June 15.

The U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes will mark one year on the job as the squad closes out the international window against Jamaica on Tuesday. 

Originally slated as a two-game series against China, the change in opponent reintroduces a familiar Concacaf neighbor with the Reggae Girlz. The Stars and Stripes will square off against Jamaica at Energizer Park in St. Louis. The United States is coming off a 3-0 win over China on Saturday, and Jamaica is coming off an April window with two losses against regional rivals Mexico.

Hayes and her squad will aim for a two-game shutout after splitting the April series against Brazil with a 2-0 win and a 2-1 loss. With one win against China already in the books to ring in the summer, the coaching staff is still evaluating the roster pool, and players are still earning first caps with the squad. Midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta made her debut at 32 years old on Saturday, while defender Kerry Abello and goalkeeper Claudia Dickey could get their first caps on Tuesday evening. 

Jamaica's difficult April window saw the team concede seven goals over two losses to Mexico. Head coach Hubert Busby Jr. will be without top striker Bunny Shaw, midfielder Drew Spence, and veteran goalkeeper Rebeca Spencer. The manager has not put a timeline for Shaw's return as she continues her recovery from a foot injury. 

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

Tuesday's meeting will be the sixth all time fixture between the two teams. The USWNT has won all five previous matches against the Reggae Girls. Most recently, the two sides faced each other during the 2022 Concacaf W Championship, which served as the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualifier. The U.S. national team dominated the match and won 5-0 with goals scored by Sophia Wilson, Rose Lavelle, Kristie Mewis, and Trinity Rodman.

The group was tested in the opening five minutes of their match against China, but eventually found the breakthrough just ahead of the half-hour mark. The USWNT won the match convincingly, 3-0, with lots more glimpses of in-game awareness and quicker decision making when they were presented with a higher pressing China side instead of a more structured and defensive formation. 

Still, ever the high-performance machine, some of the players were already demanding more of themselves during the postgame mixed zones, and for Hayes, it's a reflection of the group's tactical evolution. The more they're in scenarios where they've got to find solutions, the better. 

""When you're trying to put together so many new players, as a coach, you want to make sure that every time you're with them, you're making less and less tactical corrections, and this week, we've made less than we've ever had to make. Because Avery Patterson knows where to be [on] both sides of the ball. So does Lily [Yohannes], so does Michelle Cooper, so that in return, means the group as a whole can go up higher level, because they're getting better at their understanding of that."" Hayes said after the match against China.

""But I'm asking them to deliver a performance with a level of patience, so, I'm not going to criticize them for that. I feel like tactically, we've gone up another level. I really feel that way. I feel that there's so many more players that are so much more in control that we're able to do more.""

As Jamaica works on its build-up to the next World Cup cycle, head coach Hubert Busby Jr. is in a similar position of trying to evaluate the talent pool while multiple experienced players are unavailable this window. The program has been through many ups and downs, as it tries to capitalize on the success of the two previous World Cup appearances. 

A two-game losing streak against Mexico sent some concerns across faithful supporters of the island, but Busby is insistent that the group is heading in the right direction with fixtures against Concacaf rivals and a game in England against the Lionesses at the end of the month. 

""As we kind of moved from that game into this one, we looked at a couple of things, and some different players into different positions, you know, and we had conversations about players and looking to try things. It's what these games are about. We know we have our strengths, we have our deficiencies, but we have to be able to utilize these games. I know everyone wants to win every single match. That's what we're here for ... but these games are for us to be able to experiment and try things. We can't do them in World Cup qualifiers, right? So we have to be able to have this full picture of what it is,"" he said after announcing the Raggae Girls roster.

""There's all these little puzzle pieces that we have to be able to little jigsaw pieces that we have to be able to put together, that allows for us to seal this finished product. And again, it's not, we're not anywhere close to where it should be, yet, I think we're on the process of getting done ... It is always about progression. Even in that progression, it might not seem like it, because the results might not show, but we take the information and we extract it, and we have a better understanding of where we are, and we can put it in our toolbox, and we can file it away.""

USWNT: Claudia Dickey; Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sams, Kerry Abello; Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Lindsey Heaps; Catatrina Macario, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson

Jamaica: Sydney Schneider; Naya Cardoza, Chantelle Swaby, Allyson Swaby, Konya Plummer; Deneisha Blackwood, Olufolasade Adamolekun, Amelia Van Zanten, Atlanta Primus; Tiffany Cameron, Jody Brown

Claire Hutton, USWNT: The deep-lying midfielder has been involved in USWNT camps throughout 2025 and has already made two appearances. The 19-year-old Kansas City Current player has been a crucial cog in the middle third for the club, functioning as collaborator and disruptor, while notching two assists and creating five chances. Yohannes is developing good chemistry in her matches this year, and the U.S. coaching staff might want to see more games between the two teenagers.

The USWNT prepared for a an organized defense against China and were presented with something else. They might be over prepped for a Jamaica side that typically faces them in a mid to low block. It might be another lopsided match with so many of Jamaica's key players unavailable. Pick: USWNT 3, Jamaica 0

TOPICS:

With roughly one year to go before the United States (along with Mexico and Canada) hosts the 2026 FIFA World Cup, questions have emerged about the state of the U.S. Men's Soccer Team.  A poor performance in last summer's Copa America tournament followed by a 4th place finish this past March in the CONCACAF Nations League has injected seeds of doubt over this group's readiness to take on the world's best in what will perhaps be the most important tournament in American soccer history.

This summer's Gold Cup (being played in the U.S. from June 14th through July 6th) was supposed to serve as a final opportunity for the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) to come together and right the ship prior to 2026.  But several key absences from first team regulars means uncertainty around the squad will linger well beyond the tournament's conclusion.  The most high profile of those absences is star attacker Christian Pulisic who plays his club soccer for Italy's AC Milan.  Coming off back-to-back seasons of 50 games played, Pulisic asked for this summer off so as to rest and recuperate with the hope of maximizing his chances of being healthy for next summer's World Cup.



On the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the two former American soccer stars sat down with current USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino who said the decision for Pulisic not to come was a collective one.

“We cannot force the player to come. But I think I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision, you know, to try to find the best for the national team and for the best for the player.

“Sometimes, you need to put the interests (of the team) in a maybe medium-long term than in the present.”

Despite Pochettino's insistence that the decision for Pulisic to miss the Gold Cup was collective, he made clear that it is his job to ensure the players are prioritizing the national team.

“That is a responsibility of us (the staff), that the (players) need to prioritize the national team. We were talking about Argentine player, or Brazilian player, or English player, or Spanish player. They are desperate – even (Lionel) Messi, even Neymar, even (Kylian) Mbappe for France; we were working with these guys, Harry Kane (as well). These guys are desperate to go to the national team.”

With Pulisic and other projected starters like Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun all unavailable for the tournament, is the goal still to win or is it simply to use this as a period of player evaluation?

“We need to win,” said Pochettino.  “We need to win because... I was... I feel so bad, so [expletive], that is the word, when we lose against Panama (in the Nations League). And then the second game (against Canada) was how it was, no? But in the same time, in a parallel way, I think it's a great opportunity for many players to show we are here and we want to fight for a place in the World Cup.”

The United States' first Gold Cup match occurs on June 15th against Trinidad & Tobago in San Jose, California.

The US men's national team host Türkiye on Saturday afternoon in their first of two international friendlies ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's 27-man roster includes 16 players from Major League Soccer, giving veterans and rising stars alike the chance to impress against a high-level European team.

After facing Türkiye, the USMNT will quickly pivot to a June 10 friendly vs. Switzerland at Nashville SC's GEODIS Park. They'll begin their Gold Cup group on June 15 against Trinidad & Tobago at San Jose's PayPal Park.

Can Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna continue his rise on the international stage? He's tallied 8g/4a through 16 games for RSL after being named the 2024 MLS Young Player of the Year.

Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps FC) and Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC) will vie for the starting No. 9 role, while FC Cincinnati center back Miles Robinson and Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Zack Steffen are also hoping to crack Pochettino's XI.

Amid breakout seasons, Orlando City right back Alex Freeman, Philadelphia Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan and Vancouver midfielder Sebastian Berhalter are all in their first USMNT camp.

The USMNT's June roster is light on big-name European stars, with AC Milan forward Christian Pulisic (fatigue) and Fulham defender Antonee Robinson (injury) both absent. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund midfielder Gio Reyna and the Juventus duo of Tim Weah and Weston McKennie have FIFA Club World Cup obligations.

Türkiye are ranked No. 27 in the latest FIFA World Rankings and are on track to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup after finishing as quarterfinalists at UEFA Euro 2024.

USMNT star joins community to dedicate second of three mini-pitches aimed at fostering youth participation

PHILADELPHIA, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allstate, in partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation, unveiled a new mini-pitch on Saturday, May 31, at Bell Avenue Elementary School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania. The initiative, part of a multi-year collaboration with U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Tyler Adams, aims to increase access to safe, engaging play spaces for youth in underserved communities.

 

More than 75 children, ages 9 to 12, participated in a youth clinic led by grassroots partner Black Star, a national community platform focused on accelerating the growth and visibility of Black soccer players, coaches and fans.

""As part of our ongoing commitment to youth empowerment, Allstate is proud to support initiatives that create safer spaces and more opportunities for young athletes to thrive,"" said Elizabeth Brady, executive vice president and chief marketing, customer and communications officer at Allstate. ""This mini-pitch is more than just a place to play, it's a foundation for building stronger, more connected communities.""

The event featured a block party with local food trucks, a DJ, inflatable soccer games and an appearance by Adams, who participated in the unveiling and engaged with youth and families throughout the day. The Philadelphia-area pitch is the second installation in a three-year partnership between Allstate and Adams, who are donating one mini-pitch annually to underserved communities across the country. The first was unveiled in 2024 at Fisher Academy in Detroit.

Mini-pitches are hard-court surfaces designed for both pickup and organized play and have proven to be powerful tools in helping kids stay active, improving public safety and providing accessible, permanent spaces to grow the game.

""Partnering with Allstate to create this mini-pitch means a lot to me, not just because it's about soccer, but because it's about access,"" said Adams. ""Growing up, I didn't always have facilities like this. So being able to give kids in communities like Yeadon a safe place to play, grow and dream — that's what it's all about.""

""We are thrilled to continue our work with Tyler and Allstate to bring mini-pitches to more communities across the country,"" said Ed Foster-Simeon, president and CEO of the U.S. Soccer Foundation. ""Tyler is committed to ensuring that more young people have safe places to play the game. We are delighted to help bring this project to fruition and we know that it will have a positive impact on children for years to come.""

Black Star, a national community platform focused on accelerating the growth and visibility of Black soccer players, coaches and fans, helped lead the clinic and community outreach for the event.

""This partnership with Allstate and Tyler is a step forward in ensuring soccer is accessible, inclusive and inspiring for all youth, no matter where they come from,"" said Patrick Rose, director, Black Star and cultural marketing at For Soccer. ""By activating in communities like Yeadon, we're investing in long-term development and opportunity for generations to come.""

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has said that Christian Pulisic can become the American equivalent of Lionel Messi with the World Cup coming to the U.S. next summer.

Pulisic is already an all-time USMNT great at age 26 and has the opportunity to cement his legacy at the 2026 World Cup. With 32 international goals, Pulisic has already entered the top five among USMNT all-time goalscorers.

The AC Milan star has opted to take this summer off, however, sitting out the Gold Cup to rest after a second consecutive 50-appearance season with his club side.

Though Pulisic's decision has caused controversy, Pochettino said that it was taken with the World Cup in mind.

""Christian is a very nice guy and very committed to the national team, and of course he's desperate to play the World Cup and arrive in the best condition,"" Pochettino said on the ""Unfiltered Soccer"" podcast with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.

""I think [skipping the Gold Cup] was the best decision to help him, because every player is in different circumstances ... But sometimes you have to put the interests of the long term ahead of the present.”

Though U.S. Soccer said that Pulisic came to the federation with the idea to take a break, Pochettino insisted that the decision was ultimately made collectively.

""We can't force the player to come,"" he said, ""but I need to be fair and say it was a collective decision to try and find the best for the national team and the best for the player.""

Pulisic will now be under even more pressure to deliver next summer at an event that can shape his legacy as a player — much like the 2022 World Cup did for Messi.

After another standout campaign with AC Milan, Pochettino believes that Pulisic can match Messi's level of notoriety in the United States — if not necessarily his World Cup-winning performance in Qatar.

""Christian in the last year has shown great quality. He's performing in Europe, and also is performing here in the national team. He's a very talented player that can help us win,"" the Argentine said.

""People compare Messi with Christian Pulisic. I don't want to be disrespectful with Messi or Pulisic but I think in this country, Pulisic should be our Messi. Because he's iconic player and if you ask a kid on the street to name one soccer player in this country, it's Pulisic.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Watch: Lionel Messi stars in FIFA Club World Cup commercial for Michelob Ultra","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2025/06/03/lionel-messi-fifa-club-world-cup-michelob-ultra/83991180007/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:06:31 GMT","

Lionel Messi has scored another Michelob Ultra commercial – this one timed to the FIFA Club World Cup.

If you are a fan of football or fútbol, you likely remember the Michelob Ultra commercial from 2024's Super Bowl featuring the Argentina and Inter Miami superstar, Jason Sudeikis and NFL great Dan Marino in which Messi joins a game of beach soccer when the Michelob Ultra tap goes dry.

In this new commercial, titled ""Superior Hotel,"" Messi competes in a one-on-one soccer match for the lone Michelob Ultra in the hotel bar refrigerator. The 30-second ad will appear on social media – including on YouTube – and air during broadcasts throughout the FIFA Club World Cup. The international tournament starts June 14 with Messi and Inter Miami taking on Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

Messi is perfect fit for Michelob Ultra, said Ricardo Marques, senior vice president of marketing for Michelob Ultra.

""A global soccer icon like Messi helps fuel the significant momentum and growth both soccer and Michelob Ultra have been experiencing across the U.S.,"" he said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""Messi is the biggest soccer star of our time and is the perfect embodiment of our brand's point of view and brings excitement to some of soccer's most passionate fans during some of the sport's most competitive tournaments.""

As the official beer sponsor of the FIFA Club World Cup, Michelob Ultra will also present the Superior Player of the Match Trophy, awarded after each game – the brand sponsored the award during last year's Copa America 2024. Michelob Ultra will also sponsor the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Michelob Ultra pop-up beer gardens and pitchside clubs will be found at the 12 host stadiums, too. Fans can enter online to win a chance to sit in the Michelob Ultra Pitchside Club in New York City for the semifinals and final.

""The FIFA Club World Cup is an opportunity to continue to make our brand synonymous with one of the world's most beloved sports by elevating the fan experience this summer and into 2026,"" Marques said.

There's no rest for the wicked, they say—and that's certainly true for soccer players, especially those from the world's biggest clubs.

With the domestic season having only just wrapped up (or in some cases, still ongoing), a host of top teams now have just a matter of weeks to prepare before going at it again—this time at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Held in the United States from June 15 to July 13, this edition marks a major turning point for the tournament. With a brand new format featuring 32 teams instead of the usual seven, a fresh trophy, and a massive prize pot on offer, clubs will be fighting for far more than just summer bragging rights.

But given the tournament's relatively low-key past—often treated as an afterthought by both fans and clubs—many might not be familiar with how it works.

So what exactly is the Club World Cup? How do teams qualify? And how does the new format play out? Here, we break it all down.

The 2025 Club World Cup will feature clubs from all six of FIFA's continental confederations—UEFA (Europe), CONMEBOL (South America), AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), Concacaf (North and Central America), and OFC (Oceania)—each competing for a shot at international glory.

Each confederation has been allocated a set number of qualification spots, with Europe leading the way with 12 teams, followed by South America with six. Asia, Africa, and North/Central America are each represented by four teams, while Oceania receives just one.

Qualification is determined by performance in each region's premier club competition—such as the UEFA Champions League for European sides, or the Concacaf Champions Cup in North America––with recent winners guaranteed a spot and other consistently strong performers rounding out the selection.

As host nation, the United States also receives one automatic place in the tournament. That honor has been granted to Inter Miami, meaning Lionel Messi will be making an appearance on the world stage once again—this time in his adopted homeland.

As for the tournament format, the 32 qualified teams will be divided into eight groups of four. Each team plays the others in its group once, with the top two from each group advancing to the Round of 16. 

From that point on, it follows a familiar knockout structure—quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final—with all matches played as single-leg ties, adding extra pressure and excitement to every round.

The Club World Cup initially launched in 2000, but it hasn't always been a consistent fixture on the soccer calendar––taking a hiatus between 2001 and 2005, and again in 2024––and has undergone several changes in format and structure over the years.

Since its inception, there have been 20 editions of the tournament, producing 12 different champions—with some clubs winning it just once, and others dominating on multiple occasions.

As with the UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid stand tall as the most successful club in the competition's history, having lifted the trophy five times—first in 2014, then again in 2016, 2017, 2018, and most recently in 2022.

Below, we've listed all the past Club World Cup winners, sorted by the number of titles they've claimed.

In previous years, clubs have arguably treated the Club World Cup as little more than a post-season exhibition—a cool-down or a global showcase. But with FIFA's new revamp, the 2025 edition promises to be bigger, more competitive, and more meaningful than ever before.

First, there's the money. With a total prize pot of $1 billion, clubs will earn a significant sum simply for participating—and even more for advancing deep into the tournament. That kind of revenue can go a long way: helping clubs fund new signings, invest in infrastructure, or improve overall operations. This financial boost could prove especially vital for smaller clubs, particularly those from less wealthy federations like Oceania or Africa.

Second, comes the global spotlight. With increased attention, broadcasting reach, and media coverage, teams that aren't used to large international audiences will get a unique opportunity to showcase themselves on a massive stage. That exposure could be career-changing for players, coaches, and entire clubs—and might even help launch the next global superstar.

Lastly, the tournament arrives at a valuable moment in the calendar. Taking place during the summer, it allows clubs to stay sharp in the off-season, test new ideas, integrate recent signings, and give younger squad members valuable competitive experience—all while playing in a high-stakes environment.

The main broadcaster of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is DAZN, which in December 2024 acquired the global rights to the tournament in a landmark €1 billion deal. DAZN will stream all matches for free and has also sublicensed rights to select local broadcasters.

Among those local broadcasters is Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, which will air 23 matches, and TNT Sports in the U.S., which will show 24 games.

In China, streaming platform Migu secured the broadcast rights directly in a separate deal covering two editions of the tournament, as DAZN does not currently operate in the Chinese market.

Real Madrid have the ultimate opportunity to bounce back from a poor 2024–25 campaign at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

The pressure is on Xabi Alonso to lead Real Madrid to silverware after the club failed to win a major trophy in Carlo Ancelotti's final season in charge. The new manager will make his debut on the touchline for the Spanish giants at the newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup, where Real Madrid are one of the favorites to win the competition. 

Along with the star-power of Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham, Alonso will also have new signings Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen to call upon in this summer's tournament. A trophy would be a dream start to Alonso's reign at the biggest club in the world.

Here's everything you need to know about Real Madrid's 2025 FIFA Club World Cup campaign. 

Real Madrid are competing in Group H. Check out the full list of their opponents below, including kick-off times and stadiums across the United States.

Real Madrid kick off their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup berth against Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Then, Los Blancos are set to travel to North Carolina to take on Pachuca. The two sides most recently faced off the in the FIFA Intercontinental final, where Real Madrid secured a 3–0 victory.

Four days later, Alonso's men will complete their group stage campaign against RB Salzburg, another team they already played this past season. Real Madrid walked away with a 5–1 victory over the Austrian outfit in the Champions League league phase.

On paper, Real Madrid have the star-studded squad capable of making it to the final on July 13, but they will have to get past several formidable opponents to do so. With the new defending European champions Paris Saint-Germain just one of the European powerhouses competing in the tournament, Los Blancos will have to rediscover their once dominant form to take home the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup trophy.

Real Madrid is working to finalize several important signings before the Club World Cup. Huijsen and Alexander Arnold are already confirmed and they're negotiating for Álvaro Carreras with Benfica. However, it seems that things won't stop at just these three names.

Josep Pedrerol has spoken and pointed out two more signings that Real Madrid will make. In this case, though, it will be after this summer's Club World Cup. But there will be two more additions joining the three defenders he already takes for granted.

""Real Madrid is considering signing a midfielder and a forward"" the journalist stated. Although Pedrerol wanted to make it clear that ""it won't be before the Club World Cup, it'll be afterwards"". Those are the moves they're already preparing in the halls of Bernabéu.

Pedrerol has indicated that the first moves have taken place in defense out of necessity. The three signings before the Club World Cup have been in the back line because it was the most weakened. Within the white club, they believed that in order to win the title this summer, it was the priority they needed to address.

Xabi Alonso has been clear about the signings he wants brought in this summer for next season. Beyond the defense, where they've strengthened in every position. A midfielder and a forward were also other positions he considers important.

A playmaker has been one of his major demands for next season. With Kroos's retirement last summer and Modric's departure this year, they've lost quality in the midfield. Angelo Stiller is the name that stands out the most to solve this problem.

In attack, a forward like Joselu has been missed for matches that became complicated. A ""tank"" in the box, able to bring down balls and with the opposing goal always in mind. Maybe this isn't the priority right now, but Xabi Alonso has also requested it.

In two weeks, Real Madrid will embark on their first challenge under new manager Xabi Alonso as they kickstart their FIFA Club World Cup campaign in the USA.

Heading into the tournament, winning which can be very lucrative for the club, Real Madrid are dealing with a plethora of fitness problems to key players.

There is hope that some players like Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and Antonio Rudiger could recover in time for the tournament but there are others who might not be ready.

Indeed, according to journalist Melchor Ruiz of COPE, as many as four Real Madrid players will not be playing any part in the Club World Cup this summer.

Two defenders – David Alaba and Ferland Mendy, along with midfielder Eduardo Camavinga and young striker Endrick will all be unable to participate in the inaugural expanded edition of the tournament.

Alaba, having recovered from an ACL injury only a few months ago, had to undergo knee surgery again due to a meniscus tear. While there was hope that he could return in time for the competition, it appears that the Austrian will not make it.

Mendy, on the other hand, is has been out for over a month due to a thigh injury and is unlikely to return for almost two more months, ruling him out of the trip to the USA.

Meanwhile, Camavinga has been out of action since late April due to an adductor tear with his recovery expected to last for multiple months. As such, he will not play any part in the Club World Cup and hope to return in time for the start of the new season.

Endrick suffered an injury late in the season, in the game against Sevilla and will be out for a period of two months, leaving him with no chance of playing at the Club World Cup.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

GARY LINEKER has agreed a deal with a new broadcaster after leaving the BBC.

The presenter stepped back from hosting Match of the Day after 26 years in the hotseat at the end of the Premier League season just over a week ago.

He has now agreed a deal with DAZN that will see his The Rest Is Football Podcast broadcast highlights of the Club World Cup.

The show, which features Alan Shearer and Micah Richards as co-hosts, will show the best bits from matches in the video version of the podcast.

DAZN chief Pete Oliver said: ""The Rest Is Football is essential viewing and listening for fans who want insight, entertainment, and personality.

""This partnership is a brilliant way to bring the Fifa Club World Cup even closer to that audience.

“It's about connecting global football with the voices fans trust and love, and showing the tournament in a fresh, exciting, and authentically British way.”

The Club World Cup begins on June 15 and it is being held in the US.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has revamped the tournament to include 32 teams, with Chelsea and Manchester City flying the flag for England. 

Streaming giants DAZN are the event's global rights holder and will broadcast all 63 matches for free.

Channel 5 will also show 23 live games after striking a sub-licencing agreement.

Lineker's Rest Is Football Podcast was removed from the BBC's streaming service last week following the former England striker's departure from the company.

It comes amid a bitter end to his time at the Beeb as Match of the Day chiefs dealt him a final snub just hours before his farewell show.

The Sun exclusively revealed that they decided to axe his last interview with Liverpool star Mo Salah without warning due to fears he would say something controversial about Gaza.

Lineker issued an apology last month after sharing a pro-Gaza video that likened supporters of Israel to rats.

He has since been enjoying some time off in Ibiza, attending his son Harry's wedding and appearing to put his feud with brother Wayne aside during celebrations.

It has always been Lineker's plan to expand his podcast empire after his BBC departure, saying: ""Professionally, I've got a big podcast company and I think it takes up quite a bit of my time and it will probably take up a bit more now.

“It's really exciting and it's a lot of fun. We're doing really well. I don't think I'll do much television.""

Gary Lineker has moved his popular podcast to streaming platform DAZN following his departure from the BBC.

The deal will see his ‘The Rest is Football' show further bolstered by the inclusion of footage from the FIFA Club World Cup in what will be a video version of the show.

Lineker, who hosts the podcast alongside Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, will see the show collaborate with DAZN which has the broadcasting rights to this summer's tournament in the United States.

It comes after the podcast was removed from the BBC's audio streaming system last week following Lineker's exit from the corporation.

The former Match of the Day host left his role following a social media disagreement after he shared a post about Zionism.

The post featured a depiction of a rat which has historical links to anti-semitism.

Lineker subsequently apologised before announcing that alongside his previously announced Match of the Day exit, he would no longer host the BBC's coverage of the 2026 World Cup or next season's FA Cup.

Pete Oliver, chief executive of growth markets at DAZN, said: ""The Rest Is Football is essential viewing and listening for fans who want insight, entertainment, and personality - and this partnership is a brilliant way to bring the FIFA Club World Cup even closer to that audience.

""It's about connecting global football with the voices fans trust and love, and showing the tournament in a fresh, exciting, and authentically British way.""

Lineker and co will line up to provide their analysis of the revamped FIFA competition in which 32 teams will battle it out to be crowned World Champions.

Teams from each of the six international football confederations will be present at the Club World Cup.

Europe will be represented by 12 clubs which act as the highest quota of all the confederations with the places decided by Champions League performances over the past four seasons.

Therefore, England's representatives will be Chelsea and Manchester City – Champions League winners in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

Meanwhile, other European teams have qualified via a UEFA ranking system based on clubs' performances over the four seasons.

A maximum of two clubs per country can qualify meaning Liverpool missed out despite reaching the Champions League final in 2022.Both Asia and Africa were awarded four club places each as were the North and Central America federation.

South American clubs were handed six places and Oceania one.

Newly-crowned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain have the opportunity to claim world dominance as they look to continue their incredible 2024/25 campaign.

The French giants face off against Atletico Madrid, Brazilian outfit Botafogo and MLS side Seattle Sounders in the group phase of the competition.

Elsewhere, Manchester City will play Wydad FC, Al-Ain and Juventus, while Chelsea face Espérance Sportive de Tunis, Flamengo and Los Angeles FC.

It's not cheap to plant grass.

When the FIFA Men's World Cup comes to Seattle next year, Lumen Field will play host to six games, all of which will be played on a natural grass field.

It'll be the first time the stadium will have grass as its primary playing surface and the cost of installing and maintaining the field was the bulk of $19.4 million approved by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson late last month.

The money from the state also included funding toward infrastructure improvements at the stadium, security around the venue and for transportation to help get fans to and from the games.

“We're very pleased with the cooperation. The representatives around the state all saw value in bringing the World Cup to Seattle and the state of Washington,” said Peter Tomozawa, the CEO of Seattle's World Cup organizing committee. “We did numbers of presentations as to what this could mean for the state, what this could mean for our city, and we're super pleased, especially in this incredibly tough budget environment, that we got the funding that we needed to put in the grass to get the stadium ready and sort of the capital requirements that were necessary.”

Nearly 30 years ago, the language in the public referendum that approved the funding mechanism for the construction of Lumen Field stipulated that local officials would pursue the opportunity for the stadium to host World Cup games should there become the chance.

That opportunity will come next summer when Seattle is slated to host four group-stage games — including one game featuring the United States — one game in the round of 32 and one game in the round of 16.

But it's not a cheap endeavor and one of the biggest expenditures is the installation of the grass field that will take place after the completion of the 2025 NFL season. It will temporarily replace the artificial surface used for games involving the Seahawks, Sounders and Reign, but will only be used for the World Cup matches. That cost includes installation, irrigation and additional equipment to help maintain the health of a grass field at a venue that's never had grass as the primary surface in its history.

After the tournament, an artificial surface is expected to be reinstalled before the start of the 2026 NFL season.

Some of the funding will also help with the replacement of seats in the Hawks Nest in the north end of the stadium as FIFA requires all seats include a seat back. Those will remain after the tournament leaves along with other infrastructure improvements around the stadium.

“Everything the state is funding in capital for the stadium are all things that meet FIFA requirements, but also serve a broader purpose for the stadium ongoing,” said April Putney, chief strategy officer for the local organizing committee. “None of it is just something that is beneficial for the tournament itself. It's all things that will provide ongoing benefit and help the stadium, either with attracting future events or solving the ongoing needs that they have.”

There was also funding from the state for $1.7 million in upgrades to the soccer facilities at the University of Washington and another $100,000 for upgrades at Gonzaga. Seattle U and UW will be used as practice fields for teams while they are in town. Gonzaga is under consideration as a potential base camp for a country who could end up playing the majority of its matches on the West Coast with games set to be played in Seattle, Vancouver, B.C., the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles.

There is also expected to be additional funding coming from the federal level eventually. Seattle and the rest of the host cities in the U.S. were part of a unified request from the federal government for funding related to security around the games. Seattle's portion of the federal request was $31.5 million to go along with $2.75 million already allocated from the state, Putney said.

Lionel Messi has scored another Michelob Ultra commercial – this one timed to the FIFA Club World Cup.

If you are a fan of football or fútbol, you likely remember the Michelob Ultra commercial from 2024's Super Bowl featuring the Argentina and Inter Miami superstar, Jason Sudeikis and NFL great Dan Marino in which Messi joins a game of beach soccer when the Michelob Ultra tap goes dry.

In this new commercial, titled ""Superior Hotel,"" Messi competes in a one-on-one soccer match for the lone Michelob Ultra in the hotel bar refrigerator. The 30-second ad will appear on social media – including on YouTube – and air during broadcasts throughout the FIFA Club World Cup. The international tournament starts June 14 with Messi and Inter Miami taking on Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

Messi is perfect fit for Michelob Ultra, said Ricardo Marques, senior vice president of marketing for Michelob Ultra.

""A global soccer icon like Messi helps fuel the significant momentum and growth both soccer and Michelob Ultra have been experiencing across the U.S.,"" he said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""Messi is the biggest soccer star of our time and is the perfect embodiment of our brand's point of view and brings excitement to some of soccer's most passionate fans during some of the sport's most competitive tournaments.""

As the official beer sponsor of the FIFA Club World Cup, Michelob Ultra will also present the Superior Player of the Match Trophy, awarded after each game – the brand sponsored the award during last year's Copa America 2024. Michelob Ultra will also sponsor the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Michelob Ultra pop-up beer gardens and pitchside clubs will be found at the 12 host stadiums, too. Fans can enter online to win a chance to sit in the Michelob Ultra Pitchside Club in New York City for the semifinals and final.

""The FIFA Club World Cup is an opportunity to continue to make our brand synonymous with one of the world's most beloved sports by elevating the fan experience this summer and into 2026,"" Marques said.

Ex-Barcelona star running out of options with desperate 'Hand of God' attempt set to cap disastrous second Santos spell","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/what-next-for-neymar-running-out-of-options-desperate-hand-of-god-disastrous-santos-spell/bltdef11e86279c1570","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The enigmatic Brazilian is facing an uncertain future after failing to reignite his career at his boyhood club

""Feels like I'm going back in time,"" Neymar said when confirming his return to Santos at the end of January. ""It's been nearly 12 years since I left for the most famous club in the world and it seems like yesterday. My feelings for the club and fans have never changed.""

The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star added: ""Now I need to play again. And only a club like Santos can provide the love I need to prepare for the coming challenges in the next few years."" They were heartfelt words, but the truth is: Neymar had nowhere else to go after mutually terminating his contract at Al-Hilal.

Injuries overshadowed the end of Neymar's career at PSG, and the Brazilian's physical condition deteriorated further in Saudi Arabia, as he managed just seven appearances for Al-Hilal across one-and-a-half seasons. Santos threw Neymar a lifeline after he'd reached his lowest ebb, a final chance to show his critics that he still has something to offer at the top level.

Naturally, the red carpet was rolled out at Vila Belmiro, with thousands of fans turning out to welcome back their 'prince' at a lavish ceremony featuring local singers and an extravagant fireworks display. Neymar was also bestowed with Pele's iconic No.10 shirt, which he described as an ""honour"", before telling the crowd: ""I am very happy. We lived great moments here. There's still a lot that could come. I will not lack boldness.""

He has certainly lived up to that final proclamation, but in truth Neymar hasn't been on the pitch for long enough to make any meaningful impact for Santos so far this season. Winding back the clock has proven to be an impossible task for the 33-year-old, and it's unclear what comes next as he prepares to drop into the free agency pool.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlos Alcaraz's meteoric rise to tennis stardom continues as he blazes through Roland Garros, matching up to the legendary Rafael Nadal in a spectacular 300-match journey. The young Spanish sensation has triumphed over four opponents, setting the stage for three crucial showdowns in Paris.

Having recently clinched his seventh Masters 1000 title in Rome, Alcaraz's dominance on the clay courts is undeniable. His victory over Jannik Sinner marked his 300th ATP match, solidifying his position among the tennis greats. At just 22 years old, Alcaraz boasts an impressive 239-61 record, placing him in elite company alongside iconic players like Rod Laver, Arthur Ashe, and John McEnroe.

Surpassing even his compatriot Nadal at the 300-match milestone, Alcaraz's remarkable achievement speaks volumes about his talent and determination. With 19 ATP titles under his belt, including 11 from 13 finals, the young prodigy's consistency and skill are unparalleled. Alcaraz's ability to excel on all surfaces and against any opponent showcases his versatility and unwavering focus on improvement.

Since bursting onto the scene in 2021, Alcaraz has shattered records and expectations, becoming the youngest world number one in 2022 and the youngest Major champion across all surfaces. Drawing inevitable comparisons to Nadal, Alcaraz is carving his own path to tennis immortality, captivating fans and experts alike with his exceptional talent and maturity on the court.

As Alcaraz crosses the 300-match mark, the tennis world eagerly anticipates just how far this rising star will soar. With each victory, he cements his status as a force to be reckoned with in the tennis realm, leaving spectators in awe of his unprecedented success and boundless potential.

 Lorenzo Musetti's stunning 2025 European clay season shows little sign of slowing down at Roland Garros. 

 The 23-year-old Italian on Tuesday booked his maiden semi-final at the clay major with a hard-earned 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 triumph against Frances Tiafoe in Paris. Musetti went toe to toe with Tiafoe for the best part of three absorbing sets on Court Philippe-Chatrier, before putting his foot down to win eight of the final 10 games and seal victory. 

 “[The third set] was definitely decisive,” said Musetti in his on-court interview. “Frances didn't start as he wanted I think but today was really complicated to play well. It was so windy and really difficult to manage the balls properly. Especially the third set was really a fight and it was not easy to make a break. 

 “I was a little bit tired and it was really tough for me to stay there, but I found the extra energy to win the [third] set, and the last set was definitely my best set of the match.”

 Now 19-3 on clay in 2025, Musetti will take on defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or 12th seed Tommy Paul for a spot in the championship match. With his two-hour, 47-minute victory against Tiafoe, Musetti also jumped two spots to No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, positioning him to reach a new career high after Roland Garros. 

 “I guess it's a process of growing, but only inside the court but especially off the court,” said Musetti about his recent strides forward. “Last year I became a father, and I think that gave me an extra responsibility. I think now I approach things in a more professional way, not just on the court, but in my daily routine: When I practise and in my free time. 

 “I enjoy my time with my family so much. Even if they are not here, they are always with me inside my heart, so I think this win is for them.”

 Musetti arrived at Roland Garros in the form of his life and at a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, and he was the only player to reach the semi-finals at all three clay ATP Masters 1000 events (Monte-Carlo, Madrid, Rome). Yet the way the Italian has moved through the draw has nonetheless been impressive. 
 Having pulled through in four sets against Mariano Navone and Holger Rune in the previous two rounds, Musetti again held firm after a setback when Tiafoe clinched the second set to level the pair's quarter-final clash. In a nail-biting third set, the Italian rallied from 5-5, 15/30 to hold serve and then crucially broke Tiafoe in the next game. That proved to be the defining moment of the match. 
 With the momentum in his corner, Musetti raced to an early 3-0 lead in the fourth set, deploying some typically classy shotmaking en route, and he completed his victory with his fifth service break of the match. The eighth seed was broken just once himself, early in the second set, and he finished the match having won 81 per cent (61/75) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys Stats. 
 Having lost his two previous tour-level meetings with Tiafoe, Musetti levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 3-3 with Tuesday afternoon's win. The Italian is now 13-4 at Roland Garros, where he will contest his second Grand Slam semi-final following his run to the same stage at 2024 Wimbledon.

PARIS (AP) — Lorenzo Musetti was warned for unsportsmanlike conduct for kicking a tennis ball that inadvertently hit a linesperson during his Roland Garros quarterfinal against Frances Tiafoe on Tuesday.Unlike most top-level tennis tournaments, which rely on electronic line-calling, there are still humans on court at Roland-Garros to make rulings on whether shots land in or out.The eighth-seeded Musetti, who won a bronze medal for Italy at the Paris Olympics and was a semifinalist at Wimbledon last year, had just dropped a game to trail Tiafoe 5-3 in the second set of their match at Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Aryna Sabalenka reacts to learning she has reached her 10th straight Grand Slam quarterfinal after defeating Zheng Qinwen at the French Open. (1:03)

PARIS -- Four-time champion Iga Swiatek's 26th successive win at Roland-Garros on Tuesday set up a French Open semifinal clash against top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka.

Swiatek defeated Elina Svitolina 6-1, 7-5 to extend her impressive run. The consecutive wins record on the Parisian red clay is Chris Evert's 29.

Having been searching for her best form in recent months, Swiatek, who struggled in the previous round, was in total control in the opening set.

She was made to work harder by her 13th-seeded Ukrainian rival in the second set, dropping her serve in the fourth game after hitting two straight unforced errors into the net. But Swiatek broke back immediately and took advantage of Svitolina's poor service game to break again with a thunderous forehand return and move up 6-5. Swiatek sealed the win with a final ace.

Swiatek dropped outside the top four before the French Open and has not won a title or reached a final since her victory at Roland-Garros last year.

Sabalenka back into semifinals Sabalenka defeated Zheng Qinwen in straight sets to reach the semifinals for the second time.

Chasing her first title at Roland-Garros, Sabalenka overcame a shaky start and windy conditions to prevail 7-6 (3), 6-3 and extend her record against the Olympic champion to 7-1.

The score did not fully reflect the closeness of the quarterfinal, though, with so little separating the rivals. But Sabalenka demonstrated why she was No. 1, making the difference on big points, while Zheng struggled with her serve in tense moments.

Sabalenka will try to reach her sixth Grand Slam final, and first at Roland-Garros.

Sabalenka lost her most recent match against Zheng last month in Rome, having previously dominated their first six encounters. She said that loss was actually a good thing in the middle of an already exhausting season.

""I was actually glad I lost that match, because I needed a little break before Roland-Garros,"" Sabalenka said. ""Today, I was just more fresh. I was ready to battle, I was ready to leave everything I had on court to get this win.""

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, has yet to drop a set in Paris.

Zheng started strong on Court Philippe-Chatrier, breaking early and dominating with aggressive play.

However, two double faults in the eighth game allowed Sabalenka to break back and shift the momentum.

A misjudged call by Zheng in the 12th game nearly cost her, but she fought off a set point to force a tiebreaker. Sabalenka remained more consistent and secured the set after Zheng hit long on a drop shot.

Zheng saved a break point with an overhead shot in the fifth game of the second set, but Sabalenka's powerful backhand return pinned her down on the next one, allowing the top-ranked player to move ahead 3-2. Zheng did not go down without a fight, though, and broke back immediately, only to drop her two last service games.

The loss ended a run of 10 consecutive match wins for Zheng at Roland-Garros, dating to last summer's Olympic Games.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

...

PARIS (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka is the top-ranked player in women's tennis. Yet even that status didn't spare her from competing in front of empty seats at Roland-Garros, something she says isn't fair.

The three-time Grand Slam champion faced China's Zheng Qinwen in the first quarterfinal match on Tuesday, beginning at 11 a.m. on Court Philippe-Chatrier. When play began, large sections of the 15,000-seat stadium were still unoccupied — a common sight in the early hours at the French Open, when many ticket holders opt for lunch or arrive later in the day.

“It was a big match and probably would make more sense to put us a little bit later just so more people could watch it,” Sabalenka said after her 7-6 (3), 6-3 win. “ I definitely think that would make more sense to kind of like move our match for a little bit later.”

But scheduling more night sessions for women is proving a tough issue to resolve for French Open tournament director Amélie Mauresmo.

Since the introduction of night sessions in 2021, only four women's singles matches have been featured in that marquee time slot. Serena Williams played in the first-ever night match at Roland-Garros, but pandemic restrictions meant the stands were empty.

No women's matches have been scheduled for the evening session this year, something Sabalenka said should change. Asked about her views on the fact that women haven't played a single night match this year, the player from Belarus said they deserve “equal treatment.”

“There was a lot of ... great battles, a lot of great matches which would be cool to see as night sessions,” she said. “Just more people in the stands watching these incredible battles. And just to show ourselves to more people. I definitely agree that we deserve to be put on a bigger stage. Like better timing, more people watching.”

There was, however, one upside to the early start for Sabalenka ahead of her semifinal against four-time champion Iga Swiatek.

“I'm happy to finish earlier and then I have a half day off and I can just enjoy the city and do all the things that I have to do,” she said.

Defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominance at Roland Garros by securing her 26th consecutive victory at the event, defeating Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. Swiatek will now face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals.

Defending champion Iga Swiatek extended her Paris superlatives on Tuesday, reaching her fourth straight Roland Garros semifinal and earning her 26th consecutive victory at this event.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

No. 5 seed Swiatek of Poland defeated No. 13 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine 6-1, 7-5 in their quarterfinal meeting on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Svitolina needed 1 hour and 41 minutes to collect her fourth win in five matches against Svitolina.

Despite holding her lowest ranking since 2022 and nearly falling to Elena Rybakina in the previous round, Swiatek pulled out some of her peak play to dismiss Svitolina, who was seeking an appearance in her fourth career Grand Slam semifinal.

""Even though first set, the score looks pretty straightforward, it wasn't like that in any other games,"" Swiatek said to the press. ""I had to fight for every point. I'm happy that I also stepped up when she broke me in the second set, and that I kept my intensity until the end.""

Semifinal showdown vs. Sabalenka: The stage is now set for a semifinal clash between the two players who have locked down the No. 1 ranking since April of 2022.

Swiatek, who has spent 125 weeks at World No. 1, will face current World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final four on Thursday. Sabalenka is enjoying her 41st week at the top of the rankings and ousted reigning Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in their quarterfinal.

Swiatek leads the overall head-to-head 8-4, and the clay-court head-to-head 5-1. Sabalenka, though, beat Swiatek 6-3, 6-3 in their most recent meeting, on the hard courts of Cincinnati last year. This will be their first-ever meeting at Roland Garros. 

""For sure our rivalry is pushing both of us, I think, but it's not only about the level of tennis,"" Swiatek said. ""It's about like everything, how we work, and how professional we are.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Clay-court queens: Svitolina started the day as this year's clay-court match-win leader, with 16 victories on the dirt in 2025. She won an indoor-clay title in Rouen, made the semifinals in Madrid and the quarterfinals in Rome.

Swiatek, meanwhile, entered Roland Garros without a clay-court title for the first time since 2020. However, she won that 2020 Roland Garros championship anyway, and she still has a chance to take the crown for a fifth time after closing out Svitolina's stellar clay-court swing.

Swiatek is the fifth player in the Open Era, including women and men, to win 25 or more consecutive singles matches at Roland Garros. The rest of that list: Rafael Nadal, Chris Evert, Bjorn Borg and Monica Seles.

""I feel like on this court and overall, like, Roland Garros, I should always push until the end and fight for everything,"" Swiatek said. ""Because there's more [probability] that I overcome some stuff rather than in other places. I just maybe believe it a little bit more.""

Match moments: Tuesday's first-set scoreline looks routine, but Svitolina did have three chances to break in the opening frame. Swiatek had to grind out a particularly tough hold for 4-1 to maintain her break advantage.

Once she got through that game, Swiatek and her signature forehand took control. In the next game, Swiatek used that wing to convert her fifth break point of another lengthy tussle and lead 5-1. She eased to the one-set lead from there.

As windy conditions intensified in the second set, Svitolina made her presence felt. The Ukrainian jumped out to a 3-1 lead before Swiatek regrouped, slamming rally forehands crosscourt to pull back on serve.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Still, Svitolina was two points away from taking the second set after a forehand winner gave her deuce at 5-4. Swiatek, though, was not to be denied, holding on for 5-5, then cranking a forehand return winner off of a second serve to break for 6-5.

Serving for the match, Swiatek summoned her second ace of the day to queue up double match point. Her third ace of the day followed immediately thereafter, and the Polish player was back in the Roland Garros semifinals, a place she is very familiar with.

Defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominance at Roland Garros by securing her 26th consecutive victory at the event, defeating Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. Swiatek will now face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

LONDON -- Nick Kyrgios, the Wimbledon runner-up in 2022, will miss the Grand Slam tournament and the rest of the grass-court season, he said Tuesday.

The 30-year-old Australian has dealt with injuries and has undergone wrist and knee operations in recent seasons.

He has played only five singles matches in 2025, going 1-4.

His most recent tournament was the Miami Open in March, when he won a match for the first time in nearly 2½ years.

""I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year,"" Kyrgios posted.

He's ranked 633rd. He was as high as 13th in 2016.

Three years ago at the All England Club, he made his best run at a major tournament by getting to the final before losing to Novak Djokovic.

World No 5 looked crushed after his transformative clay swing ended in defeat to Alexander Bublik but grass is the perfect surface to make amends

Alexander Bublik reacted to the most significant victory of his career by collapsing on to the Parisian soil with his arms aloft, his face transmitting joy and disbelief. Although his jubilation was an apt reaction to breaking new ground by reaching his first grand slam quarter-final, it also said much about his beaten opponent.

Jack Draper's rise over the past 12 months has been one of the most significant developments on the ATP Tour. As he has established himself as one of the best in the world and earned respect within the locker room, the target on his back has grown accordingly. Now ranked No 5, Draper is one of the elite opponents that others lomeasure themselves against. When they face him, they will try to swing freely and use the occasion to take their games to levels they normally cannot sustain. As was the case with Bublik on Monday, this will sometimes work.

One of the great challenges of being at the top is learning how to hold off the bloodthirsty masses, to find a way through tough matches by making life difficult for those opponents and seizing the most important points. Draper is still new to these situations; this is his second grand slam tournament as a top 20 player and his first inside the top five. A year ago, he could barely trust his body over five sets. Facing more of these experiences will teach him how to overcome them.

Despite his own disappointment, Draper ends his clay season having made transformative progress on the surface, which he previously had minimal experience on. Less than two months ago, in his third-round defeat to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the Monte Carlo Masters, the British No 1 was still struggling badly with his movement on the surface and his confidence was shot. His growth since then is reflected in his results as he reached his first clay-court final at the Madrid Open, a Masters 1000 event, and following it up with a quarter-final in Rome. He arrived in Paris seeking his first match win here and finished the tournament in the second week. He could still reach a new high world ranking of No 4 on Monday.

While some players tend to handle defeats better with age, Draper says that his losses are more painful. Now he knows what he is capable of, falling short of his lofty goals hurts even more. In the hours after his defeat to Bublik, he looked utterly crushed. Not only did he miss a big opportunity to build a deeper run, Draper squandered the chance to test himself against Jannik Sinner, the best in the world, in the quarter-finals.

One of Draper's most admirable qualities is the perspective he maintains in difficult moments. Even as he processed a crushing defeat, he was still able to recognise how it could propel him forward. Since he has arrived on the circuit, navigating physical problems, anxiety and doubt, few things have come easily for him. This is no different.

“It's a really, really tough loss to take,” he said. “My journey, even though I've come up quickly this year, I've got myself to a high ranking, it's always been a steep learning curve for me. There's always been a lot of adversity, a lot of injuries, a lot of setbacks. This is another one of those tough matches. I'll learn from it and I'll get better and I'll use it to my advantage.”

Once Draper has finished stewing over this loss, he will shift his sights on the coming storm. Until now, he has had the benefit of developing his game and building his career in the shadows. While British athletes are often burdened by hype and expectations, Draper is still somewhat under the radar. He has immense respect within tennis, and there is a consensus that he is a genuine contender at the biggest events, but his profile at home does not match his growing list of achievements.

This will surely change when he heads to Wimbledon as one of the best in the world and on grass, a surface that perfectly suits his game, he will be a top contender. This will be Draper's first experience of the attention and scrutiny that comes with his new lofty status. How he handles those challenges will be fascinating and instructive.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

“The more grand slams I play and the more big matches I play, I'll learn from them and won't make the mistakes that I did today.”

So said the British tennis player who had suffered an unexpected loss at a major. Not Jack Draper, as it happens, but his friend and occasional mentor Sir Andy Murray, who made this comment an hour or so after going out of the 2008 Australian Open at the hands of an inspired Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

I mention the quote because Draper's surprise defeat on Monday felt so reminiscent of that period circa 2008-10 when Murray was generally ranked at No 4 in the world – the same position that Draper, 23, is likely to be in when the new chart is published on Monday.

It was a development phase for Murray, who then played a canny but slightly conservative baseline game based on working his opponents around the court and eliminating his own chances of error.

While most observers accepted that Murray trailed behind Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and perhaps Novak Djokovic, he was supposed to beat the likes of Tsonga, Marin Cilic, Fernando Verdasco and Stan Wawrinka, all of whom knocked him out of hard-court majors in this era.

The big shift began on New Year's Eve 2010, when Murray announced the appointment of Ivan Lendl as his coach. From that moment, he made a mindset change. He began to bully opponents with his serve and forehand, and eventually opened his grand-slam account in September 2012.

Now, I am not suggesting that Draper needs a so-called “super-coach” like Lendl. He has James Trotman in his corner – not a great player, admittedly, but a wise and cool-headed character who has steered Draper's progress admirably to date.

But there are always lessons from the sorts of defeats that Draper suffered on Monday against the instinctive brilliance of Alexander Bublik. And in his case, we are talking about an ability to react more nimbly and speedily to his opponent's pattern of play, rather than showing his bafflement by yelling at his player box as he did here.

The only real criticism anyone could have of Draper and his team was that they looked surprisingly unprepared for Bublik's feathered drop shot. It is hardly news that Bublik loves that play.

Could Draper have done more to adjust his own position on the court? Could he have tried to gamble earlier in the rallies? During his post-match press conference, he intimated a faint sense of regret. “Was [Bublik] playing that way because I was allowing him to maybe play that way? I'm not sure.”

While Draper is a burlier and more powerful figure than Murray, he is also a more manufactured tennis player. He lacks his predecessor's fluidity and feel, as well as his chess-like ingenuity on the court.

Bublik took full advantage of these minor weaknesses with a perfectly honed game plan which, at times, made Draper look clunky, heavy-footed and predictable.

And yet, just like with Murray 15 years ago, Draper is smart and self-aware enough to go away and analyse the footage. He will learn to change up his patterns more quickly when under pressure, and to deal with the mental stress of facing red-lining opponents.

Even when faced with such overwhelming quality, Draper still had five chances to break as Bublik served for the match. Unfortunately, he played tight-armed, safety-first points on the first two when one haymaker of a forehand might have turned the match.

This is another quality that champions learn: the knack of finding the right shot at the right time. The great ones have an almost supernatural ability to find the lines on the most important points.

Now Draper moves on to the grass, a surface where he feels much more comfortable – yet he still has not made much of an impact at Wimbledon to date.

Drawn against defending champion Novak Djokovic on his 2021 Centre Court debut, he was eliminated by 19th seed Alex de Minaur a year later before missing 2023 with a torn shoulder tendon.

Only last year, when Draper went down in straight sets to compatriot and regular practice partner Cameron Norrie, did he have any reason to be disappointed. This was another match in which a tactical adjustment might have helped, because Draper – who again turned in bafflement to his player box – was spraying too many errors and needed to dial back his ambition.

You might argue that I am contradicting myself here, by calling Draper too passive against Bublik and too aggressive against Norrie. But then, that is the beauty of tennis: different opponents pose different questions, and the challenge is to adapt on the day.

Draper certainly absorbed the lesson of last year's Wimbledon exit. His refusal to give away cheap points over the past year has been an important factor in his rise up the rankings. He will learn from Monday's Bublik masterclass too, and come back stronger.

                Kyrgios sidelined again with knee injury, delaying his return to Wimbledon.            

Nick Kyrgios will miss Wimbledon 2025 following a setback in his recovery from a lingering knee injury, the same issue that kept him out of Roland Garros. The Aussie star shared the update via Instagram Stories earlier today, apologizing to fans for the disappointment and assuring them it's just a temporary hurdle. He added that he's already back to work, focused on returning stronger than ever.

Kyrgios has dealt with recurring knee and wrist issues across 2023, 2024, and even earlier. Once ranked as high as world No. 13, the Aussie has now dropped to No. 633, a stark reflection of how injuries have derailed his momentum. A finalist at Wimbledon in 2022, Kyrgios has won seven singles titles since turning pro in 2013, along with four doubles titles, including the 2022 Australian Open with Thanasi Kokkinakis.

The announcement is a major disappointment not just for Kyrgios but for fans who were eager to see him back at the All England Club after skipping Roland Garros. While he's been open about his distaste for clay, he's always been a crowd favorite on faster surfaces.

In his Instagram story, Kyrgios wrote, “Just wanted to give everyone a quick update – I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year. I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever. Thank you for all your continued support – it means everything to me. See you soon!”

Last year, Kyrgios had announced plans to return in 2025 and later, at Roland Garros, his first appearance since 2017, not in singles, but in doubles with partner Jordan Thompson. That comeback, too, was cut short by another flare-up in his knee, raising further doubts about the Aussie's long-term fitness.

Nick Kyrgios announces his come back in 2025:""Something is keeping me around the game. (…) I think the one thing that is now on my target is a Grand Slam. I think that will be the only thing that will shut people up at the end of the day. That'll be my deep motivation."" pic.twitter.com/x2m62PZTQ0

There was a glimmer of hope back in March when Kyrgios earned his first singles win in over two years, defeating American Mackenzie McDonald in Miami. Having undergone wrist reconstruction and dealt with persistent foot and knee injuries, the 30-year-old was hoping to build on that momentum until things unraveled once again. His current record for the season stands at 1-4.

 The Australian had already withdrawn from the 2025  French Open due to the same knee injury.

Nick Kyrgios has officially ruled himself out of the 2025 Wimbledon Grand Slam tennis tournament after suffering another injury setback.

The 30-year-old Australian confirmed via social media on Monday (June 2) that a recurring knee issue has disrupted his recovery, ending hopes of a return during the grass court tournament season, which is traditionally his strongest surface.

The 2022 Wimbledon finalist, who worked as a commentator for last year's event, had already withdrawn from the ongoing 2025 French Open due to the same knee injury and has struggled with wrist problems in recent years.

“Unfortunately, I won't make it back for grass season this year,” Kyrgios shared in an Instagram story. “This is just a bump in the road... I'm already working hard to get back stronger.”

His absence from Wimbledon means he has played just one Grand Slam match since his 2022 US Open quarter-final appearance. That lone outing came at this year's Australian Open, where he lost in the first round to Great Britain's Jacob Fearnley.

After that tournament, Kyrgios said he could not see himself ""realistically playing a singles match"" again. It remains to be seen whether he will be fit to compete in the US Open later this year.

Since the end of 2022, Kyrgios has played only six matches, winning just one, against USA's Mackenzie McDonald at the Miami Masters.

And one of those less glamorous moments came at the French Open in 2019, where a surprise early exit would lead to a chain of consequences that would leave another tennis star rather unhappy.

When Williams was sent home after a third round defeat to then 20-year-old Sofia Kenin, she was unsurprisingly not in the best of moods.

The 23-time Grand Slam champion made 34 unforced errors during her loss to unseeded Kenin as she struggled to get to grips with the game.

Williams, who has the most majors in the open era, was also chasing the chance to equal Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slams. 

After the defeat, a dejected Williams had to fulfil her media obligations and was desperate to get them done as soon as possible.

According to French newspaper L'Equipe, Williams told a tournament official, ""Put me in another room, smaller, but now"" referring to the press conference theaters.

It led to the official at Roland Garros telling Dominic Thiem, who was fulfilling his media obligations in one room, to end his press conference early to make way for Williams.

The Swiss had just beaten Pablo Cuevas in the third round and was preparing for his opponent, Gael Monfils in the fourth round.

Thiem hit back at the official at the time of the incident. 

""What the hell? But it's a joke, really. What's the point of that, that I have to leave the room because she's coming?"" he said.

Guy Forget, the tournament director at the time, issued an apology to Thiem, who won the US Open in 2020.

""Every player has to wait. It shows a bad personality, in my opinion,"" Thiem later told reporters.

""I wasn't angry or frustrated. Maybe for a couple of minutes or so. It is just the principle. 

""It doesn't matter if it is me who sits in there, even if a junior is in there.

""I am 100% sure Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal would never do something like that.""

""I don't know if it was her mistake or only the mistake of the officials,"" Thiem later added. ""I don't know if she saw me, or saw someone was in the room. If she'd seen me, it would have been nicer for her to wait.

""I had an apology [from tournament director Guy Forget]. I don't know whose fault it is exactly. It was just a very strange thing, I never had something like that before. I'm easy-going. Of course it was strange, but I've forgotten it now.""

The then fourth-seeded Thiem said he understood Williams' desire to get her media responsibilities done as fast as she could.

""She lost and everything,"" the Austrian said. ""So I think it was a little bit mistake of her, mistake of the officials, but as I said, it's forgotten.

""It was a funny thing, strange thing, which made a big round in all the social networks, but now I don't put any attention on it anymore.""

Roger Federer offered his opinion on the situation at the time, aiming blame at those who allowed this situation to even occur.

""I don't know what went wrong but something went wrong for this to happen,"" the Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion said.

""If I would have lost today against Leonardo Mayer, I would let him go first or decide when he wants to go to press as he's got a next match. My next match is far, far away. So that's just the way you go about it.

""There must have been a misunderstanding, or maybe they should have kept Serena still in the locker room, not waiting here in the press centre.""

Annabelle Croft, a former world No.24 and now tennis commentator, slammed Williams at the time, claiming that she should have just waited.

“She should be made to wait an extra five minutes until finished. Had it been a role reversal, there would have been absolute uproar,"" she said on EuroSport at the time.

“It's just appalling. I think he's owed an apology to be honest.”

“I asked them to put me in the small room,” Williams said of the incident. 

“I begged them to put me in the small room, and they didn't.

“I said, ‘Listen, I can come back. I'm just going to go back'. They were like, ‘No, stay here'.

“They pulled him out. I was like, ‘You guys are so rude to do that', quote-unquote, that's what I said. The next day I had a bad personality. Literally that's what happened.

“I actually stuck up for the guy, so I don't understand how I got a bad personality for telling them what they did was wrong to him.

“But we spoke about it. I've always liked him. I still like him. He's a great player. I mean, he's unbelievable.

“I'm really, quite frankly, too old to be in controversy. That's why I just wanted to clear the air.

“I'm like, ‘Dude, I told them that it wasn't right what they did'. He said he didn't say ‘bad personality', that the media mixed up his words. It's all good.”

Later, Thiem would actually extend an olive branch to Williams, making it clear that it was likely not her fault but the fault of the organisers.

“Probably it was not Serena's mistake,” he told reporters a month later

“I find her achievements unbelievable, sensational. I would like to make amends with her in Wimbledon or the US Open mixed doubles.

“In retrospect, it was funny that such an organisational mistake happened at a Grand Slam tournament. What I do not understand is that it blew up so much.”

So no hard feelings in the end.

The USTA announced last week the participants who will be competing in the U.S. Open Wild Card Playoffs later this month.

Three former New Jersey high school stars are set to take part in a four-player singles field and a four-pair bracket for doubles.

Delbarton alum Michael Zheng of Columbia headlines the action.

The 2021 NJSIAA state singles tournament champion and last fall's NCAA men's singles tournament winner will compete in both the singles and doubles playoffs.

His doubles partner is teammate Nicolas Kotzen, a Newark Academy alum who Zheng defeated in the NJSIAA singles final.

Zheng was named an Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division-I All-American this spring.

Also competing in the doubles bracket is Alex Kotzen, another Newark Academy alum and NJSIAA state singles champion from 2019.

Kotzen spent his last year of college at Tennessee after previously playing at Columbia. He is the older brother of Nicolas.

The playoffs are set to be held at the USTA National Campus in Orlando. FL. from June 16-18. The new event, featuring the top American collegiate players, is expected to more than double the average number of U.S. Open wild card berths earned by American collegiate players with six.

The winners of the men's and women's singles and doubles competitions will earn U.S. Open main draw wild cards in their respective categories. The finalists, meanwhile, will receive U.S. Open qualifying wild cards.

Zheng earned an automatic spot into the playoffs after winning the NCAA singles title in November. The rest of the field, listed below, were selected by a committee comprising USTA staff, college coaches, and an ITA representative.

The singles semifinals will take place on June 16, the doubles semifinals on June 17 and the finals on June 18.

The event is free and matches will begin at 5 p.m. each day. Streams of the matches will be available on the USTA National Campus website.

PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz lost in the first round of the French Open as the tournament's No. 4 seed on Monday, eliminated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by 66th-ranked Daniel Altmaier of Germany.

Altmaier broke Fritz's big serve five times at Court Simonne-Mathieu and ended the Californian's 15-match Grand Slam winning streak against players ranked outside the top 50.

Fritz's exit followed another by a top-10 American: No. 9 Emma Navarro was bounced from the women's bracket earlier Monday.

In September, Fritz lost the U.S. Open trophy to Jannik Sinner, becoming the first U.S. man to reach a major final since Andy Roddick in 2009. In Paris, Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Roddick was No. 3 in 2007.

While hard courts are Fritz's preferred surface, he did have a run to the second week on the red clay of Roland-Garros a year ago, making it into the fourth round before losing to Casper Ruud.

This is not Altmaier's first big win at the French Open. He beat No. 8 seed Matteo Berrettini there in 2020, and Sinner in 2023.

Three-time major winner Aryna Sabalenka will face four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek in a blockbuster semifinal.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka has recovered from a slow start to systematically dismantle Paris Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in a 7-6 (3), 6-3 victory that has sent her into the French Open semifinals.

Sabalenka suffered her first loss to Zheng in seven career meetings in the Rome quarterfinals last month, and the Belarusian went behind early on Tuesday in the opening set at a half-full Court Philippe-Chatrier.

“It was a true battle, and I had no idea how I could break her back and get back into the first set. I didn't start well, and I'm glad I found my rhythm and won,” said Sabalenka, who took a step closer to a maiden French Open title.

“I think we're all here for one reason. Everyone wants that beautiful trophy. I'm glad I have another opportunity, another semifinal to do better than last time.

“I really hope that by the end of the clay court season, I'm really proud of myself.”

China's Zheng, bidding to emulate compatriot Li Na's 2011 triumph at Roland Garros, crushed a powerful forehand winner to break for a 2-1 lead, but Sabalenka moved through the gears to level five games later and was denied on set point while up 6-5.

The 27-year-old top seed shrugged off the disappointment to glide through the tie-break when errors crept into eighth seed Zheng's game before the players swapped breaks in a high-octane second set.

A huge forehand winner put Sabalenka 5-3 up, and the three-time Grand Slam champion never looked back as she closed out the contest.

In a later quarterfinal, reigning French Open champion Iga Swiatek of Poland swept aside Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 6-1 7-5 to stay in the hunt for a record-breaking victory in Paris.

The 24-year-old, who accepted a one-month doping ban late last year, is looking to become the first woman in the professional era since 1968 to win four consecutive titles in Paris.

Although she failed to win a title going into the French Open this season, she looks to have rediscovered her remarkable clay court form at Roland Garros.

She will next play Sabalenka in a mouth-watering semifinal.

“I should have had better intensity in the beginning of the second set,” Swiatek said in a post-match interview. “When I saw my intensity go low I got it high again. I am happy I did it at the end of the set.

“Against Aryna [Sabalenka] it is always a challenge. She has a game for every surface. I have to do the work, be brave with my shots and go for it. She is having a great season.”

“I will not lie. It will be a tough match but am happy for the challenge,” she said.

The Pole is now on a 26-match winning streak at the French Open, following her title three-peat between 2022-24 to add to her 2020 crown.

                Kyrgios sidelined again with knee injury, delaying his return to Wimbledon.            

Nick Kyrgios will miss Wimbledon 2025 following a setback in his recovery from a lingering knee injury, the same issue that kept him out of Roland Garros. The Aussie star shared the update via Instagram Stories earlier today, apologizing to fans for the disappointment and assuring them it's just a temporary hurdle. He added that he's already back to work, focused on returning stronger than ever.

Kyrgios has dealt with recurring knee and wrist issues across 2023, 2024, and even earlier. Once ranked as high as world No. 13, the Aussie has now dropped to No. 633, a stark reflection of how injuries have derailed his momentum. A finalist at Wimbledon in 2022, Kyrgios has won seven singles titles since turning pro in 2013, along with four doubles titles, including the 2022 Australian Open with Thanasi Kokkinakis.

The announcement is a major disappointment not just for Kyrgios but for fans who were eager to see him back at the All England Club after skipping Roland Garros. While he's been open about his distaste for clay, he's always been a crowd favorite on faster surfaces.

In his Instagram story, Kyrgios wrote, “Just wanted to give everyone a quick update – I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass season this year. I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever. Thank you for all your continued support – it means everything to me. See you soon!”

Last year, Kyrgios had announced plans to return in 2025 and later, at Roland Garros, his first appearance since 2017, not in singles, but in doubles with partner Jordan Thompson. That comeback, too, was cut short by another flare-up in his knee, raising further doubts about the Aussie's long-term fitness.

Nick Kyrgios announces his come back in 2025:""Something is keeping me around the game. (…) I think the one thing that is now on my target is a Grand Slam. I think that will be the only thing that will shut people up at the end of the day. That'll be my deep motivation."" pic.twitter.com/x2m62PZTQ0

There was a glimmer of hope back in March when Kyrgios earned his first singles win in over two years, defeating American Mackenzie McDonald in Miami. Having undergone wrist reconstruction and dealt with persistent foot and knee injuries, the 30-year-old was hoping to build on that momentum until things unraveled once again. His current record for the season stands at 1-4.

For the uninitiated, Luigi is part of Nintendo's legendary Mario Bros. franchise—a timid Italian plumber and the younger twin of the more famous Mario. His signature look? Bright blue overalls, a green shirt, and a green “L” cap. Sound familiar?Yes, Sinner and his team have seen the memes. And yes, they're all in.His coach, Darren Cahill, shared a “Jannik & Luigi” meme on his Instagram Story with the caption, “Forza Luigi!” A few days later, Sinner joined in, posting photos of himself in the outfit with the caption, “Luigi back on court.”“No, it's nice, you know?” Sinner told Tennis.com in the post-match mixed zone. ""I feel like sometimes we need to see the funny part as well.""

On Monday evening, the crowd at Roland Garros got in on the joke, too. As Sinner faced off against No. 17 seed Andrey Rublev for a spot in the quarterfinals, chants of “Vai Luigi!” (“Let's go, Luigi!”) rang out alongside the usual “Forza Jannik!”“It's something different, and it's also nice sometimes to change things up—if not, it gets too boring,” Sinner said with a grin. “It's good to have something on, at least!”Sinner didn't need any magical power-ups on Monday evening, as he cruised into the quarterfinals without dropping a set. It's a strong statement in just his second tournament back following a three-month suspension for doping, after also reaching the final in Rome.

Stream every match from Roland Garros on the Tennis Channel app, each day after 11 p.m. ET. 3 to Stream, our daily wrap of the action in Paris, highlights you three matches you'll want to read about—and then replay.Boisson gave France a Cinderella, and tennis fans a new talentLois Boisson d. Jessica Pegula 3-6 6-4, 6-4As Pegula and Boisson walked into Court Philippe Chatrier, the tennis TV pundits in the States were in accord: Boisson…wasn't going to win.“Jess doesn't lose matches like this,” one said of Pegula.“This isn't her favorite surface, but this should be routine,” another chimed in.To be fair, any other opinion at that moment would have sounded preposterous. Pegula is ranked No. 3; Boisson is No. 361, and playing her first major main draw, as a wild card, at the relatively advanced tennis age of 22. Her win in the round before, 7-5 in the third over her 138th-ranked countrywoman Elsa Jacquemot, hardly seemed like reason for worry.

As they say, that's why they play the game. From the first point, Boisson looked like much more of a threat than she seemed to on paper. She came out looking to run around and hit her heavy-topspin forehand, and finished the first rally by whipping one into the crosscourt corner for a winner.After that opening salvo, reality settled back in, and Pegula won the first set. But Boisson's shot-making potential became more obvious after she settled down in the second. She pushed Pegula back with her bolo-punch forehand, brought her forward with drop shots, and left her looking helplessly skyward with backhand topspin lobs. With each winning shot, the French crowd believed a little more, and roared a little louder.What Boisson did best, perhaps by accident, was use that atmosphere to her advantage. With a mix of high-bouncing topspin and short drops, she draw Pegula into long, scrambling, increasingly tense rallies. Pegula is the harder, flatter hitter, and on occasion she threatened to blow the match open with her superior pace. But Boisson always managed to bog her back down, and keep her tight, with varying speeds and spins and heights.

Pegula was impressed.“All she wants to do is hit forehands,” she said. “She's really fast, so she's really good at running around to get her forehand and also covering the forehand side.”“She hits it pretty heavy. I mean, super high and heavy when she wants to, when she needs to get back in the point, and then she's able to use her drop shot and slice.”In the end, Boisson also had fortune on her side. Serving for the match at 5-4, she looked tight and went down break point. Pegula seemed to have next rally won, until Boisson stuck her racquet out and blocked the ball just over the net, where it died for a winner.Boisson raised her hands in apology. Then, a few minutes later at match point, she ripped another winning forehand. Cinderella had arrived.In photos: Lois Boisson brings French crowd to its feet in dramatic Jessica Pegula stunner

Alexander Bublik d. Jack Draper 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4Just when Draper's star seemed to be permanently ascending, Bublik, like a giant meteor, streaked across Lenglen on Monday to wipe it out.The Russian is famously, shall we say, insouciant about his career and his results. As he puts it, “I prioritize tennis and life in equal ways.” As an example, during one of his matches last week, he realized he was playing early enough in the day that, if he lost, he could be back home in Monte Carlo by evening. That didn't sound too bad, so he relaxed and swung out, thinking that win or lose, he'd be happy. In this case, he happened to win.On Monday against Draper, Bublik swung even bigger and played even better. In fact, he played some of the most blistering tennis of the fortnight so far.“100% one of the best days of my life and one of the best matches I have ever played in my life,” he said. “That was as simple as that.”Bublik won 83% of first-serve points, hit 68 winners against 39 errors, was five of six on break points, and 33 of 40 at the net. He took a Top 10 opponent who has been improving monthly, and didn't allow him to do anything.

100% one of the best days of my life and one of the best matches I have ever played in my life. Alexander Bublik

What explained Bublik's sudden burst of will power? He credited his “one chance” philosophy. The only way to beat Draper, in his mind, was to go big—to move fast and break things.“Sometimes I have a feeling like there's only one chance,” Bublik said. “So I told myself, you have this chance, you do your best. If it doesn't work, I'm out. In certain moments I do believe there's only one chance.“So I did my best and it worked well…So that's how I approach it, and that's why I played full and I played high risk, because that was the only chance.”Read more: Alexander Bublik won't change ‘his path' after biggest win of career at Roland GarrosFor a guy like Bublik, who clearly doesn't enjoy pressure, the problem with going for broke and building a lead is that you start hoping you can win, and that makes you nervous. You could see it happen to him when he served for the match at 5-4 in the fourth. He rushed, he double faulted, he nearly threw it all away—if he had lost that game, he might have lost the match. But as he said, this was his day, and in the end, everything worked.

Jannik Sinner d. Andrey Rublev 6-1, 6-3, 6-4The Italian and the Russian played 157 points on Monday. If you happened to miss the first 155, the next one, which brought Sinner to match point, told you all you needed to know about this contest.Rublev served at 4-5, deuce; he was down, but not quite out. Two winning points and he would have leveled at 5-5 and possibly forced a tiebreaker. He had beaten Sinner as recently as last summer, so there was no reason to give up hope yet.With that in mind, Rublev served and attacked. He took his forehand early and pounded it crosscourt, and then did it two more times. He had Sinner well behind the baseline, just trying to stay alive in the rally. The problem was, he couldn't kill him off. Sinner gradually worked his way forward, and got a look at an offensive forehand of his own. When he clocked it, Rublev didn't stand a chance. The point was over; a minute later the match was, too.

All of which is to say that Sinner and Rublev play similar games, but Sinner does everything a little—and these days, a lot—better. He stands farther in, takes the ball earlier, hits it with more pace, uses the drop more often, and places his shots more more accurately. That last element—accuracy—may have been the most important on Monday. The two hit almost the same number of winners, but Rublev more than doubled Sinner's errors, 39 to 19.On the serve, Rublev hits a harder average first ball, but Sinner's second serve comes in with more pace and depth, and it shows. There was a staggering difference between the two on second-serve points: Sinner won 77% of his, Rublev just 29%.A year ago, Sinner and Rublev split two three-matches on hard courts. Clay has traditionally been a better surface for Rublev than it has for Sinner. But none of that appears to matter anymore. Sinner is the best, and we've only had a glimpse so far of how good he's going to be.

But joy for some meant woe for others, and one team keen to see the back of Spain are Williams, who had a torrid time with both drivers suffering front wing damage.

The 'Wicked' star will take on the titular role for three nights at the Hollywood Bowl.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Cynthia Erivo has responded to the backlash she received for her upcoming lead role in Jesus Christ Superstar at the Hollywood Bowl.


	After it was announced earlier this year that the Wicked star would be playing Jesus in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's musical, some conservatives were quick to criticize her for taking the role as a Black queer woman. However, during a recent interview with Billboard, Erivo couldn't help but laugh at the negative response.




	“Why not?” she said of her casting. “You can't please everyone. It is legitimately a three-day performance at the Hollywood Bowl where I get to sing my face off. So hopefully they will come and realize, ‘Oh, it's a musical, the gayest place on Earth.'”

	The actress will take to the stage at the famed Hollywood venue from Aug. 1-3, alongside Adam Lambert, who is set to play Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar. The musical is a rock opera that follows the final days of Jesus Christ, leading up to his crucifixion, seen through the eyes of his betrayer, Judas. The musical was initially a concept album before making its Broadway debut in 1971. It has also received several revivals over the years, as well as a film adaptation, directed by Norman Jewison, in 1973.


	Erivo, who won a Tony for her performance in Broadway's The Color Purple, has previously played Mary Magdalene in Morgan James' all-female version of the musical's concept album.


	The Grammy and Emmy winner came out publicly in 2022 on the cover of British Vogue.

“It's somewhere lost in the space-time continuum, or it's in some teamster's garage,"" Michael J. Fox said in a video, as Gibson will detail the search in the upcoming doc ""Lost to the Future.""

	The guitar that Marty McFly famously played at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance in Back to the Future has been missing for decades, and hopefully it won't take a DeLorean and a flux capacitor to find it.  


	Gibson — the guitar brand behind the iconic cherry red ES-345 Michael J. Fox wielded in the movie — announced that it's on the hunt for the guitar, with the company sharing a callout Tuesday asking for anyone who may have details on its location to reach out with tips. “Have You Seen This Guitar?” Gibson's poster reads, accompanied by a still from the movie of Fox playing the instrument. The search — and if all goes the way Gibson would like, the re-discovery — will be featured in an upcoming documentary the company is producing called Lost to the Future.

	Gibson posted a video Tuesday with Back to the Future stars Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd — along with Huey Lewis, who cameoed in the film and whose “The Power of Love” was famously featured in the movie — all calling on the public to send information to their website, or to call the 800-line Gibson has set up.

	“We need your help, we're trying to find the guitar I played in Back to the Future,” Fox said in the video. “It's somewhere lost in the space-time continuum, or it's in some teamster's garage.” 


	The company initiated the search and documentary this year to tie the efforts to Back to the Future's 40th anniversary, and Gibson is also featuring an interview with Michael J. Fox on Oct. 21 (“Back to the Future Day”) and will release custom guitars modeled after the original Gibson they're searching for, Gibson said. 

	











	“We've been looking into leads and rumors for a long time, and as you can imagine, we're talking 40 years ago, so memories fade,” Lost to the Future director Doc Crotzer tells The Hollywood Reporter. “We weren't in the era of digital trails, or of receipts and things like that. There are conflicting reports too. You can find about as many different rumors as you can people.” 


	Indeed, there are several different stories about what happened to the guitar. The Back to the Future team first rented the instrument from Norman's Rare Guitars, a famous guitar shop in Los Angeles, when they were filming the first movie. They'd returned the guitar after they finished shooting, and per Crotzer and Mark Agnesi — Gibson's director of brand experience and Norman's former GM from 2009 to 2019, that's where their trail currently goes cold. 


	Crotzer first asked Agnesi about the guitar around a decade ago when Agnesi was still working at Norm's, and several years ago, after Crotzer first spoke with Back to the Future co-creator Bob Gale, he'd approached Agnesi again at Gibson. Agnesi and Crotzer list off several rumors, like that the guitar was headed to auction in the ‘80s but never made it there for a sale. 


	A likely scenario, they say, is that someone simply bought it from Norm's and the origins of the sale have been lost. Norman's owner, Norman Harris, has given several interviews in the past, suggesting he sold it to a friend, who eventually sold it to a woman who came back to his store years later and offered $1 million to sell it back. But Harris had also suggested in the past that it'd been sold to someone in Japan. Needless to say, so far Gibson and Crotzer haven't tracked the guitar yet. Aside from the public inquiry, Crotzer says the film is taking them through prop houses and guitar shops as well. 

	











	“I knew that guitar came from Norm's, the first day on the job, I was looking in cases,” Agnesi says. “Every time I'd go to storage to Norm's warehouse, I was checking ES-cases to see if he still had it. I've been looking since 2009, 15 years of looking for this thing. It's cool we're going to let the world know we're looking for it and everyone gets to join in.”


	Gale tells THR that he “never gave it that much thought” on what happened to the guitar before he was told it was missing in around 2019, but that since then he's become more invested in tracking it down. 


	“It's like we want to put it on milk cartons, ‘have you seen me,'” Gale says with a slight chuckle, describing the search efforts. “We rented the guitar again for Part 2, but I've learned that guitar might not have been the one we used in the first film. So the question is, what happened to the original?”


Back to the Future's high school dance scene is one of the most memorable guitar scenes in the history of the film business, as Marty McFly unintentionally inspires the creation of Chuck Berry's “Johnny B. Goode” by performing the song with the band on stage, eventually losing the crowd as his performance devolves into a Van Halen-style guitar solo. Artists, including John Mayer and Coldplay's Chris Martin, have called that scene in the movie instrumental in inspiring them to pursue music. 


	The scene almost never happened, as Robert Zemeckis contemplated going straight from the kiss to the scene at the clock tower, but it stayed in after testing at a preview when the audience reacted positively to it. 

	











	“We had no idea it would be part of the film's legacy, the Johnny B. Goode scene is the only scene in the entire movie which doesn't really advance the character or plot. We were basically doing what they do in India, where we stopped the movie for a musical number,” Gale says. “It's been amazing over the years to discover how important that particular scene was to people. It inspired so many people to pick up a guitar and be a rock and roller.”


	Gibson says the guitar in the movie was likely a 1960 or 1961 ES-345 (Its use in the film was a historical inaccuracy, given most of the movie was supposed to take place in 1955 and the 345 didn't hit shelves until three years later). An early ‘60s 345 on its own could already fetch $25,000 to $50,000 given how sought-after vintage Gibsons are, but its place as one of film's most iconic guitars makes it priceless. 


	Gibson and the doc team don't have the guitar's serial number, which would be the easiest way to identify a specific instrument. Luckily, they say, the guitar has a key identifier that makes it stand out. Usually, the ES-345 models would have a split parallelogram inlay going completely down the fretboard, but on the guitar in the movie, the 12th fret had a single sold bar marker on  it instead, a rare anomaly that would make the guitar more unmistakable. 


	“That's the smoking gun if we're being honest,” Agnesi says. “It's that inlay on the 12th fret that's really going to let us know that we found it.”

	











	Overall, the team feels confident their search will be successful, even if the search has to go well outside the country. Agnesi has a “Japan theory” for the guitar's whereabouts, given a vintage guitar boom that hit the country in the ‘80s. He said Gibson's international teams in Japan, China and Europe will help spread the word as well. 


	As for what they'll do if they actually do find it? That's still to be determined, though Crotzer said, “there's something poetic about the idea of reuniting this guitar with Michael J. Fox, whether it's for an hour, or forever.”


	“My hope would be whoever has this guitar is enough of a fan of the movies to allow that to happen. There are a lot of possible scenarios. Does the person who has it want to be found? Do they want to, say, lend us the guitar?”


	Agnesi says he'd like to get the guitar in a place it can be showcased for “as many people to have a chance to see it as possible.” 


	“If that means Gibson buys it for their collection and puts it in the vault, I am absolutely 100 percent ready to start talking with anybody who comes forward who might have the guitar about potentially buying it,” Agnesi says. 


	Still, as Gale says, the focus remains on finding the guitar right now. 


	“At this point, we just kind of want to know it's in good hands and is being well taken care of,” he says. “Everything else you figure out after that, but let's solve that mystery first.”

'The Studio' was named breakthrough comedy series and 'The Pitt' won breakthrough drama series, with Julio Torres, Poorna Jagannathan, Kathy Bates and Ben Whishaw winning individual acting awards in those categories.

Adolescence topped the 2025 Gotham TV Awards, sweeping the limited series categories and winning three of the four awards for which it was nominated.


	The four-episode series about a teenage boy accused of murder, which became a much-talked-about phenomenon shortly after its streaming debut in March, won breakthrough limited series and lead performance in a limited series (Stephen Graham) and tied for best supporting performance in a limited series (Owen Cooper). It's fourth nomination was for co-star Erin Doherty in the supporting performance category.

Jenny Slate tied with Cooper for the supporting prize, recognizing her performance in Dying for Sex, which was nominated for three awards.

	Breakthrough comedy series went to The Studio, while The Pitt won breakthrough drama series.


The Pitt star, writer and producer Noah Wyle and his castmates Katherine LaNasa and Shawn Hatosy accepted the breakthrough drama honor, with Wyle saying that they were the only ones from the Max show at the event. And as he's done throughout the promotion of The Pitt‘s first season, Wyle highlighted how the show is a “love letter to first responders … people in the trenches for the past five years,” his voice getting louder as the well-heeled audience at Manhattan's Cipriani Wall Street applauded.


	In the comedy categories, Fantasmas‘ Julio Torres won best lead performance in a comedy series, and Deli Boys‘ Poorna Jagannathan won best supporting performance in a comedy series.

	











	Accepting the first award of the night, Jagannathan joked that the Gotham Awards are the “only awards that count” and that “New York City's opinion is the only one I care about.” She thanked her family and the team behind Deli Boys, which she called a “little brown show” with “no message … no point to prove.”


	“We got to do what a lot of white actors get to do: We got to play dumb fucks,” she added, noting that the Hulu series had yet to be renewed for a second season. “The fact that we got to be so ordinary was what made it so extraordinary.”


	As in the comedy categories, in the drama categories, the Gotham TV Awards similarly spread the wealth around, with Matlock‘s Kathy Bates winning best lead performance in a drama series and Black Doves‘ Ben Whishaw winning best supporting performance.


The Pitt and Matlock were each nominated for three awards, with both shows nominated for breakthrough drama series as well as in the lead and supporting performance drama categories. Neither Whishaw nor Bates were on hand to accept their awards.


Pee-wee as Himself won best original film, while Rebel Ridge‘s Aaron Pierre was named the winner of outstanding performance in an original film. And Social Studies won breakthrough nonfiction series.


	The Gotham Film & Media Institute also presented a number of tributes on Monday night. Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino as well as Hwang Dong-hyuk received creator tributes; Elisabeth Moss and the cast of The Handmaid's Tale accepted the inaugural ensemble tribute; Brian Tyree Henry received the performer tribute; Sheryl Lee Ralph took home the Sidney Poitier icon tribute; David E. Kelley received the visionary tribute, and Parker Posey was honored with the inaugural legend tribute.

	











	Sherman-Palladino and Palladino were honored by Kelly Bishop, Luke Kirby and Gideon Glick, who have each appeared in multiple productions from the team behind Gilmore Girls, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Étoile. All three reflected on their experiences auditioning for the writer-directors. Kirby professed his love for the married creators, saying in part, “I will love you until the day someone drives a stake into my heart.”


	And Bishop, who recalled Sherman-Palladino fighting for her to play Emily Gilmore in Gilmore Girls, said the honor Sherman-Palladino and Palladino received marked a “celebration of a canon of work that has dazzled audiences and critics alike,” adding that the pair's “determination to create something unique and everlasting in all shows changed TV.”


	Taking the stage to the Étoile theme, Sherman-Palladino joked about retiring and getting divorced with Palladino quipping that in both cases they needed to keep going because of “gambling debts.”


	Posey was honored by her White Lotus co-stars Leslie Bibb and Sam Rockwell who had fun offering their own takes on some of her character's memorable, Southern-accented lines, including “tsunami,” “Piper, no” and “Buddhism.”


	“No one sees the world quite the way she sees it,” Rockwell said in part of Posey.


	Accepting her legend tribute, Posey riffed on the name of the honor, thanking White Lotus creator Mike White for writing her character and “believing in a legend,” something she also thanked White Lotus network HBO for.

	











	“Let's keep the arts alive. Let's turn this business into entertainment that everyone can love,” she added. “I love you New York. I wish I could live here again.”


	This marks the second year in which the Gotham Awards have broken out TV honors with a separate ceremony during Emmys season.


	A complete list of this year's winners follows.

Andrew Garfield, ""A Complete Unknown"" scene-stealer Monica Barbaro, and ""Anora"" actor Yura Borisov are circling lead roles in the story of Sam Altman's firing and rehiring. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	With DC's Sgt. Rock no longer on his schedule, Luca Guadagnino has now lined up a brand-new movie project to direct.


	Guadagnino is in talks to direct Artificial, a recounting of the tumultuous period at artificial intelligence company OpenAI in 2023 that saw CEO Sam Altman fired and rehired in a matter of days.




	Heyday Films' David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford are producing the feature that is being put together at lightning speed at Amazon MGM Studios. Simon Rich wrote the script and will also produce, with Jennifer Fox also in talks to produce.

	How fast is this moving? Sources say Amazon is looking to get production going this summer, with an eye to shoot in San Francisco and Italy.




			Related Video		







	Actors are being lined up, although no deals are made and much is contingent on Guadagnino's deal being closed. Andrew Garfield, A Complete Unknown scene-stealer Monica Barbaro, and Anora actor Yura Borisov are among those said to be circling.  


	Altman co-founded OpenAI, but in the fall of 2023, after mounting safety concerns regarding AI, and reports of abusive behavior, was ousted as the head of the company by his board. Five days later, after a revolt, he was reinstated. Sources say that if all goes as planned, Garfield would play Altman, Barbaro would play chief technology office Mira Murati, and Borisov would play Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder who led the movement to get rid of Altman.


Artificial will unite Guadagnino and Amazon MGM for the third time. He directed After the Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield, and Ayo Edebiri, which the studio is releasing in theaters Oct. 10. He also directed Challengers, starring Zendaya, which the studio released theatrically last year.

	











	Luca had been previously on track to shoot Rock, a World War Two action movie that would have starred Colin Farrell, for DC. That project had been eying a late summer start of production before DC reconsidered its plans, citing “daylight issues.” Now, ironically, Guadagnino's new project will likely begin before Rock's original start.

Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz's feature about devastation wreaked by European conquistadors in the Pacific debuted in Cannes.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Janus Films has picked up the North American rights to Lav Diaz's epic historical drama Magellan, which debuted out of competition in Cannes.


	Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal's plays the titular Portuguese explorer in the 160-minute feature from the Filipino auteur Diaz, best known for earlier films like The Woman Who Left and From What Is Before.



	Bernal as a despotic and at times deluded Magellan persuades the Spanish Crown to fund his bold 16th century expedition to the fabled lands of the East, only to unleash a decade of devastation wreaked by European conquistadors in the Pacific as part of colonial conquests.

	A synopsis from the film's producers states: “The voyage is exhausting beyond expectations, with hunger and mutiny pushing the crew to their limits. Upon reaching the islands of the Malayan Archipelago, Magellan's mind changes. He becomes obsessed with conquest and conversion, which sparks violent uprisings beyond his control. This is not the myth of Magellan, but the truth of his journey.”

	Janus Films earlier picked up the 2025 Cannes titles Resurrection from director Bi Gan and Hlynur Pálmason's The Love That Remains.


	Janus Films in a statement said of its latest acquisition: “We are thrilled that Lav Diaz's work will reach a wider North American audience than ever before through his mesmerizing Magellan, a unique collaboration between the modern master of Filipino filmmaking and one of the finest, most soulful actors of his generation. A vivid slice of vital history rendered on a grand scale, Magellan is visually ravishing and profoundly moving.”

	











	The distribution deal was negotiated by Janus Films and Luxbox. The producer credits on Magellan are shared by Rosa Filmes, Andergraun Films, Black Cap Pictures, Ten17P, El Viaje Filmes, Volos Films, Lib Films and AKP21.

What's your type?


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Mariah Carey is stepping into a new era. After going nearly seven years without dropping a proper album, the pop superstar appeared to tease on social media that she has a new LP in the works — and the first taste of it may be coming sooner than you think.  


	In one video posted Monday (June 2), Mimi looks as glamorous as ever while sitting in a car, listening to a single with a groovy club beat on the radio. The video then cuts to a shot of the screen displaying an untitled track — “T:D_MC16.mp3.” “To show my appreciation for your support, thank you DJs,” Carey's smoky voice says as the track heats up.  

	











	The clip then pans to the car's license plate, which displays the following: “MC16.” The caption reads, “What's your type?” — the same message that the video ends with. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Based on the license plate, it looks like the Songbird Supreme is finally following up 2018's Caution, which was the 15th album in her discography — as in, her next LP will be her 16th, or “MC16.” It would also appear that the first single could arrive Friday (June 6), based on another video Carey posted on Instagram one day after the first one. In the second clip, she sits again in a car while music plays on the stereo system, the engine loudly running before the shot cuts to a message reading, “June 6.” 

	











Billboard has reached out to Carey's reps for comment.


	Though the “Obsessed” singer has been active over the years with her yearly “All I Want for Christmas” pushes, fans have been growing increasingly impatient for fresh music. Carey's last album, Caution, reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200, one of 18 top 10 entries she's scored on the chart over the course of her career.  


	The new teasers come just a few days after Carey celebrated the 20th anniversary of one of her most iconic albums, The Emancipation of Mimi, which spent two weeks at No. 1 in 2005. To mark the occasion, she recently released a special multi-disc anniversary edition of the project, featuring remixes, bonus tracks, radio mixes and a cappella cuts compiled together in one place for the first time.

Former New York concert promoter Heath Miller says he's working with Billy McFarland to stage a Fyre pop-up at his family resort on the Honduran island of Utila.

	Dave Brooks



A Honduras-based hotel owner says he's reviving the Fyre Festival brand alongside Billy McFarland as a pop-up experience at his island resort, marking the latest twist in a bizarre saga. 


Heath Miller, a former New York concert promoter and one-time vp and talent buyer at Webster Hall in Manhattan, says he reached an agreement with McFarland to stage a 300-to-400-person Fyre Resort Pop-Up at his hotel, Coral View Beach Resort, located on the island of Utila, one of Honduras' famed Bay Islands in the Caribbean. The event will run from Sept. 3-10.


	Tickets are cheap: Just book a room at Miller's 25-room resort, and a pass for Fyre is included. Rooms start at $198 per night for singles, $329 for couples, $399 for triples and $449 for the hotel's four-bed room.

	Miller is quick to point out that the September event is not being billed as Fyre Festival II, adding that tickets from that event won't get you access to the Fyre Resort Pop-Up, which he says will be more low key than what had been planned for Fyre's comeback festival in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. There will be live entertainment, although Miller notes that he hasn't secured any talent yet and says the festival won't have a large budget or a splashy lineup.


	“This event isn't for an artist looking for a $100,000 fee,” he says. “Honestly, for me, this is a promotional vehicle for my hotel and it plays into my grand plan — I'm working on writing a book on my music career, and the book was supposed to end last June [with a story about] Jack Antonoff in Asbury Park. But instead, I guess Fyre is going to be the final chapter of the book.”


	In Miller's estimation, the controversy around the disastrous 2018 festival — which garnered international headlines when ticketholders arrived on a Bahamian island to find that the promised luxury event had not been realized — may ultimately be the biggest draw.


	“Fyre Festival is a tainted brand that obviously has a horrible reputation, but at the end of the day, this brand can create press and awareness better than Coachella can,” he says.


	Miller has been managing the hotel since 2019 for his late father, who bought the island resort in the 1990s. He says his idea for the Fyre pop-up is partially inspired by Sixthman, the concert and cruise ships company owned by Norwegian Cruise Lines that stages music-themed cruises for artists like Lindsey Stirling, Joe Bonamassa and comedian Nate Bargatze.


	“Originally, I wanted to do fan club and events here,” on Utila, says Miller, who hoped to match music with scuba diving and water excursions. He adds, “Fans want to engage with the artist in unique and different ways and see them play in unique settings,” noting that the Fyre pop-up presented a rare opportunity to build proof of concept. 


	Under the terms of their agreement, McFarland maintains full ownership of Fyre, and Miller will serve as venue manager and site host.


	Miller says he's already secured permits and local approval for the Fyre Resort Pop-Up and said he hopes the famed festival brand creates some positive buzz for Utila. The island is popular year-round with scuba divers and snorkelers who visit the island to swim with sharks and explore the 600-mile-long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, but it isn't as well-known as other Caribbean destinations like Barbados, St. Lucia, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.


	Miller adds he's well aware of McFarland's past failures with Fyre Festival, most famously with the disastrous first edition in 2018, which left hundreds of fans temporarily trapped on Grand Exuma island. McFarland masterminded the event, according to the FBI, convincing fans to shell out thousands for luxury accommodations that turned out to be emergency tents and gourmet meals that were little more than cheese sandwiches.


	McFarland went to prison after admitting to stealing $26 million from investors for the event and has been working to repay them since being released from prison in 2022 after serving four years of his six-year sentence. While serving in solitary confinement, McFarland came up with the idea for a sequel to Fyre, which he had hoped would repair his image, and bounced around different sites in the Bahamas and Mexico before landing on Playa del Carmen near Cancun. McFarland ultimately hired Mexican firm Lost Nights to produce the event and staged a press conference on March 27 with local officials to highlight it.


	However, things went south in April when city leaders from Playa del Carmen announced that no permits for Fyre Festival had been issued in the seaside town. McFarland responded by releasing images of permits that he said proved Fyre was happening, but he later pulled the plug on the event and refunded ticket holders. On April 24, McFarland announced he was selling Fyre's assets and intellectual property and had reached an agreement with a streaming service to license the name.


	Miller says McFarland retains the name for Fyre and has a core team of a half-dozen individuals working with him, including his long-time partner, Michael Falb.


	“I'm well aware of Billy's past and I think it's important that we are transparent about what happened. I personally met with the mayor of Utila when securing the permits for this event and even showed him the documentaries about Fyre Festival,” Miller said of the films FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened and Fyre Fraud, both of which were released in 2019 and chronicled the festival's rise and fall.


	“Billy has issues and one of his biggest flaws is that he tends to trust people more than he should,” Miller says, noting that McFarland reminds him of himself when he was a young promoter working New York's nightlife circuit as an independent concert promoter, both for himself and for John Scher's Metropolitan Concerts and later Webster Hall. Miller notes he worked with McFarland prior to Fyre Festival, when McFarland was running millennial VIP company Magnises.


	“He never stiffed me on a bill — we always got paid what we were owed,” Miller says. “I look at Billy's mistakes and I ask myself what I would have done if I was controlling millions of dollars for a huge party. I don't know. What I can tell you about Billy is that he a big kid at heart that really just wants to throw the world's greatest party.”

The tour in the U.K. and Europe will be his first dates in the region since 2019.

	Thomas Smith



Drake has expanded his upcoming summer tour with his newly-announced $ome $pecial $hows 4 UK run through the United Kingdom and Europe with PARTYNEXTDOOR.


	Earlier this year it was announced that Drake would headline Wireless Festival in London on all three nights (July 11-13), and the Canadian superstar will now expand his run to include shows at Birmingham's Utilita Arena (July 20, 21) and Manchester's Co-op Live (July 25, 26) alongside PARTYNEXTDOOR.

	











	The tour will then continue through Europe over the ensuing months with dates in Amsterdam, Stockholm, Paris, Berlin, Milan and concludes in Hamburg, Germany on Sep. 23. See the pair's full run of shows below.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Tickets for the shows will first be available on presale on Wednesday (Jun. 4) before a general sale begins on Friday (Jun. 6) on Drake's official website.


	The upcoming dates will be Drake's first run of shows in the U.K. and Europe in six years since his 2019 Assassination Vacation Tour. Earlier this year, he toured throughout Australia on his Anita Max Win jaunt, though a number of dates in Sydney and Auckland, New Zealand were cancelled with short notice due “scheduling conflicts.”


	Earlier this year Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR released their collaborative album $ome $exy $ongs 4 U which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and No. 3 on the U.K. Official Albums Chart. The LP was Drake's 14th No. 1 atop the Billboard 200 and PARTYNEXTDOOR's first chart-topper.

	











	In May, Drake also teased the return of his OVO Fest in his hometown in Toronto, Canada. Appearing at Central Cee's show, he confirmed the star-studded event would “be back this year.” It will be his first time hosting the event since his high-profile beef with Kendrick Lamar and his ongoing lawsuit with his label Universal Music Group.

""I think it's one of my favorite episodes,"" Joe Jonas says of South Park's season 13 premiere.

	Tyler Jenke



Joe Jonas has taken a look back at South Park‘s famous spotlight of the Jonas Brothers, admitting that he views it as a personal “claim to fame.”


	Joe's comments appear in the new episode of Mythical Kitchen's Last Meals (via Entertainment Weekly), where he explained to host Josh Scherer that his opinions were not shared by his brothers at the time.


	“I think I was the only brother that loved it,” Joe explained. “Our skin was not as thick back then, and I thought it was hilarious, because I watched South Park, and I was like, ‘This is so funny, I know what they're doing, they make fun of everyone!'

	“To be made fun of by a comic is usually a sign that they give a s–t, and they care, and it's funny,” he added. “They really went for us.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Joe, along with brothers Kevin and Nick, were spotlighted as part of The Ring, the premiere episode of South Park's 13th season in March 2009. The episode, which was inspired by the release of Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience just weeks earlier, sees the fictionalized trio convincing their fans to wear purity rings at the behest of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse.


	However, Jonas agreed that he was able to see the humor in the South Park parody, noting that the band weren't the specific focus, but rather it was “Boss Mickey” that was in the sights of the creators.


	“I mean, what an honor to get my ass kicked by Mickey,” Jonas added. “I think it's one of my favorite episodes. And later on, now, we just laugh. We love that. I think it's so great. Definitely a claim to fame for me.”

	











	The recent comments from Joe align with Nick's own from 2016, in which he addressed the episode in a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything' session.


	“When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time and so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on,” he explained. “But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times.”


	Joe himself reflected on the episode just months later in his own AMA session, stating he was “so pumped” when it first aired, but conceded that “Nick was really kind of not into watching it.”


	“I thought it was the funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously if you go to a comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it,” he explained. “And for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. 


	“Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse.”


	Joe's comments also come just days after the release of his second studio album, Music for People Who Believe in Love, which will be followed in August by the Jonas Brothers' seventh album, Greetings from Your Hometown.

The Belfast trio are set to play a number of shows at U.K. festivals this summer.

	Thomas Smith



Kneecap has announced its biggest-ever English show with a huge headline date at London's OVO Wembley Arena this coming September.


	The Belfast hip-hop trio will head to the 12,500-capacity show on Sep. 18 and follows their headline show at London's Wide Awake festival in Brockwell Park in the capital in May. Tickets for the show will go on presale on Jun. 4 at 10 a.m. BST, with a full general sale on Jun. 6 at 10 a.m. BST .


	In April, the group came into wider focus following their shows at Coachella Festival where they shared a Pro-Palestine message on stage. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” Following the shows, the trio split with their booking agent, and Sharon Osbourne and right-wing critics called for their visas to be revoked. 

	











	A month later in late May, band member Mo Chara, born Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, was charged with a terror offense following historic videos which allegedly showed the MC shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” in reference to the two militant groups. Both are proscribed terror group status by the U.K. government, and alleged support is forbidden under the 2000 Terrorism Act. Ó hAnnaidh denies the charge, and called it “a carnival of distraction” away from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on June 18.

	In response, several shows in Germany were cancelled, and the group were removed from the Eden Session lineup in Cornwall, England and TRNSMT in Glasgow, Scotland. The trio announced make-up gigs in nearby cities which sold out instantly. A number of acts including Massive Attack, Brian Eno, CMAT and more have backed the group in an open letter, calling for artistic freedom of expression.

	











	The group are due to play a number of massive shows this summer. Later this month the group will head to Glastonbury Festival, before shows at Green Man, 2000 Trees and shows with Fontaines D.C. in their home city in Belfast in August. They released their album Fine Art in 2024 and are currently working on a follow-up.

	After his DC Studios pic Sgt. Rock got pushed a full year, Luca Guadagnino has moved fast to find his next movie. The director in talks to helm Artificial at Amazon MGM Studios. While deals are still not closed, he looks to have found a strong ensemble as insiders say Andrew Garfield, Monica Barbaro and Anora breakout Yura Borisov are in early talks to star.


	While not confirmed, sources say the film revolves around the period at the artificial intelligence company OpenAI in 2023 that saw CEO Sam Altman fired and rehired in a matter of days. Simon Rich wrote the script and will produce alongside Heyday Films' David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford. Jennifer Fox is also in talks to produce.

	Guadagnino is someone who always likes to work and was getting ready to shoot Sgt. Rock later this summer with Colin Farrell set to star. When the film had to push a full year, Guadagnino moved quickly to find something he could get up and running this year and mulled several options before landing on Artificial.


			Watch on Deadline		







	While technically the film is in development until everyone has a closed deal, the idea would be to shoot this year once those deals have closed.


	The film reunites Guadagnino and Amazon MGM Studios. He directed After the Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which the studio is releasing in theaters October 10, and Challengers, starring Zendaya, which the studio released theatrically last year.


	Heyman is also already in business with the studio as he gears up to produce the next James Bond film alongside Amy Pascal. Additionally, he produced all eight film adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, as well as the three Fantastic Beasts films.

	











	Guadagnino is repped by CAA and Range Media Partners, Garfield is repped by CAA, Barbaro is repped by UTA and Range, and Borisov is repped by UTA and ColorCreative.

	“The original story comes from something my grandfather told me when I was young,” Tsou told Deadline's Melanie Goodfellow in our Cannes Studio. “He told me the left is the devil's hand, do not use it. At the time I was already ‘corrected' as I was originally left-handed, so I didn't really understand, but it stayed in my mind for a long, long time.”


	“The story was in my heart for so long, and I really, really want to show how the world how beautiful my country is. This is like a love letter to Taiwan,” Tsou said.


	Deadline Chief Film Critic Pete Hammond exclaimed, “Shih-Ching shows strong command of storytelling and shifting tones with high dramatics that could careen out of control but never do, instead keeping us on the edge of our seats. Baker's tight editing really comes into play here and proves worthy of Douglas Sirk at his height. Ultimately what holds it all together are the strong performances all around.”

	











	Coming out of the fest, Left-Handed Girl stands at 95% fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes. 


Shih-Ching Tsou is a longtime collaborator of Baker's who worked as a producer on his earlier films including Starlet, Tangerine, The Florida Project and Red Rocket. The duo also co-directed a film called Take Out 21 years ago.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


Slow Horses will return to Apple TV+ for Season 5 this fall.


	The streamer revealed Tuesday that the fifth installment of the espionage drama will debut with the first two episodes on September 24, followed by one episode weekly until October 22. Luckily, there's already a Season 6 incoming, too, as the series was renewed in October.


	Along with the premiere date, Apple TV+ also gave a glimpse at the new season in a series of photos. They don't give away much, but there is a glimpse of Nick Mohammed will also guest star in Season 5. See those below.


Slow Horses is a darkly humorous espionage drama that follows a dysfunctional team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 known unaffectionately as Slough House. Gary Oldman stars as Jackson Lamb, the brilliant but cantankerous leader of the spies, who end up in Slough House due to their career-ending mistakes as they frequently find themselves blundering around the smoke and mirrors of the espionage world.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In Season 5, everyone is suspicious when resident tech nerd Roddy Ho has a glamorous new girlfriend, but when a series of increasingly bizarre events occur across the city, it falls to the Slow Horses to work out how everything is connected. After all, Lamb knows that in the world of espionage, the London Rules — cover your back — always apply.


	The cast also includes Kristin Scott Thomas, Jack Lowden, Saskia Reeves, Rosalind Eleazar, Christopher Chung, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Ruth Bradley, James Callis, Tom Brooke, and Jonathan Pryce. 

	











Slow Horses is produced for Apple TV+ by Heartstopper maker See-Saw Films, with Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Julian Stevens, Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, Adam Randall, Gail Mutrux, Douglas Urbanski and Oldman serving as executive producers. Saul Metzstein, who earned an Emmy nomination for Season 3, returns to helm Season 5.

Nicole Clemens is heading to Amazon to lead international originals. 


	Clemens, the former Paramount TV Studios boss, will take up the Vice President and Head of International Originals role at Prime Video and MGM Studios, which comes after her new boss Kelly Day had her role expanded amid a time of change for the juggernaut.


	Clemens will lead an international originals team hat last year made 140 shows and movies across more than 20 territories including the likes of Culpa Tuya, Maxton Hall and Clarkson's Farm. Upcoming projects include Red Queen and Betty La Fea (Colombia); and new projects like Newtopia, Superboys of Malegaon, Graduation Trip: Mallorca and Costiera.

	











	Clemens will spend a period of time at the Amazon MGM Studios' Culver City HQ, before relocating to London, according to an internal note from Day that has just been sent out, seen by Deadline. She joins international originals bosses including Javiera Balmaceda (Head of International Originals, Latin America, Canada & Australia), Tara Erer (Head of International Originals, Northern Europe), Nicole Morganti (Head of International Originals, Southern Europe) and John Holmes (Director of International Originals Production & Post), who will report into Clemens.

	She is a former Paramount TV Studios boss and Paramount+ President of Original Scripted Series, who left soon after Paramount TV Studios was shut down, after working on the likes of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, Reacher and Cross.

	











	“I look forward to Nicole joining the Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios family next month and I'm sure you'll provide a warm welcome,” said Day.


	The news comes at a time of change for Amazon both in the U.S. and internationally. Studios boss Jennifer Salke recently exited soon after international originals boss James Farrell and UK MD Chris Bird. After Salke left, Day was handed an expanded role internationally.

Longtime soap opera star and Hallmark hunk Jack Wagner is a married man. On May 31, 2025, his girlfriend of four years, musician Michelle Wolf, revealed via Instagram that the two had tied the knot in an intimate ceremony. 

Captioning a series of photos from the wedding that she has since made private, Wolf tagged Wagner and their photographer, and wrote, “We did it!!!!!! MARRIED in front of our little family!! #MrAndMrs ♥️♥️♥️ 💃🕺”

At the time of publication on June 2, Wagner had not yet commented on or shared his surprise wedding news publicly. It's not clear when or where the “When Calls The Heart” star married Wolf, but on May 29, Wagner shared a video of himself filming in Capri, Italy, as he prepared to make a temporary return to “The Bold and the Beautiful,” where he starred as Nick Marone from 2003 to 2012.

In a series of photos Wolf posted to Instagram, the newlyweds were beaming — with Wagner in a tuxedo and Wolf in a wedding dress and veil. Images included them laughing at an outdoor altar as the priest marrying them looked on, and posing at a small reception. 

Wagner has shared very little publicly about his relationship with Wolf, but before making her profile private, she shared a photo of them on January 12, 2022, to mark their first anniversary together as a couple. The first time she posted a photo of them together was the previous May, sharing a brief video of them looking into a mirror, over which she wrote, “My man.”

Friends flooded Wolf's posts with comments, including Wagner's co-star in Hallmark's “The Wedding March” franchise, Josie Bissett, who wrote, “❤️❤️❤️Congratulations!!!!!❤️❤️❤️”

A friend of Wolf's wrote, “MICHELLE!! You're such a beautiful and gorgeous Mrs. Wagner! Lucky Jack!!! You both look so incredibly happy! Congratulations and I can't wait to hear about your Italy trip!! Love you so much!! ❤️👰🤵‍♂️💍”

A post shared by Jack Wagner (@jackwagnerofficial)

In her series of images from the wedding, Wolf also included a blended family photo featuring the happy couple flanked by two of their grown kids — Wolf's daughter Ornella, who commented “love you mommy” on the post, and Wagner's son Peter. 

Wagner raised Peter with his ex-wife, actress Kristina Wagner. The former “General Hospital” co-stars went public with their relationship in 1990, when she was expecting Peter, and married three years later, per Soaps. They divorced in 2006. Their younger son, Harrison, died at age 27 in 2022 after years of battling addiction, the former couple shared at the time. 

In 2011, Wagner was also reunited with his daughter Kerry from a previous relationship, per People, who was put up for adoption as an infant. The two did forge a relationship and she's appeared in his Instagram posts periodically, but it's not clear if she was present for his nuptials. 

Wagner will soon return to the set of “When Calls The Heart,” as season 13 begins filming mid-summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Below Deck' Fans React to the Chaotic Season 12 Premiere: Lost Luggage, Stressed Chef, & a Black Light","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/below-deck-fans-season-12-premiere/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:27:41 GMT","

Season 12 of “Below Deck” debuted on June 2, and the episode was filled with drama, which had fans talking. 

Captain Kerry Titheradge returned as the head of the boat, and he immediately told the crew, “The way I manage, is that I'm very firm, but I'm fair with everybody. But don't take my kindness for weakness.”

Despite his warning, the first big mistake that the crew made was forgetting to bring the charter guests' luggage on board, which had Titheradge scrambling to retrieve them.

“They left the charters luggage on the dock?!?! It's the FIRST charter!” a fan tweeted. Another posted a photo of “Below Deck” veteran Eddie Lucas and wrote, “You know who wouldn't have left the luggage behind?!”

Another point of contention was Chef Lawrence Snowden, who was new to the “Below Deck” franchise, and despite his initial calm demeanor, started stressing out over being filmed.

“Chef is already freaking out. And he's done. Hope Captain has some other chefs lined up,” a viewer wrote. Another shared, “I'm OBSESSED with how much Cheffy hates the cameras.”

Later in the episode, the primary charter guest showed up with a black light and checked the cabin for germs.

“These charter guests have a long list of complaints. They should just go to bed,” a fan quipped. 

A post shared by Fraser (@fraserolender)

According to chief stew Fraser Olender, “Below Deck” season 12 will be full of lots of ups and downs. “There are firings. There are hirings. There are disasters left, right and center. But I cannot tell you enough how dramatic and how fun this season is. It is nonstop,” he told Us Weekly on June 2.

“I was so excited to get into this season. I think I've grown so much since I first started out on the show — and you never know what you're going to get as a crew,” Olender shared.

He continued, “But I just wanted to make sure that out of any season, this one is where I wanted to bring my crew to the best of their ability. I wanted harmony and I wanted love and friendship and peace amongst all the madness. I think we succeeded.”

There's also an incident during season 12 where the authorities get involved. “You haven't seen this yet, but I had to go speak to the local police in French to deal with the situation. It was a lot,” Olender told Decider.

“It was nuts. I was almost embarrassed to discuss the issue we were having with the police. But you've got to do what you've got to do to make it work in these waters,” the reality star shared.

However, Olender added, “I'm very grateful and happy to be here. I know what's required of me and the rest I just roll with. There's always going to be drama, but at least I know, or I feel like I know, how to do the job.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jennie Garth and Peter Facinelli Celebrate Daughter Fiona's High School Graduation","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/jennie-garth-daughter-graduation/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:09:30 GMT","

Jennie Garth and ex-husband Peter Facinelli recently came together to celebrate a major family milestone: their youngest daughter Fiona's high school graduation. The event was documented on Garth's Instagram, where the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum and Hallmark star posted, “She did it!! My baby girl graduated high school! I am so beyond proud of her!! My heart is filled with so much excitement to see her fly! I love you so much @fionaeveee.”

A post shared by Jennie 🤍 (@jenniegarth)

In the carousel of photos, Garth, 53, posed alongside Fiona, 18, as well as her older daughters Luca, 27, and Lola, 22. Also in the family group was Garth's current husband, David Abrams, whom she married in 2015. The sweet family moment was highlighted by a video showing the family firing confetti as Fiona's name was called at the ceremony.

For Garth and Facinelli, this celebration was about more than just Fiona's academic achievement. The former couple, who were married from 2001 to 2013, have made headlines in recent months for their openly improved post-divorce relationship. Garth told E! News earlier this year, “For so many years, it wasn't as fun as it could have been. We made it seem like it was great and it was all rainbows and ponies, but it was not at times.”

Their relationship saw a turning point when Facinelli appeared on Garth's podcast, “I Choose Me,” in November. Reflecting on their history, Garth said, “We were together for 17 years, and I love his fiancée and his new son. It's just nice to be open and be easy.” Facinelli, 51, who also shares a young son named Jack with fiancée Lily Anne Harrison, echoed these sentiments in a separate interview, telling E! News, “I love her. She's the mother of my kids. I consider her a friend. I consider her husband a friend.”

The graduation celebration marked a joyful moment after a challenging year for the family. In January, Garth and her daughters had to evacuate their home due to Los Angeles wildfires. Facinelli stepped in and offered them refuge, which Garth described in a tearful video as an example of their family's resilience and support. “My family and I are safe, our home made it through the night and we are feeling so blessed, so fortunate, and so lucky,” Garth said at the time. 

Fans were delighted to see the family united for Fiona's big day. Among the many Instagram moments,  she echoed one of her famous lines from “Beverly Hills, 90210,” writing in the caption, “She chose herself!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former ‘Dancing With the Stars' Host Makes Big Career Announcement","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/dwts-star-hosting-new-game-show/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:44:52 GMT","

As fans get ready to watch Ribeiro and Hough's third season hosting “Dancing With the Stars” together, former host Erin Andrews is gearing up to start her first hosting gig since leaving the show. 

After her unceremonious dismissal from the show after Season 28, Andrews focused on her job in sports journalism, as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox, and started her WEAR clothing line and “Calm Down with Erin and Charissa” podcast. Now that she's made her way back into reality TV to co-host the new game show “99 To Beat,” Andrews is, understandably, nervous.

“I'm going on a trip, I'm going on a work trip on Friday,” Andrews told producer Ryan Musick on her podcast. “And I'm leaving for a while to film a new game show for FOX.”

“And I'm very nervous, I have a ton of anxiety. But I'm excited,” Andrews added. “I am excited to get back into that world. Obviously, it's been a minute since I got the boot from “Dancing With the Stars” with Tom Bergeron. I affectionately love to tell that story. My agent is like, ‘Don't say that, you weren't fired, you were replaced.' I was fired. I was fired.”

She went on to reveal that she'd been trying to find a game show to host for a while. “I was on “Pyramid” one time with [Michael] Strahan, up against Aaron Rodgers. Had a blast doing that. I love that whole vibe, and had been really, you know, taking meetings, and trying to get back into that world.”

“I like playing off people, I like playing off contestants,” she continued. But she couldn't resist one swipe at “DWTS,” cheekily telling listeners. “Super pumped I don't have to wear a ballroom gown. I'm very excited about that.”

Andrews' new show, “99 To Beat,” first debuted in Belgium in 2018. Initially, 100 contestants compete against each other in mental, physical, and just plain ridiculous challenges. In one challenge, “pairs of contestants were blindfolded and had to identify the sound of squeaky toys,” Deadline reported.

“We were looking for a show about normal people,” the show's creator, Jo Dehennin, said. “We wanted to do something for everyone that everyone could participate in. And it is out of the ordinary in that usually gameshows have winners and there has to be some extraordinary quality to the contestants, but in this show it is all about not losing.”

Whoever finishes last in each challenge is out, and whoever makes it to the end as the final contestant standing takes home a jackpot of $100,000. 

Following the tremendous success of the Belgian format, other countries adopted it. The United States will be the 11th country to create its own version of 99 To Beat. According to TV Insider, Andrews will co-host with Ken Jeong, which is scheduled to air Wednesdays at 9 ET/8 CT in the fall.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kevin McGarry Playfully Roasted by Wife Kayla Wallace","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/kevin-mcgarry-roast/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:45:00 GMT","

Hallmark star Kevin McGarry received an epic roasting from his wife, “When Calls the Heart” alum Kayla Wallace, and he took it all in stride. 

Wallace did a trend that made the rounds on social media a while back, which utilized ChatGPT to create a “roast” of McGarry. She chuckled as she read the results, and Hallmark fans got a kick out of it all. 

On May 29, McGarry shared the video via his Instagram Reels. He didn't include a caption with his post, and it seemed he didn't need one. Text added over the video read, “CHAT GPT ROAST,” and Wallace held back giggles as she read the chat off her phone. 

It began, “Kevin McGarry, the man who's mastered the art of playing the charming, slightly brooding love interest in Hallmark movies.”

The roast continued, “If you've ever wondered what it would be like to date a man who looks like he just stepped out of a Christmas card, Kevin's your guy. With his perfectly tousled hair and sweater collection that could make any winter scene feel like a cozy embrace. He's the poster child for romantic cliches.”

A post shared by Kevin McGarry (@kevin_mcgarry_w)

“But let's not forget his dedication to the craft. Kevin's commitment to portraying characters who are always in the right place at the right time, usually just in time to save the day or share a heartfelt kiss, is truly commendable. It's as if he's been genetically engineered to embody the ideal man next door.”

Wallace kept going with the roast that wasn't over quite yet. “His performances are so consistently wholesome, they could be used as a benchmark for measuring the purity of maple syrup. And then there's his Canadian charm. Kevin hails from Ontario, which means he's legally obligated to be polite and apologetic even when he's not at fault. This politeness extends to his acting, where he delivers lines with such sincerity that you might start questioning your own life choices.”

A post shared by Kayla Wallace (@imkaylawallace)

The Chat GPT roast also teased, “He could read the phone book and could make it sound like a heartfelt monologue. So here's to Kevin McGarry, the man who proves that sometimes the best way to win hearts is by being impossibly perfect. Keep doing you, Kevin. The world needs more sweater-clad romantic leads who make us believe in love, even if it's just for 90 minutes.”

Both Wallace and McGarry chuckled and said, “Thanks, Chat GPT.” McGarry filmed the video and could be heard chuckling frequently as Wallace read the roast. 

One “When Calls the Heart” fan commented, “That's the nicest roast I've ever heard! 😍 I think chatGPT must've set a special parameter for Hallmark actors. Wise move, chatGPT! 😉

Another remarked, “Perfectly read by wife Kayla! Love the laughs too! Keep doing what you're doing, Kevin! Your fans love it and silliness aside, this world needs more of this goodness, in fiction and life. We agree, GPT! 👏❤️❤️”

Someone else quipped, “That was great!!! But Kayla, ‘the wife,' reading it makes it even better!!! Thanks chat GPT for ‘the benchmark for measuring the purity of maple syrup.' Keep doing you, Kevin!! 😂😆”

Jordan Staying Off Social Media Gives Bigger Box Office Audience Returns","https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/denzel-washington-michael-b-jordan-advice-social-media-1235128952/","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:45:00 GMT","

Michael B. Jordan may have a decade-long creative partnership with Ryan Coogler, but it's another one of Jordan's past directors who has influenced his relationship to fans the most: Denzel Washington.  

Washington directed Jordan in 2021 film “A Journal for Jordan.” According to “Sinners” actor Jordan, Washington imparted wisdom about how to navigate fame in the social media era. Washington advised Jordan to stay offline as a way to entice audiences to go to theaters, telling Jordan, “Why would they pay to see you on a weekend if they see you all week for free?”

 










Jordan told Vulture the story, adding that between his hectic shooting schedule — Jordan is set to direct, produce, and star in “The Thomas Crown Affair” remake as well as “I Am Legend 2” — he hasn't “really been out in the world” anyway.

Jordan did, however, anticipate his own personal desire to document his life: The star hired a videographer in 2018 to capture his journey both onscreen and off. That videographer later was Jordan's assistant on his directorial debut “Creed III” and will be an associate producer on “Thomas Crown.”

 










“The intent was me feeling like I don't take in the moments,” Jordan said. “Because I'm always on the go, always working and grinding. One day I wanted to have something to reflect on outside of the memories in my head. … I've missed out on a lot of life. I'm not complaining — but that balance is something I've always struggled with, of the personal and professional stuff.”

Jordan might reunite with his mentor Washington soon, too, as Washington teased his involvement in “Black Panther 3.” The film has not yet been announced but Coogler is expected to return to helm the MCU film. It's unclear if Jordan would reprise his role, though, as his character died in the first film and was briefly resurrected for a dream sequence in the sequel. 

Jordan reflected to Vulture about how Coogler believing in him and his talent changed his career after being cast in Coogler's directorial debut “Fruitvale Station.” 

“He told me he thought I was a movie star,” Jordan said. “He thought I was a great actor, and he wanted to show the rest of the world that, and he wanted to make the movie with me.”

Scarlett Johansson didn't hold back when showing her “Jurassic Park” fandom to producer Steven Spielberg. The actress, who will now lead franchise installment “Jurassic World: Rebirth,” recalled first meeting with Spielberg about the role. 

“I had a meeting with him and I don't actually know if he knew the depths of my ‘Jurassic' fandom, but I'm hoping that no one explained it to him too thoroughly because it maybe would've come off as being a little too much,” Johansson told THR. “Although knowing Steven now, he was excited when I shared how much it would mean to me to play any part in ‘Jurassic.' I could've played it cooler and maybe I wouldn't have gotten it.”

She added of the experience,  “It taught me that if you are enthusiastic about a project, it is actually good to share your enthusiasm. You don't have to dumb it down or play it cool.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






Johansson first learned about the potential “Jurassic World: Rebirth” casting while on set for her own directorial debut “Eleanor the Great.” Johansson had to juggle her enthusiasm for both projects. 

 










“When I first heard that there was a new ‘Jurassic' movie coming, that it was written with a female lead who was the age that I could fit into, and that it was happening during a time period that I could shoot, it was particularly surreal,” Johansson said. “I was actually in the middle of making ‘Eleanor' — we were filming it at the time — so there was a lot happening at the time. I had to compartmentalize my nervous excitement for the job in front of me while also focusing on making it work. I would have these really geeked out, fangirl moments and then be, like, ‘OK, put that away for a second.'”

She continued that working on “Jurassic World: Rebirth” was “unbelievable” especially due to her love of the original “Jurassic Park” film. 

“I've been trying to get into a ‘Jurassic' movie for, I don't know, 15 years or something,” Johansson said. “I was so stoked that it all came together.” Johansson reflected on how watching “Jurassic Park” in theaters was a monumental “collective experience” for her at the time too. 

“It was so thrilling and has stayed with me forever. Those kinds of movies are rare, and I'm here for them. I'm here to be carried away, entertained and thrilled,” she said.”

If you could go back in time and change the most pivotal moments of your life, would you? Director Kogonada helms heartfelt romance-drama “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” that stars Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell as two strangers who become caught in the folds of fate.

The synopsis reads: “What if you could open a doorway and walk through it to re-live a defining moment from your past? Sarah (Robbie) and David (Farrell) are single strangers who meet at a mutual friend's wedding and soon, through a surprising twist of fate, find themselves on A Big Bold Beautiful Journey – a funny, fantastical, sweeping adventure together where they get to re-live important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present…and possibly getting a chance to alter their futures.” Kevin Kline and Phoebe Waller-Bridge also star.

“A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” is written by Seth Reiss, who also produces along with Bradley Thomas, Ryan Friedkin, and Youree Henley. Kogonada executive produces with Ilene Feldman, Gino Falsetto, Ori Eisen, Paul Mezey, Micah Green, Dan Steinman, and John Atwood. 

 










Farrell reunites with director Kogonada after starring in 2022 film “After Yang.” Recent IndieWire Honors recipient Farrell is rumored to return for “The Penguin” Season 2, as well as Matt Reeves' “The Batman” sequel, next. Both are WBD projects. 

His “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” co-star Robbie is also at Warner Bros. with Emerald Fennell‘s adaptation of the Emily Brontë novel “Wuthering Heights.” Robbie produced Fennell's prior two films through her LuckyChap banner; she'll star as Catherine alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff. Elordi is back with his “Saltburn” writer/director Fennell for the feature, which has already caused a stir online due to its casting choices and first look images.

And Kogonada announced in 2022 that he was going to helm a limited series about the murder of Vincent Chin. Chloé Zhao was set to serve as an executive producer on the series. The project since has been shelved.

Sony will release “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” in theaters September 19. Check out the trailer below.

Emmy-winning actress Sheryl Lee Ralph received the Sidney Poitier Icon Tribute at the Gotham Television Awards June 2. The “Abbott Elementary” star has a special history with the tribute's namesake.

“It's a very full circle moment, because quite literally Mr. Poitier opened the door to Hollywood for me by casting me in my first film — ‘A Piece of the Action,'” Ralph told IndieWire on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony.

The 1977 crime comedy both starred and was directed by Poitier. Ralph played a supporting role in the movie, which also featured James Earl Jones. After this appearance, Ralph began scoring guest spots on popular TV show such as “Good Times” and “Wonder Woman,” before landing her Tony-nominated role in the 1981 Broadway musical “Dreamgirls.” Since then, Ralph has been a film, television and stage staple, but she professes that none of her success would have been possible without Poitier.

“Mr. Poitier looked at me and said, ‘Sheryl Lee Ralph I expect great things from you … I am sorry that the industry doesn't have more to offer you, because you deserve it.' He planted a seed in me that represented the great possibility. And because I believed in great possibility, I kept at it and never gave up. I kept honing my craft. I kept on keeping on. And I wish that he were here tonight to be able see the seed that he planted in me and how it's grown,” Ralph said.

 










She added that Poitier taught how important the director is to a project.

“I remember one day I was just lost, reading a book, and I couldn't hear what he was saying, and he just came over to the desk — we were all students in a classroom — and he just got my attention, and he said, ‘You're on my set. I am your director, and you pay attention to me' … I'll never forget that. So, I try to respect directors always,” she said.

Poitier's groundbreaking Hollywood career included an Oscar-win for “Lilies of the Field” in 1964, when he became the first Black man to receive the Best Actor Academy Award. He later starred in seminal classics like “In the Heat of the Night,” “To Sir, With Love,” and “Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?” He bridged into directing during the 1970s with credits including “Buck and the Preacher,” “A Warm December,” and “Stir Crazy.” Poitier died in 2022 at the age of 94.

Shame have announced a new album. Cutthroat, which was produced by John Congleton, arrives September 5 via Dead Oceans. The English post-punk group has also shared the album's lead single, “Cutthroat,” alongside a video, directed by Ja Humby, that features lead singer Charlie Steen riding a motorcycle in a wall of death stunt at a carnival, dancing in gold lamé shorts, and more. Check it out below.

Steen, in a press release, cited Oscar Wilde as an influence on the new song. “I was reading a lot of Oscar Wilde plays where everything was about paradox,” he said. “In ‘Cutthroat,' it's that whole idea from Lady Windermere's Fan, ‘Life's far too important to be taken seriously.'”

Cutthroat is the follow-up to 2023's Food for Worms. Shame—featuring vocalist Charlie Steen, guitarists Sean Coyle-Smith and Eddie Green, bassist Josh Finerty, and drummer Charlie Forbes—recorded the new album, which they describe as “a joyride,” at Salvation Studios in Brighton, England.

“This is about who we are,” Steen said. “Our live shows aren't performance art—they're direct, confrontational, and raw. That's always been the root of us. We live in crazy times. But it's not about ‘Poor me.' It's about ‘Fuck you.'” He added: “It's about the cowards, the cunts, the hypocrites. Let's face it, there's a lot of them around right now.”

Big Thief have announced a new album. Double Infinity is the band's sixth studio LP and follow-up to 2022's Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You. Out September 5 via 4AD, the record was made with a rotating cast of collaborators, among them Alena Spanger, Ginla's Jon Nellen, Natural Information Society's Mikel Patrick Avery, and Laraaji. Listen to lead single “Incomprehensible” below.

Now a trio, following the departure of bassist Max Oleartchik, Big Thief recorded Double Infinity live over the span of three weeks at New York's Power Station, with longtime collaborator Dom Monks handling production, engineering, and mixing duties. Following the album's release, Big Thief will kick off their Somersault Slide 360 Tour of North America.

Since 2022, all three members of Big Thief have kept busy with their solo projects. Adrianne Lenker shared Bright Future in 2024 and the live album Live at Revolution Hall earlier this year; Buck Meek put out Haunted Mountain in 2023; and James Krivchenia's Performing Belief arrived just last month. In February, the band dropped an EP of previously unheard material to support relief efforts for the California wildfires.

Lauren Duffus is an astronaut lost in inner space. In the video for “N.U.M.T.E.”, the artist moonwalks through South London in a Ralph Lauren spacesuit, navigating packed dancefloors and streets as cold, empty, and unforgiving as the far side of the moon. Apart from a quick smoke break, she's hermetically and emotionally sealed off from the city around her, adrift in her own orbit. It's difficult to tell whether the song's desperation is being muffled by her helmet or if we're picking up on a distress signal from a galaxy far away. Through bleary synths and gasping vocals, you can just barely make out the message: “I need you more than ever and I fellawaiiiii…” before the voice staggers and recedes into mournful static.

The British producer excels at channeling hard-to-name feelings into vaporous, borderless tracks. Her songs are composed of pleas without answers, calls without responses, and locked-in emotional states whose tension crests but never resolves. The psychodrama is front and center, but in Duffus' hands it's never stifling. She's enamored of music that paints in washed-out colors on the biggest canvas possible: witch house's booming, foul air, doom metal's slow-motion majesty, and the all-consuming dread of UK and Chicago drill. Duffus draws upon their atmosphere to craft weightless, post-genre collages blanketed with tissue-thin layers of voice. Her latest EP, Can's Gone Warm, is her most fully realized and strangely accessible collection of music to date, giving exciting new shape to fleeting emotions.

Like any number of young British artists working in the Dean Blunt school of deadpan art-pop, Duffus is a cryptic presence who offers little set-up or backstory for her music. But even if her voice billows and blares like a haunted Burial sample, you can still make out the contours of a pop song within her work. Our most reliable guidepost is her vocals, which she layers and abstracts until the shape of the song, rather than its lyrics, becomes the main driver of its meaning. On tracks like “Super” and “Liar,” Duffus pitches her voice somewhere between Janet Jackson and Grouper, articulating her longing in sultry R&B hooks that are sped up and washed out until they resemble pure glossolalia. The interplay between the EP's misty surface and its effervescent melodies reminded me of Kelela's Aquaphoria, and suggests that Duffus could just as easily be a straight-up pop performer as an Elizabeth Fraser-style experimental vocalist.

The power of her songs' blurred outline varies in its intensity. Duffus leaves her greatest mark on tracks where the production seems to shape her voice in real time. Her vocals on “N.U.M.T.E.” streak and smear against ghostly synths and the song's fast-paced drum'n'bass rush, as though her words were being lost in translation in real time. “Liar” offers some modest stage-setting as Duffus chants “5 a.m. in Deptford” before her airy singing is subsumed by the murder-hornet whir of a synthetic drum break. She doesn't need to fill in the specifics of what happened; the music is shattering enough on its own. Although it's just a stone's throw away geographically, “Lewisham” is a notable step down. The track is pretty but meandering, so feather-light that it's insubstantial. Over some grounding harp plucks, Duffus churns over the phrase “ooh this is something” with varying degrees of loving clarity and mushy surrender. By the song's end, it's hard not to feel like the “something” in question was a whole lot of nothing.

Closing track “Riser Brummm” is a bruising reminder of Duffus' talent and of the strengths and limits of her approach. The song is pitched between the uplift of a choral arrangement and the pendulum-swing blast of a grime synth, sending her voice to scatter and regroup like a murmuration of birds. The sound is panoramic, as she responds with muted anguish to the instrumental violence every time it barrels back her way. Without constant forward motion, the air around her can become heavy and static, but when she kicks up a storm and rides its conflicting currents, Duffus absolutely soars.

For almost a decade now, Obongjayar's chameleonic voice has offered words of self-love, survival, and seduction. When he steps an octave up from his resting pitch, the Nigerian-born, London-based singer embodies a vengeful ghost with unfinished business; an octave down, and he transforms into a ferocious dancehall MC. “This place is ugly,” Obongjayar sang on “God's Own Children,” a modern spiritual from 2020's Which Way Is Forward? EP. “Don't let it rob you/Of your face, of your grace, and of your body.”

“Born in This Body,” from his new album, Paradise Now, calls back to that sentiment: “You're covered in paint/Your clothes and your shoes don't fit/Don't make yourself small/For no one.” Except this body's got five more years of disillusionment caked under its nails, and the mood of the moment is far closer to the one Obongjayar captures on opening track “It's Time.” “I walk the world with my head on a swivel,” he quivers in his upper register, “It's hard trusting anything.” Paradise Now is twitchy and anxious, stuffed with ruminations on love, belonging, and violence. Obongjayar worked on the record with proven hitmakers behind Doja Cat and Kendrick Lamar, and as it races through alt-R&B, Afro-dance rhythms, indie rock, and brooding Americana, a globalized, omnivorous popstar emerges. He's instinctive but legible, algorithmically tuned without being dull, political right up to the line of provocation. Most importantly, he can make you move.

The first four songs on Paradise Now constitute their own mini-arc, tracing a relationship as it goes sour. Obongjayar delivers the scornful “Life Ahead” through gritted teeth, but an overwrought arrangement of martial drums, marimba, and gunshot samples can't match the precision aim of his jabs. More successful is “Peace in Your Heart,” which situates itself in an indie-pop niche between the xx's self-titled and Braids' Native Speaker. Things don't really get going, though, until the album has cleared its throat of trite breakup drama altogether. On “Jellyfish,” Obongjayar rails against “spineless” lawmakers in the UK and stateside (“Bomb bomb spawned by the stars and stripes”) alike. Though he writes in broad strokes—no “Fuck Badenoch”'s to be found here—the shuddering, corkscrewing synthesizer leaves his message unmistakable: Things are going down the drain. Fast. “Talk Olympics,” featuring Little Simz, ratchets up the tempo even further, making percussive instruments out of both artists in a slightly more hospitable take on Tanzanian singeli.

Obongjayar then breezes past some tender Afropop (“Prayer”) and glassy soul indebted to Blonde and Moses Sumney (“Moon Eyes”) before suddenly arriving at what sounds like the gates of hell itself. “Baby ride me like a cowboy/I'm your cowboy,” he croons on “Sweet Danger,” toying with the inherent machismo of the American West while the song's blistered blues threaten to clamp their jaws around him. “There's no saving me.” If salvation is out of reach, one may as well dance among the flames. The best song on Paradise Now is far and away “Not in Surrender,” a disco punk anthem that opens with the triumphant misdirect, “I put my hands up, not in surrender/I'm getting ready to fly.” Amidst white-hot DFA cowbells, Obongjayar grooves like Off the Wall-era MJ and seethes like TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, another musician whose best work blurs the boundaries between fucking up the system and just plain fucking.

With a frantic, deconstructed groove and fuzzed-out bass, “Instant Animal” could pass for an outtake from Return to Cookie Mountain and would make for an appropriately grand finale, if only there weren't four more tracks left to go. It's as if everything before “Jellyfish” and after “Instant Animal” is a padded cell for the wilder, more bracing album housed within. The staid, TikTok-ified disco of “Just My Luck” is most egregious, reeking of some label-meddling post Obongjayar's viral turn on Fred again..'s “adore u.” Paradise Now's knot of anger, faith, pain, and lust can't be tidily unwoven by committee. Obongjayar needs to stake it all on himself; “I'm no magician,” he claims on “Strong Bone,” as though he didn't just spend half an album tangled up and the other half breaking free.

	Christopher Cruz



	It's been eight years since the last time a Mario Kart game was released for a Nintendo console, but the wait is nearly over. And while 2017's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe may have missed the exact launch of the original Nintendo Switch, fans worldwide can rev their engine's right at the starting line this time around as Mario Kart World arrives day one for the upcoming Switch 2.


	Unlike the 2017 iteration (dubbed Deluxe), Mario Kart World (out June 5) isn't just an upgrade to a previous title, but an all-new entry in the beloved racing franchise built from the ground up for Nintendo's next generation console. With high-definition graphics, 24-player races, and sprawling environments to explore, Mario Kart World aims to leap the series forward into the modern era of gaming.


	But, in true Nintendo fashion, creating a sequel to a classic gaming staple doesn't just boil down to adding more. For the developers at Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development Division (Nintendo EPD, for short), overhauling a concept like Mario Kart requires a delicate tightrope walk of staying true to the spirit of the franchise while making good on new ideas — many of which are also old ones that were once cut due to the technical limitations of previous hardware.

	











Rolling Stone caught up with Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki to discuss the challenges of reinventing the series for a new generation of players, designing its interconnected world, and how balance becomes a key phrase in more ways than one.

	











	Since joining Nintendo in 2005, Yabuki has become a veteran at the company whose experience has spanned multiple console generations. He first worked as a planner on Mario Kart Wii (2008) before becoming the director of Mario Kart 7 (2011) and 8 (2014). Now serving as the producer of World, he brings a wealth of knowledge to the process.


	That knowledge means that Yabuki and his team knew very early on exactly what they wanted to do to differentiate the new game as more than just Mario Kart 9: make it an interconnected world and allow for 24 players rather than the standard 12.

					The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far		
	









	Both concepts have been at the top of his list for years but could never be implemented due to hardware restrictions of earlier consoles. “What actually ends up being in the product itself is only that small tip of the iceberg,” Yabuki tells Rolling Stone via translator. “But we think of the rest of the iceberg as a future treasure that we're storing for later use.”


	In Free Roam, players can drive around at their own pace getting to know the different geographical regions of the map, which are broken down into areas Mario fans will find familiar, from the grasslands and rolling hills of the Mushroom Kingdom to the fiery volcanic mountains around Bowser's Castle. Each of the games' few dozen courses (the exact number is a secret) are scattered around the map and can be driven through stop-by-stop and dissected outside the trials of a race before diving into a prix.


	The term interconnected is important to Yabuki, who doesn't view the game as being the same as other open-ended games like Breath of the Wild or Microsoft's racing sim Forza Horizon. “When it comes to Mario Kart World, we naturally didn't use the phrase ‘open world,' because, for me, sometimes that definition can be a little bit unclear, ambiguous, and we want it to stay very specific,” Yabuki says.


	“The beginning of this project really was thinking about that vast interconnected world, and how do we layer on top of that all of the experiences that you're accustomed to having in a Mario Kart game,” he says. “[There was] a lot that we had to think about in terms of changing away from what been, up to that point, traditional elements of the Mario Kart series.”

	Whereas traditional open world games might lack a distinct focus on any one distinct region or town, the creators of Mario Kart World view their environment more like a series of elaborate locales that branch out across its overworld map. That design choice demanded that the developers think methodically about every course's placement.

	











	“When you're creating a vast interconnected world where you can drive anywhere, there first thing that we had to think about was how to build in all of these racing routes all over that world like a network that overlays it,” Yabuki says. “In thinking of that network of all these connected routes, we had to consider them one by one and make sure that each one was pleasurable and interesting, and that it would offer a lot of value and fun for the player no matter which way they went.”


	In the Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes, players will travel to their next destination in between races, making each circuit feel less like a sequential series of levels and more like one larger gauntlet comprised of smaller legs. In Versus mode, users can select the tracks they want to play by choosing courses geographically adjacent to each other to chart a path around the overworld.


	But it's not just the game's world that's expanded in size, but the number of active racers too. Doubling the number of participants in each race doesn't just require making stages larger or widening the roads; it demands a total rethinking of how each of the game's systems work in harmony to keep the action from becoming overwhelming.


	“[In terms of balancing], we had to think not of this in terms of just the linear increase up to 24 players because, if we didn't adjust anything else, you'd be receiving too many attacks and it would be too stressful of a gameplay experience,” Yabuki says. “So, because of this kind of balance, we had to think about redesigning all elements from the ground up. When we think about a crash or a spin or a collision, for example, each of those is going to have a different amount of speed that the racer loses. And these have to be adjusted very carefully to make sure that it matches all of these new conditions of the game.”


	But as any player knows, the inherent stress of a Mario Kart match is also part of the core appeal. In practice, the 24-player races may not feel entire untenable, but there's definitely another layer of insanity. Whereas races once felt like candy-colored relays and juiced up soap box derbies, the increased scope and potential for unforeseen upsets is more potent than ever, feeling closer to the nail biting climax of a Mad Max movie. For the designers, the surprises remain essential to the spirit of the franchise.

	











	“We have to think about the chaos element, as well. Sometimes, a free-for-all is a really fun experience, too,” Yabuki says. “So, we need to make sure that's coming across as a fun element where it feels like anything could happen at any time.”


	The surprises don't just include the moment-to-moment action, but who is doing the action, too. While it initially launched with 42 playable characters, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe now has 50 racers to choose from including those added in downloadable expansions. Based on pre-release previews, Mario Kart World looks to be rivaling that base number (although, like the course count, the final tally remains unknown), on top of tons of different unlockable outfits that change the look of each racer.


	But among the pack, some noticeable favorites have already emerged. After the game's full reveal earlier this year, fans were instantly enamored by the inclusion of previous side characters like Pokey, Pianta, and Penguin (the last one most older fans fondly remember throwing off mountainsides in 1996's Super Mario 64). The most viral hit, however, was a nameless cow (simply called Cow) who previously served as an obstacle in Mario Kart levels like Moo Moo Meadows.


	Yabuki himself is amused by the fervor around the new character, although he hadn't expected the veracity of the fan response. “Yes, that was a very big reaction to the cow. We were certainly surprised,” he says. “The reaction really went beyond our imagination in terms of how happy people were and how excited.”


	It took some convincing, however, to get the character added to the roster. “I have to say that, in previous Mario Kart titles, we [had] to consider whether or not that character would be able to drive,” Yabuki says. “Perhaps my old way of thinking was, ‘Well, surely they would need to have hands and feet to be able to drive.' But I'll say that's come a long way for me, and maybe I've changed my thinking. So, now even characters like Goomba or Pokey, I think, ‘Okay, sure. They can drive.'”


	When it comes to evolving the gameplay of Mario Kart for a new era, the team has been careful not to change too much, while still adding new layers of depth to the base mechanics. Part of that comes from the lack of restrictions the new interconnected world provides, but it can also be felt in how the game controls in action. Yabuki and the developers were adamant that new systems be woven into the game's design, with the caveat that they're not mandatory for everyone to learn — especially newcomers.

	











	“Mario Kart, as a series, is one of those games where you do expect that the player will play the game quite a lot, so we have to think about all of the different kinds of play styles that players will bring to the game, and also their chance to learn as they see other people doing interesting things,” Yabuki says. “Some people might learn even from doing random actions themselves. They may have jumped at just the right moment to avoid a shell and suddenly, for the first time, realize that's a technique.”


	The new abilities in question mostly stem from a move called the Charge Jump. By holding the right shoulder button (normally used for drifting around curves) during a straight away, the player character will crouch into their karts and, upon release, can jump straight up into the air, or flip in whatever direction the joystick is held. This opens up a few options: players can flip into a rail grind or drive along walls — or, as teased by Nintendo staff at preview events, the move can be used to deflect items when mastered (think: blue shell).


	It's the mastery bit that's key. Although the game is intended to be readily accessible to anyone, the seasoned developer knows that it's going to become a major time sink for more dedicated fans. “I think there's a great opportunity for the way they view the world itself to change, Yabuki says. “They may see a guardrail as an obstacle in the beginning, but as they play more and they become more experienced and learn different moves, they will learn that they can use it to rail slide and all of the things that they can do using those obstacles in new ways.”


	As with most Nintendo games, the Mario Kart series offers an open-ended experience that often belies its difficulty. To gauge how best to create new challenges, Yabuki says that he looks to the franchise's past as a frame of reference rather than what else is being created in the gaming landscape (“I don't really look to other games for ideas”). For Mario Kart, specifically, that means pinpointing what the game's purest form is and making it easier from there for newcomers, rather than starting easy and ratcheting it up from there.

	“With the original Super Mario Kart, the idea of having 50cc, 100cc, 150cc [engines], for us, was sort having different difficulty levels,” Yabuki explains. “During development, the way that we developers approach the game is we try to think of 150cc as being the standard. We try to use 150cc to experience these newly designed courses first and make sure that they work at that engine size.”

	











	When asked whether he plans to implement a higher, 200cc difficulty like the one previously added to Mario Kart 8 post-launch, Yabuki stays mum. “Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes likes this,” he says coyly. “However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet.”

L
ast spring, Lily Seabird was walking through downtown Burlington, Vermont, around 1 a.m., singing to herself. Still a little buzzed from a night out, her phone long past dead, she sang the words out loud as they came to her: “We walk these streets we've come to know/Memories live on in them, after the snow…”


	“I got through the whole thing, and I got home and I wrote it down really quickly,” Seabird says.


	She wanted to make sure she held on to those newly written verses before they vanished, but the truth is, her songs are unforgettable. Each lyric hits with crystal clarity, locking you into her wavelength whether you're listening to her album Trash Mountain — named after the “hippie house” where she lives, overlooking the former site of a town dump — or attending one of her shows. It turns out many of the songs on the album started similarly, arriving like bolts from the blue and sending her racing to jot them down ASAP. “I have a good memory,” she adds with a smile.

	











	When she wrote that late-night meditation, which she dubbed “Trash Mountain (1am),” she'd just gotten home to Burlington after SXSW 2024, where she played bass in singer-songwriter Greg Freeman's band, as well as leading a band of her own. Freeman was one of the most-talked-about acts at the festival that year; 12 months later, in March 2025, it was Seabird's turn to floor audiences in Austin with some of the week's most rave-worthy performances.


	Released this spring as Seabird's third album, Trash Mountain is an exquisitely bittersweet alt-country song cycle about love, loss, and friendship. “I just turned 26, so I feel like I'm pretty young still,” she says when I meet her at a diner in Manhattan, en route to a show in Philadelphia. She sees the album's autumnal tone as reflecting her stage of life, as she and the friends she's made in Burlington over the last eight years — a wildly creative bunch that includes Freeman and the cool, arty indie/psych acts Robber Robber and Dari Bay, among others — enter the second half of their twenties.

	“When we started all playing in bands, it was purely for fun, just getting drunk and playing a house show,” she says. “And I still do it for fun, but there was a sadness that I started to feel. A sadness of growing up and things changing…. It's something I've maybe always wanted, but there's this nostalgia.”


	Growing up in rural Pennsylvania, Seabird taught herself guitar at age 11 and played in an all-girl punk band in her teens. After graduating high school in 2017, she moved to New York to study at the New School, bringing with her the same two guitars she plays now, an acoustic Seagull and a blue Telecaster.


	A self-described huge fan of Leonard Cohen, she was deeply affected by his death the previous year. As we talk, she takes off her denim jacket to reveal two arms full of tattoos, including her second-ever: a sketch of a woman's contemplative face on her left bicep, based on a line drawing called “Montreal Visitor #2” from Cohen's poetry volume Book of Longing, which she picked up from a free table in Tompkins Square Park her first year of college.


	Seabird found life in New York overwhelming — “I was working so many jobs and going to school and it was way too intense” — and when she heard that some friends were taking a road trip north in the spring, she tagged along, thinking she could see an exhibit on Cohen at a Montreal museum. “I grabbed my backpack: ‘Can I come?' It was very last-minute, and that one little decision changed my life.”

	After her pilgrimage to Quebec, she ran out of money for a bus ticket home, so she ended up crashing with a friend in Burlington. On her first night in town, she performed some of her songs at a University of Vermont open mic, where she met Freeman, another artist her age on the bill. “I think we were both just like, ‘Wow, who was that? Who is that songwriter who was so much better than everyone else?'” Freeman tells me.


	Drawn by the creative community she'd found in Burlington, Seabird soon transferred to UVM. She spent her summers working at an environmental nonprofit — she went door-to-door drumming up support for the state's 2020 single-use plastics ban (“Lily Seabird is partially responsible for banning the straw in Vermont!” she jokes) — and kept writing songs on the side, with Freeman as her biggest cheerleader. “Greg was the main encouraging person to me, as a young girl playing music,” says Seabird. “We'd go to shows and he'd be like, ‘Why aren't we making a band and playing your songs?'”


	The two old friends have continued to make music together since then; though they no longer play in each other's bands full-time, he added guitar to several songs on Trash Mountain, and she's listed in the credits of his upcoming album Burnover. “She's just really raw,” Freeman says. “When you're at a Lily show, you're totally experiencing her — there's not even a tiny bit of trying to be anything other than what she is.”


	That's just as true of Trash Mountain, a remarkably lucid document of Seabird's interior life. After gathering last summer at the southern Vermont studio of her friend Kevin Copeland with a few musicians she knows well — also including her partner, guitarist Rick Soszynski, and Robber Robber's Nina Cates and Zack James on bass and drums — she stripped away the stormy arrangements of her past releases to let her words speak for themselves. “It's softer than my other albums,” she says. “I was feeling really quiet and soft.”


	One of the most stunning songs on the new LP is “Arrow,” where she explores complex feelings of love and grief. Her words have a directness that Cohen would be proud of: “There exists this fine line, on either side of it pain and beauty…”

	











	Those words, she says, reflect the loss of a close friend to suicide three years ago. “My world was really rocked when my friend died,” she says. “There's now this fear of things going away, but also, that's just life. Things change. And that chorus is saying, ‘I wish that everything could just be the same forever.”


	The album opens with a spare, moving ballad called “Harmonoia”: “I wonder where you are, what puts a smile on your face/I wonder if you've changed or if you'd know me just the same.”


	She explains that she titled the song after a word she found in a book called The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows. “It's a feeling of feeling paranoid when things are too good, that they're going to end,” she says. “That transience and impermanence of everything.”

	Seabird is used to life as a touring musician (“I've been road-dogging for a while,” she says), and she's about to kick off another summer full of solo and full-band shows, starting June 6 in New York. Luckily, she's learned that she can handle inspiration wherever it finds her.


	“I'm the kind of writer where I'll just sing out into space, without a guitar,” she says. “I used to think that I could only write songs at home, but it turns out I am writing them everywhere.”

	Following his exit from the White House, ending his run as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk left the government with a haphazard mess of devastating budget cuts and backlash from his shareholders and the public.


	On Monday's The Daily Show episode, Jon Stewart quickly chronicled Musk's fall from “tech titan given a mandate to move fast and crush the deep state” to “guy who had a bad night in a Nashville bar he can't remember.”


	“DOGE has finally rooted out one of America's least efficient government workers,” declared Stewart, celebrating the finale of Musk's 130 days as a “special employee” in the White House last week. “He's leaving his job to make more family with his time,” joked the host, referencing Musk's obsession with having as many children as humanly possible.

	“Look at this poor bastard,” said Stewart, directing the audience to a photo of Musk jumping onstage during a campaign event for Donald Trump to a photo of the billionaire with a black eye during a press conference with the president. “He's looking beaten down. He's got that look on his face that I imagine his employees normally have — black eye, 1,000-yards stare. This dude has seen some shit,” said Stewart before cutting to a clip of Musk dubiously claiming his five-year-old son X punched him in the face.

	











	“Elon spent $300 million of his own money to get Trump elected, irreparably damaged his personal brand and almost all of his business, and is clearly suffering some kind of issue,” said Stewart, who then segued into a New York Times report that Musk allegedly took ketamine, Ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms during the 2024 campaign trail, and that reportedly he took so much ketamine he couldn't pee right. (Musk has vehemently denied the report.)Stewart mocked the SpaceX CEO rerouting a conversation to talk about “spaceships” instead of “presidential policy” during his exit interview on CBS News' Sunday Morning. Trump has “broken this poor man,” observed Stewart. “But let this be a lesson to Elon and anybody in Trump's orbit: Whatever your passionate political belief or whatever your ideology is, you will go from reaching for mine stars to dissolving in a puddle of your own urine and shame and starting a fight club with your kid just to be able to feel because Trump … Trump doesn't believe in anything, man.”

	As Elon Musk departs the Trump White House — at least officially — a new Senate report examines how the world's richest man leveraged his access to the levers of federal power to boost his myriad personal businesses, including his electric vehicle company Tesla, aerospace contractor SpaceX, social media platform X, and brain-chip firm Neuralink.


	Musk is leaving his post as a “special government employee” — a status that limited his stint in the executive branch to 130 days. As Donald Trump made clear in a press conference, where he gave Musk a “key” to the White House, the billionaire's influence will live on, as will his crusade against his own regulators.


	Issued by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the report is titled “Special Interests Over the Public Interest: Elon Musk's 130 Days in the Trump Administration” and features a list of 130 actions by Musk, his companies, and family members that “raise questions about corruption, ethics, and conflicts of interest.”Musk, of course, was Trump's biggest benefactor in the 2024 campaign, spending nearly $300 million to put Trump and Republican candidates into office. He then camped out at Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition and moved to Washington with the 47th president. At times appearing to be the nation's true chief executive, Musk commanded the forces of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and sent critical agencies like USAID (the U.S. Agency for International Development) through the “woodchipper,” likely condemning millions of vulnerable people across the globe to death by preventable diseases.

	











	The Warren report is focused on Musk's use of political power to boost his businesses, or secure special benefits — from regulatory relief to rich new contracts — that favor his fortunes and his family.

	











	The report clarifies that “Not every action listed … represents a violation of federal law,” but argues instead that “Musk has violated norms at an astonishing pace” while engaging in and supporting actions that are “hurting the American public.” It labels this “scandalous behavior regardless of whether it subjects him to criminal prosecution.”


	The Warren report divides its list into 15 categories, which Rolling Stone can exclusively preview below:

	The report highlights the time, when Tesla showrooms were increasingly beset by public protests, that Trump turned the White House lawn into a Tesla lot.


	The report highlights more than 20 instances of Musk or DOGE helping Musk's enterprises secure new contracts on an inside track on rich lines of business. For example, it highlights Rolling Stone's report about how staff at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were instructed to find “tens of millions” of dollars for a rich new Starlink contract, as well as a new $100 million NASA contract for SpaceX to launch an asteroid monitoring space telescope.


	When Trump took office, Musk companies faced federal penalties and enforcement actions totalling up to $2.4 billion, according to the report. Warren highlights CNBC reporting that the federal government has allowed nearly 40 cases against Musk companies to effectively go dormant, while others, including a Department of Justice case against SpaceX for alleged anti-immigrant discrimination in hiring, have been dropped.


	The report describes how Musk and the administration have targeted agencies with powers to regulate Musk businesses — including “gutting their staff, throwing sand in the gears of their operations, and embedding DOGE staff loyal to Musk.” A key example of this is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has authority to police Musk as he turns X into a payment platform. “Delete CFPB,” Musk has posted, and the administration has tried to bring the agency to its knees. (Read Rolling Stone's interview with Warren on this topic.)

	Musk operates in many highly regulated areas, from launching rockets to biomedical brain implants. The FAA has, under Trump, become a service agency for SpaceX, clearing the way for rocket launches despite frequent catastrophic failures. In Trump's auto tariff battles, the administration announced that cars with 85 percent domestic content were spared the levy — a category that reportedly only includes Teslas.


	Never before has a presidential megadonor had so much unfettered access to government data, insight, and decision-makers. The report highlights Musk's role as a dominant participant at Trump Cabinet meetings, despite having no Cabinet-level post, who was “privy to upcoming policy changes at the highest level of government,” many of which could boost his bottom line.

	











	Musk has been deeply enmeshed, through DOGE, in the HR decisions of the federal government — firing tens of thousands of employees while installing loyalists throughout the bureaucracy. Many of these lackeys now have permanent government gigs, and will be able to carry out Musk-aligned policy without his active direction, including the head of the Federal Communications Commission, which has oversight of radio spectrum needed by Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet business.


	The report links Musk to the Trump administration's sudden, curious interest in the cause of white Afrikaaners from South Africa, who have been granted refugee status amid Musk's trumped-up allegations that they face a “genocide” — even as other truly vulnerable people from around the world are being denied admission to the United States.


	The report highlights a Wall Street Journal investigation into perceived threats from X execs who intimated that a planned merger between ad conglomerates might face trouble if ad clients didn't ramp up their spending on the social media platform.


	The report links Musk to the Trump Federal Trade Commission's “seemingly baseless” investigation into whether Media Matters colluded with advertisers. X sued the watchdog in late 2023, after Media Matters reported that ads on the platform were being served up against “pro-Nazi” content, leading large brands to suspend campaigns on the platform.


	The report links Musk's White House influence to favorable provisions of the House budget bill, including funding for the “Golden Dome,” a space-based missile defense program that seems ready-made for Starlink. 


	Warren's report highlights dozens of deals that Musk companies have inked with countries that are under tariff threat from the administration, as well as Musk accompanying Trump's tour of Persian Gulf countries, where the DOGE chief announced deals of his own — including that Neuralink had inked a deal to begin clinical trials in the United Arab Emirates.


	The report highlights how Musk's power is translating to deals for family members, including his brother recently inking a deal with Persian Gulf states to mount drone light shows, while his dad is reportedly in talks to build a Musk Tower in Dubai.

	











	Musk's fruitless effort to finance a conservative takeover of the Wisconsin state Supreme Court is highlighted in the report, as is his call for judges who oppose Trump to be impeached.

	Despite his pledge of “maximum transparency” by DOGE, Musk himself has hidden his norms-busting activities behind a veil of secrecy, the report concludes, failing to make public his vast financial holdings, or what if any waivers of federal ethics requirements he may have received.

Neil Young is a little over two weeks away from the launch of his Love Earth world tour. And in a new post on the Neil Young Archives, he's inviting longtime fan Donald Trump to come and check it out.


	“When I tour the USA this summer, if there is not martial law by then which would make it impossible, let's all come together and stand for American values,” he wrote. “We will not be doing a political show. We will be playing the music we love for all of us to enjoy together. President Trump, you are invited. Come and hear our music just as you did for decades.”


	He's alluding to the fact that Trump is a longtime fan of his work. Rolling Stone even rang up Trump in 2008 to discuss his fandom after noticing him at several New York shows, including the front row of a CSNY concert at the Theater at MSG where he was seated next to Patti Smith and Salman Rushdie.


	“He's got something very special,” Trump said. “He's performed for me at my casinos over the years, and he just brings it down. I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	He couldn't, however, name any of his songs when pressed. “It's sort of all favorite,” he says. “I like the older stuff better, which is typical with a lot of artists — hence the famous Ricky Nelson song ‘Garden Party.' I like all his songs, you know, ‘Rock and Roll' — just great stuff.”


	Trump and Young met up at Trump Tower a little over ten years ago when the singer was looking for investors for his Pono music service. But their relationship soured once Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency, and began blasting “Rockin' In The Free World” at his events.

	











	“You are a disgrace to my country,” Young wrote in a long, scathing letter to Trump on his website. “Your mindless destruction of our shared natural resources, our environment, and our relationships with friends around the world is unforgivable.… Our first black president was a better man than you are…Every time ‘Rockin' in the Free World' or one of my songs is played at your rallies, I hope you hear my voice. Remember it is the voice of a tax-paying U.S. citizen who does not support you. Me.”

	Last month, Young reacted to Trump's vicious campaign against Bruce Springsteen. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America,” he wrote. “You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That's your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce. You know how I feel.”


	In this new post, where Young invites Trump to his shows, he strikes a somewhat softer tone. “Bruce Springsteen and many others will be in our country this summer, there for you,” he writes, “playing our favorite music, songs like ‘Born in the USA.' We are proud of who we are, and must never let our government forget it.”

Parks and Recreation ended more than a decade ago, but its seven seasons left behind countless meme formats to be recycled in perpetuity. Still, members of the cast are protective of how their most memorable scenes are repurposed online. Nick Offerman recently came to the defense of his stoic character Ron Swanson after Michael Flynn Jr., son of Donald Trump's former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, shared a homophobic post on X using a Parks and Recreation meme.


	“Just wanted to post how I feel about ‘pride' month,” Flynn captioned a GIF that edited a Pride flag over the computer Swanson tossed into a dumpster in the Season Four episode “The Trial of Leslie Knope.” He replied to his own post doubling down on his rage bait, writing: “I love how triggered the ABC Mafia crowd is by this meme.”

Ron was best man at a gay wedding you dumb fuck. #HappyPride https://t.co/mSlELkUvDY


	Offerman took the post as an opportunity to set the record straight about Swanson, who would have never agreed with Flynn using him to boost homophobia. “Ron was best man at a gay wedding you dumb fuck,” the actor wrote in response. After making the reference to “One Last Ride,” Parks and Recreation's series finale where Ron joins his hairdresser's wedding, he added: “#Happy Pride.”

	











	Offerman recently portrayed a queer character in The Last of Us. His character Bill shaped a romance plot line with Murray Bartlett's Frank. “Thanks to HBO for having the guts to participate in this storytelling tradition that is truly independent,” Offerman said at the 2024 Independent Spirit Awards. “Stories with guts that when homophobic hate comes my way and says, ‘Why did you have to make it a gay story?' We say, ‘Because you ask questions like that. It's not a gay story, it's a love story, you asshole!'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","New UFO Video Sets Internet On Fire, But What Does It Actually Show?","https://www.outkick.com/culture/ufo-mexico-video-speculation","Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:41:55 GMT","

The internet has more UFO footage to analyze.

As OutKick readers know, there are few topics on the internet that fire people up as much as footage of unknown objects in the sky.

As I often say, the reason why is that we have limited to no information about what's going on, and it seems like the government has no interest in sharing what it knows.

The more information that's concealed, the more it invites conspiracy theories. That's just basic human nature. Now, we have a new video taking the internet by storm.

The YouTube account @paulodeleon.ufologo posted a three-minute video showing several different angles of an object flying through the sky.

The footage was filmed around the southern Valley of Guatemala City, according to BroBible.

You can watch the footage below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

It's important to keep an open-mind in life. Generally speaking, I'd like to think that's the best way to approach things.

However, we can't just accept everything as fact. That'd be foolish, and it waters down concrete evidence. While I'm certainly no expert, this damn sure doesn't look crazy to me.

It looks like it could be a drone or maybe even a small plane. I definitely am not buying that it is a ""potential mothership,"" as described in the video's title.

Not buying all that, but I could also be wrong. I'm certainly not going to sit here with the OutKick audience and declare myself the smartest person out there.

Australia has been receiving high-level briefings from the United States' UFO task force for years, despite the repeated denials of the top military brass, newly revealed emails show.

Login or signup to continue reading

Freedom of information documents from December 2021 show US officials discussing a briefing regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) - the modern term for UFOs - with its Five Eyes allies.

The email chain included officials from the United States UAP Task Force (UAPTF) and an Australian defence representative, using a US Department of Defence email address.

""Re tomorrow's UAP briefing, I received confirmation from Australia and Canada they will be here ... and of course UK,"" a UAPTF official wrote. 

However, a scheduling conflict led to the meeting being rescheduled for early January, 2022, much to the annoyance of the Office Under the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security (OUSD).

""I recall you and your team said last week that you wanted to come in today to brief the other partners. Because of this I urged the partners to build time into their schedules and come in for the brief,"" the OUSD official wrote.

""The last thing we want to do is be dismissive of our allies and their time,"" a UAPTF official replied.

""We definitely would like to continue this conversation with the partners, and now have an obligation to do so for multiple reasons.""

The former Chief of Air Force - and now Vice Chief of Defence - Air Marshal Robert Chipman twice told senators during an estimates hearing that Australia had not been briefed on UAPs after the email exchange and rescheduled Five Eyes briefing. 

In November 2022, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked if the US had discussed UAPs with Australian intelligence services or the Air Force.

""I'm not aware of any formal discussions that we've held with the US,"" Air Marshal Chipman said.

""I imagine it would have come across my desk if those discussions were held in the last four months.""

During the Senate estimates hearing the following year, the Air Marshal was more adamant in response to Senator Whish-Wilson's questions, which specifically queried if Australian defence attaches had received UAPTF briefings.

""No,"" Air Marshal Chipman said.

""No briefings at all,"" Senator Whish-Wilson said.

""No,"" Air Marshal Chipman repeated.

Briefing notes prepared in May 2022 for Air Marshall Chipman's Senate estimate hearing also state that neither ""the US nor any other nation or ally"" had requested or offered to collaborate on the issue of UAPs.

""Defence has no desire to seek collaboration on this issue,"" the briefing note states.

The Department of Defence refused to answer questions from The Canberra Times.

Grant Lavac, an Australian civilian UAP researcher, said the lack of transparency was ""quite concerning"".

""The Chief of Air Force leads all discussions on UAP in Australia, so if there's one person that needs to know what is happening on this topic in an Australian context and our discussions with allies, it's him,"" Mr Lavac said.

""He's either uniformed because there is a complete lack of intelligence sharing, or there's a degree of incompetence, or it's something more sinister like plausible deniability.

""Any one of those three scenarios is concerning.""

It's not the first time the Australian Defence Force has misled Senators about the nation's UAP activities.

In 2024, Defence officials admitted Australia sent representatives to a UAP briefing in the Pentagon, after vigorously denying any involvement.

The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by members of the Five Eyes alliance, was later released by the US government.

It shows the alliance - which includes US, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand - met for a ""caucus working group"" to ""cultivate shared awareness of allies' UAP issues, detection, and mitigation activities and challenges"".

They discussed the need for ""networks to share Five Eyes UAP reporting"", including documents marked ""top secret"" and ""special intelligence"", along with UAP ""collection planning"".

""The intention is to develop a framework for future UAP collaboration,"" one document said.

Australia's UAP policy has previously been criticised for being out of step with its closest military allies, including the US, which introduced mandatory UAP reporting for defence personnel in 2021.

The US considers UAPs a potential flight safety and national security risk, while other allies have acknowledged the unknown aerial phenomenon, including the UK, Canada, France and Spain.

The Canberra Times has previously reported Australian Defence personnel don't feel comfortable reporting UAP sightings through official channels and freedom of information documents revealed senior Defence officials mocked the subject while preparing briefing notes.

The Australian Defence Force stopped collecting reports of UAPs in 1996, ""after determining there was no scientific or other compelling reason to continue to devote resources to the recording and investigation of UAP"".

The paranormal ranch continues to draw scientists and experts keen to explain numerous UFO sightings and paranormal activity


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In season 6 of ""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch"" the team claims to have found a huge invisible phenomenon within 'The Triangle' that may shed light on supposed UFO sightings and strange animal behavior. So what is ""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch""? You'll have to keep watching to find out.

""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch"" season 6 airs on the History Channel in the U.S. and Canada every Thursday — and viewers abroad can watch it from anywhere with a VPN.

► Date and time: ""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch"" season 6 will premiere on the History Channel in the U.S. on Tuesday, June 3 at 8 p.m. ET/ PT. • U.S. — History Channel (via Sling, Philo or Hulu)• Canada — History Channel• Watch anywhere — try NordVPN 100% risk-free

As ever, excited middle aged men make dramatic sounding declarations around ""anomalous data"" originating from the astonishing amount of kit such as ground-penetrating radar and drones they have deployed at the 512 acre ranch in an effort to discover the truth about events there - and around there.

Events such as strange cattle mutilations, UFO sightings in ""UFO Alley"" and other paranormal events. Up to this point they have focused on an area of high activity they call ""The Triangle"" where equipment has inexplicably malfunctioned, possibly, some researchers have argued, as it may be a location where 'interdimensional portals' exist. 

Read on for how to watch ""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch"" season 6 online and from anywhere in the world. 



""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch"" season 6 will premiere on the History Channel in the U.S. on Tuesday, June 3 at 8 p.m. ET/ PT. Stream the next day.

Hulu offers a huge library of classic and current TV shows and movies, as well as acclaimed originals and movie exclusives. Plus, it's got the entire FX catalog. Subscriptions starts at just $9.99 per month.

Just because the History Channel isn't available everywhere doesn't mean you can't watch ""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch"" season 6 if you're away from home. Watching along with the rest of the internet can be pretty easy. With the right VPN (virtual private network), you can stream the show from wherever you go. 

Not sure which VPN is right for you? We've tested many different services and our pick for the best VPN overall is NordVPN. It offers superb speeds and excellent customer service.

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence offers tons of strategy in an excellently designed euro game about finding alien life – and it's getting a new expansion!

Whether you imagine aliens to be benevolent givers of distant technology, horrible monsters from beyond the stars, or just some single-celled bacterium, there's no argument that finding alien life would be a major discovery. But until that happens, we can imagine what it would be like to be part of SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a competitive strategy game with resource management and some tableau building. The goal of each player is to earn the most victory points by the end of the 5th round. Victory points are scored in a vast variety of ways. However, players will be mostly wanting to find traces of life on various planets in order to discover new alien life and learn more about them to score big.

On each players turn, they will perform various actions like launching probes to scout out nearby planets, dropping landers on those planets to do some deeper analysis, scanning deep space around Earth, discovering new technologies, analyze data, and more.

Depending on the technologies each player unlocks, they will have a different edge over their competition for each different action. For example, one technology makes landing a rover cheaper, while another offers a wider range while scanning deep space.

As players are racing to launch probes, drop rovers, and also land on the multitude of moons, they might score points based on who got there first, who did the most research, and so on. But one the alien life is found, the game really begins!

There are several different alien species to be discovered, and players won't know which they've found until it's discovered. At that point, the aliens special setup and rules are revealed. The alien species will offer new cards for players to collect into their hand as well as new ways to earn points and resources.

The game ends at the end of the 5th round. At which point the player with the most points wins!

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a game that offers a ton of strategic depth. Plus there are lot of different tactics to reach victory. There are many different mechanics and systems that seamlessly work together in order to offer a great gaming experience. It's on the heavier side of complexity. But if that's not an issue for you gaming group, you might love SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

You'll be able to expand your search for alien life later this year. SETI: Space Agencies adds asymmetric organizations that will change how you scan the stars. These private tech companies and global research networks have unique abilities, strategic advantages, and starting conditions. 

The expansion introduces new alien species with their own unique traits, as well as more than 40 project cards that provide variety and strategic options. It also adds a new mechanic, Signal Tokens, that enhances scanning efficiency.

SETI: Space Agencies arrives in Q4 this year.

🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.

At least eight states have introduced legislation about so-called ""chemtrails""—a conspiracy about chemicals being released into the atmosphere by aircrafts.

Newsweek has created a map showing the states that are considering legislations surrounding this unsubstantiated phenomenon.

Chemtrail conspiracy theorists claim that the government or other groups are using aircrafts to release chemicals or metals into the atmosphere, visible in the white lines that aircrafts leave behind in the sky. People have claimed these are used for a range of things from weather modification to mind control.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the white lines observed behind aircraft are contrails—condensation trails—that form when hot exhaust from jets meets cold air at high altitudes. The EPA states these are a natural result of flight and pose no risk to weather patterns. Some flights do not produce them as they require specific humidity and temperature conditions.

Federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have publicly denied undertaking or planning any weather modification experiments such as those described by chemtrail conspiracy theorists.

At least eight states have introduced bills regarding chemtrails.

In Louisiana, Republican state Representative Kimberly Landry Coates defended a bill to ban chemtrails, which last week passed the state House of Representatives 58-32.

The measure also directs the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to record reported chemtrail sightings and pass complaints on to the Louisiana Air National Guard.

In Florida, GOP state Senator Ileana Garcia introduced legislation in December 2024 to prohibit weather modification activities in the state. In May 2025, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said he would sign the law.

In April 2024, Tennessee lawmakers passed a bill banning the release of chemicals into the air, however, the bill did not explicitly mention chemtrails.

There are other bills under consideration in Kentucky, where a bill seeks to ban ""any form of geoengineering activities"" including polluting the atmosphere and Minnesota where a House bill introduced in March aims to ban weather-modifying substances.

In Rhode Island, a Senate bill would ban certain weather engineering activities and in New Hampshire a bill proposes banning the release of polluting emissions.

In South Dakota, a Senate bill also would ban polluting emissions and in Texas, state Representative Wesley Virdell introduced an anti-chemtrail bill.

Mark Shanahan who teaches American politics at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom told Newsweek that the legislation on chemtrails showed a ""disconnect from reality.""

""The norm in mature democracies is that voters elect skilled representatives who act in our best interest, and thus for very many decades potential legislators have striven to prove their intellect, their balance and their ability to weigh evidence,"" he said.

""But that changed with Trump's election to a situation where politics is much more about celebrity than credibility and cranks from the margins of political ideas are now lauded front and centre. Whether it's RFK [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] at Health, or [Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene] MTG in the House, wild and wacky ideas, with no basis in truth, are being raised and argued as if they were true - often with little or no media push-back.

GOP Louisiana state Representative Kimberly Landry Coates: ""This bill is to prevent any chemicals above us in the air, specifically to modify the weather.""

Florida state Senator Ileana Garcia previously told Newsweek: ""The bill essentially repeals outdated provisions related to various aspects of the weather modification law, including definitions, licensing requirements, and the processes surrounding the application and issuance of licenses.""

Robert F Kennedy Jr. on X in August about chemtrails: ""We are going to stop this crime.""

Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hosted chemtrail activist Dane Wigington on his podcast in March 2023. The episode was titled ""Are Chemtrails Real?""

In the episode, Kennedy Jr. said he began to consider the issue of chemtrails when he and actor Woody Harrelson saw contrails from a plane transform into clouds. He asked Wiginton questions about the theory, asking him, ""What proof do we have that chemtrails are happening?"" and ""How come we don't see more whistleblowers coming out?""

Kennedy Jr. also speculated as to whether chemtrails are causing ""accumulations of aluminum, even in places in very, very remote parts of the earth.""

Wigington said planes are spraying aluminum into the environment, adding: ""What we're seeing in our skies are not condensation trails. In almost all cases they are sprayed particulate trails.""

Kennedy Jr. said it was ""kind of frightening to think that somebody may be putting large amounts of bioavailable aluminum into the environment, spraying it in microscopic particulates from airplanes.""

Scientists surveyed in a 2016 study by Carnegie Science, University of California Irvine rejected the claim that excess environmental aluminum was the result of spraying. Most rejected that aluminum concentrations have increased at all.

Of the experts who thought that aluminum concentrations might have increased, the increase was primarily attributed to changes in industrial, agricultural, or natural processes.

After Hurricane Helene swept across the Southeastern U.S., killing at least 227 people, last year, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""Yes they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done."" The congresswoman didn't specify who ""they"" were.

She then posted an image of Helene overlaid on an electoral map, suggesting that the hurricane's path had been intentionally set in motion to target Republican-leaning counties. The map appeared to have been created by Matt Wallace, a crypto influencer and conspiracy theorist with over 2 million followers on X.

Greene's posts quickly went viral, with one receiving a user-generated community note on X that clarified existing ""weather control"" technology is limited to small-scale cloud seeding and cannot generate large storms or hurricanes.

Whether or not other states try to pass similar legislation remains to be seen as legislative sessions continue.

GOP Sen. Michael Fesi, of Houma, who apparently believes in chemtrail conspiracy theories

The Louisiana Legislature has passed a new bill to outlaw “chemtrails,” a made-up and very fake thing that conspiracy theorists and other assorted fringe people believe in.

Because of course.

After the House May 28 killed a bill to ban fluoride in drinking water, there was the slightest sliver of hope that lawmakers wouldn't agree to other conspiracy measures. That hope was apparently as short-lived as it was small.

Following House passage of Senate Bill 46 — which was authored by Houma Republican state Sen. Michael ""Big Mike"" Fesi — on June 1, Senate President Cameron Henry, a Metairie Republican, formally “enrolled” the bill, meaning it will become law — unless Gov. Jeff Landry vetoes it.

Unlike many of the other fake conspiracy theories that now make up much of the GOP's policy agenda, the chemtrail conspiracy theory seems to be relatively new. For instance, a Telegraph article from 2017 traces the scientifically debunked theory to the 1990s after the Air Force published a paper about theoretical efforts to control or influence the weather.

The theory goes something like this: All those white streaks you see in the sky caused by plane exhaust are not plane exhaust that has gotten more common over the years as more and more freight and commercial travel happens in the sky. Rather, this clearly unhinged theory claims that those streaks are actually dangerous chemicals that ""they"" are pumping into the sky for ... reasons.

Who are ""they?"" That's a great question. Like fingerprints, no two chemtrail conspiracists agree on all the details. That said, they typically choose from one of the ""thems"" commonly blamed for such made up things, including but not limited to:

The Government;

The Military;

The Corporations;

The Jews;

The Communists; and of course

The Aliens.

But even if there's no one ""them"" to blame, surely there's a reason, right? Again, that's up for debate. The point of spraying these unidentified-but-they're-real-man-do-your-research chemicals varies depending on a variety of factors, including political affiliation, how long the person has been using YouTube, their familiarity with legendary crank Art Bell, how many Burning Mans they've attended and of course, drug use. Here's just some of the many possible answers you might get:

Fesi and other Louisiana Republicans appear to have put their chips on “weather control,” based on the plain language of the bill. Who Fesi thinks is behind this preposterous fake plot is unclear.

There is one interesting difference between the other anti-science theories like anti-vaccine propaganda or the weird anti-fluoride movement that have become Republican policy. Those conspiracies have deep roots in conservative fringe elements that believed they were Communist plots to, as the 1964 classic Dr. Strangelove put it, steal or otherwise contaminate our “precious bodily fluids.” Chemtrails, however, were until recently largely the domain of drug addled, left-leaning hippie conspiracy theorists.

While the law may seem silly — because on one level, it clearly is — it could have significant implications. Conspiracy theorists could use the bill to challenge flight routes, the construction and location of airports, or file costly suits against airlines and air freight companies. Those, in turn, could increase costs and disruptions to companies and consumers.

There is no evidence that plane exhaust is part of part of some vast, coordinated plot, in large part because no such plot exists. Similarly, there is no evidence that the government is attempting to control the weather. Meteorology remains one of the least understood and inexact scientific disciplines.

And then there's the logistics of such a conspiracy. In order to undertake such a conspiracy, literally tens of thousands of people across the globe would have to be in on it, including people manufacturing the fictional weather control chemicals and dispersing equipment, the baggage handlers standing there while the fake technicians are loading it into planes, pilots, plane mechanics, air traffic controllers, and political leaders of countries that don't like each other. That's not even considering the untold thousands of red-tape loving, approval stamp wielding bureaucrats needed to undertake such a feat.

There is, however, clear, scientifically demonstrated evidence that burning fossil fuels like jet fuel is bad for the environment and human health. However, Fesi and other Republicans have not proposed banning them.

Because of course.

In this article

Airbus and Boeing have been competing head to head for decades as the world's largest commercial airplane makers, but Airbus has pulled ahead by several measures. 

Over the past few years, Airbus has beat Boeing when it comes to net profits, aircraft orders, deliveries and backlog.

Experts say Airbus' A321neo narrow-body aircraft is propelling the company ahead of Boeing, which has been dealing with crisis after crisis over the past several years.

Europe's Airbus entered the market more than half a century after its rival, but it's made strides since its inception. Today, Airbus and Boeing planes make up more than three-quarters of the world's commercial aircraft.

The Boeing 737 family and Airbus A320 family are the companies' best-selling aircraft and have been a crucial segment of competition.

Watch the video to learn how Airbus came to be the biggest commercial plane manufacturer and whether it can stay on top.

Program halted suddenly, leaving legal immigrants unable to work due to lack of US social security number

Millions of legal immigrants may be left unable to work after the US Social Security Administration quietly instituted a rule change to stop automatically issuing them social security numbers.

The Enumeration Beyond Entry program is an agreement between the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, where US Citizenship and Immigration Services would provide social security with information from applicants for work authorization or naturalization.

The program began in 2017 under the first Trump administration.

Without any public notice, on 19 March, the program was halted, affecting millions of immigrants every year and burdening Social Security Administration offices, as those applicants will now have to visit a Social Security Administration office and apply separately to receive a social security number.

Following the freeze, the Trump administration issued a memo on 15 April aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from receiving social security benefits, but provided no evidence of it being a problem.

Trump and Elon Musk, billionaire former leader of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have falsely claimed these programs are being used to attract unauthorized immigrants to vote for Democrats.

“Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicare or social security retirement benefits. Nor does any evidence exist that unauthorized immigrants fraudulently receive benefits in large numbers,” wrote Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, an economics professor at Boston College, in a blogpost.

Lee Thacker moved to south-west Minnesota last summer with his now wife, a native of the US. After getting married, he applied for a work authorization card while his permanent residency application was being processed.

When the 52-year-old from Pontypridd in Wales received his work authorization card at the end of April 2025, he began applying for jobs and received a job offer. After he failed to receive his social security number, “I lost the job,” said Thacker.

“I needed a background check and the company doing the check required a social security number, and the company itself has a policy of not employing people without social security numbers. So I am legally entitled to work, but in practice I can't because no one will employ me without a social security number.”

He noted the work authorization form, I-765, still has a checkbox on it to fill out to receive a social security number card, which he did. He paid $260 for the employment authorization card application and was expecting to receive a social security number within two weeks of receiving his work authorization card.

Thacker was not informed why until he visited a Social Security Administration field office about half an hour away, where he was informed about the change.

In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid $25.7bn in taxes to social security, despite not being eligible to receive the benefits.

“It's definitely affected a lot of individuals. We've tried to warn all of our clients,” said Jennifer Bade, an immigration lawyer based in Boston, Massachusetts.

Bade explained the issues and difficulties immigrants face in visiting a Social Security Administration field office, including having to take time off work, language barriers, and issues and delays for immigrants who need a social security number to start a job, open a bank account, or receive a loan.

“The pausing of this program makes no sense,” added Bade. “It's all just meant to attack immigrants, and it has no actual benefits. Pausing this program literally has no benefits.”

Democrats on the House committee on oversight and government reform urged the Social Security Administration to reverse its decision to freeze the program.

According to the then ranking member of the committee, the late congressman Gerald Connolly, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration personally approved the pause despite legal concerns and warnings over the effects of pausing the program.

Hope Rudasill of North Carolina said her husband, whose name is being kept anonymous for fear of retaliation, recently filed for a work authorization card, but did not expect the delay in receiving a social security number, as he was told it would be issued automatically when he filed his application.

“My husband hasn't been able to start his job search because most employers require a valid social security number before even considering applications. It's also prevented him from applying for a driver's license which limits his ability to get around independently,” Rudasill told the Guardian.

“We haven't been able to open a joint bank account, which is not only inconvenient for managing finances, but also creates challenges when we go to our adjustment of status interview [an essential part of applying for lawful permanent residency] as a shared bank account is a key piece of evidence to prove we're building a life together and not having that documentation makes the process more stressful.”

The rule change came as billionaire Musk pushed misinformation about immigrants and social security benefits, including touting data from the Enumeration Beyond Entry program, falsely claiming it was evidence of fraud.

In fiscal year 2024, 3.24m initial employment authorization documents were approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The costs of issuing a social security number through this program in the same year, according to a Social Security Administration memo, was $8 per issuance, compared with $55.80 in a field office.

Those field offices are also operating with reduced staff, as the Social Security Administration sought to cut staff by at least 12%, and Doge has terminated leases for at least 47 offices at the agency. The freeze is likely to add even more pressure to staff at the agency, in addition to new phone restrictions implemented by the Trump administration, which will require individuals to make 1.93m additional trips to social security field offices annually.

“I was hoping I would be able to work within a few months of applying for permanent residency, once I got the employment authorization card,” Lee Thacker added. “If I had known social security cards were no longer being sent out automatically, I would have made an in-person visit shortly after getting my employment authorization card. There must be many people waiting patiently expecting to receive their social security cards. If this is a permanent change local SSA offices will be receiving more in-person visits at a time when staffing numbers are being reduced.”

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Social Security Administration said in an email: “The Enumeration Beyond Entry (EBE) process is currently paused for noncitizens granted work authorization (I-765) and newly naturalized US citizens (N-400) for 90 days, while the agency is evaluating its enumeration policies and procedures. SSA will continue to process EBE applications for those granted legal permanent resident status (I-485) along with all EBE applications that were filed prior to March 18, 2025.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Erin Patterson is accused of serving her ex-husband's family poisonous mushrooms.James Ross/The Associated Press

An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives with poisonous mushrooms told a court on Tuesday she accepted that the fatal lunch she served contained death caps.

But Erin Patterson said the “vast majority” of the fungi came from local stores. She denies three counts of murder and one of attempted murder over the beef Wellington meal she served to her parents-in-law and her estranged husband's aunt and uncle at her home in July 2023.

Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson were hospitalized and died after the lunch in the rural town of Leongatha in the Australian state of Victoria. Heather's husband, Ian Wilkinson, was gravely ill but survived.

Patterson's lawyer earlier told the Supreme Court trial that the poisoning was a tragic accident but prosecutors said it was deliberate. If convicted, she faces a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder charges and 25 years in jail for attempted murder.

Long queues formed outside the Latrobe Valley Courthouse on Tuesday after Patterson took the stand late Monday, which was the first time she had spoken publicly since the deaths.

Mushroom madness grips small Australian town as murder trial brings media storm

During several hours of evidence on Tuesday, Patterson, 50, told the court she began foraging fungi during the COVID-19 lockdown of March 2020, witnessed only by her children.

“I cut a bit of one of the mushrooms, fried it up with some butter and ate it,” she said. “They tasted good and I didn't get sick.”

Patterson said she also fed foraged mushrooms to her children, chopped up “very, very small” so they couldn't pick them out of curries, pasta and soups.

She developed a taste for exotic varieties, joined a “mushroom lovers” Facebook group, and bought a dehydrator to preserve her finds, Patterson said. Her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, asked if she accepted that the beef Wellington pastries she had served to her lunch guests in 2023 contained death caps.

“Yes, I do,” said Patterson.

The accused told her lawyer most of the mushrooms she used that day came from local supermarkets. She agreed she might have put them in the same container as dehydrated wild mushrooms she had foraged weeks earlier and others from an Asian food store.

Mandy in April told the court his client had lied when she initially told investigators that she had never foraged before. But he denied that she had deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms and said she disposed of her dehydrator in a panic about the accidental deaths.

Alleged Australian mushroom murderer faked cancer diagnosis to lure victims, prosecutors claim

Earlier Tuesday, Patterson became tearful when she was asked about expletive-filled messages she had sent about her in-laws in December 2022 in a Facebook group chat that she described as a “safe venting space” for a group of women.

“I wish I'd never said it. I feel very ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn't have to hear that I said it,” said Patterson. “They didn't deserve it.”

Patterson, who said she had tried to have her parents-in-law mediate a dispute with her estranged husband, Simon, about school fees, said she was feeling hurt, frustrated and “a little bit desperate.”

The couple formally separated in 2015 after earlier temporary splits, the court has heard. Simon Patterson was invited to the July 2023 lunch but did not attend.

Tuesday's evidence also traversed Patterson's health after prosecutors' suggestions that her lunch invitation was unusual and that she'd organized it on a false pretense of receiving a cancer diagnosis. The mother of two admitted she never had cancer, but had been worried enough by symptoms to seek tests.

Despite her separation from Simon, Patterson said she had hoped to reunite with her estranged husband and said she had remained close to her in-laws.

“It never changed. I was just their daughter in law,” said Patterson, through tears. “They just continued to love me.”

The 14-member jury has heard five weeks of prosecution evidence, including what the lunch guests told relatives before they died. Heather Wilkinson said shortly before she died that Patterson ate her individual beef wellington pastry from a different colored plate to the other diners, said prosecutor Nanette Rogers.

Opening her case in April, Rogers said the poisoning was deliberate but that her case would not suggest a motive for the alleged killings. The prosecution says Patterson lied when she told investigators she had eaten the same meal as her guests and fed her children the leftovers.

Patterson is due to continue giving evidence on Wednesday. Her evidence Tuesday did not include her account of the day of the lunch, or cross-examination from prosecutors.

A Berlin court has said that Germany must adhere to the EU's Dublin procedure when turning back asylum seekers at the border. The ruling challenges a new migration policy, and the government says pushbacks will continue.

The Berlin Administrative Court on Monday ruled that the rejection of asylum seekers at border controls is unlawful unless carried out under the EU's Dublin procedure.

The urgent decision is a blow to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has pledged to crack down on migration. Shortly after taking office last month, Chancellor Merz's government advised police that they could turn back irregular migrants at the border, even if they applied for asylum. 

The ruling came in the case of three Somali nationals who were turned back to Poland on May 9 under the new German regulation.

The court said such rejections bypass the necessary legal steps and violate asylum rights.

""Persons who express the wish to seek asylum while at a border check on German territory may not be sent back"" before it is known which country is responsible for processing the claim under the EU's so-called ""Dublin"" system, the court said. 

The three Somalis — two men and a woman — had arrived in Germany by train from Poland on May 9.

The Federal Police stopped them at the railway station in Frankfurt an der Oder, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.

The three said they wanted to apply for asylum in Germany. However, they were returned to Poland the same day. The police justified this by arguing that they had entered from a safe third country.

However, the court also ruled that ""the petitioners cannot demand to be allowed into"" Germany, adding that the Dublin asylum procedures ""can be carried out at or close to the border.""

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who is responsible for implementing the migration policy, said Monday evening that the ruling only applied to the case in question, and that the government would stick to its migration policy.

Shortly after taking office last month, Chancellor Merz's government advised police that they could turn back irregular migrants at the border, even if they applied for asylum.

""We will continue with the pushbacks,"" Dobrindt said in a statement, adding that ""we think we have the legal justification for this.""

Dobrindt added that the interior ministry would provide more detailed justifications for the pushbacks, as requested by the court.

The interior minister said that the migrants in question had attempted to cross the border three times, and only on the third attempt, did they invoke the right to asylum. 

A crackdown on irregular migration was a central pledge in Merz's campaign ahead of February's general election.

That vote saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) achieve its best-ever result, winning just over 20% of the vote. Merz has since argued that decisive action on migration is essential to stopping the AfD's rise.

After Monday's ruling, Germany's environmentalist Green Party, now in opposition, said that the court's decision backed up their stance that Merz's migration policy was bound to fail. 

""This is a severe defeat for the federal government and should serve as a warning to abide by the law in the future and not knowingly exceed its own powers for populist purposes,"" Greens lawmaker Irene Mihalic told the Rheinische Post newspaper.

""The border blockades were a rejection of the European Dublin system and have offended our European neighbors.""

Karl Kopp, managing director of German pro-immigration advocacy group Pro Asyl, told the Rheinische Post that Interior Minister Dobrindt's ""unlawful practice of national unilateral action in asylum policy has failed.""

Last week, Dobrindt said he was hoping for a European Union (EU) agreement on a proposal to send failed asylum-seekers to ""return hubs"" in safe third countries. 

The European Commission has also proposed a scheme to allow member states to reject asylum applications from migrants who have passed through a ""safe"" third country before entering the EU. The proposals have yet to pass in the European Parliament or be adopted by national governments.

The Dublin Regulation is an EU law that determines which EU country is responsible for the application.

However, under the rules, police are not allowed to simply turn asylum seekers back at the border.

Instead, German authorities must initiate a complicated procedure to transfer them back to the country where they first entered the EU.

The first EU country where an asylum seeker enters and where fingerprints are taken is usually responsible for the claim.

The idea is that it ensures that a person doesn't apply for asylum in several EU countries simultaneously.

The system has been criticized for putting too much burden on EU external border countries like Greece and Italy, which are often the first entry points.

The looming expiration of the New START Treaty, the only remaining bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, has focused national security experts on what comes next. Given the impending deadline, some strategists argue that the United States should engage Russia in a new nuclear agreement and that the way to do so is to open negotiations while continuing to abide by the limits set by New START even after the treaty expires, in early 2026. The first part of this argument has some merit; the second does not. To meet the current moment, the United States must move past New START.

At the time it was signed in 2010, New START had some advantages. The treaty set constraints on deployed strategic nuclear warheads, limiting each side to 1,550 warheads. It also had domestic political utility: in exchange for Republican support for the treaty, Democrats agreed to support modernizing aging strategic nuclear forces. But New START was written for a geopolitical landscape that no longer exists. Back then, although Russian President Vladimir Putin had begun to show his growing discontent with the prevailing world order, he had not yet revealed his determination to rebuild, to the maximum extent possible, the Soviet empire. Moreover, Russia's Cold War–era strategic and regional nuclear forces were aging, and its own full-scale modernization effort had not yet taken shape. Perhaps most important, many observers at the time considered China to be relatively benign and largely content to keep its military within its own borders. Although there were hints that it was seeking future capabilities, China's nuclear forces were based on older systems and seemed limited to maintaining “a minimum means of reprisal.”

Fifteen years later, the world has changed dramatically. Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have emerged as aggressive and expansionist leaders. Russia has, according to Putin, modernized 95 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is pursuing several novel intercontinental systems that were designed to get around New START constraints. Most worrying, Putin has fielded a regional nuclear force of some 2,000 short- and medium-range lower-yield weapons that can be launched from the ground, air and ships. This regional force obliterates the 1991 and 1992 Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, by which both Moscow and Washington agreed to eliminate all army tactical nuclear weapons and dramatically slash holdings of navy and air force tactical nuclear weapons.

China, meanwhile, is undertaking what Admiral Charles “Chas” Richard, the former commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, described as a “strategic breakout.” The “explosive growth” of China's nuclear arsenal, he said, “can only be described as breathtaking.” Beijing, too, is now busy fielding a highly modernized regional nuclear force and is en route to becoming a full-blown nuclear peer to the United States. It is also collaborating with Russia in new ways that threaten U.S. security. As the 2023 congressionally mandated, bipartisan Strategic Posture Commisson unanimously noted: “The new partnership between Russian and Chinese leaders poses qualitatively new threats of potential opportunistic aggression and/or future cooperative two-theater aggression.”

In a world with two potential nuclear-armed enemies, New START no longer provides for U.S. and allied security. By constraining U.S. strategic forces, it undermines the United States' ability to deter Russia and China simultaneously. New START also fails on a regional level by not addressing the shorter-range nuclear weapons that Russia or China would likely use first in wartime. In other words, New START is the wrong treaty for the current time. In the near term, the only way for the United States to meet this new world order is to let the treaty expire and begin increasing its own capabilities.

For the past century, arms control agreements have been used to constrain threats posed by potential aggressor nations. But for the most part, these agreements have worked only when none of the signatories harbored aggressive intent. Where there was such intent, arms control treaties have been covertly or overtly violated or channeled arms competition into areas that were not limited. The naval treaties of the 1920s and 1930s offer a case in point: they limited capital ships but excluded submarines, allowing a robust competition in the latter. And by the 1930s, some of the parties, particularly Nazi Germany, merely pretended to abide by treaty limits. In more recent decades, the Soviet Union and now Russia have been repeat offenders. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union violated the Biological Weapons Convention shortly after its signing, and then went on to violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the 1980s.

Since coming to power in Russia, Putin has violated nine separate arms control agreements and now appears ready to skirt two more: the State Department's most recent arms control compliance report notes that Putin is following his Soviet predecessors in contravening the Biological Weapons Convention by maintaining “an offensive biological warfare program,” and after intelligence reports indicated Russia may be planning to put a nuclear weapon into Earth's orbit, Russia vetoed a UN resolution reaffirming the Outer Space Treaty. Moreover, by deliberately taking reckless actions such as cutting in front of U.S. naval and air forces, Putin's military routinely ignores the 1972 Incidents at Sea Agreement and the Reagan-era Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities Agreement, which both sought to regulate militaries' conduct in order to avoid accidents that could lead to inadvertent escalation or miscalculation. Given these willful and continuing violations, the prospect of negotiating a meaningful arms control deal with Putin under the best of circumstances is far-fetched. Add to the calculus that Moscow's forces have stepped up attacks on Ukrainian cities even as Putin gives rhetorical support to peace talks, and it beggars belief that Russia would engage in good-faith arms control negotiations over the next year.

In the near term, nuclear discussions between Washington and Beijing seem similarly improbable. China, for its part, regards any willingness to engage in arms control as a sign of weakness, and it views the transparency and verification process that would presumably undergird such an accord as intrusive and akin to espionage. When the first Trump administration proposed such talks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry described the proposal as “neither serious nor sincere.” Beijing is also unlikely to contemplate any arms control agreement until it has reached parity with Russia and the United States, which is, according to the Defense Department's China Military Power Report, a decade away.

In the absence of changes in the leadership in Moscow and Beijing, the United States is not likely to see a new nuclear arms control treaty anytime soon. This is disappointing, of course, but arms control is not—and can never be—a substitute for strong deterrence policies and posture. History clearly shows that building strategic nuclear forces creates painful defense dilemmas for adversaries and is the surest formula both for protecting the United States and its allies and for ultimately getting adversaries to the negotiating table. Unilateral restraint has never succeeded in doing that, nor has continuing to abide by outdated agreements that cannot ensure future security. 

To begin meeting the demands of a two-nuclear-peer environment, the United States should prepare now for force posture adjustments once the New START limits disappear. The simplest place to start is by reversing those changes the United States agreed to in order to comply with New START. On the U.S. fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, for instance, close to 100 launch tubes for Trident II missiles have been deactivated since 2011. Roughly 30 B-52 bombers have also been stripped of their nuclear capabilities to meet the treaty's limits. Reversing these moves would quickly boost U.S. deterrence power. The United States should also upload its existing Trident II submarine-launched missiles and its land-based Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles by increasing the number of warheads carried on each missile.

In the medium term, the U.S. Strategic Modernization Program—which was first outlined by the Obama administration and which will modernize all three legs of the nuclear triad—should be expanded to more accurately respond to the current nuclear landscape. The overall increase in deployed warheads, however, need only be modest for the United States to maintain credible deterrence against both Moscow and Beijing. The United States should, for instance, increase the number of new Columbia-class strategic nuclear submarines from “a minimum of 12” to a minimum of 15, and the number of new B-21 bombers from 100 to at least 150. There is no need for the United States to match Russia and China weapon for weapon, but it does need the flexibility to maintain a strategic force that can hold one adversary at bay even after absorbing a first strike and retaliating against the other adversary.

Once New START expires, the United States also needs to let go of the Cold War assumptions that underpin it. With the sole exception of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, every U.S.-Soviet/Russian nuclear arms agreement from SALT I in 1972 to New START has focused on intercontinental-range systems. Regional nuclear forces—both short- and medium-range—were excluded from consideration. Since the 1970s, successive U.S. administrations believed this was an acceptable risk, assuming that any use of nuclear weapons that would occur between Moscow and Washington would rapidly escalate to the use of intercontinental weapons. But that is no longer a tenable assumption. Strategists now generally agree that the first use of a nuclear weapon will occur as the result of an escalating regional conventional conflict. Putin has made such escalatory threats against Ukraine and NATO, and Russia's approximately 2,000 regional nuclear weapons are not subject to New START's 1,550-weapon ceiling. In addition to improving U.S. and allied regional deterrent options (an approach also recommended by the Strategic Posture Commission), any new arms control effort must cover the regional nuclear threats in Europe and the Asia-Pacific.

In the future, any new nuclear treaty should set an overall limit for all deployed nuclear weapons, regional and intercontinental, held by the treaty parties. Under that ceiling, each party could be free to alter the mix of intercontinental and regional weapons at any point, as long as it notified the other party. Such flexibility would bolster currently undersized U.S. military forces as well as the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence guarantees. Of course, traditional arms control advocates will likely object to such an approach since the total number of nuclear weapons allowed will go up—suggesting progress has been lost—but that argument is disingenuous. As it is written, New START simply pretends Russia's regional weapons don't exist. If a new treaty were to freeze the overall force size at Russia's current roughly 3,550 level, the increase in number might look bad, but it would reflect reality. Better bad optics than pretending the weapons don't exist.

Verifying the number of regional nuclear weapons deployed by each side (indeed, even identifying which regional nuclear weapons are deemed “deployed”) will be challenging, especially given their small size and frequent association with launchers that can be used for either conventional or smaller nuclear weapons. But this problem can be overcome once both sides recognize they have an interest in establishing limits. And if the parties can't get to that modicum of goodwill, it will be fruitless to pursue a treaty in the first place.

Until then, the United States should take all necessary steps to maximize the deterrent potential of its current arsenal. If it instead tries to hold on to New START constraints in the unrealistic hope that doing so will coax Moscow back to the table, it will find itself mired in Cold War nostrums about strategic stability that were derived from a bipolar world. All the while, it will struggle to keep pace with the novel challenge of dealing with two nuclear peers that, increasingly, are working together against U.S. interests.
