Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams reports from North Carolina as the family of murdered Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska speaks out. Silicon Valley is stepping in after the killing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska shocked the nation. Eoghan McCabe, CEO and founder of Intercom, committed $500,000 to commission murals of Zarutska's face in major U.S. cities. "I am offering $500k in $10k grants to paint murals of the face of Iryna Zarutska in prominent US city locations," McCabe wrote. McCabe's post caught the attention of billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who replied with an offer to contribute $1 million. Musk has also been vocal about Zarutska's case, particularly media coverage of the killing and public reaction. Elon Musk has pledged $1 million to an initiative to have murals of murdered Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska. The person also said that McCabe was inspired by a desire to not let Zarutska be forgotten or ignored by mainstream media after her life was taken in such a brutal way. Notably, after George Floyd's 2020 killing, murals and statues in his honor appeared across U.S. cities. Surveillance video of Zarutska's stabbing has gone viral, sparking debate about how criminals are handled and public safety. The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., had 14 prior arrests when he allegedly stabbed Zarutska to death on a train in Charlotte, N.C. He also questioned why the suspect, who he called a "mentally deranged lunatic," was allowed to walk free despite a lengthy criminal record. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks about the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska aboard a North Carolina train during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., Sept. 9, 2025. "I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious War in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic. The perpetrator was a well known career criminal, who had been previously arrested and released on CASHLESS BAIL in January, a total of 14 TIMES. Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP," Trump said. "This could have been anyone riding the light rail that night. We are committed to making sure this never happens again," Zarutska's family said in their first statement since she was murdered. Iryna Zarutska, 23, was killed when taking a train in Charlotte, N.C., on Aug. 22, 2025. Zarutska was on a Lynx Blue Line train in Charlotte when she sat in front of a man in a red hoodie later identified as Brown. After a few moments of sitting behind Zarutska, Brown is seen in the video standing up and stabbing the young woman. Brown was arrested soon after the attack and has been charged with first-degree murder. The Justice Department on Tuesday added a charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Larry Ellison, chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle Corporation, sits in the Oval Office of the White House as President Donald Trump signs an executive order, Monday, Feb. 3, 2025, in Washington. Elon Musk listens as President Donald Trump meets with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. 13, 2025, in Washington. NEW YORK (AP) — Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison wrested the title of the world's richest man from longtime holder Elon Musk early Wednesday, according to wealth tracker Bloomberg, as stock in his software giant rocketed more than a third in a stunning few minutes of trading. Another news organization with a long history of tallying the world's richest, Forbes, still has Musk at the top, at $439 billion. With Ellison's surging fortune Wednesday, he could fund the lifestyles of 5 million American families for a year, about the entire population of Florida, allowing them to all quit their jobs, assuming the U.S. median household income. Or Ellison could just tell all of South Africa to take a vacation for year and produce nothing, based on its gross domestic product. Ellison owns about 40% of Oracle, which means its surging stock added $100 billion to his net worth in little over a half-hour after stock market opened. The company had announced more than $300 billion worth of new contracts when it reported earnings. It said that it now expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to jump 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year. then rise to $144 billion in four years after that. Ellison said about the bold projections, “AI Changes Everything.” Musk is hoping the same for Tesla and his own net worth, but he's been struggling to convince investors. The company had been promising a big turnaround in electric car sales after they fell sharply earlier this year, but the bounce back hasn't happened. Musk has been downplaying the bad numbers by trying to shift investors' focus to Tesla's other business of making robots and advances in the artificial intelligence behind its cars and robotaxis. Tesla sales in the European Union plunged 40% earlier this summer, the seventh month in row of drops, as customers balked at buying his cars after he took to X to support extreme right-wing politicians there. The company has been losing market share in the U.S., too, as buyers angry with his embrace of Donald Trump have stayed away from Tesla showrooms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic (77) heaves a shot from half court over Portland Trail Blazers forward Jerami Grant (9) as the buzzer sounds in the first half of an NBA basketball game in Dallas, Dec. 16, 2022. NEW YORK (AP) — NBA players can now fire up those end-of-quarter heaves from deep without their shooting percentages being adversely affected. The league has approved a change in the way statistics on those shots are recorded, which could spur players to take more heaves from very, very deep with hopes of a miracle make. It was finalized at the league's board of governors meeting on Wednesday. For stat-keeping purposes, the NBA will tell teams that any shot taken within the final three seconds of the first three quarters and is launched from at least 36 feet away on any play that starts in the backcourt will count as a team shot attempt — but not an individual one. Many players have avoided taking the miracle 50-footer or deeper shot at the end of quarters to protect their personal shooting percentages. Based on its tracking data, Golden State's Stephen Curry made four shots under those criteria last season and Denver's Nikola Jokic made three. The AP and other outlets reported on Sept. 3 that the league is closing in on finalizing another new format for this season's All-Star Game, one where three eight-man teams — two from the U.S. and one composed of international players — would square off in a round-robin tournament. Having 16 All-Stars from the U.S. and eight from other countries would be in line with the current breakdown of where NBA players are from; the league is about two-thirds American players, one-third international players. The league has been heading in this direction for several months, especially after last season's All-Star mini-tournament — untimed games to 40 points, with four teams of eight players each — was a flop. Silver has wanted a more competitive All-Star format for years. Talks on how to proceed with a new NBA-backed league in Europe, in partnership with FIBA, are continuing, Silver said. “I think our basketball people now are very engaged in how the competition will work,” Silver said. “Our lawyers are thinking hard on how we can take ... a sort of cap-based system and revenue-sharing system with players and how we could apply that in a European framework.” Silver also said the league's governors got an update on domestic expansion plans at its meeting that concluded Wednesday. The NBA said in July that it was beginning the process of formally exploring adding to its current 30-team league, though there is no timetable for when that will happen. Seattle and Las Vegas have long been believed to be major candidates for NBA expansion if the league formally decides to move forward. The NBA Cup, which has had a Final Four setup for its semifinals and final in Las Vegas — and will again this season — will be changing in 2026-27. The final — which doesn't count on either team's record — will be the only game played at a neutral site. The board approved a change to coach's challenges, starting this season. The NBA says it will expedite review times. Last season was the first where referees could determine whether a proximate foul should have been called on certain plays.</p>

Sarah Huckabee Sanders joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her decision to deploy the state's National Guard to support ICE agents and share an update on the statewide school phone ban. EXCLUSIVE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement's recruitment efforts are proving to be a quick success with 141,000 applications and 18,000 tentative job offers since the recruitment push started at the end of July. The Trump administration launched a campaign earlier this summer to boost ICE staff, including by offering major perks, such as up to $50,000 as a sign-on bonus, student loan forgiveness and special retirement benefits. "ICE has received more than 141,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S. We have already given more than 18,000 tentative job offers," Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks at a press conference at the Wilshire Federal Building on June 12, 2025, in Los Angeles. "Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country," Noem continued. The agency has been conducting large operations in major cities throughout the country, including in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., in order to execute mass deportations as well as arresting those in the country illegally with other criminal charges or convictions. More detention centers have also opened throughout the country to hold individuals before deportation, including Alligator Alcatraz in Florida. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July provides funding for 10,000 ICE agents. As of mid-August, there were 100,000 applicants since the effort began. Notably, the age cap, which is typically 37 or 40, was nixed by the administration and it is encouraging retired law enforcement officers to join. Residents surround federal and Border Patrol agents after an immigrant raid on Atlantic Boulevard in Bell, California, on June 19, 2025. "We are ENDING the age cap for ICE law enforcement. Qualified candidates can now apply with no age limit," Noem posted to X on Aug. 6. ICE currently has various operations underway to achieve the administration's goals, including "Operation Midway Blitz" in Chicago and "Operation Patriot 2.0," which each have the primary goal of targeting criminals. Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks during a campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 4, 2024. While many Democratic leaders have been unwilling to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, many Republican leaders are openly assisting ICE. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Tuesday that the state's National Guard will help out ICE in the state with 40 people. "The Arkansas National Guard stands ready to support this mission by providing requested administrative and logistical assistance to the Department of Homeland Security," Brig.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life. CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday. They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance — ideally in labs on Earth — before reaching any conclusions. Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life, past or present. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options. Calling it an “exciting discovery,” a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — SETI Institute's Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Mario Parente — were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible. “That's part of the reason why we can't go so far as to say, ‘A-ha, this is proof positive of life,''' lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. “All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.” Either way, Hurowitz said it's the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover's search for potential signs of long-ago life. “It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?” Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's “a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.” Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance's science instruments before the drill came out. This image provided by NASA shows the 360-degree view of a region on Mars called “Bright Angel,” captured on June 12, 2024 by NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and is made up of 346 individual images that were stitched together after being sent back to Earth. “There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,” Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial. There's no evidence of present-day life on Mars, but NASA over the decades has sent spacecraft to Mars in search of past watery environments that might have supported life way back when. Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz. NASA's acting Administrator Sean Duffy said budgets and timing will dictate how best to proceed, and even raised the possibility of sending sophisticated equipment to Mars to analyze the samples on the red planet. “All options are on the table,” he said.</p>

Brett Eagleson, whose father was killed in the attacks, said in New York the judge's recent "historic, landmark decision" to advance a long-running lawsuit against Saudi Arabia was based on "indefensible evidence." Family members of 9/11 victims celebrated on Wednesday a court victory they said brings them one step closer to holding Saudi Arabia accountable for its alleged role in the 2001 terrorist attacks. Brett Eagleson, whose father, John, was killed in the attacks, said during a press conference in New York City the judge's "historic, landmark decision," issued two weeks ago, to move forward with a long-running lawsuit against the Saudi Arabian government was based on "indefensible evidence." "There were at least 13 Saudi government officials connected to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. "There were funneling support from the Ministry of Islamic Affairs in Washington, D.C., to their embassies in San Diego, to the hijackers' handlers, right down to the hijackers themselves." This photo obtained March 1, 2003, shows Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, alleged organizer of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, shortly after his capture. Eagleson also named two people who he alleged were part of an "advance team" sent by the Saudi government to assist the Islamic extremist group al Qaeda in plotting the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. However, what's happening currently and what's been happening for the past 24 years has been an abomination," Eagleson said of the drawn-out legal fight. Brett Eagleson, whose father was killed in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, speaks at a press conference in New York City on Sept. 10, 2025. Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York said in a 45-page decision that a person could reasonably infer that the two individuals had some knowledge that they were supporting the plane hijackers who perpetrated the deadly attacks on the World Trade Center towers and Pentagon. "Some of the disputed facts cannot be resolved at this stage of the litigation, because weighing the evidence or assessing witnesses' credibility will need to take place at trial," the judge wrote. "Nonetheless, the entire body of undisputed facts, and the Court's preliminary assessment of certain disputed facts, are adequate for the Court to conclude that the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate here." Daniels' decision means the two-decade case is likely headed for trial, a point Eagleson made during the press conference. "This is what we've all known for 20 years," Eagleson said. "It's time for America to learn what we've been fighting.… This is the best thing that we can do for the memories of our loved ones is let's stand up for what's right and just and let's have truth accountability and closure." The attacks on Sept. 11 were carried out by 19 suspects associated with al Qaeda, led at the time by Usama bin Laden. They hijacked four commercial airplanes in the United States, crashing two into the twin towers in New York City, one into the Pentagon and another into a field in Pennsylvania. Five others were charged in military tribunals and are being held at Guantanamo Bay.

Fresno State guard Jalen Weaver (5) shoots over during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Utah State in the quarterfinal round of the Mountain West Conference tournament, Thursday, March 14, 2024, in Las Vegas. Fresno State's Steven Vasquez, left, celebrates the team's win over New Mexico following an NCAA college basketball game in Fresno, Calif., Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2023. The NCAA banned three Division I college basketball players by permanently revoking their eligibility on Wednesday, saying they had bet on their own games at Fresno State and San Jose State and were able to share thousands of dollars in payouts. The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an enforcement investigation that uncovered violations by Mykell Robinson, Steven Vasquez and Jalen Weaver. The NCAA said the three bet on one another's games and/or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season; two of them manipulated their performances to ensure certain bets were won. The NCAA said a sports integrity monitoring service in January notified Fresno State and NCAA enforcement staff that a Nevada sportsbook operator had flagged suspicious prop bets on Robinson. According to the NCAA, Robinson and Vasquez had been roommates at Fresno State during the 2023-24 season. In January 2025, Robinson, who was still at Fresno State, and Vasquez, then at San Jose State — discussed over text message that Robinson planned to underperform in several statistical categories during one regular-season game. Robinson also placed multiple bets on Weaver, his teammate at Fresno State in 2024-25, the NCAA found. During one game, Robinson, Vasquez and a third party bet a combined $2,200 on Robinson to underperform, and a $15,950 payout was redistributed among those who had bet, the NCAA said. During that same season, Robinson placed 13 daily fantasy sports over-line and under-line prop bets totaling $454 on parlays that included his own performance. Robinson placed multiple bets on Weaver, including two bets placed before a game in late December 2024 after he and Weaver exchanged information about their respective betting lines, the NCAA said. Weaver cooperated and agreed to the violation in his case. All three were released from their respective teams and are no longer enrolled at their previous schools. The latest case comes eight years after a 2017 federal investigation into off-the-books payments to players and their families that, at the time, was against NCAA rules and one of the biggest scandals in the sport's history. Since then, the growth of legalized gambling across the United States has raised different concerns for college sports leaders and there have been scattered allegations, including some earlier this year, against programs involving betting. The NCAA in June said that “several sports betting-related violations by staff members at NCAA schools” have been resolved in recent years and noted its enforcement staff was working on issuing notices of allegations in several ongoing gambling cases. “The enforcement staff's sports betting-related caseload has significantly increased in recent years, and our staff — including our new sports betting integrity unit — has been effective in detecting and pursuing violations,” Jon Duncan, NCAA vice president of enforcement, said then. The nation's largest college sports organization, overseeing some 500,000 athletes, also said it was considering a proposal that would allow athletes and staff members to bet on professional sports and shift enforcement efforts to college sports betting and “behaviors that directly impact game integrity.” The Division I Council introduced the proposal that will be considered this fall and be implemented if Divisions II and III officials also approve. Current NCAA rules do not allow athletes or institutional staff to engage in sports betting for any sports that have NCAA championships; bets by an athlete on their own team or own sport risks a lifetime ban from college athletics. Those rules would not change under the pending proposal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Director Kash Patel listens during a news conference at the Department of Justice, May 7, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Three high-ranking FBI officials were fired last month in a “campaign of retribution” carried out by a director who knew better but caved to political pressure from the Trump administration so he could keep his own position, according to a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday that seeks reinstatement of the agents. It quotes Patel as having told Driscoll in a conversation last month “the FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it.” An FBI agent walks inside the front entrance of ex-Trump national security adviser John Bolton's Washington office, Aug 22, 2025. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Driscoll, Steve Jensen and Spencer Evans, three of five agents known to have been fired last month in a purge that current and former officials say has unnerved the workforce. It adds that “his decision to do so degraded the country's national security by firing three of the FBI's most experienced operational leaders, each of them experts in preventing terrorism and reducing violent crime.” Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel speak during a news conference at the Department of Justice, May 7, 2025, in Washington. The suit was filed in federal court in Washington, where judges and grand juries have pushed back against Trump administration initiatives and charging decisions. It notes that Patel, in a Fox News Channel interview two weeks after the terminations, said “every single person” found to have weaponized the FBI had been removed from leadership positions even though the suit says there's no indication any of the three had done so. “Their firing from the FBI, taken together, has put every American at greater risk than when Brian Driscoll, Steve Jensen and Spencer Evans were in positions of leadership.” Another of their attorneys, Abbe Lowell, said the lawsuit shows FBI leadership is “carrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs.” Former acting director of the FBI Brian Driscoll participates in a panel discussion during a summit on terrorism and political violence in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. Perhaps the most prominent of the plaintiffs is Driscoll, a former commander of the FBI's specialized hostage rescue team who served as acting director between when then-Director Christopher Wray resigned in January and Patel was confirmed in February. Driscoll resisted the order in a dispute that led Bove to accuse him of “insubordination.” Driscoll survived the dispute and took another high-profile position overseeing the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group, or CIRG, which deploys to crises. But new problems arose last month, the complaint says, when an FBI pilot whose duties including flying the bureau's private jet was falsely identified on social media as having been a case agent on the investigation into Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. The lawsuit recounts a conversation from early August in which Driscoll told Patel that it would be illegal to fire someone based on case assignments. Meyer was later fired but is not among the plaintiffs in Wednesday's suit. One of the plaintiffs, Jensen, was picked by Patel to run the bureau's Washington field office despite a backlash from Trump loyalists about his earlier leadership role coordinating investigations into the Capitol riot. The suit says that even as Jensen was publicly defended by FBI leadership, he was told by Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino that they were spending “a lot of political capital” to keep him in the position. In May, according to the complaint, Bongino told him he would have to fire an agent assigned to his office who'd worked on Trump-related cases but also investigations into officials of both major political parties. That agent, Walter Giardina, was also among the five who were fired. Another plaintiff, Evans, says he was targeted for retribution over his leadership role in the FBI's Human Resources Division during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which made him responsible for reviewing accommodation requests from employees seeking exemption from vaccine requirements. That position exposed Evans to a barrage of criticism from a former agent who the lawsuit says regularly aired his grievances against Evans on social media and maintained access to Patel. Evans was among senior executives told in late January to either retire or be fired, but he was given a reprieve and permitted to remain in his job as leader of the Las Vegas field office. On Aug. 6, the lawsuit says, Evans was packing for a new FBI assignment in Huntsville, Alabama, when he was notified that he had been fired.</p>

O'Connell, 51, claimed an unknown woman took his belongings while he was taking a yoga class in the Los Angeles area. The "Pictionary" game show host said that his phone and wallet were stolen out of a pair of shoes he stashed in the studio before taking a class. Jerry O'Connell claimed to be the victim of a "yoga bandit" who allegedly stole his belongings during a class in LA. When the session was over, O'Connell's belongings – which included cash – were missing. "I wear the same pair of dirty old sneakers to yoga class and before class, I took them off and slipped my wallet and phone into the dirty shoes. He said it "made no sense" that his items were missing "since the door is locked." "I told the guy at the desk in a hushed tone since I was still feeling the zen, and if there's a place where no one is going to freak out, it's a yoga studio," he told the outlet. Jerry O'Connell reportedly lost cash and his phone at an LA yoga studio. NBC first reported that Los Angeles Police Department officials took a theft report, and said the crime was caught on security cameras. The culprit allegedly immediately charged "almost $500 at a department store and 100 bucks at the gas station," O'Connell said, before adding that American Express already had a new card ready for him. The woman allegedly has a repeated history of incidents stealing from yoga studios. The "Stand By Me" actor said he frequents the yoga studio with his wife, Rebecca Romijn. "The only real bummer is that I had a photo of Rebecca from high school in my wallet, a four-leaf clover Jack McBrayer had given me, a $2 bill I got while shooting ‘Stand By Me,' and my grandfather Charles Witkowski's obituary." "So if Gus's Liquor hits the jackpot, it could be the yoga bandit," he said before adding, "What are the rules about that? Jerry O'Connell and Rebecca Romijn have been married for 18 years and share two children together. O'Connell added, "By the way, I have an Android, so good luck selling that. And Find My Android doesn't work." "I was back today and took a class," he said. "Shout out to Zack, my yoga teacher – I can touch my toes because of him, so all things ended well."

A married man and woman were found dead inside their burned out home near the Belmont Park racetrack Monday, according to the NYPD, as officers seek a man in black caught on surveillance video near the crime scene. New York City police are urging residents to be on alert for a man suspected of torturing an elderly Queens couple for hours before killing them and setting their home on fire – all under the guise of needing to come inside to charge his phone. The NYPD has released new photos of 42-year-old Jamel McGriff, an ex-con with a decades-long rap sheet, as police warn he is considered armed and dangerous. The NYPD is asking for the public's help in locating Jamel McGriff, an ex-con wanted for allegedly torturing and killing an elderly Queens couple. Police say surveillance video shows McGriff approaching a home around 10 a.m. and asking the resident if he could come inside to charge his phone, which the homeowner declined. Surveillance footage captured McGriff exiting the home around five hours later at 3 p.m., carrying two bags and walking eastbound on 87th Drive. Shortly after, the victims' son, an active-duty FDNY EMT, received a security alert that his parents' house was on fire and called 911. The NYPD is asking for the public's help in locating Jamel McGriff, an ex-con wanted for allegedly torturing and killing an elderly Queens couple. "Once the flames were under control, two victims were found deceased inside the home – 76-year-old Frank Olton, who was the one seen on video interacting with the suspect outside, and Mr. Olton's wife, 77-year-old Maureen Olton," NYPD Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. "Mr. Olton was found in the basement tied to a pole with multiple stab wounds; Mrs. Olton was found on the first floor severely burned." "Do not allow anyone you don't know or who you are not expecting into your home," Tisch added. This still image taken from security video shows the man police are seeking in connection with a double-homicide arson attack near New York's Belmont Park racetrack. He is also wanted for two recent robberies – one at a Harlem GameStop in July and another at a Manhattan Verizon store, where he was reportedly fought off by a store clerk who noticed he was carrying a fake gun, police said. Last year, McGriff also failed to register as a sex offender, a parole violation, police said. McGriff was last spotted pawning two cellphones in the Bronx on Tuesday, police said. He was also seen on surveillance video walking down a sidewalk in Queens wearing a black hat, black jacket, blue jeans and black sneakers while carrying a backpack and paper bag. Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS, share tips online at https://crimestoppers.nypdonline.org or on X @NYPDTips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exposure to dangerous chemicals, overmedication, a lack of physical activity, poor sleep, too much screen time and stress are the other key drivers of the decline in children's health, according to the MAHA commission's latest report, “Make Our Children Healthy Again.” But does the new strategy report, spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., truly address the changes needed to improve children's well-being? CNN asked leading nutrition researchers, food safety advocates, pediatricians and health policymakers for their thoughts. Overall, experts CNN spoke with agree with the main MAHA diagnosis:  American children are increasingly affected by chronic disease that is largely preventable. “There is much in this report that is on target, especially the need to improve diet quality and increase physical activity while reducing screen time,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. “If we want to see healthier pregnancies and birth outcomes and more children having a healthy start in life, this benefit must be protected from any cuts,” the nonprofit National WIC Association stated in June when the 2026 budget was announced. The SNAP program, which provides monthly benefits to help low-income individuals and families buy groceries, is the “most effective tool available to prevent hunger in America,” according to the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. Medicaid provides free or low-cost health coverage to the elderly, people with disabilities and some low-income pregnant women, families and children. Cuts to Medicaid hurt children by limiting their access to critical check-ups and preventive care and creates financial instability for families, experts say. The administration's cuts to key safety nets for children, “along with its chaotic, confusing actions restricting vaccine access are worsening — not resolving — efforts to improve children's health,” Kressly said in a statement. There are also glaring blind spots that need to be addressed for American children to be truly healthy, Willett added. “The authors say that they want to look for underlying causes of the chronic disease epidemic in children, but don't mention poverty and systemic racism, which are clearly important underlying contributors,” Willett added. The report includes little about sugar-sweetened beverages or lead in water, which Willett says are “huge and well-documented issues.” The report also ignores proven strategies — such as taxes on soda — “that can easily be implemented without further research, especially when the income is used to support nutrition and activity programs in children.” “Food dyes, fluoride and vaccine injury get a lot of attention, but are almost surely minor contributors to the epidemic, if they contribute at all,” Willett said. That's because the MAHA campaign has focused on Kennedy's “pet peeves,” and fails to marshal proven interventions for the underlying drivers of chronic disease, said Lurie, a former associate commissioner for public health strategy and analysis at the US Food and Drug Administration. “The actual causes of chronic disease in this country relate to added sugars, sodium and fats,” he said. But fixing those issues is either absent from this report or addressed in a very weak way.” The 2025 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, or DGAC, which analyzes recent nutrition research and suggests recommendations for new federal dietary guidelines, for the first time called for Americans to turn away from red and processed meats and embrace plant-based protein sources known to improve health, such as beans, peas and lentils. However, it appears that Kennedy and the MAHA Commission have “dismissed” the committee's work, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California, who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center's Nutrition Studies Research Group. “Given my recent participation in (the US Dietary Guidelines) process, my sense is the administration is disregarding solid science and replacing it with whim and whimsy — substituting seed oils with beef tallow for deep-frying french fries and cane sugar for high fructose cane syrup in soda,” Gardner said. “That's not going to help address the root causes of childhood obesity and poor health.” On average, children in the United States get nearly two-thirds of their calories from ultraprocessed foods packed full of additives and high-calorie sugars, salt and fat, according to a recent CDC report. This type of poor diet is contributing to alarming rates of childhood obesity and a rise in type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, high blood pressure and more in the nation's youth, experts say. “Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” said Popkin via email. “Sadly, they will support research and issue guidelines but provide no regulations or laws to mandate change. The MAHA commission's overriding message is still “more research needed,” said Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University in an email. “On reducing intake of ultra-processed foods, the report says it will try to develop a definition as a base for future research and policy — a distant goal,” said Nestle, author of numerous books on food politics and marketing, including 2015's “Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning).” “The big issue for me is what are they going to do about food marketing to children?” said Nestle, who has spoken out about the billions of dollars industry spends on advertising soda and ultraprocessed foods to children, especially minority children.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Mexico officials announced Monday that it will become the first state to make child care free regardless of one's income. The universal child care program will build on an existing program that has provided child care at no cost to thousands of children. “Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico's future prosperity,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said in a statement announcing the expanded program Monday. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.” In 2022, voters in the state overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment to allocate a portion of the state's Land Grant Permanent Fund, which is largely funded by taxes on oil and gas, toward funding early childhood and public school education. New Mexicans earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or annual household incomes of about $124,000, had qualified for free child care under the program. In New Mexico's most recent budget, the Early Childhood Education and Care Department received a $113 million increase in funds, bringing its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that fund will go toward child care payment support. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. It is as horrific as anything you'll ever see happen to an innocent person: A young Ukrainian woman, minding her own business on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, suddenly attacked from behind by a black man wielding a knife, stabbing and killing her before walking off and saying, “I got the white girl.” But that thought process turned out to be an illusion, because our so-called leaders and judges have made this country infinitely less safe for no good reason. The answer, of course, is that he was continually arrested only to be put back on the street despite being a clear danger to others. This case was originally not covered at all by most legacy media outlets despite being a top trending story on social media sites such as X. But when it got too big to ignore, what we read and heard out of networks such as Axios and CNN was, and there's no other word to describe it, despicable. “The gruesome video of the fatal knife attack on Iryna Zarutska on a light-rail car in Charlotte is drawing attention from MAGA influencers seeking to elevate the issue of violent urban crime — and accuse mainstream media of under-covering shocking cases.” The fatal knife attack is only drawing attention from MAGA influencers? It's creating, per Axios's clear implication, a perception that violent urban crime is somehow exaggerated? Let's look at the numbers where this latest murder took place, in Charlotte. In 2018, according to the Charlotte Police Department, there were 57 murders recorded. Thankfully, the Axios story was eviscerated online for its blatant bias and dishonesty. But it didn't stop there: Enter CNN's Brian Stelter, who piously lectured earlier this week that race had absolutely, positively nothing to do with Zarutska's execution. “Most murders in the U.S. never become national news,” Stelter said Monday. “This one's got our attention for a couple of reasons. 1, first and foremost, the recent release of that gruesome video. They picked up on this video from local news and ran with it. “In this case, it is Trump-aligned influencers who are posting up a storm about this case on social media, really over the weekend. Elon Musk, Charlie Kirk, other Trump-aligned figures succeeded in making this senseless death a symbol of big-city crime. “I have to say, some of the replies to Musk, some of the comments around this story are baldly racist, stoking fear of African Americans because this man attacked a White woman. The open racism on sites like X today, it's eye-popping.” But Stelter is especially accomplished at the bias of omission to push false narratives. Nor did Van Jones, who once somehow chalked up President Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton to racist voters. “We don't know why this man did what he did,” Jones said Monday night before blaming Kirk for assigning a motive to the murder based on race. “I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed in Charlotte by a madman, a lunatic,” Trump said Monday. “She's just sitting there, it's on the tape. He wants to send the National Guard into Chicago next, but Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) is resisting at every turn in offering zero cooperation while claiming that Chicago has become a much safer city. But on cue, over Labor Day weekend alone, 54 people were shot in Chicago. Speaking of progressive Democrats, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) weighed in to share what the role of law enforcement is really about. And if you thought stupidity is a handicap in politics, think again. “I want to be clear that, like, law enforcement isn't to prevent crime,” she said on a podcast ironically called Grounded. OK, so by this logic, if police raid the home of a possible mass shooter before he carries out such an attack, they're not doing their job? Or if a highway patrol officer pulls over a drunk driver before he or she kills someone, that's also not part of the job? Back to the Charlotte murder, the suspect, Brown, once told officers after being arrested that he believed that he was given some kind of material that “controlled what he ate,” according to police records. When officers told Brown they couldn't help him with this fabricated condition, a judge simply released him without bail. Overall, Brown had been arrested in the same county 14 times, including for violent crimes, yet was continually released back into the public. From 2017 until earlier this year, North Carolina was run by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who plans to run for Senate in 2026. A recent Ipsos poll shows that then-President Joe Biden was 26 points underwater in August 2024 on how voters viewed his handling of crime. Trump has surged on this issue following the National Guard deployment to Washington, with a majority of people now approving of his tactics. Brown should have been in a prison cell for some time now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuesday night was another night of drone and missile attacks, in what has been a major escalation of Russian air assault since the summit meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska nearly four weeks ago. Overnight, at least eight Russian drones lost their way and ended up being shot down by Polish and NATO fighter jets after they crossed into Polish airspace. “Increasing evidence indicates that this movement, this direction of strike, was no accident,” Zelensky alleged while noting that if NATO jets can shoot down drones over Poland, why not over Ukraine, where Russia targets civilians with impunity. “He's been weak on Russia,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) told CNN's Manu Raju Tuesday morning. “He's got people in his administration pulling the wrong way, and it's time for fellow Republicans like me to be calling these guys out,” Bacon said. “Putin is no longer content just losing in Ukraine while bombing mothers and babies, he is now directly testing our resolve in NATO territory,” Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) posted on X Tuesday night. Since then, Putin met with his fellow authoritarians to conspire against the US. “The president has done a number of things to demonstrate that he was being patient. “I really believe if you don't have a counterweight to a growing threat of totalitarianism, and the litmus test is in Ukraine, we fail in Ukraine, we're going to put far more American lives at risk, having to regain the foothold that we have for democracy in Europe,” Tillis said.

Shortly after the strike, Trump vented on his Truth Social page, “This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me. Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals. The Prime Minister told me that he wants to make Peace. I believe this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for PEACE. I assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.” But their situation is going to be dire in the days ahead. US AND INDIA TALKING AGAIN: After a period when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was reportedly refusing to take Trump's calls and was seen warmly embracing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin at a summit in China, Trump seemed to be writing off the erstwhile U.S. ally. But as of Wednesday morning, it appears the old pals have patched things up. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks,” Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday night. “I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries! “Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. We will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people.” Washington Examiner: Poland scrambles aircraft to destroy Russian drones violating its airspace Washington Examiner: Trump fumes over Israel's attack on Doha and assures Qatar it won't happen again Washington Examiner: Taiwanese president says Trump is bolstering support for island amid China's expansionism Washington Examiner: Taiwan's diplomats yearn for direct talks with Trump amid tariff negotiations Washington Examiner: Republicans inch closer to short-term funding deal as time is running out Washington Examiner: Trump says Princeton student released by Kataib Hezbollah after months of torture Washington Examiner: Opinion: Why Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar matters AP: EU commission president seeks sanctions, partial trade suspension against Israel over war in Gaza Task & Purpose: Air Force Special Ops Troops Practice Airfield Seizures Amid Caribbean Build-Up AP: Trump is upsetting the US allies needed to counter China Air & Space Forces Magazine: SDA Readies for Prime Time with First Operational Satellite Launch Defense News: Vendors Team Up on Sensors, Comms Systems for GCAP Next-Gen Fighter War on the Rocks: Opinion: Denial Won't Do: Europe Needs a Punishment-Based Conventional Counterstrike Strategy Air & Space Forces Magazine: Little Caesars at 6,000 Feet: A Day Hauling Cargo on the C-130 12 p.m. 1400 L St. NW — Atlantic Council discussion: “U.S.-Iraq security partnership after Operation Inherent Resolve,” with former U.S. 12 p.m. — Washington Institute for Near East Policy virtual forum, “The Abraham Accords at Five Years: Resilience and Roadblocks,” with former Israeli Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Amir Hayek, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council; Victoria Coates, vice president, Heritage Foundation's Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy; former U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Yael Lampert; and Ahdeya al-Sayed, former president, Bahrain Journalists Association https://washingtoninstitute-org.zoom.us/webinar/register 8:30 a.m. Washington Convention Center — Billington CyberSecurity Summit, with Douglas “Doug” Matty, chief digital and AI officer at the Pentagon Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office; Matthew “Matt” Turek, deputy director, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Information Innovation Office https://billingtoncybersummit.com THURSDAY | SEPTEMBER 2511 a.m. — Arms Control Association annual meeting, hosted at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, with former Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif; former Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification Mallory Stewart; Senior International/Defense Researcher at RAND Kingston Reif; and Fifth General Secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation Bridget Moixhttps://www.armscontrol.org/2025AnnualMeeting</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As public outrage grew over last month's killing on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, Mayor Vi Lyles focused her initial statement on addressing mental health issues, warning that “we will never arrest our way” out of some of the underlying causes of crime. A day later, facing accusations that she had downplayed the stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, Lyles pivoted. She announced an increased law enforcement presence on the transit system and accused the local courts of “tragic failure.” Five years after the murder of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a brief push among some Democrats to cut funding from police departments to provide money to social services, the party has failed to articulate a vision that addresses concerns over crime and criminal justice reform. Democrats agree that their messaging lacks the simplicity and cohesion of Republicans' tough-on-crime approach. “We need to learn at long last that data does not make people feel and it doesn't shift perception,” said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank. Republicans including Trump and North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley have claimed that Democratic prosecutors, judges and lawmakers have supported policies that allow people like the alleged attacker to be on the streets. “For far too long, Americans have been forced to put up with Democrat-run cities that set loose savage, bloodthirsty criminals to prey on innocent people,” Trump said in an Oval Office video posted Tuesday. An AP-NORC poll released August 31 found that 55% of US adults said deploying the National Guard to assist police departments was acceptable or somewhat acceptable to them. “For years now you've seen Democrats really talk about how we really need to feel more sorry for the people committing crimes than those who suffer from them.” Josh Stein called on the legislature to pass his proposal to boost pay for law enforcement and correctional officers. Republicans have argued the suspect, Decarlos Brown — who had a history of mental illness and convictions for breaking and entering, armed robbery and felony larceny — should not have been free to allegedly commit the crime in the first place. In January, Brown was charged with misuse of 911, a Class 1 misdemeanor, after he called for help to deal with what he described as a “man-made” substance controlling him. A judge released him on cashless bail after he provided a written promise he would return to court. “Democrat politicians, liberal judges and weak prosecutors would rather virtual signal than lock up criminals and protect their communities,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Tuesday press briefing as she railed against cashless bail. Roy Cooper, the party's front-runner in next year's US Senate race, pointing to a task force for racial equity he created via executive order in June 2020, weeks after Floyd was murdered. The panel, which was co-chaired by Stein when he was the state's attorney general, was asked to recommend solutions to “end disparate outcomes in the criminal justice system, mitigate the effects of bias and discrimination, and increase accountability in law enforcement and criminal justice.” Cooper signed legislation in 2023 implementing stricter bail laws for violent criminals. The task force didn't release its recommendations until after Brown completed a five-year sentence for robbery with a dangerous weapon in September 2020, and it didn't recommend releasing inmates early. “This was a heartbreaking, despicable act of evil and Iryna Zarutska's family and loved ones are in our prayers,” a spokesperson for the Cooper campaign said in a statement. “Roy Cooper knows North Carolinians need to be safe in their communities; he spent his career prosecuting violent criminals and drug dealers, increasing the penalties for violence against law enforcement, and keeping thousands of criminals off the streets and behind bars.” Democrats have long struggled to settle on a consistent message on public safety in a way that resonates with voters, a majority of whom trust Republicans more on the issue. The party has specifically struggled when Republicans tie them to specific instances of violence that capture national attention. Bush released the racially divisive Willie Horton attack ad against Democrat Michael Dukakis. Four years later, Bill Clinton won the presidency running on a tough-on-crime platform, then signed the 1994 crime bill into law. The legislation added funding for policing and banned assault weapons. It also implemented several policies — such as the “three strikes” provision — that Democrats later blamed for mass incarceration. “The biggest challenge for Democrats is that the only narrative that the public has heard when it comes to crime and when terrible, tragic incidents happen — like the stabbing and murder in Charlotte — is a GOP narrative of ‘We need to crack down and get tough on crime,'” said Insha Rahman, the director of Vera Action, which works to limit mass incarceration. Rahman has called on Democrats to go on the offensive when discussing public safety by focusing on aspects such as reducing gun violence and providing medical treatment for addiction and mental illness. Bennett of Third Way, who worked on Clinton's presidential campaigns, said his party should argue that Trump and his use of federal forces in cities is actually interfering with attempts to reduce crime. He pointed to messaging about the intervention in Washington, DC, by Mayor Muriel Bowser, who noted Republicans cut $1 billion from the city's budget, including money for law enforcement. “All it requires is saying, ‘Let me be 100% clear, we have a crime problem in America, and we need to address it with serious law enforcement … and the problem with Trump is what he's doing is actually getting in the way of that,'” Bennett said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Donald Trump has foisted National Guard troops on Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. Other cities are on edge, particularly after he posted an apparently artificially generated image of himself dressed up like Robert Duvall's surfing cavalry commander in “Apocalypse Now,” a meme that seemed to suggest he was threatening war on the city of Chicago. Trump later clarified that the US would not go to war on Chicago, but he's clearly comfortable joking about it. He's reorienting the US military to focus on drug traffickers as terrorists and told Congress to expect more military strikes after the US destroyed a boat in the Caribbean last week. A lot of it might also be illegal. US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled this month that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth committed a “a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act” when they deployed federalized troops to Los Angeles over the objections of the state's governor and mayor. The Posse Comitatus Act was passed by Congress in 1878 as Southern states worked to oust federal troops and end Reconstruction. Questions over how and whether troops can be used to enforce laws goes back to the pre-Civil War period, when federal marshals sought help from citizens and militiamen in recovering fugitive slaves and putting down the protests of abolitionists, according to the Congressional Research Service. It is not clear why Trump has not yet, as he has promised, called up the National Guard to patrol in Chicago, but he may be waiting for the Supreme Court, which has been extremely deferential to his claims of authority, to weigh in on a preliminary basis. But Congress has ceded some authority to locally elected officials in recent decades. After Vietnam, Congress overrode Richard Nixon's veto to pass another law, the War Powers Act of 1973, which requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of a military strike. And Trump did do that, at least his third such notification since taking office in January. Trump also sent notifications to Congress about his strike against an Iranian nuclear facility and Houthi rebels who were attacking shipping routes. The Reiss Center at New York University maintains a database of War Powers Act notifications going back to the 1970s. But Congress, which the Constitution puts in charge of declaring war, has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuelan drug cartels. “If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the US, would anyone even ask this question?” It's not yet clear which military unit was responsible for the strike, what intelligence suggested there were drugs onboard, who was on the boat or what the boat was carrying. “The decision to blow up the boat and kill everyone onboard when interdiction and detention was a clearly available option is manifestly illegal and immoral,” Oona Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges at Yale Law School, told me in an email. “I don't give a sh*t what you call it.” That's not an acceptable response even for some Republicans. “Did he ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?” wrote Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky in his own post on X. “Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation?? But that seems unlikely to occur at the moment. After the strike against Iran earlier this year, Paul was the only Republican senator to side with Democrats and demand Trump seek approval for any future Iran strikes. During his first term, seven Republicans voted with Senate Democrats to hem in Trump's ability to strike against Iran after he ordered the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. But there were not enough votes to overcome Trump's veto that year. Trump's authority to use military force without congressional approval of the Caribbean operation technically expires after 60 days after he reports on the use of force, although he can extend it by an additional 30 days, although he could also declare a new operation is underway. In February, Trump designated drug cartels, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, as foreign terror organizations. In April, CNN reported the CIA was reviewing whether it had authority to use lethal force against drug cartels. But the military strike against the alleged cartel boat happened as part of a broader campaign against Venezuela, including positioning US ships, aircraft and a submarine in the Caribbean, according to a CNN report. Trump may have campaigned as a president who would end wars, but he's governing like a president who is very comfortable using his military.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The national debate around crime and law-and-order politics has largely focused on America's biggest cities in blue states: Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, as well as the federal government's backyard of Washington, DC. But the unprovoked stabbing last month of a Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, has thrust the “Queen City” squarely into that conversation. The gruesome video of what police said was Decarlos Brown's random attack on Iryna Zarutska was released Friday and quickly sparked a wave of right-wing criticisms of Democratic-led cities and criminal justice reform policies. He spent more than five years behind bars for robbery with a dangerous weapon, state records show. Family members told CNN Brown, who is homeless, has a history of mental health struggles. Most recently, after a misdemeanor charge of misusing 911, he was released on the condition of a written promise he would appear for his next hearing, according to court records. The White House said his release left him “free to slaughter an innocent woman just months later.” Brown has been charged on the state level with first-degree murder for allegedly stabbing Zarutska. He was also charged federally Tuesday with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. CNN has reached out to Brown's attorney for comment. “We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence — he will never again see the light of day as a free man,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday he's investigating the possibility of cutting federal funding from the city's light rail system. President Donald Trump posted about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting Republican candidate in next year's closely watched Senate race. Right-wing politicians have long used horrific crime stories – particularly those featuring Black suspects and White victims – to make broader criticisms of Democrats as soft on crime. It's a playbook infamously honed in the “Willie Horton” campaign ad of the 1988 presidential race to attack presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. Is the opposite side let's allow murders on our light rail? According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, in the first half of this year, “Charlotte experienced a 25% reduction in violent crime, which includes homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults, encompassing shootings” compared with the same time period last year. And Charlotte does not cleanly fit the partisan attacks the White House has waged in Chicago, LA or New York. She faces a Republican and Libertarian in November, but the city has had a Democratic mayor for the past 16 years. “We, as a community, must do better for those members of our community who need help and have no place to go,” she wrote. Then her latest statement took a different tack and blamed courts and magistrates for allowing repeat offenders to remain on the streets. “We need a bipartisan solution to address repeat offenders who do not face consequences for their actions and those who cannot get treatment for their mental illness and are allowed to be on the street,” she wrote. Brown's mother told CNN affiliate WSOC the court should have never let her son be out in the community given his previous arrests and mental health issues. On the ground in Charlotte, residents spoke to CNN about their safety concerns in light of the attack even as they questioned whether more security could have prevented it. Zarutska was stabbed in Charlotte's South End, a neighborhood transformed into an area of high-end apartments, restaurants, shops and breweries — fueled by the 2007 debut of the light rail system. Unlike extensive transit systems in New York or Chicago, the Charlotte Area Transit System, known as CATS, has a more limited area. It consists of a bus system, north-south blue line light rail and an east-west gold line street car, with proposed plans for further expansion. “As a native of Charlotte, I'm so sad to say that our city has gotten to this place,” Ferguson, the US Attorney, said Tuesday in announcing federal charges. Channing Chasco said he doesn't really ride the light rail in Charlotte. He said he believes the national reaction to the killing stems from a mix of political opportunity and real concern about safety. “I didn't realize it was making national coverage,” he said. Since the attack, she and her boyfriend have grown “more aware” and “feel uneasy,” she said, adding she often sees homeless people hanging out at train stops but usually tries to avoid places they congregate. Dean takes early morning runs, and “as a small, 28-year-old blonde girl,” she said she is more aware of her surrounding since the stabbing. Dean takes early morning runs, and since the stabbing she's been more aware of her surroundings and habits in public, like wearing headphones, she said. Amy, who only wanted her first name used, told CNN she rides the light rail to work every day. “I feel uncomfortable now, since it happened,” she said. “Before, the light rail was my choice, but now I think about just driving and parking since it happened.” “Maybe they should do some more safety, fare checks. But maybe more checks would make you feel safer,” Amy said. She also acknowledged that after seeing video of the stabbing that she isn't sure what police could have done in the moment to stop it. Sheryl, who did not want to give her last name, told CNN she can't stop thinking about the killing. I don't have anything against Trump, but he's overstepping his power by doing things like sending the National Guard to cities. I think he's talking about this tragedy here for political reasons, too,” she said. CNN's Stephen Watts, Holly Yan, Sara Smart, Zoe Sottile and Mia Blackman contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justice Brett Kavanaugh's breezy suggestion this week that Americans who are roughed up by ICE can sue agents in federal court is drawing pushback from civil rights attorneys who note the Supreme Court's conservative majority has in recent years made those cases nearly impossible to win. Writing to explain the court's emergency ruling Monday that allowed the Trump administration to continue “roving” immigration patrols in Southern California, Kavanaugh brushed aside concerns that masked ICE agents had pushed, shoved and detained Hispanics – in one instance throwing a US citizen against a fence and confiscating his phone. “To the extent that excessive force has been used,” Kavanaugh wrote in a 10-page concurrence, “the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action, and remedies should be available in federal court.” Gorsuch and Kavanaugh warn lower court judges in Trump cases Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said that it can be incredibly difficult for a person subjected to excessive force to find an attorney and take on the federal government in court. The question for the Supreme Court was whether an agent could rely on factors like a person's apparent ethnicity, language or their presence at a particular location, to establish reasonable suspicion. A US district court in July ordered the Department of Homeland Security to discontinue the practice of making initial stops based on those factors. “The government, and now the concurrence, has all but declared that all Latinos, US citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents' satisfaction,” wrote Sotomayor, joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Jason Gavidia, a US citizen, was approached in June by masked agents who repeatedly questioned his citizenship status, pressing him to name the hospital in which he was born, according to court records. When he could not answer that question, he said, agents racked a rifle, took his phone and pushed him up against a metal fence. Another US citizen, Jorge Viramontes, was grabbed and escorted by agents into a vehicle and held in a “warehouse area” for further questioning, according to court documents. Richard Re, a Harvard Law professor, viewed Kavanaugh's remark in the opinion differently. Maybe, Re wrote on Tuesday, Kavanaugh was attempting to signal something about where he thinks the law should go. “When you have an important sentence that's very ambiguous, it's usually deliberately so,” Re, who clerked for Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge, told CNN. “I think it's not clear what to make of that remark,” Re said. “It could suggest a genuine interest, on at least one pivotal justice's part, in revitalizing Fourth Amendment remediation.” The court has for years been limiting the ability of people who face excessive force to sue federal agents, litigation that proponents say can act as a check on such behavior. Supreme Court to hear arguments over Trump's ‘Liberation Day' tariffs Americans may also sue the government for damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, if its employees engage in wrongdoing or negligence. But federal courts have carved out a complicated patchwork of exceptions to that law as well. Kavanaugh's opinion came as the court has faced sharp criticism in some quarters for deciding a slew of emergency cases in Trump's favor without any explanation. The Supreme Court has consistently sided with Trump recently, overturning lower courts' temporary orders and allowing the president to fire the leadership of independent agencies, cut spending authorized by Congress and pursue an aggressive crackdown on immigration while litigation continues in lower courts. Those emergency cases don't fully resolve the legal questions at hand – and the court is often hesitant to write opinions that could influence the final outcome of a case – but they can have enormous, real-world consequences. Emergency cases are almost always handled without oral argument and are addressed on a much tighter deadline than the court's regular merits cases. What he didn't explain, several experts note, is how a violation of those rights could be vindicated. “Sincerely wondering,” University of Chicago law professor William Baude posted on social media, “what remedies does Justice Kavanaugh believe are and should be available in federal court these days for excessive force violations by federal immigration officials?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump discredited the Epstein letter that showed his alleged signature and slammed Israel's strike on Qatar during a trip to Joe's Seafood in Washington on Tuesday evening. He said he was “not thrilled” about the strike and said the letter is “nonsense.” The Epstein estate recently released a letter from Trump to convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein on his birthday. The letter shows Trump telling Epstein that they had certain things “in common.” And frankly, you're wasting your time,” he told reporters. The House Oversight Committee's release of the letter has stirred up more speculation about Trump's relationship with Epstein. The attack reportedly infuriated Trump advisers who wanted to negotiate peace in Gaza. He also called the Qatari emir and prime minister to say such an attack would not occur in the future. Trump said Tuesday evening that Israel did not tell him in advance but that he's not “surprised by anything.” “I'm never surprised by anything, especially when it comes to the Middle East,” he added. They yelled phrases such as “Free Palestine” and “Free D.C.,” also calling Trump the “Hitler of our time.” Vice President JD Vance stopped to greet one patron and smiled.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal grand jury in Washington declined to indict a lawyer accused of threatening National Guard troops patrolling the city as part of President Donald Trump's federal crime surge, adding to a growing list of felony rejections facing U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office. Paul Anthony Bryant, a West Point and Columbia Law School graduate, was arrested on Aug. 24 after allegedly shouting “I'll kill you” and slamming his shoulder into a Guardsman. Prosecutors charged him with threatening a federal official and making threats to injure — felonies carrying maximum penalties of 10 and 20 years. His attorney called the case “baseless” and said there is no video evidence due to National Guard troops not wearing body cameras. The grand jury's no true bill is at least the eighth felony case rejected since Trump's federal takeover of Washington law enforcement, prompting concerns of jury nullification. Pirro has warned of a “politicized jury,” noting jurors previously declined to indict those who threatened to assassinate the president and assaulted federal agents. Prosecutors could now ask a magistrate judge at Bryant's Wednesday hearing to find probable cause and re-present the case to another grand jury. Alternatively, they may file misdemeanor charges, which do not require grand jury approval. Bryant, who carried a legally owned firearm at the time of his arrest, was not charged with any gun-related offenses. Neither Pirro's office nor Bryant's legal team responded to requests for comment.</p>
