                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a no-brainer that patients are on the internet, and it's not all funny cat videos, restaurant recommendations, and career-related searches. “Patients often arrive having researched symptoms online or even self-diagnosed. They may cite TikTok, something they read on Facebook, or medical websites,” said Victor Ajluni, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University and emergency psychiatrist at Detroit Receiving Hospital, both in Detroit, Michigan. “It's a shift from passive reception of care to active engagement. However, accompanying that autonomy can be patient anxiety and uncertainty. For example, the Female Physician Career Tracks Report 2024 found that “Patient autonomy is the principle that patients have the right to make informed choices about their own healthcare,” Ajluni told Medscape Medical News. True autonomy is informed, supported, and situated in a relationship of trust.” “The historical way of practicing medicine in the 50s, 60s, and 70s was very authoritarian…but the medical establishment realized that patients do better and are more compliant when they're involved in their medical decision-making,” said Brandon Hirsch, MD , a board-certified, dual fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon at Disc Sports and Spine Center in Newport Beach, California, who started his practice in 2019. “I want patients to be invested in the decision because I think it leads to more satisfied patients and better outcomes. There may also be aspects of correcting misinformation, easing anxiety, talking patients down, or convincing them they don't have or need something that their online information has convinced them they do. Asking open-ended questions and listening to the answers can provide insight into your patient. “For example, if the patient asks, ‘what is recovery like after surgery?' I'll say, ‘tell me specifically what you mean by that,'” said Hirsch. “There is an acquired skill to building rapport and getting them [patients] to trust you,” said Brian T. Garibaldi , MD, MEHP, director, Center for Bedside Medicine, and a professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “There's no substitute to sitting down and saying, ‘tell me what's important to you…' or ‘what are you most concerned with? “It really does come down to making the most of your time and directing attention to who is this person as an individual, not only what is the disease and what is the disease process.” There can also be a downside to being well informed. “Many patients feel overwhelmed, not reassured, by what they find online. I also name the dynamic — telling patients that anxiety tends to escalate when we try to self-diagnose from fragmented or extreme online content. “Being dismissive is the worst thing you can do,” agreed Hirsch. “You need to validate their concerns and address them.” Patient autonomy doesn't mean acquiescing when a patient demands a treatment that you know to be harmful or that is against the standard of care. But in many cases, there is not one “right” option. “Even as far as we've advanced in the last 100 years in terms of diagnostics and treatment, there is a still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to complex medical decision-making,” said Garibaldi. “We've started to talk openly about that with trainees and with patients…the only way to make a decision is to engage the patient, understand their goals and values, understand how they weigh the risks and benefits....” Make sure that when you're making diagnoses and choosing treatment options, you remember that the ‘right' answer depends on who the person is. “Early in training, I thought clinical authority meant always having the right answer and steering patients firmly. But I've learned that real authority comes from humility and dialogue,” said Ajluni. “Autonomy isn't about letting patients ‘do whatever they want' — it's about making decisions together in a context of respect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a move that could reshape drug discovery, researchers at Harvard Medical School have designed an artificial intelligence model capable of identifying treatments that reverse disease states in cells. Unlike traditional approaches that typically test one protein target or drug at a time in hopes of identifying an effective treatment, the new model, called PDGrapher and available for free, focuses on multiple drivers of disease and identifies the genes most likely to revert diseased cells back to healthy function. Marinka Zitnik, study senior author, associate professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS The traditional drug-discovery approach - which focuses on activating or inhibiting a single protein - has succeeded with treatments such as kinase inhibitors, drugs that block certain proteins used by cancer cells to grow and divide. However, Zitnik noted, this discovery paradigm can fall short when diseases are fueled by the interplay of multiple signaling pathways and genes. For example, many breakthrough drugs discovered in recent decades - think immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapies - work by targeting disease processes in cells. The approach enabled by PDGrapher, Zitnik said, looks at the bigger picture to find compounds that can actually reverse signs of disease in cells, even if scientists don't yet know exactly which molecules those compounds may be acting on. This tool doesn't just look at individual data points but at the connections that exist between these data points and the effects they have on one another. Instead of exhaustively testing compounds from large drug databases, the new model focuses on drug combinations that are most likely to reverse disease. PDGrapher points to parts of the cell that might be driving disease. Next, it simulates what happens if these cellular parts were turned off or dialed down. The AI model then offers an answer as to whether a diseased cell would happen if certain targets were "hit." "Instead of testing every possible recipe, PDGrapher asks: 'Which mix of ingredients will turn this bland or overly salty dish into a perfectly balanced meal?'" The researchers trained the tool on a dataset of diseased cells before and after treatment so that it could figure out which genes to target to shift cells from a diseased state to a healthy one. Next, they tested it on 19 datasets spanning 11 types of cancer, using both genetic and drug-based experiments, asking the tool to predict various treatment options for cell samples it had not seen before and for cancer types it had not encountered. The model also highlighted KDR (VEGFR2) as a target for non-small cell lung cancer, aligning with clinical evidence. It also identified TOP2A - an enzyme already targeted by approved chemotherapies - as a treatment target in certain tumors, adding to evidence from recent preclinical studies that TOP2A inhibition may be used to curb the spread of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer. The model showed superior accuracy and efficiency, compared with other similar tools. In previously unseen datasets, it ranked the correct therapeutic targets up to 35 percent higher than other models did and delivered results up to 25 times faster than comparable AI approaches. This makes it faster to test ideas and lets researchers focus on fewer promising targets. This tool could be especially useful for complex diseases fueled by multiple pathways, such as cancer, in which tumors can outsmart drugs that hit just one target. Because PDGrapher identifies multiple targets involved in a disease, it could help circumvent this problem. Additionally, the researchers said that after careful testing to validate the model, it could one day be used to analyze a patient's cellular profile and help design individualized treatment combinations. Finally, because PDGrapher identifies cause-effect biological drivers of disease, it could help researchers understand why certain drug combinations work - offering new biological insights that could propel biomedical discovery even further. The team is currently using this model to tackle brain diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, looking at how cells behave in disease and spotting genes that could help restore them to health. The researchers are also collaborating with colleagues at the Center for XDP at Massachusetts General Hospital to identify new drug targets and map which genes or pairs of genes could be affected by treatments for X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism, a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UK trial shows drones can deliver defibrillators faster than ambulances, but survival depends on better dispatcher guidance and bystander confidence in using the life-saving devices. Study: The use of drone-delivered Automated External Defibrillators in the emergency response for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Drones can capture breathtaking photos, patrol and monitor sensitive or dangerous areas, and deliver medical equipment or medication. One such use is to provide automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to help resuscitate cardiac arrest patients before they reach the hospital. Nine out of ten people who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) die before being discharged from the hospital or within 30 days of the arrest. The chances of survival and of neurological recovery are doubled if bystanders can provide prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use an automated external defibrillator (AED) to get the heart beating again. The issues with bystander AED defibrillation include not being able to find, access, and retrieve an AED from a public location. In an earlier study, only 5%- 22% of people knew where to find the nearest public AED. Many AEDs are difficult to reach (up to 59%), and only 3%- 25% of OHCAs occur in the vicinity of an AED. The authors of the current study have already demonstrated these aspects in their earlier research. The researchers simulated an OHCA scene beginning with a call to 999 for emergency help. This was followed by the dispatch of a drone that could perform autonomous flight “Beyond Visual Line of Sight” (BVLOS) to the location of interest. Participants were recruited for the capability to perform CPR or use an AED outdoors, but recent training varied, and many struggled with AED use. Only 64% had CPR training in the past five years, and just 36% had AED training. The experience was assessed using video recordings, audio recordings of the emergency call, and post-simulation interviews. a) drone at remote site with AED loaded, b) emergency call made (study team member shown), c) drone on-scene winching AED to ground, d) drone departs and bystander informed it is safe to retrieve AED on ground. An AED was delivered on nine occasions by drones. The median simulation time was 9:13 minutes, from placing the emergency call to resuming CPR after delivering an AED shock. This meant a hands-off period (when the patient did not receive CPR) of 2:32 minutes. Of this, 16 seconds went to retrieving and bringing back the device. Participants sometimes found it hard to hear the call handler clearly, especially as the drone approached. Bystanders felt the AED winch was too slow and unnecessarily prolonged the wait for AED use. Conflicting AED and call handler instructions created serious problems. The call handlers did not provide instructions specific to the device or monitor correct AED use. The bystanders did not hesitate to retrieve the drone, but were often not confident about using it. The study showed that autonomous BVLOS flights of an AED-carrying drone to a simulated OHCA scene are feasible. However, bystanders often struggle to manage the call handler's instructions and CPR. This led to a total CPR stoppage of 2.32 minutes. “Bystanders and call-handlers need more support to effectively use drone-delivered AEDs.” This aspect of call-handler training should receive as much or more attention as AED delivery itself. Call-handlers are often unsure how far CPR may be paused and how to help the bystanders use the AED. The authors focused on a single-bystander scenario; given that only 16 seconds were spent away from the patients to fetch the AED, this use case may be acceptable. Most importantly, studies must show that such interventions improve patient survival. Further research is needed in multiple fields, including how to integrate drone-delivered medical equipment into local emergency medical services and script responses for a more standardized help protocol, especially considering the need to guide bystanders in AED use. Key limitations include operational challenges such as weather and technical cancellations, connectivity failures that forced the auto-returns, and the slow AED winch design. Regulatory approval and safety oversight, such as from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, will remain essential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neurological diseases affect millions worldwide, and the need for long-term patient-friendly treatments has never been greater. Microneedles-which are tiny, micron-sized needle systems- have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional needles and offer a pain free way to deliver medicines. However, most existing microneedles are rigid and can cause discomfort during prolonged use and therefore limits their adoption in long-term use. To overcome this, researchers from South Korea have designed a new microneedles system inspired by the natural mechanism of a bee sting. Led by Professor Wonku Kang and colleague Dr. Sohee Jeon from the College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University in collaboration with Dr. Jun-Ho Jeong from College of Medicine at Chung-Ang University, the team introduces wearable "Electrospun Web Microneedle (EW-MNs)" based patches which enable long-term and continuous drug delivery through the skin. The study was made available online in Advanced Healthcare Materials on July 31, 2025. Unlike traditional rigid microneedles, which can cause irritation during prolonged use, our EW-MNs are soft, breathable, and remain anchored to the skin just like a bee stinger." Professor Wonku Kang, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University To fabricate the EW-MNs, the researchers used an electrospinning process (a technique that uses an electric field to spin very fine polymer fibers) to create a web of nanoscale fibers on metal microneedles. Importantly, all this was achieved while maintaining minimum discomfort, and even if any mild skin irritation occurred, it disappeared quickly on removing the patch. Emphasizing on the impact of this technology, Prof. Kang says "With further development, these EW-MNs could revolutionize drug delivery, allowing patients to receive effective long-term treatments without the fear or discomfort of needles!" This approach also holds value for elderly patients, children and cases where safety and patient compliant treatments are urgently needed. Overall, the study demonstrates a perfect example of how nature can drive innovations, bringing us one step closer towards safer, more comfortable, and patient-friendly drug delivery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using tiny particles shaped like bottlebrushes, MIT chemists have found a way to deliver a large range of chemotherapy drugs directly to tumor cells. This antibody is tethered to bottlebrush-shaped polymer chains carrying dozens or hundreds of drug molecules - a much larger payload than can be delivered by any existing antibody-drug conjugates. In mouse models of breast and ovarian cancer, the researchers found that treatment with these conjugated particles could eliminate most tumors. We are excited about the potential to open up a new landscape of payloads and payload combinations with this technology, that could ultimately provide more effective therapies for cancer patients." At least 15 ADCs have been approved by the FDA to treat several different types of cancer. This approach allows specific targeting of a cancer drug to a tumor, which helps to prevent some of the side effects that occur when chemotherapy drugs are given intravenously. However, one drawback to currently approved ADCs is that only a handful of drug molecules can be attached to each antibody. That means they can only be used with very potent drugs - usually DNA-damaging agents or drugs that interfere with cell division. These particles consist of a polymer backbone that are attached to tens to hundreds of "prodrug" molecules - inactive drug molecules that are activated upon release within the body. This structure allows the particles to deliver a wide range of drug molecules, and the particles can be designed to carry multiple drugs in specific ratios. Using a technique called click chemistry, the researchers showed that they could attach one, two, or three of their bottlebrush polymers to a single tumor-targeting antibody, creating an antibody-bottlebrush conjugate (ABC). This means that just one antibody can carry hundreds of prodrug molecules. The currently approved ADCs can carry a maximum of about eight drug molecules. "We can use antibody-bottlebrush conjugates to increase the drug loading, and in that case, we can use less potent drugs," Liu says. "In the future, we can very easily copolymerize with multiple drugs together to achieve combination therapy." Other particles are absorbed into cells with the target antibody before releasing their toxic payload. They also designed ABC particles carrying an experimental type of drug known as PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera), which can selectively degrade disease-causing proteins inside cells. Each bottlebrush was tethered to an antibody targeting either HER2, a protein often overexpressed in breast cancer, or MUC1, which is commonly found in ovarian, lung, and other types of cancer. This treatment was significantly more effective than giving the same bottlebrush prodrugs by injection, without being conjugated to a targeting antibody. "We used a very low dose, almost 100 times lower compared to the traditional small-molecule drug, and the ABC still can achieve much better efficacy compared to the small-molecule drug given on its own," Liu says. These ABCs also performed better than two FDA-approved ADCs, T-DXd and TDM-1, which both use HER2 to target cells. In future work, the MIT team plans to try delivering combinations of drugs that work by different mechanisms, which could enhance their overall effectiveness. Among these could be immunotherapy drugs such as STING activators. The researchers are also working on swapping in different antibodies, such as antibodies targeting EGFR, which is widely expressed in many tumors. Liu, B., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this study, Federica Grosso, Daniela Zanetti, and Serena Sanna from the Institute for Genetic and Biomedical Research (IRGB) of the National Research Council (CNR), Italy, uncovered new associations between gut microbiome and the aging process. These findings could help explain how age-related diseases like cardiovascular conditions and macular degeneration are influenced by changes in the gut ecosystem. As people age, this microbial community shifts, often leading to imbalances associated with inflammation and chronic disease. To explore how these changes might affect the body, the researchers used Mendelian Randomization-a method that leverages genetic data-to test over 55,000 possible causal connections between gut microbial characteristics and age-related health indicators. Another finding was the association between a metabolic pathway in the gut, called "purine nucleotides degradation II," and lower levels of apolipoprotein M (ApoM), a protein that helps protect against heart disease. This result was validated using data from an independent study, strengthening the evidence. "Unlike previous studies, we performed replication analyses for the significant results using independent GWAS datasets, a fundamental step that has often been overlooked." The study also revealed how some bacteria may affect protein levels differently depending on a person's blood type. Specifically, in individuals with blood type A, certain gut microbes that can break down a sugar called GalNAc may influence proteins related to inflammation and cardiovascular health. This suggests that personalized approaches to managing age-related diseases could consider both gut microbiota and genetic factors like blood type. The research team followed strict guidelines to reduce false findings and confirmed its key results in independent datasets. By carefully testing for reverse causality and other biases, the authors provided strong evidence that the gut microbiome can influence critical aspects of aging biology. Although more research is needed to fully understand the biological pathways involved, these findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiota might help delay or reduce age-related inflammation and disease. The study lays a foundation for future therapeutic strategies that could include diet, probiotics, or other microbiome-based interventions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preliminary findings from a new clinical trial show no adverse neurodevelopmental effects after brief inhaled anesthesia and surgery in infants and young children, reports the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the peer-reviewed medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). A "balanced" strategy using a lower dose of the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane did not lead to meaningful short-term differences in IQ or child behavior problems, according to the study by Ji-Hyun Lee, M.D., Ph.D., of Seoul National University Hospital, Republic of Korea, and colleagues. "These findings support existing evidence suggesting that brief anesthetic exposure is unlikely to result in clinically significant neurodevelopmental impairment," the researchers wrote. Animal studies have raised concerns about possible neurotoxic effects of general anesthetic or sedative drugs in young children. Randomized clinical trials – in which participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups – are the best way to assess these safety concerns. One previous randomized trial (the GAS study) found normal neurodevelopmental outcomes in children receiving sevoflurane. However, that study was published several years ago and evaluated an alternative approach (awake regional anesthesia) that is not widely available. To address this research gap, Dr. Lee and colleagues designed a clinical trial including 400 children under two years of age undergoing one-time surgery with general anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to anesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane alone or a balanced strategy using an intravenous sedative (dexmedetomidine) and a short-acting opioid (remifentanil). In both groups, anesthesia exposure was brief, with surgery lasting less than 90 minutes. When the patients were approximately 30 months old, the researchers assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes using a nonverbal intelligence test and a parent-reported child behavior scale. Overall IQ and behavioral scores were similar between the groups. Although the balanced approach "effectively reduced sevoflurane requirements during surgery, it did not provide measurable developmental advantages," Dr. Lee and coauthors wrote. In the meantime, the findings provide reassurance that one-time general anesthesia does not adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and young children who require surgery. The new study is "a welcome and important addition" in an area where definitive evidence is difficult to obtain, according to an accompanying editorial by Andrew Davidson, MBBS, M.D., and Caleb Ing, M.D., MS. They discuss the challenges of studying this complex issue – including the fact that children who require surgery may have other health issues affecting neurodevelopmental outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes around 70% of head and neck cancers in the United States, making it the most common cancer caused by the virus, with rates increasing each year. This means that patients are usually diagnosed after a tumor has grown to billions of cells in size, causing symptoms and spreading to lymph nodes. In a new federally funded study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Mass General Brigham researchers show that a novel liquid biopsy tool they developed, called HPV-DeepSeek, can identify HPV-associated head and neck cancer up to 10 years before symptoms appear. By catching cancers earlier with this novel test, patients may experience higher treatment success and require a less intense regimen, according to the authors. Our study shows for the first time that we can accurately detect HPV-associated cancers in asymptomatic individuals many years before they are ever diagnosed with cancer. By the time patients enter our clinics with symptoms from the cancer, they require treatments that cause significant, life-long side effects. We hope tools like HPV-DeepSeek will allow us to catch these cancers at their very earliest stages, which ultimately can improve patient outcomes and quality of life." HPV-DeepSeek uses whole-genome sequencing to detect microscopic fragments of HPV DNA that have broken off from a tumor and entered the bloodstream. Previous research from this team showed the test could achieve 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity for diagnosing cancer at the first time of presentation to a clinic, outperforming current testing methods. To determine whether HPV-DeepSeek could detect HPV-associated head and neck cancer long before diagnosis, researchers tested 56 samples from the Mass General Brigham Biobank: 28 from individuals who went on to develop HPV-associated head and neck cancer years later, and 28 from healthy controls. HPV-DeepSeek detected HPV tumor DNA in 22 out of 28 blood samples from patients who later developed the cancer, whereas all 28 control samples tested negative, indicating that the test is highly specific. Using machine learning, the researchers were able to improve the test's power so that it accurately identified 27 out of 28 cancer cases, including samples collected up to 10 years prior to diagnosis. The authors are now validating these findings in a second blinded study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) using hundreds of samples collected as part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) at the National Cancer Institute.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Animal studies suggest CoQ10 protects memory and learning, but human evidence remains inconsistent, highlighting the urgent need for rigorous trials to determine its role in preventing cognitive decline. CoQ10 is most concentrated in energy-demanding organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, where up to 95% of the body's energy needs are met through its mitochondrial role. In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, Australian researchers reviewed the effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on cognition. Approximately 22% of the world's population is estimated to be 60 years or older by 2050. Accompanying this change will be an increase in people with cognitive decline and the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. The causes of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline are multifactorial, but the major contributors are oxidative stress, inflammation, poor cardiovascular health, decreased cerebral blood flow, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These multiple processes in the body and brain require various targeted therapeutic approaches. Various approaches to addressing age-related cognitive decline have been employed, including dietary modifications, physical activity, medications, and nutritional supplements. CoQ10 is an antioxidant and metabolic stimulant that positively influences biological mechanisms relevant to cognition, with mixed effects on cognitive test performance in trials. The molecule exists in three redox states, ubiquinone, semiquinone, and ubiquinol, which allow it to act both as an electron carrier in energy production and as a free radical scavenger. CoQ10 plays a major role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by transporting electrons from Complexes I and II to Complex III in the electron transport chain. Its bioavailability differs between formulations such as ubiquinone and ubiquinol, which may influence clinical outcomes. In a clinical trial, preoperative CoQ10 therapy in patients scheduled for an elective heart surgery increased cardiac and myocardial mitochondrial CoQ10 levels, improving the efficiency of energy production. A meta-analysis of trials of CoQ10 treatment in heart failure indicated that CoQ10 supplementation enhanced ejection fraction by 3.67% and reduced the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class by 0.3. A study reported that long-term CoQ10 therapy was safe, alleviated symptoms, and reduced adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic heart failure. Dietary sources such as organ meats, fatty fish, and seed oils are rich in CoQ10, while vegetables and fruits generally contain much lower amounts, with avocado being a notable exception. Although no significant performance improvements were observed in a test measuring learning and spatial memory, CoQ10 levels were significantly elevated within the cortex. Another study examined the combined effects of CoQ10 and vitamin E, and found benefits of the combination treatment on learning in aged mice. In a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CoQ10 therapy improved memory, retention, and learning, with substantial decreases in oxidative stress and increases in ATP levels within the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. One study examined the relationship between AD and CoQ10 in genetically modified mice and found that CoQ10 administration altered the expression of 12 proteins in the hippocampus and improved spatial memory in genetically modified mice with AD. Specifically, the overexpression of complexin 1 (CPLX-1) and CPLX-2 following CoQ10 therapy prevented memory impairments. Furthermore, CoQ10 therapy significantly improved cognitive functions in a double-transgenic mouse model, preventing AD progression through decreased inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as the activation of autophagy. CoQ10 supplementation improved short-term memory impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, and the effect was further enhanced in combination with wheatgrass, sesamol, and thymol. Although widely sold as a dietary supplement, CoQ10 is not FDA-approved for treating any medical condition, and product quality can vary significantly between brands. Research on the cognitive effects of CoQ10 supplements in healthy people is limited, with only two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted to date. Cerebral blood flow was significantly increased during cognitive tasks in the treatment group, albeit task performance showed no changes. Notably, people who were cognitively normal at baseline showed significant improvements in MPI following 34 weeks of ubiquinol supplementation. The review emphasized that these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to dose, formulation, and statistical limitations. Furthermore, RCTs of the combined CoQ10 and vitamin E treatment reported no improvements in cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's disease. One study reported that CoQ10 supplementation improved cognitive function, reduced fatigue symptoms, enhanced working memory, and improved arithmetic task performance in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. In a study of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, CoQ10 administration improved cognitive tasks involving the frontal lobe. These null effects may be attributed to insufficient statistical power and small sample sizes rather than the absence of an effect. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiny particles in polluted air trigger lung damage, chronic disease, and early deaths, making cleaner air a critical global health priority. Air pollution accounts for about 4.7 million premature deaths annually and contributes to nearly 8 percent of global disability-adjusted life years, placing it above smoking, obesity, and high cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor. Review: Particulate matter air pollution: effects on the respiratory system. In a recent review article in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers Robert B. Hamanaka and Gökhan M. Mutlu at The University of Chicago, USA, synthesized toxicological studies and epidemiological evidence to explain how particulate matter (PM) causes impaired lung function, inflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby contributing to both chronic and acute respiratory illnesses. Their conclusions sharpen the main message: particulate air pollution is a major environmental health risk and a significant cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality, with most excess deaths being cardiovascular, highlighting the urgent need for stricter air quality standards and effective public health interventions. Children's lungs are especially vulnerable, with long-term exposure stunting lung growth and leaving deficits that persist into adulthood. Air pollution contains both gaseous components and PM. Gases include sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂), ozone (O₃), and carbon monoxide (CO). PM is classified by size: PM10 (coarse), mainly originating from natural and industrial sources, typically remains in the upper airways; PM2.5 (fine) and PM0.1 (ultrafine or nanoparticles), primarily produced by fossil fuel combustion, penetrate deeply into the lungs, posing greater health risks. Sulfur dioxide from coal burning has decreased globally, but indoor biomass burning for cooking and heating remains a concern in developing regions. Because pollutants are often co-produced, isolating individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, PM2.5 is consistently linked to adverse cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, prompting regulation under frameworks such as the U.S. Clean Air Act. Extensive studies confirmed associations between PM exposure and mortality, with a biphasic response showing stronger effects at lower concentrations. Cohort studies confirm no safe threshold exists; even low-level PM exposure increases health risks, with mortality associations persisting below current guideline values and observed down to ~4 µg/m³. Temporary decreases during the 2008 Beijing Olympics reduced biomarkers of inflammation, and lockdowns for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also demonstrated rapid health benefits. However, wildfire smoke is now increasingly influencing annual PM2.5 averages, and events such as the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster underscore the persistent and emerging threats from acute, high-intensity particulate exposure. Studies show that vanadium and other transition metals in particulate matter are among the most toxic components, strongly associated with both mortality and lung cancer incidence. Air pollution is a significant contributor to respiratory illnesses and deaths, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) consistently linked to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Large-scale studies show that even modest increases in PM2.5 are associated with higher risks of respiratory hospitalizations and mortality, with no safe threshold identified. People with asthma are particularly vulnerable, as exposure worsens symptoms, increases emergency visits, and is strongly linked to new-onset asthma in children and has been associated with epigenetic changes such as FOXP3 hypermethylation. Evidence from long-term cohorts, such as the Southern California Children's Health Study, also shows reduced lung function growth in highly polluted areas. In COPD, air pollution accelerates disease progression, impairs lung function, and heightens the likelihood of hospital admission and death, while also contributing to new cases beyond smoking-related risks through oxidative stress pathways. Studies further reveal that PM2.5 worsens outcomes in pulmonary fibrosis, accelerating lung function decline and mortality, and drives lung cancer progression via IL-1β–mediated expansion of mutated cells, including in nonsmokers. Among lung transplant patients, higher exposure levels are linked with chronic lung allograft dysfunction, reduced survival, and greater mortality, underscoring the pervasive respiratory impact of air pollution. Policy-driven air quality improvements deliver rapid health benefits, with declines in hospital admissions and mortality observed within months of pollution controls being enacted. This leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines, systemic immune responses, and oxidative injury, contributing to diseases like asthma, COPD, fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer through persistent epithelial injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor, as PM accumulates in mitochondria, alters energy metabolism, and amplifies ROS production. These effects impair lung regeneration, promote epithelial injury, and disrupt mucociliary clearance, weakening defenses against pathogens and promoting fibrosis via IL-6–dependent pathways. Chronic exposure may also induce premature cell aging (senescence) and fibrosis. Additionally, air pollution causes epigenetic changes, such as global DNA hypomethylation and histone modifications, that influence long-term respiratory health. Finally, PM particles may act as carriers for viruses, enhancing deep lung deposition of pathogens. The central message is clear: air pollution remains a major, modifiable risk factor for respiratory disease, with no level of exposure proven to be safe. Effective emission reductions and health mitigation strategies are vital. A deeper mechanistic understanding of how pollutants damage tissues is essential, with new single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic tools offering promise for advancing this knowledge. Improved pollutant measurement techniques, such as satellite monitoring, low-cost sensor networks, and land-use regression models, will enhance exposure assessments and improve the accuracy of environmental monitoring. Identifying the most toxic components of particulate matter, like transition metals (e.g., vanadium), will inform targeted policies. These advances are especially critical for protecting children, older adults, and low-income populations who bear disproportionate burdens.
