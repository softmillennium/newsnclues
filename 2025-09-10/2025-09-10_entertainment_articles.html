                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA and one of the most influential activists on the right, has died after being shot at a Utah rally today, President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform. Trump wrote, “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Kirk, one of the most prominent social media influencers and podcasters on the right, also was credited with mobilizing young voters for Trump's reelection bid. He was on a tour of college campuses, the latest being an appearance at Utah Valley University. Video of the shooting showed Kirk speaking at a large outdoor event on university grounds. Then, he lurched backward as blood poured from his neck. The messages had a common theme: At a time of deep division in the country, violence has no place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle chairman and co-founder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Global's new owner David Ellison and a major investor in the media company after its merger with Skydance, just saw his wealth soar by over $100 billion. The company reported stellar earnings late Tuesday with a massive backlog of contracts for its Cloud business that seeming to ensure its pole position in the AI market and pushed the shares up by more than 40%. It has Tesla founder Musk's wealth at $385 billion. Paramount Communications Exec Justin Dini Departing In Wake Of Skydance Deal Elon Musk's SpaceX Spending $17B To Acquire Wireless Spectrum From Dish Network Parent EchoStar Musk became the world's richest person in 2021 before losing the title to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and LVMH's Bernard Arnault. The holdings of all are largely in stock and wealth stats numbers can fluctuate from hour to hour with share prices. Bellwether Forbes still had Musk in the lead at $437 billion. Oracle shares are up 35% at about $325, off a high today of $346. David Ellison has said he and his father are close and speak daily and that the Oracle connection could certainly be tapped to bring more of a tech focus to Paramount Global, which now has some very deep pockets behind it. Ellison, who is close to President Donald Trump, has been floated as suitor for TikTok if it sells its U.S. operations. The Forbes real-time billionaires list has, from nos. 3 to 10, Mark Zuckerberg, Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jensen Huang, Steve Ballmer, Arnault and Warren Buffett.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Margaret Josephs is celebrating her beloved mother in style. The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star shared a loving tribute to Marge Sr. on Instagram as her mom turned 79, posting a playful video of the pair dressed in glamorous evening gowns. “Happy birthday to this legend, my hilarious, glamorous, unfiltered, loving, generous, mighty fine at 79 mommy,” Josephs wrote. “This video epitomizes our relationship, the best banter with warmth and affection any duo could ever have! The post quickly drew comments from Josephs' fellow Housewives. Danielle Cabral added, “Happy birthday to THE FABULOUS [Marge Sr.].” In that Aug. 18 clip, both were dressed to the nines while Josephs added the text: “Just know if you've ever done me wrong, my mom knows. Marge Sr. became a fan favorite when she first appeared alongside her daughter in Season 8 of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” Known for her wit and free-spirited nature, she often lightened tense moments on the show with her humor. During her first season, Josephs explained how unconventional their mother-daughter relationship has always been. “Marge Sr. is an out of control party girl,” Josephs said in a confessional. Their dynamic has also caught the attention of Bravo host Andy Cohen, who ranked Marge Sr. among his “top five housewife moms of all time” during a January 2022 episode of “Watch What Happens Live.” He credited her with introducing him “to the concept of mommy and me facelifts.” As Josephs continues to share snippets of her bond with her mother on social media, fans are reminded of the warmth, humor, and resilience that define their relationship. Whether through candid confessions on Bravo or stylish Instagram posts, the duo has become one of the franchise's most memorable mother-daughter pairs.</p>

In Prime Video's “The Girlfriend,” the choice is as grueling as possible, pitting Daniel (Laurie Davidson) between his girlfriend Cherry (Olivia Cooke) and mother Laura (Robin Wright). From the outside, Laura could be loving, protective, overbearing, even intrusive — while Cherry sows doubt for hiding pieces of her past despite ostensibly adoring her new beau. On paper, it could be any soapy summer read or weekend binge, but the limited series manages to hit the exact tonal sweet spot for this kind of story. Like the source material from author Michelle Frances, Naomi Sheldon and Gabbie Asher's TV adaptation is told from multiple points of view, leaving the audience and remaining characters to make their own choices about who's truthful and who's lying — and why. The show starts out by depicting everything from both Laura and Cherry's perspective, along with their individual scenes. By the end, both women are arguably being honest — about the lies they've told each other, Daniel, other people, and themselves — but the dissonant lenses on their shared reality (a.k.a. Wright hits the exact right note of desperate determination; sometimes the show pulls back or changes perspective to preserve Laura's image, but halfway through the season she lets loose with an unhinged turn that will guarantee viewers stay through the end. Cooke is irresistible as always, playing a delicious mix of femme fatale, girl next door, and genuine psychopath — depending on who you believe. As regal as she is in “House of the Dragon,” “The Girlfriend” gives the actor a palpable physical freedom (not to mention a truly stunning modern wardrobe). With the focus mainly on Cooke, Wright, and Davidson, the ensemble is tight and rounded out by supporting performances from Waleed Zuaiter, Tanya Moodie, Shalom Brune-Franklin, Karen Henthorn, Anna Chancellor, Leo Suter, and Francesca Corney. Music supervisor Matt Biffa relishes more than a few needle drops catered to scandalous character beats that only enrich this viewing experience. The twists vary in actual shock value, but the tension provides enough of a hook to follow this warped love story to its conclusion. All six episodes of “The Girlfriend” are now streaming on Prime Video. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Niall Horan's return to “The Voice” for season 28 — set to premiere on September 22, 2025 — came with a wave of emotions for the pop superstar. In a new promo posted to social media on September 9, the hitmaker said he's thrilled to be back after a year away, but that return brought back all the nerves he felt 15 years prior, when he made it onto Britain's “X Factor” in 2010 — a show that changed his life forever. “I feel like I'm going to audition,” Horan said nervously when fellow coach Michael Bublé asked him how he was doing. “When you haven't done this for a while, it's weird.” Recalling his early days on “X Factor,” where he became part of the global supergroup One Direction, Horan is seen in the new NBC promo telling one contestant, “I don't think anyone really understands how hard it is to audition on a show like this.” “It's all about the voice for me,” he says. The promo then shows Horan turning his chair around for multiple contestants, telling one he loved her confidence and informing another, “I just couldn't wait to get around just see what … you look like, the energy you were giving. Although coaches Reba McEntire, Snoop Dogg, and Bublé have worked together before on the show, Horan came into the new season not knowing Snoop. “Obviously, I've known Mike for a very long time,” he says in the new promo. “But it's an amazing experience just to get to know these people and then become good friends with them,” Horan added. On September 9, NBC uploaded a YouTube video featuring the four coaches chatting at a table behind the scenes at “The Voice.” Their discussion began with McEntire asking them when it became clear to them that they were going to be fast friends. “I think it was the first moment for me,” Snoop replied. “But I was excited to meet Snoop and work again with you guys.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dan Stevens also stars in the drama from Rachel Lee Goldenberg ('Unpregnant'), about entrepreneur Whitney Wolfe Herd's path from Tinder exec to Bumble creator and CEO. To start, you might mistake Swiped, the new film from Unpregnant director Rachel Lee Goldenberg, for a rom-com. They banter about LA techie types and fake-sounding names; unlike all the other guys we've seen hit on her earlier, he actually asks her questions and listens when she answers. It is, instead, a biopic centered around an invention that's either facilitated a lot of real-life meet-cutes or brought about the death of them, depending on how much luck you've had on the dating apps. But while the Hulu release ultimately adopts a tone of triumph, its themes of empowerment ring hollow coming from such a thinly written script. It's most persuasive as a portrait of the frequently toxic culture surrounding those apps to begin with. 'Yellowjackets' Star Simone Kessell Among Cast Additions to Chris Hemsworth's Amazon MGM Film 'Subversion' (Exclusive) Airdate: Friday, Sep. 19 (Hulu)Cast: Lily James, Jackson White, Myha'la, Ben Schnetzer, Dan Stevens, Clea DuVall, Ian Colletti, Coral PeñaDirector: Rachel Lee GoldenbergScreenwriters: Bill Parker, Rachel Lee Goldenberg, Kim Caramele Our protagonist, played by Lily James, is Whitney Wolfe, who will eventually go on to become the billionaire founder of Bumble. She meets her best friend there (Tisha, played by Industry's Myha'la), and starts dating another co-founder (Justin, played by Tell Me Lies' Jackson White). The script, written by Bill Parker and Goldenberg with Kim Carmele, is most effective at the “fall” part of Whitney's rise-fall-rise arc, brought about not by any egregious wrongdoing on her part but by a culture built to insulate certain types of people (i.e., white men) at the expense of everyone else. The tech guys might talk a big game about disruption, but good old-fashioned misogyny is everywhere in their world, from the sales meetings where prospective clients seem more interested in flirting with Whitney than listening to her pitch, to casual office conversations about the relative hotness of women whose photos have been uploaded to the app. Eventually, it's also in the way Whitney is treated by Justin, who talks over her to important investors and gossips about their relationship and, post-breakup, escalates to icing her out of meetings and threatening her at work events. It's in the grossness of the app itself, which attracts an increasing number of complaints from female users about abusive messages and unsolicited dick pics. (“I think most of these chicks are just reporting harassment on guys who reject them,” a male exec scoffs when the issue is raised.) Swiped provokes real indignation with the way Whitney is treated by the company she once helped build, which now sets about pushing her out and then tarnishing her reputation for good measure. It is somewhat less compelling at depicting Whitney's rise back out from the ashes. Swiped is rock-solid in its case that, as Whitney explains, “the rules of online behavior have been written exclusively by men,” and Whitney's aspiration to bring about a genuine sea change is an admirable one. On an abstract level it's easy to cheer for the formation of Bumble, an app explicitly designed to offer a less toxic experience for female users. It's stuffed with biopic clichés, like the moment when she interrupts her own impassioned rant mid-sentence because she's struck by a eureka moment, and over-reliant on montages that let years fly by in the blink of an eye.

After Cannes, Dickinson and Dillane brought “Urchin” to the Telluride Film Festival as an Oscar-hopeful bid. Starring Dillane as an unhoused, drug-chasing drifter in London, and in the vein of Mike Leigh's “Naked” in terms of toxic emotional candor, “Urchin” follows Mike (Dillane) as he stumbles through addiction, and London's correctional and reformatory systems, trying to build his life back up again. (IndieWire's Anne Thompson even deemed Dillane a potential Oscar contender.) Related Stories When Jafar Panahi Has a Story to Tell, Nothing Will Stop Him How Mona Fastvold and Daniel Blumberg Adapted Shaker Hymns for ‘Ann Lee': ‘The Film's Pretty Extreme. From IndieWire's review of Urchin: “Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive… Of course, ‘Urchin' is all the more rewarding for its messy approach to Mike's disarray, which rejects a clear diagnosis in favor of honoring a character who feels like he can't even afford to understand himself. Dickinson's film — shaped by people he knew growing up, and further informed by his work with a variety of social outreach charities — reflects a mature, and frequently harrowing, recognition of how people can be held captive by the centrifugal force of their own behavioral patterns.” The cast also includes Megan Northam and Dickinson himself, who will soon be shipped off to Beatles land to play John Lennon for Sam Mendes' upcoming Apple quadrilogy. Started this past February ahead of the Berlinale by Sideshow co-founding executive Jason Hellerstein, 1-2 Special has picked up a handful of festival movies this year. The distributor is firmly in the Radu Jude business, with North American rights to the Romanian director's Silver Bear winner “Kontinental 25” and upcoming Locarno premiere “Dracula.” There's also Christian Petzold's “Miroirs No. 3,” bought for the U.S. from Metrograph Pictures, which paused theatrical releases this year, and Simón Mesa Soto's Un Certain Regard Jury Prize winner “A Poet” coming up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two actors' long-time friendship was a major factor behind-the-scenes as well. “You talk about the meta of something… you've got these two guys who have both been world-famous for over 30 years with a wonderful sense of friendship and brotherhood,” director Joe Carnahan told Tudum of working with the duo, who also serve as producers on the film. “It would be so much easier if we just stole this money, I swear to god,” Damon's character says before things really go downhill. He's joking, but there's clearly a grain of desire behind it, one Affleck's character picks up on. Later, he explains that a tattoo he has on his hand stands for “Are we the good guys?” It seems like that question will get harder for both men to answer as the movie goes on. “The Rip came out of a deeply personal experience that my friend went through, both as a father and as head of tactical narcotics for the Miami Dade police department,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a significant, seven-figure deal, Legendary has bought the movie rights to Alchemised, an upcoming dark fantasy by author SenLinYu. One source said that rights deal, an outright purchasing, exceeded $3 million. The acquisition comes as Legendary feels energized thanks to a three-year output deal with Paramount, which itself is reenergized thanks to new owners Skydance, and an almost billion-dollar hit with A Minecraft Movie. SenLinYu, who identifies as they/them, is a known quantity in the Harry Potter fan fiction world, especially a subset known as Dramione, which centers on the forbidden love between Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy. They were best known for one book titled Manacled, a 2023 Potter meets Handmaid's Tale dark fantasy that drew more than 10 million views on fanfic platform AO3 and received over 100,000 five-star ratings on Goodreads. Sen, as they are also called, also dabbled in Star Wars fan fic pairing Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey and has won awards in that space. After growing up in the Pacific Northwest and studying classical liberal arts and culture, they started writing in the Notes app of their phone during their baby's nap time. According to sources, Alchemised began as Dramione before being transfigured into a dark romantasy. Set in an alternate world of necromancers and corrupt guild families, the story centers on an alchemist and healer named Helen Marino, who may hold forgotten secrets in her mind. The book, from Penguin Random House division Del Rey, is due to hit stores Sept. 23 with a first printing of 750,000 copies and translations lined up in 21 languages. This isn't the first time that fan fiction turned original material has bewitched Hollywood. 50 Shades of Grey also caused a fury and a major deal after E.L. James turned her Twilight fan fiction into an erotic romantic drama. SenLinYu is repped by WME and attorney Matthew Sugarman at Weintraub Tobin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Country music has a long history with guns and gun culture, from songs about handing down family heirloom rifles to harvesting that first buck of the season. “I didn't think that'd be a cause for me… But when the shooting happens in your town, it's different,” Secor tells Rolling Stone during this week's episode of the Nashville Now podcast. He began lobbying for gun reform, including red flag laws and a ban on assault weapons, and produced a forthcoming documentary, Louder Than Guns, about America's gun violence issue. “I thought, ‘Well, Mr. Aldean can stand up there at a shooting and make his choice for what to do when the volley is coming at his actual audience,'” Secor says. And I sure hope they will — because country has a unique opportunity to bring together the very folks who could make that minuscule difference to create a red flag law, for example, that would have kept this firearm out of the hand of a person who obviously shouldn't have guns.” “There's something for that: It's called a red flag law,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City jeweler Eddie Plein is often credited with inventing the gold grill as we know it back in the '80s. His early handiwork was most notably sported by Bronx rapper Just-Ice on the album cover of his sophomore project Kool & Deadly released in 1987. Plein then took his Eddie's Famous Gold Teeth operation south to Virginia, then finally settling in Atlanta, where the gold grill has become a Southern staple. Wall sat down with The Art of Dialogue recently and told a story about how he ended up on Nelly‘s hit record “Grillz” and revealed it all started with the St. Louis rapper getting tricked into purchasing a custom grill that he thought was made by Dang. The Houston rapper explained that he received a call from T.I. while the Atlanta rapper was on tour with Nelly and told Wall, “Yeah, man, I see my boy Nelly got a grill from you.” However, he recalled being “confused, 'cause I'm like, ‘Man, I never met Nelly a day in my life. I'd love to make him a grill,'” and asked Tip what he was talking about. Yeah I'll get you a Paul Wall grill. I'll get you a Johnny grill,'” he said of other rappers that were also trying to sell grills during that period. Eventually, Wall ran into the St. Lunatics at a hotel in New York, who then put him in touch with Nelly after learning that his grill wasn't made by Johnny Dang. He then said they decided to gift him a custom grill so he could see the difference between their work and the competition. “It was a helluva investment, because, let me tell you, that was hands down the most expensive grill we made to that point and it was a walking billboard, and as soon as Nelly got his grill he was like, ‘Hey, I love my grill. And the rest, as they say, is history. “Grillz” hit the top of the Billboard Hot 100, was nominated for best rap performance as a duo or group at the 2007 Grammys and further popularized the dental jewelry, making a custom grill from Paul Wall and Johnny Dang a must-have status symbol.
