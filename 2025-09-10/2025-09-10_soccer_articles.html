                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get Recruited Faster with a Player Profile on SoccerWire.com On Tuesday night, the USMNT defeated 17th-ranked Japan 2-0 at Lower.com Field in front of a crowd of 20,192 fans, behind goals from forward Alex Zendejas and striker Folarin Balogun to close out the September window with a strong result against a World Cup-bound opponent and even the matchup's all-time series. Mauricio Pochettino made five changes from the lineup that faced Korea Republic on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey. Zendejas, Balogun, defenders Alex Freeman, Chris Richards and midfielder Cristian Roldan all earned the start Tuesday in Columbus after entering Saturday's match against Korea as second-half substitutes. Columbus Crew fullback Max Arfsten started at his home club stadium in his 12th cap for the USMNT. Also starting the match were the three most capped players in camp – forward Christian Pulisic, center back Tim Ream and midfielder Tyler Adams. Goalkeeper Matt Freese, in his ninth appearance, and Tristan Blackmon, fresh off his USMNT debut Saturday night, completed Pochettino's starting lineup. Freeman sprinted to chase down a beautifully chipped ball from Adams and sent a pacey, low cross into the box that the Japanese defense cleared away. One minute later, Japan progressed with a headed ball into space, which Arfsten shut down with a smart tackle. High pressure from the defensive duo forced Japan to make a lackadaisical back pass into no man's land. Balogun squared his shoulders and took a shot on goal from close range that Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako blocked. The Crew defender showed no fear on his club's home turf and beat his defender 1v1 with a wicked stepover move. Arfsten rocketed a left-footed cross into the box where Zendejas lined up his shot. Arfsten was credited with the assist, his fourth on the year, to send his fans in Columbus into a frenzy. Freese made several stops in the first half to keep a clean sheet for the second straight half. The goalkeeper was called into action to stop Japan's first shot of the night in the ninth minute, dropping to block a left-footed cross from midfielder Junya Ito that was curving toward goal. Two more stops from Freese in the 21st minute, on a dangerous header from midfielder Kaishu Sano inside the box, and in the 35th, after a takeaway nearly gifted an opportunity for Japan, brought his save total to four in the first half. Following a free kick around midfield, Pulisic capitalized on Japan taking time to organize defensively. Pochettino made a group substitution in the 66th minute, sending on Diego Luna, Sergiño Dest, Jack McGlynn, and Luca de la Torre. Zendejas, Adams, Pulisic and Arfsten exited the match. In the 79th minute, McGlynn's deflected shot was headed toward goal, but Osako's leaping save prevented the United States from extending their lead. The group returns to action in October for another two-match set against World Cup qualified opponents. As part of Hispanic Heritage Month, U.S. Soccer will pay tribute to the Hispanic community, honoring both their cultural heritage and their passionate support for the U.S. team. Four days later, the USMNT faces Australia, presented by American, at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. USA – Alex Zendejas (Max Arfsten), 30th minute: Arfsten beat his defender one-on-one on the left wing with a quick stepover move and created space to fire a left-footed cross. USA – Folarin Balogun (Christian Pulisic), 64th minute: Following a foul on Japan, the United States was awarded a free kick around midfield.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Visa ticket presale signup window opened at 11 a.m., and will run through Friday, Sept. 19 at 11 a.m.. Those Visa cardholders who qualify can then declare their intent to purchase tickets. "With just ten months to go until the FIFA World Cup 26 kicks off, we are excited to launch the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament," FIFA World Cup 2026 COO Heimo Schirgi said in a statement. "This marks a momentous milestone as we build up to this historic event, and we look forward to millions of fans joining us in North America next June." Those chosen to buy tickets will be notified by email on Sept. 29. FIFA has said that being selected as part of the presale lottery doesn't necessarily guarantee that tickets will be available during a specific time slot. Following the Visa presale, there will be other ticket phases. A registration window for the early ticket draw is expected to be open from Oct. 27-31, FIFA said. Time slots for purchase will run from mid-November to early December. Signup and selection will be similar to the Visa presale. Tickets to all of the tournament's matches, including those for specific teams and venues, will be made available once sales begin, FIFA said, adding the prices will range from about $60 up to more than $6,700 for the Final at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026. Tickets will also be made available for purchase on a first-come, first-serve basis when the tournament start date gets closer, FIFA said. Jeff Capellini has been digital producer at CBS New York for 18 years. He previously worked for The Associated Press and several newspapers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the U.S. driving into their attacking third, center back Tim Ream played the ball out wide to Max Arfsten. Then, he fired a decent, left-footed cross – right where Zendejas was waiting. “For some reason, I knew he was going to go one-on-one,” Zendejas said. “Our job as forwards and wingers is to get in the box. In that very spot inside the box, Zendejas floated between two Japanese defenders. The finish was the second international goal for Zendejas, who made a statement in his 13th career cap. September camp was the first of 2025 for Zendejas, though he's played for head coach Mauricio Pochettino before. For some of his U.S. teammates, the familiarity goes back a lot further. “I've played with him since we were 14 years old, so I've always known what a great player he is,” said forward Christian Pulisic. “He really showed this camp something different, so I'm really happy for him. He's a really technical player, really clean on the ball, and he gives a little something different. He does a lot for us as well.” When asked about Zendejas during the post-match press conference, Pochettino said that the Club América attacker gives him doubt – in a good way. If Pochettino already had an idea about who his forwards are going to be for the World Cup next summer, Zendejas gave him reason to keep his name to the mix, which was Pochettino's whole approach to this September camp. Arfsten knows Lower.com Field well, playing 62 matches for the Crew since 2023, including a victory in the 2023 MLS Cup. A significant portion of the 20,192 in attendance for USA-Japan recognized No. The Crew fans gave Arfsten a warm welcome when his name was announced in the starting lineup, and the volume raised whenever Arfsten got a touch on the ball or took a shot. And the wingback put on a show in front of a home crowd – showing bravery in 1v1 situations, combining with teammates like Folarin Balogun in dangerous areas and hustling on the defensive end to disrupt Japan's attempts to carry the ball toward goal. Fans who followed the USMNT this summer know what Arfsten can do. “He's a player that we've believed in from Day One,” Pochettino said. “His character, his personality, the characteristics, how he is as a player – it's a combo that we really love.” Pochettino said the potential for Arfsten is “massive.” And if his fast rise is any indication, that's certainly true. Earlier in 2025, Arfsten earned his first call-up to the National Team. Now, he's setting up teammates for difference-making goals and becoming a consistent contributor, tacking on more to his year-long totals of four assists and one goal in 12 caps.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>19 for Pulisic in his nine-year international career, tying the27-year-old with Claudio Reyna and legendary forward Clint Dempsey for fourth all-time in USMNT history. September camp offered a chance for the longtime veteran to get his first minutes with the National Team since spring.The vibes out of training camp were all positive. Teammates reported that Pulisic integrated seamlessly with the squad. While he admitted the program has “been in a tough spot” at times over the past several months, his affection and passion never wavered. “I love this team,” he said after Tuesday's match. This camp also gave Pulisic a chance to see some new players and reunite with others. Against Japan, Pulisic found a lot of freedom, starting the match as a winger on the left side. The 3-4-3 formation resulted in more movement, opening more channels and dynamic playmaking, like when Pulisic almost scored in the 54th minute. His driven shot forced Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako to drop quickly to keep the strike from squeezing past him from a difficult angle. It was Pulisic's actions and quick thinking that led to Balogun's goal. “I'm pretty comfortable in most of the attacking positions,” Pulisic said. "Today, it was nice playing mostly on the left and being able to turn and coming in on my right foot. It's definitely a good spot for me.” Like many players called into this camp, these 11 days allowed Pulisic to get more time with Pochettino, who was named head coach of the USMNT one year ago to the day on Sept. 10, 2024. In his post-match press conference, Pochettino called Pulisic “un jugador intelligente,” a smart player, and praised his versatility, being able to play both right and left sides of the field. The two have gotten to know each other better this camp and are on a good page as Pulisic departs Columbus and returns to his club in Italy. “We had good conversations,” Pulisic told reporters after the match. We had a normal camp, and everything is good between us and good between the team. Tuesday's win gives Pulisic and the U.S. a strong result heading into the October window where the USMNT will again face two World Cup-bound opponents in Ecuador and Australia. With nine months to go until the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off in June,Tuesday's result and Pulisic's strong performance puts the U.S. on a confident, positive and winning trajectory heading into fall camps.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lottery for Visa cardholders opens today, followed by a general onsale The lottery for Visa cardholders opens today, followed by a general onsale Soccer's biggest stage is headed to Met Life Stadium. For the first time ever, the world's biggest sporting event will bring FIFA World Cup quarterfinal matches to New Jersey and Philadelphia. Next up is an Early Ticket Lottery from October 27 to 31, where anyone with a FIFA ID can enter. Winners will be chosen at random, and then can buy their tickets from mid-November to early December. If you need round 3, the Post-Draw Sales open in December on a first-come, first-served basis for general matches, again as long as you have a FIFA ID. To get your ID, create a free account at FIFA.com/tickets. That's where you'll also join the lottery and have access to purchase tickets. Admission to general matches will be about $60 per ticket, while the finals games could see prices soar to $6,700 per ticket – you read that right! Keep in mind that high-demand games or knockout rounds will see steep price increases. You can also add on hospitality packages that include premium seating, food, drinks and other perks; this is not via the lottery and can be purchased on its own. Don't worry if you can't get in right away – FIFA will also launch its own resale platform as a safe way to resell or buy tickets. Be aware of scammers from different resale sites.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a 2-0 loss to South Korea on Saturday, the U.S. men's national team hoped to get its mojo back with a win. Tuesday's game had a win-or-go home feel to it, as the U.S. tries to find its footing and keep fans on board — and the USMNT delivered, with a 2-0 win over Japan. 17 team in the FIFA rankings, breaks a tough streak of losses against top-25 teams. Folarin Balogun got another excellent finish in the 64th minute, off a great assist from Christian Pulisic. Goalkeeper Matt Freese also pitched in significantly for the win, getting six saves and continuing to cement his place as the first-string goalkeeper. Japanese goalkeeper Keisuke Osako, who had a stunning nine saves, held the USMNT to only two goals. The win also marks a potential turning point for USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino. After months of testing out potential lineup combinations, this game demonstrated more team chemistry than several past editions. And Pochettino, who dismissed some criticism of the team as "bulls***" on Monday, will have a much-needed win under his belt and a sigh of relief heading into the rest of the fall. “It is important for us to keep pushing and improving," Pochettino said post-match. Looking forward, Pochettino will have a broad roster to choose from in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup next summer. Zendejas and Folarin were the 16th and 17 different players to score for the U.S. under Pochettino, across only 18 games, per OptaJack. After closing out the September window with a win, the USMNT will reconvene in October to play Ecuador and Australia, before facing Paraguay and Uruguay in November.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COLUMBUS, Ohio — U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino indicated that fringe players who performed well in Tuesday's 2-0 win over Japan are in contention for World Cup roster spots. He then also mentioned Columbus Crew left wingback Max Arfsten, who provided the assist on that goal while playing at his home stadium. “It's a player that we really believe from day one, because I see in the way that he is, his character, his personality,” Pochettino said. The manager also made mention of Alex Freeman, who started at right wingback; and Cristian Roldan, who played 90 minutes in midfield one week after being on vacation and receiving a late call-up to the squad for his first USMNT opportunity since the 2023 Gold Cup. “We have players that play in this new formation [with their clubs],” Pochettino said. He mentioned Freeman and Arfsten, but also center back Chris Richards, who has said he is more comfortable playing in a back three, which is what he does at Crystal Palace in the English Premier League. A day earlier, at his pre-match news conference, Pochettino sounded defensive and defiant. He pushed back against criticism of his squad selections, and doubled down on his stance that results in the buildup to the World Cup aren't as relevant as some fans and pundits seem to believe. “If you go to the past, when things happen like this … this team were very successful,” Pochettino said, indicating the U.S.'s capacity to rebound from defeat. Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu, speaking moments before Pochettino, said through an interpreter that he thought the U.S. staff “did a magnificent job.” The USMNT, he said, “managed to regain their confidence and play well against us.” When asked which U.S. players impressed him, Moriyasu singled out Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun. Explaining his decision to rotate his entire lineup and play a “B” or “C” team, Moriyasu gave an explanation similar to the one Pochettino has given in the past. “We are aiming to win at the World Cup,” he said. “I cannot just rely on my experienced players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The victory came three days after a humbling 2-0 defeat against South Korea in Harrison, New Jersey. Balogun doubled the U.S. lead in the 64th minute with a nifty goal of his own as Pochettino's squad earned a much-needed victory against a Japan side that already has qualified for the 2026 World Cup. While Tuesday's game was just a friendly, the USMNT needed a positive outcome after some disappointing performances — the team has endured six defeats in 2025. Even with Tuesday night's win, Pochettino's record with the USMNT is a less than stellar 10-1-7 since taking over as coach in September 2024. Pochettino has precious little time to turn around what has been an underperforming national team squad before next summer's World Cup. The USMNT's next two matches (both friendlies) come in the next FIFA international match window in October. USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights of Tuesday night's USMNT vs. Japan friendly in Columbus, Ohio: Folarin Balogun netted his sixth career goal for the U.S. in the 64th minute with a terrific finish that got past Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako. Balogun's left-footed shot from the left side of the box came after an assist from Christian Pulisic. For Zendejas, it was his second goal for the USMNT and first since March 2023 when he scored in a 7-1 rout of Grenada in Concacaf Nations League play. USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has tabbed four different starters from his lineup for Saturday's 2-0 loss to South Korea. Defender Chris Richards, midfielder Cristian Roldan, and forwards Folarin Balogun and Alex Zendejas get the start Tuesday night. Sebastian Berhalter, Sergiño Dest, Diego Luna and Josh Sargent each started on Saturday, but will open this game on the bench. For Christian Pulisic, this will be his 80th career USMNT cap. The Samurai Blue currently are on a 13-match unbeaten streak that dates back to February 2024. Alex Freeman, a 21-year-old defender who plays professionally for Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer, is the son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman. Antonio Freeman spent eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Green Bay Packers, helping the team win Super Bowl XXXI. In that victory, Freeman had an 81-yard touchdown reception. Alex Freeman made his USMNT debut as a starter in the team's 2-1 defeat against Turkey on June 7, and earned his ninth national team cap with a start against Japan. The U.S. men's national team is set to face Portugal in a March friendly, according to multiple reports. Fox Sports reported that the USMNT-Portugal match would take place at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The 71,000-seat venue could also potentially host a match against Belgium, though Washington, D.C. and other locations are also being considered. Mauricio Pochettino has expressed frustration with the amount of fullback Tim Weah has played early in his time at Marseille. Weah has alternated between fullback and winger during the past few years of his club career, taking him from Lille to Juventus and now back to France with Marseiile. HARRISON, N.J. — Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed the need to win friendlies leading up to the World Cup, saying that results will only matter when the tournament kicks off next summer. The U.S. men's national team fell 2-0 against South Korea on Saturday, Sept. 6, as goals from Son Heung-min and Lee Dong-gyeon in the first half settled the match at Sports Illustrated Stadium. Pochettino has now lost seven of 17 games during his tenure as USMNT head coach, particularly struggling against high-quality sides. In 2025 alone, the USMNT has lost to Panama, Canada, Türkiye, Switzerland, Mexico and South Korea.
