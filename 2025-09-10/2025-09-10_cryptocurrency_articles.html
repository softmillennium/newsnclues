                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sept. 8, Clark's Green Kaboom digital card sold for $175,000, only one day after it was pulled from a digital pack. The buyer was spinotron, a well-known collector who has been bullish on digital cards. A longtime collector of rare Kobe Bryant physical cards, among others, spinotron has grown a large digital collection. According to his Panini profile, spinotron owns 7,269 NFTs and 7,396 unopened packs. Spinotron believes in digital cards because they remove the friction points of the physical hobby, including authentication, grading, and physical transfer. "I'm a big physical collector of 17 years," spinotron told Collectibles on SI via text. They are hugely irreplaceable, historically significant, and represent one's identity for the long term, if not forever. He has a reputation for never selling anything of note. To my surprise, I was outbid two times by another hardcore collector from the crypto side at $135k. Spinotron bought the Steph Curry Green Kaboom - Vertical NFT a week earlier for $99,999. He was happy to pair the Clark Green Kaboom with it. The Clark Green Kaboom was pulled from the 2024 WNBA Rookie Royalty digital packs, which were sold via a Dutch auction on Aug. 28. Packs sold out at $1,100, with the average sale price being $1,400. "I'm not nervous about spending $175k on a single card, because I know what it stands for going in and know the market and demand," spinotron said. "Competition was only $40k away, and I didn't test his limit. The Panini blockchain has made significant progress recently, which validates my vision and logic, and surely makes me more bullish. Many big physical collectors are coming in and staying long term." The physical card collecting domain is rapidly evolving from a personal hobby or family pastime into a model dominated by capital operations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BOCA RATON, Fla., Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LIXTE Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. (“LIXTE” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LIXT and LIXTW), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, today announced it has made an initial purchase of cryptocurrencies to further diversify its treasury holdings and for potential acquisitions. The Company purchased 10.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 300 Ethereum (ETH) for a total of approximately $2.6 million as part of its strategy to strengthen its treasury position and expand its ability to transact across multiple mediums of exchange. Cryptocurrency now totals approximately 43.6 percent of LIXTE's treasury holdings. “Adding Bitcoin and Ethereum to our treasury reflects our commitment to building a balanced and flexible digital asset strategy to complement our cash holdings,” said Geordan Pursglove, LIXTE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “By diversifying our treasury and enabling transactions across a wide spectrum of mediums, we are positioning LIXTE for greater adaptability and long-term growth in the digital economy. LIXTE Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on new targets for cancer drug development and developing and commercializing cancer therapies. LIXTE has demonstrated that its first-in-class lead clinical PP2A inhibitor, LB-100, is well-tolerated in cancer patients at doses associated with anti-cancer activity. Based on extensive published preclinical data (see www.lixte.com), LB-100 has the potential to significantly enhance chemotherapies and immunotherapies and improve outcomes for patients with cancer. LIXTE's lead compound, LB-100, is part of a pioneering effort in an entirely new field of cancer biology – activation lethality – that is advancing a new treatment paradigm. LIXTE's new approach is covered by a comprehensive patent portfolio. Proof-of-concept clinical trials are currently in progress for Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma, Metastatic Colon Cancer and Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The impact of NFT community activity is frequently instrumental in shaping success and relevance in the crypto and NFTs space. In a recent announcement through LunarCrush analytics, Phoenix Group has identified the top projects by social activity on September 10, 2025. TOP #NFT PROJECTS BY SOCIAL ACTIVITY$LINK $PENGU $APE $ICP $XTZ $FET $MASK $VRA $RENDER $GALA pic.twitter.com/7tuCMiHLvJ Chainlink has not just been active in blockchain oracles, but a recent move into NFTs is indicative of its expanding ecosystem and its expanding role in DeFi and digital collectibles. It is clear that the scale of participation LINK has achieved has no parallel in terms of usefulness and community based support. The charming and social community-driven aspect of the project still draws in dedicated fans who survive off of posting memes, artwork, and merchandise. In the meantime, ApeCoin was ranked number-three with 5.3K posts engaged and 1.5M interactions. Related to the legendary BAYC ecosystem, ApeCoin demonstrates the long term resilience of NFT brands that fuse exclusivity with a rich cultural impact. Internet Computer (ICP), got the fourth position with 4.8K engaged posts and 212.8K interactions. Tezos (XTZ) was next with 3.8K associated posts and 179.9K interactions. One aspect of Tezos that has appealed to the artists and developers who prioritize sustainability is energy-efficient NFTs. Whereas providing mainly AI and blockchain integration features, Fetch.ai NFT presence is acquiring a following as the project endeavors to discover new applications that combine artificial intelligence and digital assets. Mask Network (MASK) featured 3.1K posts engaged and 146.3K interactions, which indicates its effectiveness in increasing the power of the Web3 movement via social networks. Verasity (VRA) has done well with 2.9K engaged posts and 389.8K impressions, a figure that many of the projects higher in the rankings have attained. Video games and eSports-oriented programs used by Verasity resonate with viewers, and it is becoming increasingly an emerging leader in NFT-based communities. Its position in giving creators a voice is still of interest both to artists and developers. Gala (GALA) was also competing with Render in engaged post (2.7K) but was at 49.8K in terms of interaction. Gala is known to have a stable community as a result of their blockchain based games and entertainment. Even though its interactions are underdeveloped in comparison with others, the project still displays a continuation of relevance in NFT-powered gaming ecosystems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SEC said on Wednesday in a series of filings that it needs more time to review applications to allow staking for Ethereum ETFs issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Exchange-traded funds proposed by Franklin Templeton that would track the price of altcoins XRP and Solana also met with delays. While SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has been vocal in his support of digital assets, his agency continues to punt on deciding on many ETFs. Meanwhile, new altcoin-based ETF applications continue to be submitted on what seems like a weekly basis as financial institutions show their eagerness to list funds that offer exposure to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a chart created by Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst James Seyffart, over 90 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC approval. "At this rate we'll have one for every top 30-40 [cryptocurrency] inside 12 months, even with delays," McKayResearch founder James McKay said on X with a post including Seyffart's chart. In July, the SEC said it was looking for comments on a rule change that would permit BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust to add staking. Issuers' interest in adding staking to their Ethereum ETFs kicked into high gear after the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance said in May that certain blockchain staking activities don't involve the offering of securities. Many people took that to mean crypto ETF staking would be allowed. Last month, the SEC delayed making a decision on whether Grayscale could add staking to its Ethereum exchange-traded fund. Franklin Templeton's two proposals for spot XRP and Solana ETFs will also have to wait longer for the SEC to make a decision. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said on Wednesday he anticipates a strong end to the year for SOL with the expectation that ETFs tracking Solana will finally go live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We reported previously about extraction MMOFPS Reaper Actual and its curated presence at this year's Gamescom, which granted invited attendees a look at the various game mechanics and systems as it eyes an early 2026 release. Despite the event being long over, an interview from WCCFTech with Distinct Possibility's John Smedley and Matthew Higby has offered a few additional details to note. As reported previously, the full game space can currently support up to 200, but the aim is to “get over a thousand” at some point “a little bit after launch.” The MMO-like size isn't just about the map either, as Higby and Smedley also talked about large-scale player features like player-to-player trading via an auction house-style system, crafting that “should feel more like something from an EVE game” in terms of its complexity and depth, and the clan system known as outfits that promises to be more in-depth than other guild systems, including larger outfit bases with more features like vehicle garages. Another major point of note was discussion about the separate and optional blockchain version. Here Higby talks about how the devs are looking to create “NFT or crypto assets [that can] actually be utility-based as opposed to just being speculative value.” The current solution being considered is the ability to create a purpose-built base designed as a medical waystation, bundle it up as a blueprint, and sell it off as both an NFT and a useful in-game asset. This is to “let up a small number of people in and actually play the game because we want players to come in and actually tell us if the game is fun, and teach us the things we don't know about our own game,” according to Smed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Institutions are rotating over to ETH for the staking rewards, deflationary design and more use cases. Many see short term upside with slow growth of Bitcoin vs. Ethereum. This spinning is spreading beyond ETH and to smaller altcoins where riskier bets can pay off bigger gains. One of the evident beneficiaries of this trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE, an altcoin that is gaining momentum due to the capital seeking higher returns. Data from Glassnode and SoSoValue shows Ethereum ETFs attracted $3.87 billion in inflows during August. ETH ETFs recorded $1.24 billion in inflows during the first week and Bitcoin did $440.8 million. Fidelity's FETH and BlackRock's ETHA took the lead, driving total ETH ETF inflows to more than $13.34 billion. On September 2 ETH ETFs experienced $135 million in outflows. Bitcoin ETFs also showed life, posting $332.7 million in inflows on September 2. BTC price bounced back up to $111,000, testing its 20-week simple moving average. It is sustained inflows that are necessary for a true recovery. These data points provide a certain confirmation that traders are favoring Ethereum while spreading capital more and more across other altcoins. As capital flows out of the majors, traders are turning to high upside altcoins where smaller investments can lead to outsized returns. This is the overall appetite for risk among altcoin buyers. Analysts point out that MAGACOIN FINANCE might benefit from exchange speculation and visibility as demand rotates to lower cap assets. Its growing community and transparent foundations helps it stand out in a crowded meme market. With investors looking their eyes outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting itself up as a future contender in the world of altcoins. The institutions are looking for Ethereum's deflationary mechanics and staking yields while the retail investors are looking for more growth opportunities. Taken together, these flows confirm that investors are shifting from Bitcoin's dominance towards altcoins with stronger narratives. Out of them, the most prominent is: MAGACOIN FINANCE . It's a combination of the appeals of the meme and scarcity, as well as community hype and exchange speculation potential. Investors are turning to MAGA because it represents something we have not seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum: exponential upside from a smaller base. As altcoin momentum builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing itself as one of the more attractive places to send new capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original cryptocurrency, BTC, has been clinging to the $111,000 level for some time as investors wait for U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers on Thursday. Many anticipate a rate cut from the FOMC next week, which could serve as the trigger for BTC to move decisively higher. However, while the market focuses on macro, an even bigger demand driver for BTC is quietly taking shape. And in less than 16 hours, the project will close its current funding stage, after which each HYPER token will cost more than today's $0.012885. On prediction platform Polymarket, bettors are heavily backing a 25 basis point cut next week, assigning an 83% probability versus just 4% for no change. The U.S. M2 money supply has often grown in parallel with BTC's price, underscoring Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative asset. This shows that even though investors widely expect a rate cut, many don't believe it will translate into a major Bitcoin rally this month. If that happens, Bitcoin could stage a surprise rally in September, setting up its seasonally strong months of October and November. There's also a broader liquidity backdrop to consider: nearly $7.26 trillion is sitting in money market funds. That pool of capital isn't idle cash – with rate cuts lowering yields, even a small fraction flowing out could be a powerful catalyst for BTC. Beyond these macro moves, the longer-term catalyst for Bitcoin may come from utility-driven demand. With nearly $15 million already raised, Bitcoin Hyper is the project that could begin channeling that demand when it launches in the weeks ahead. A mix of retail speculation, pandemic liquidity, and cheaper money later pushed it past that 2017 apex. Although the institutional wave may not be over, demand risks drying up if Bitcoin offers nothing more than its role as a store of value. It's one thing to proudly claim how much BTC you hold, but that value rests heavily on the “digital gold” narrative. Bitcoin Hyper changes this dynamic by making BTC useful across a much broader set of applications – not just payments, but also DeFi platforms, real-world assets (RWA), gaming, and other use cases that people never originally envisioned on the Bitcoin blockchain. It can run dApps at Solana speeds while still anchoring settlement to Bitcoin's immutable and decentralized base layer. Bitcoin Hyper functions as a Layer-2 anchored to Bitcoin, but it doesn't bundle every transaction back to the main chain the way Ethereum rollups do. Instead, activity runs at high speed inside Hyper's own ecosystem using wrapped BTC, while periodic state commitments are anchored to Bitcoin Layer-1 for integrity. In practice, this means developers and users can interact in an environment that feels like Solana – quick, cheap, and highly scalable – while knowing Bitcoin remains the settlement anchor. It also no longer traps Bitcoin's liquidity in passive storage but actively circulates across DeFi, payments, gaming, and other apps on Hyper. The end result is a system where Bitcoin doesn't just sit in treasuries or cold wallets; it becomes the fuel for a broader digital economy. Tokens can be purchased using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. HYPER is listed under Upcoming Tokens, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

Dogecoin rallied sharply during the September 9–10 session, reclaiming the $0.24–$0.25 range with volume surging above 1.5 billion tokens. The move comes as REX-Osprey prepares to debut the first U.S. Dogecoin ETF on September 11 under the ticker “DOJE.” Technical traders flagged a bullish pennant breakout pattern, while large-scale whale accumulation added to growing confidence that institutional demand is building around the launch.

• REX-Osprey DOGE ETF is scheduled to begin trading September 11, making it the first U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking a memecoin with no declared utility.• Whale addresses accumulated roughly 280 million DOGE in the past week, indicating strong institutional-sized flows.• Technical analysts highlight a pennant breakout with upside targets of $0.28–$0.30 if the $0.25 level is held.• ETF speculation has driven retail and social media enthusiasm, with DOGE trending heavily on prediction markets and derivatives desks.

• DOGE advanced 4% during the September 9 13:00–September 10 12:00 session, moving from $0.236 to a peak of $0.245.• Early decline saw DOGE drop from $0.247 to $0.236 by 14:00, backed by massive 1.55B volume that set a strong floor.• Price consolidated within $0.238–$0.242 through most of the day, suggesting strategic accumulation.• Final hour breakout lifted DOGE from $0.240 to $0.245, underpinned by 114.7M volume at the peak.• Session closed at $0.244, just shy of resistance, confirming bullish momentum into ETF launch week.

• Support: $0.236–$0.238 range validated by repeated high-volume rebounds.• Resistance: $0.245–$0.247 remains the key ceiling; break above could target $0.28.• Volume: Session highs of 1.55B and late-hour 114.7M significantly exceeded 24-hour average of 334M.• Structure: Pennant breakout confirmed by higher lows and accelerating final-hour volumes.• Indicators: RSI hovering mid-60s suggests room for further upside before overbought conditions emerge.

• Whether DOGE can sustain closes above $0.245 and set up a push toward $0.28.• ETF launch on September 11, expected to be a structural liquidity event for DOGE.• Whale accumulation trends — continued inflows would validate institutional conviction.• Derivatives positioning as ETF hype builds, with potential for heightened volatility around launch.• Broader crypto market sentiment tied to Federal Reserve policy decisions later in the month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea's biggest crypto exchange, Upbit, is preparing to step into blockchain development with a mysterious new project called “Giwa.” The teaser has triggered intense speculation in the crypto community, with full details set to emerge at the Upbit Developer Conference (UDC). The move signals Upbit's push to go beyond its role as South Korea's largest exchange – one that often moves markets with its token listings and build infrastructure at the protocol level. However, early hints and regulatory factors suggest an L2 design is more likely. Analysts consider that Giwa may form a stablecoin liquidity platform of South Korea. Already, exchanges such as Upbit command a lot of power – token listings often result in dramatic price changes. This strategy mirrors moves by Binance (BNB Chain) and Coinbase (Base L2), both of which leveraged blockchain launches to expand beyond trading. South Korea is very strict in regards to crypto platforms. Regulatory requirements could make regulating at the L2 structure rather than a complete L1 blockchain, and thus Giwa will be easier to integrate into existing infrastructure. An L2 solution would similarly make Giwa an Ethereum-scaling solution or a comparable base chain, with the advantage of security but with more affordable and quicker transactions. Crypto observers equate this expectation to the hype of Base, the L2 by Coinbase introduced in 2023 that rapidly emerged as a significant point of liquidity.

To that point, speculation persists, with ideas of both stablecoin-centric infrastructure and a wider Korean crypto hub. Whatever form it takes, Giwa represents one of the most significant blockchain developments in South Korea's digital asset market this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When MEI Pharma announced it was considering its “strategic alternatives” in the wake of a failed merger last year, the options seemed pretty mundane. From now on, MEI Pharma—previously best known for its investigational leukemia drug—will be called Lite Strategy. This marks a move to “expand its business model beyond its portfolio of drug candidates to focus on pioneering institutional-grade digital asset treasury strategies, in partnership with leading innovators across blockchain, finance, and technology.” “Litecoin has proven itself for over a decade as one of the most secure, reliable, and scalable digital assets in the world,” said Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin who has now joined Lite Strategy's board. The rebranded company hasn't completely forgotten its biotech roots, however. MEI's story appeared to come to an end in July 2024 after a planned merger with Infinity Pharma was scuppered after investors made their own bid and MEI's shareholders ultimately voted against the transaction. It led MEI to plan a reduction in force “as soon as practicable” and discontinue all clinical activities related to voruciclib, which had been in development for acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell malignancies. That restructure also saw CEO David Urso and Chief Medical Officer Richard Ghalie, M.D., depart the company, with Chief Financial Officer Justin File moving up to acting CEO, a position he still holds. In this morning's release, File said the rebranded company's “forward-looking approach … creates a powerful model for how public companies can incorporate Litecoin into treasury operations in a way that is both innovative and accessible to traditional investors.” It's not the first time a biotech has dabbled in cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SEC's Paul Atkins commented on Project Crypto, proposing one regulatory framework for trading, lending and staking digital assets. US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins said that “most crypto tokens are not securities,” while outlining a sweeping plan to integrate crypto activities like trading, lending and staking under a unified regulatory framework. “It is a new day at the SEC,” Atkins said during a keynote address at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Roundtable in Paris on Wednesday. “Policy will no longer be set by ad hoc enforcement actions,” he added, contrasting the previous administration's aggressive crackdown on crypto firms. The SEC's updated strategy includes allowing platforms to operate as “super-apps” that can facilitate trading, lending and staking of digital assets under one regulatory umbrella. Atkins said that these platforms should also have the flexibility to offer multiple custody solutions. “I believe regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation needed to protect investors, and no more,” Atkins stated. “We should not overburden entrepreneurs with duplicative rules that only the largest incumbents can bear.” Atkins also praised the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, saying it provides “a comprehensive digital assets regime” and noted that US policymakers could learn from Europe's early regulatory steps. The SEC chief called for international cooperation to “facilitate more innovative markets.” “Working together, as Alexandre de Tocqueville might have put it, we can ‘extend the sphere' of freedom and prosperity,” he concluded. Related: SEC pushes back decisions on Bitwise, Grayscale crypto ETFs to November Last month, the European Banking Authority (EBA) finalized rules that will require EU-based banks to hold significantly more capital against unbacked cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). These draft regulatory standards are now pending review by the European Commission. In the US, the FDIC now allows supervised banks to engage in crypto activities without prior approval, while Switzerland has updated its DLT laws to support crypto custody and stablecoin guarantees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analyst claims XRP could hit $300 if Ethereum reaches $25,000, but the math shows this is very unrealistic. Every bull market produces far-fetched predictions, but this one might be among the most extreme. An anonymous analyst known as Whale Guru says XRP (XRP-USD) could soar to $300 if Ethereum (ETH-USD) reaches $25,000 in the next big pump. Standard Chartered has floated a similar long-term target, though the bank does not expect it to materialize until 2028, possibly during the next bull run. Historically, when ETH makes large moves, liquidity often spills over into other major tokens, and that can fuel rallies across the board. This is the logic behind Whale Guru's prediction, where Ethereum's strength acts as a catalyst that could lift XRP dramatically higher. Whale Guru believes that if Ethereum hits $25,000, XRP could surge from its current $2.95 price to $300. That would represent a 101-fold move, equal to more than 10,000% upside. However, the leap from under $3 to $300 is so steep that it demands scrutiny. Even in crypto, where extreme price swings are possible, this scale of growth would defy not just past performance but the basic structure of the market. At $300 each, its market capitalization would balloon to $17.8 trillion. To put that in perspective, that would make XRP more valuable than Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) combined. Beyond the sheer numbers, XRP faces other hurdles. Liquidity constraints limit how easily the token can absorb such massive flows, since much of its supply is locked in escrow or concentrated in large wallets. Adoption also lags behind Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD), with the XRP Ledger trailing in developer activity, DeFi traction, and tokenization projects. Even though Ripple's battle with the SEC is over, regulatory clarity is still uneven worldwide, and banks remain cautious about using XRP at scale. Finally, history shows that XRP has struggled to sustain even its biggest rallies. Repeating that rally more than 80 times over to reach $300 is an almost impossible stretch. Some analysts argue that $300 is theoretically possible, but not in this decade. This timeline stretches fifteen years into the future and assumes sustained adoption of XRP Ledger technology, wider institutional partnerships, and broader recognition of its role in payments. The crypto market does have a history of surprising even the most experienced traders, which is why predictions like this grab attention. Still, the distance between a 2040 forecast and Whale Guru's implied “next pump” highlights how difficult it is to bridge the gap between excitement and execution. Whale Guru's optimism was not limited to XRP. The forecasts also serve as a reminder that one analyst's vision can move sentiment, but not necessarily markets. Each of these targets would require not just favorable technical setups but also unprecedented inflows of capital, adoption breakthroughs, and regulatory clarity across multiple regions. Without that, the gap between prediction and reality will remain wide. Investors should treat this prediction as a thought experiment rather than a roadmap, keeping in mind the scale of the challenges involved.</p>

By moving collectibles onto secure, transparent, and public ledgers, we can make rare, meaningful fan items accessible to anyone, anywhere, with full authenticity and zero waste. In 2017, we saw the official birth of NFTs. At the time, it seemed like this was a way to bring collecting online. But I believe NFTs created a kind of bubble, one which only those who understood the technology and its purpose could access. This bubble appeared parallel to cryptocurrency, where both were, for a time, viewed by their small group of investors as money-making schemes. In 2025, that bubble has popped, and what's left is the foundation of something more meaningful. Just as cryptocurrencies have matured, NFTs are maturing too. We've seen the financial world evolve around blockchain through ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenised assets. Institutions now see crypto as a viable part of the modern financial system. Digital collectibles are the cultural counterpart to that financial evolution. They're the sustained advancement of what NFTs originally set out to do. But unlike the speculative hype of early NFTs, digital collectibles are rooted in fandom, not finance. They're about making collecting smarter, more accessible, and better aligned with how people actually engage with their favourite characters, games, or stories. The connection between collecting and blockchain is natural. Collecting is about rarity, status, and authenticity – exact traits that blockchain technology was purpose-built to verify and protect. Digital collectibles use that tech to expand collecting opportunities for fans, who are already the same people who would buy a comic book or go to HobbyTown, or the antique store looking for stamps. Designs aren't limited by production costs or shipping constraints. Instead, artists and creators can build immersive, detailed pieces with features impossible to replicate physically. In digital spaces, fans can connect regardless of where they live. Plastic packaging, emissions from global shipping, warehousing, and overproduction. And with modern blockchains moving toward carbon neutrality, digital merchandise becomes a more sustainable, ethical choice. Meanwhile, tariffs, material shortages, and inflation are adding to this physical accessibility issue. That's why digital collectibles can be a perfect on-ramp. When fans download an app that lets them buy officially licensed collectibles or the comics they already love – and that just happens to use blockchain under the hood – they're stepping into this world organically. It's the same principle that made ETFs an accessible entry point into investing. We're seeing a popular response from our community to “phygital” drops – digital items paired with physical ones, and publishers moving into licensed digital comics that retain the same rarity and fan value as their print counterparts. But now it's easier, greener, and finally global. The digital collectibles market is forecast to grow from about USD$11 billion  today to more than $48 billion by 2033. Blockchain just gives us a better way to do it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market may appear tethered to Bitcoin's dominance, but several altcoins are breaking away with explosive momentum. Recent data from CoinMarketCap's trend-tracking algorithm highlights three standout tokens: MYX Finance, Worldcoin, and KAITO. Each tells a very different story, ranging from speculative mania to institutional validation and niche innovation. MYX Finance has been the week's headline maker, soaring nearly 300% in a single day and more than 1,400% over the past week. The rally is fueled by excitement around its upcoming V2 launch, promising zero-slippage trading and broader cross-chain support. Yet the spectacular rise comes with red flags – thin liquidity and $14 million in short liquidations suggest the move is highly speculative. Traders will be watching closely to see if activity holds above half a billion dollars once the upgrade is live. With more than 26 million users, the project now faces the challenge of turning adoption into consistent growth while regulators scrutinize its biometric data model. KAITO is emerging as the poster child of a new trend dubbed “InfoFi,” which tokenizes access to crypto analytics. Its modest $334 million market cap leaves room for outsized gains, especially if partnerships materialize. Early listings, including on Niza.io, have added liquidity, but sustaining that volume will be key to keeping momentum alive. The bigger question is whether these assets can break free from Bitcoin's gravitational pull. With Bitcoin dominance still at 57% and the Altcoin Season Index climbing toward 60, the market may be preparing for a broader rotation. If Ethereum can sustain its momentum, these altcoins could mark the beginning of a more defined altcoin cycle. Grayscale is expanding its exchange-traded product lineup, filing fresh applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot ETFs tied to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC). Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as traders point to historical patterns and on-chain signals that suggest a major rally could be brewing. Cboe Global Markets has unveiled plans to roll out Continuous futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether on its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) starting November 10, 2025, pending regulatory approval. A closely watched technical setup is emerging across the altcoin market, and traders believe it could signal the start of a powerful new rally. As November draws near, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about which digital coins could deliver astronomical returns. Many cryptocurrencies with real promise are stumbling over new regulations. Yet, an unexpected player in the meme coin arena might break through these barriers. Amazon shareholders are gearing up for a pivotal decision at their annual meeting next year: whether the company should explore incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) into its corporate treasury. Amazon briefly sparked political controversy after exploring the idea of showing shoppers how tariffs are impacting product prices—a move that quickly drew fire from President Trump's team. Worksport, a US-based manufacturer, is making strides into the cryptocurrency space by incorporating Bitcoin and XRP into its corporate treasury strategy. A pastor from Washington state, Francier Obando Pinillo, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding over 1,500 people through a cryptocurrency scheme called Solano Fi. has introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act, a landmark bill that seeks to modernize federal home loan underwriting by including digital assets in mortgage eligibility assessments. An american has been sentenced to over seven years in prison for his involvement in a large-scale drug trafficking operation that relied on cryptocurrency for payments and money laundering. Connecticut has officially distanced itself from government adoption of digital assets like Bitcoin. On June 30, Governor Ned Lamont signed House Bill 7082 into law, placing sweeping restrictions on how the state and its agencies can engage with cryptocurrencies. -  The market sentiment around Stellar (XLM) had been bearish to start off July. -  Clandeno (CLD) is a decentralized P2P e-commerce platform unlocking blockchain-based secure transactions between buyers and sellers. Bitcoin's surge to new all-time highs is playing out differently than previous rallies, according to a July 11 report by crypto research and investment firm Matrixport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tinubu, speaking through the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, at the 18th Annual Banking and Finance Conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) in Abuja on Tuesday, said the speed at which Nigerians are embracing cryptocurrencies and other digital payment systems outside the traditional banking sector has become a matter of concern. President Bola Tinubu has directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other regulatory agencies to step up surveillance of cryptocurrency and digital payment transactions in the country. Tinubu, speaking through the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, at the 18th Annual Banking and Finance Conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) in Abuja on Tuesday, said the speed at which Nigerians are embracing cryptocurrencies and other digital payment systems outside the traditional banking sector has become a matter of concern. Many people now make payments without using the banking system. “To this end, I have directed capital market and banking authorities to get hold of this narrative and track it while it is still evolving,” he said He argued that digital tools, artificial intelligence, and open banking were no longer futuristic ideas but unavoidable realities Nigeria must embrace if its economy is to grow. For his part, Central Bank Governor, Olayemi Cardoso, boasted that diaspora remittances could rise to as much as $1billion every month by next year. “When we began this journey, remittances were at $250 million a month. By next year, our projection is $1billion a month,” Cardoso said. “Since 2024, 16 listed banks have raised more than N2.5 trillion in fresh capital to strengthen their balance sheets. “Net domestic credit to the private sector has risen to over N82 trillion this year, supporting businesses and job creation,” Olanrewaju said. In February, the Nigerian Government filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange company Binance Holdings Limited, seeking $79.51billion and ₦231million in damages for alleged economic losses caused by its operations in the country. Binance and its executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, were accused of violating Nigerian laws, including failure to register with the FIRS for tax compliance. The lawsuit included penalties for non-payment of taxes, interest rates based on the Central Bank of Nigeria's lending rate, and other financial sanctions. The FIRS alleges that Binance concealed its business activities despite having a significant economic presence in Nigeria.
