                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room: Fact or fiction with Pietro Fittipaldi 2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri It was a tense end to the Italian Grand Prix for McLaren as they issued team orders to Oscar Piastri following Lando Norris' slow pit stop. McLaren team boss Andrea Stella has opened up on the team orders situation that made headlines after the Italian Grand Prix, stressing how the outfit's actions backed up their “values and principles”. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri spent much of Sunday's race running in second and third respectively, before moving into a temporary 1-2 when Red Bull rival Max Verstappen pitted earlier on a different strategy. McLaren left it until Lap 45 to pit Piastri and Lap 46 to pit Norris, but a slow stop for the latter meant he lost out to his team mate and rejoined the action in third position – potentially costing him more ground in the title race. However, McLaren acted quickly by asking Piastri to move aside for Norris, reminding the Australian of last year's Hungarian Grand Prix and being told that the pair would be free to race to the chequered flag. As it transpired, Norris had enough in hand over Piastri during the final laps to secure second and reduce his team mate's championship lead from 34 points to 31, with all parties being asked for their thoughts on the situation post-race. Unfortunately, this compounded with the fact that we had a slow pit stop [for Norris]. Asked about the radio call that referenced Norris moving over for Piastri at the Hungaroring last season, and whether it was the best way to ensure the Australian would understand the call, Stella added: “Of course, we had Hungary, but after Hungary we had so many conversations, so much alignment with each other as to how we go racing, so I don't think we need to go so far back.</p>

His family's passion, hard work and sacrifice gave him a start. His talent saw him accelerate towards a racing career. A two-time World Champion saw he was special, and helped guide him to Formula 1. Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, Bortoleto looks back at his childhood, how his parents worked hard to fund his racing dream, how he made the difficult decision to leave them behind and go to Europe to further his career, and why Fernando Alonso's support was essential as he climbed the racing ladder. He explains how he is adjusting to the driving and living in the World Championship, the pride he feels representing Brazil, and what racing against experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg is teaching him. The Kick Sauber driver also reflects on how his manager and on-track rival Alonso continues to help him, and why he spends hours on his home simulator immediately after every race weekend.
