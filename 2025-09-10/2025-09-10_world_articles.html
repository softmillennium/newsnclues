                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was killed Wednesday after being shot at an event at Utah Valley University, President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Kirk's involvement began in the wake of the tea party movement and grew with Trump's ascendance. Having co-founded Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18, Kirk was a prominent supporter of Trump who courted young voters and used his network of nonprofits to seek to turn out voters on campuses and churches for Trump in 2024. Kirk frequently traveled to college campuses, speaking and taking questions from audience members in exchanges that often led to viral videos. Kirk's appearance at Utah Valley University on Wednesday was the first of a 14-city fall “American Comeback Tour.” Video taken by attendees shows the crowd screaming as Kirk recoiled in his seat and appeared to reach for his neck. Among those in attendance was former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican. He said on Fox News he was at the event with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. He said Kirk “came out, he was throwing hats, riling up the crowd,” and then started taking questions before the shot rang out. The American Comeback Tour had Kirk's signature “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where he would urge those who disagreed with him to debate an issue. Kirk was also an author and prominent media personality who hosted a daily three-hour radio show. He traveled with a private security contingent, a Turning Point USA aide traveling on the tour told CNN, whether he was speaking to large rallies like the one in Orem, Utah, or at smaller events. Trump has credited Kirk with galvanizing and mobilizing the youth vote for him. Kirk most recently appeared in the Oval Office in May, attending the swearing-in ceremony of Judge Jeanine Pirro. The president and dozens of other Kirk allies – as well as Democrats who had sharp disagreements with him – posted well-wishes and calls for prayer online in the wake of the shooting. An Illinois native, Kirk married Erika Frantzve in 2021. CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Aditi Sangal contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, died Wednesday after being shot at a college event, Trump said. Videos posted to social media from Utah Valley University show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators are heard gasping and screaming before people start to run away. “We are confirming that he was shot and we are praying for Charlie,” said Aubrey Laitsch, public relations manager for Turning Point USA. It was not clear if authorities were still searching the campus for a suspect. Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political organization. Immediately before the shooting, Kirk was taking questions for an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience members asked. Law enforcement tapes off an area after Charlie Kirk was shot.Tess Crowley/The Associated Press The event had been met with divided opinions on campus. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures.

Crowds scatter after a shot was fired at U.S. right-wing activist and commentator Charlie Kirk.Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribu/Reuters Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back. He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough. “And so we just don't have these types of things.” Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. But Kirk's zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers. Despite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president has previously praised Kirk as critical to his gains among young voters in last year's presidential election. White House staffers are deeply shaken after political activist and President Donald Trump's ally Charlie Kirk was shot today at an event in Utah. Charlie Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, was shot during an event at Utah Valley University, which located about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City. Utah's US senators said they're tracking the shooting of Trump ally Charlie Kirk. “I am tracking the situation at Utah Valley University closely. Please join me in praying for Charlie Kirk and the students gathered there,” GOP Sen. Mike Lee posted on X shortly after news of the shooting broke. GOP Sen. John Curtis wrote on X, “My heart goes out to Charlie, those in attendance, and their families. We are praying for his safety and the well-being of everyone impacted.” “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump has previously praised Kirk as critical to his gains among young voters in last year's presidential election. Former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, was an eyewitness to the shooting at Utah Valley University, describing the scene and its immediate aftermath in a phone interview with Fox News. The second question, he said, was about “transgender shootings” and “mass killings.” “When that happened, when that question came out, and he's you know, he's going to have the interaction, one shot. And I went from watching Charlie Kirk to looking over to make sure our daughter and our son-in-law were okay,” he said. Vice President JD Vance is calling for prayers after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot during an event in Utah. “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour,” the vice president later added. Kirk has been seen at the White House frequently during Trump's second administration. Gavin Newsom called the shooting of Charlie Kirk “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.” Notable figures are reacting to Charlie Kirk's shooting in Utah. Eric Trump: “Charlie Kirk is a great friend and an amazing person! Lara, Luke, Carolina and I will be praying for him, his wife Erika and their 2 children,” he said in a post on X. Kristi Noem: The secretary of Department of Homeland Security said, “Byron and I are lifting up Charlie, Erika, and their family in our prayers right now.” Pete Hegseth: “An incredible Christian, American, and human being. Mike Johnson: The House Speaker asked to pray “for our good friend, Charlie Kirk,” in a post on social media. Spencer Cox said he is being briefed by law enforcement after a shooting at Utah Valley University involving conservative influencer Charlie Kirk today. Cox said in a post on X that “those responsible will be held fully accountable.” “Americans of every political persuasion must unite in condemning this act,” the governor said. The FBI is “closely monitoring reports” that Charlie Kirk, a ally of President Donald Trump, was shot at Utah Valley University, the agency's director, Kash Patel, said on X. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said he's tracking the situation closely after Trump ally Charlie Kirk was shot at an event at the Utah Valley University. “I am tracking the situation at Utah Valley University closely. Please join me in praying for Charlie Kirk and the students gathered there,” Lee posted on X. Trump ally Charlie Kirk was shot at an event in Utah, a source familiar with the matter says. The extent of Kirk's injuries were not immediately clear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kremlin's war in Ukraine has spilled over into Nato country – but whether to create fear or test response, aim is unclear Whatever Donald Trump discussed with Vladimir Putin in Alaska last month, the outcome has only been a stepped increase in Russian aggression that has now forced Nato's military into action. On Tuesday night 19 Russian drones entered the country's airspace, according to the prime minister, Donald Tusk – a number that cannot be easily explained away as accidental. Though the drone incursion cannot be described as militarily significant (only one house has been reported damaged so far) the Polish incident is qualitatively different from anything that has happened since February 2022. This time the drones forced a closure of four airports overnight, some flying via Belarus. There is a fit with other post-Alaska Russian attacks in Ukraine, however. For the first time, a key Ukrainian government building, the cabinet building, was struck as part of a massive nationwide assault of more than 800 drones that stayed inside Ukraine. As for the overnight attack, it is not clear what, if anything, was being targeted. Flights paths are usually pre-set at launch, but they can be complicated. Belarus, an ally of Russia, said some drones had gone off-course because they were jammed, though that appears unlikely given that some drones landed well inside Poland. Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said their flight paths had been chosen deliberately and that there were “no grounds to suspect that this was a course-correction mistake”. The puzzling question, though, is what does Russia gain from such an obvious escalation? At the simplest level, there was an intention to create fear. A Russian military blogger with 1.65m followers took pleasure in claiming that a Russian Shahed was “flying towards the Polish city of Rzeszów” at just before 1am Polish time, emphasising that the city was where military logistics passed from the west to Ukraine. It is a concern that will be shared across eastern Europe, where memories of past Russian domination mingle with current concerns. Moscow may also have wanted to test Nato's air defences with its fast-evolving long-range drone capability, developed over three years of constantly attacking Ukraine. Dutch F-35 fighter jets flew alongside Polish F-16s, supported by German Patriot air defences and Italian AWACS mobile radar aircraft. And above all, there were no casualties or serious damage. But, Tusk said, only three or four of the drones were shot down – a low proportion, and well below anything that Ukraine achieves. The reality, as Hinz observed, is that western air defences have not been designed to tackle cheap swarms of Russian drones – Geberas are made of polystyrene and cost about $10,000 each. Effective ground-based air defences such as the German Gepard have relatively short ranges. Within hours the UK defence secretary, John Healey, said he had asked the British military to “look at options to bolster Nato's air defence over Poland”. But Moscow's most important audience is in the White House. The Polish incursion is a fresh test of US commitment to Nato, at a time when the White House has been considering whether to pull back from deployments in Europe in favour of defending its homeland and deterring China in Asia. Perhaps the Kremlin hopes that Trump will be so keen to avert escalating the US commitment to Europe that he will again pressure Ukraine into agreeing a peace on Russian terms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials claim FBI director said he had been instructed by White House to fire any agent who worked on an investigation of Trump The three officials, Brian Driscoll Jr, Steven Jensen and Spencer Evans, filed the lawsuit in federal court in Washington DC, asking a judge to declare their firings were illegal, reinstate them, and award them backpay. All three men had decades of service at the FBI. The complaint details an episode in which Patel allegedly told Driscoll he had been instructed by the White House to fire any agent who worked on an investigation of Donald Trump. Patel explained that there was nothing he or Driscoll could do to stop these or any other firings, because “the FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it”. Bove, the complaint says, also told Driscoll that he received pressure from White House aide Stephen Miller to fire FBI agents en masse. Bove also expressed his displeasure at videos that appeared to be created by FBI employees depicting him as the Batman villain Bane and Driscoll as Batman. “Driscoll responded that he did not make the video, nor could he control unknown individuals' feelings or expressions of said feelings,” the complaint says. “Driscoll stated that summarily firing Meyer would be illegal based on his military veteran status, and would also violate all established FBI policies for adverse actions against personnel,” the complaint says. “The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.” Bongino told Jensen that Giardina had “got to go”, the complaint says. Jensen refused to fire him, citing FBI protocols and the fact that Giardina, a veteran, had certain employment protections. Evans was targeted after a former FBI agent friendly with Patel alleged he had denied his request to be exempt from the bureau's Covid protocols. After the former agent, Kyle Seraphin, began accusing Patel of backing out of a promise to fire Evans, Evans was removed from his job in charge of the Las Vegas field office and reassigned to a job in Huntsville, Alabama. “Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one.” The FBI Agents Association said in a statement that FBI special agents have fewer career employment protections than many federal counterparts do. “The unlawfully fired employees who filed today's lawsuit are using the limited measures they do have to fight for their constitutional right to fair treatment and due process,” it said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recording on-duty law enforcement agents is protected by the First Amendment. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. However, recording law enforcement activities is protected by the First Amendment. “This right extends to private places, too, where the recorder has a legal right to be, such as in their own home,” the group explains. “However, if the law enforcement officer is off-duty or is in a private space that you don't have a right to be in, your right to record the officer may be limited.” The Center for Media and Democracy's report comes as DHS announced on Monday that it will be flooding Chicago with federal agents to ramp up deportations of immigrants in the city. In response, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois released a statement clarifying “what the law is when it comes to recording public officials — including ICE agents — operating in a public space.” The ACLU of Illinois says those who have been retaliated against for recording law enforcement can contact their office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, at Warsaw's request, has invoked the use of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty and launched consultations over the violation of Polish airspace by unmanned aerial vehicles, government spokesman Adam Szlapka told the Polsat TV channel. "NATO has invoked Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty," he said. Later, the spokesman wrote on the X social network that, at Poland's request, consultations were held within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Articles 4 and 5 of the treaty outline response measures by NATO countries in the event that one of them is threatened as well as the steps of the bloc's collective defense. According to their provisions, a threat to one NATO country is perceived as an attack on all the alliance's members. That said, the document does not indicate what exactly NATO may perceive as an attack or a threat, hence the consultation mechanism to talk over how to respond. Early on September 10, Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command reported the destruction of several objects identified as drones that had violated the country's airspace. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk reported that overnight from September 9 to September 10, 19 violations of the country's airspace were recorded, with all drones entering from Belarusian territory. So far, three drones have been shot down. In response to the incident, the Polish authorities decided to temporarily close airspace over part of the country, including Warsaw Chopin Airport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former vice-president says decision should not have ‘been left to an individual's ego' in new book Mrs Harris took over the 2024 Democratic nomination from Mr Biden after he was forced to drop out from the presidential race following a humiliating televised debate against Donald Trump. The former vice-president also said she felt “growing panic” about Mr Biden's second presidential campaign, and questioned if she should have spoken out. “Perhaps,” she concedes, but adds that Mr Biden is “the most consistently underestimated man in Washington”. “I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving,” she wrote. Further laying into Mr Biden and his team, she suggests his staff grew jealous of her when she outshone him in the polls. “Their thinking was zero-sum: If she's shining, he's dimmed. The former vice-president claimed concern among voters about Mr Biden's age was compounded by worries he was writing Israel a “blank cheque” for its war with Hamas. Mrs Harris also said she also resonated with Democrat voters in the ways she spoke about reproductive rights, a subject Mr Biden struggled to address, although his team was remiss to give her something she could “win with”. Instead, she was tasked with taking on irregular migration: “Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more.” She claims that when Republicans mischaracterised this role as “border czar” the White House did not help her to push back or highlight her progress. Instead she says she was forced to “shoulder the blame for the porous border,” and points out the administration did not defend her when Fox News made claims she was a DEI hire. But getting anything positive said about my work or any defence against untrue attacks was almost impossible,” she wrote. In another sore point, she recalls how Mr Biden did not mention or thank her until nine minutes into an 11-minute speech. The criticisms mark a sharp departure from Mrs Harris's previous remarks about Mr Biden, whom she struggled to differentiate herself from during the election campaign. Asked during an appearance on The View in October 2024 if there was anything she would have done differently from the president during the past four years, she said: “There is nothing that comes to mind.”</p>

MOSCOW, September 10. /TASS/. The Russian Defense Ministry is ready to hold consultations with its Polish counterparts 'on this matter,' the military agency said.

It reported that Russian forces had carried out a strike on Ukrainian military-industrial enterprises in the Ivano-Frankovsk, Khmelnitsky and Zhitomir regions, as well as on the cities of Vinnitsa and Lvov. No facilities in Poland were planned to be targeted. The range of the unmanned aerial vehicles that have purportedly crossed the Polish border does not surpass 700 kilometers.

"However, we are ready to hold consultations with the Polish Defense Ministry on this matter," the Russian Defense Ministry emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump does not believe Russia should be cut off from the global economy beyond the context of its war against Ukraine, Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with One America News Network published on Sept. 10. The statement comes as, despite Trump's repeated threats, his administration has imposed only limited penalties on Russia and, in some cases, has rolled back restrictions. The vice president added that Russia remains a resource powerhouse. "Let's be honest, whether you like or dislike Russia, whether you agree or disagree with their underlying arguments for the conflict, the simple fact is they've got a lot of oil," Vance said. His remarks come as Trump's peace proposals allegedly include lifting sanctions on Moscow, sparking concerns in Kyiv and Brussels that the West might lose leverage over the Kremlin. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Sept. 8 that Europe must cut purchases of Russian oil and gas if it wants Washington to step up sanctions to push Moscow toward meaningful negotiations. Indian officials said the tariffs would not halt their imports of Russian crude. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the following day that Washington is ready to expand secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil, though no further measures have been announced.

After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets. Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland on Sept. 10, in what became the largest attack on a NATO member state since the start of Moscow's all-out war against Ukraine. Poland, NATO's eastern frontline state, is facing its most serious security challenge in decades. Western officials have warned of the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia in the coming years, but are Poland — and NATO — truly prepared for such escalation? European leaders denounced Russia on Sept. 10 after Poland downed multiple Russian drones in its airspace, marking the first time a NATO member has destroyed Moscow's military assets over its territory during the war in Ukraine. "Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X, adding that those "that posed a direct threat were shot down." Article 4 of the NATO treaty allows member states to request consultations with the allies if they believe their security has been threatened, without triggering a military response. The proposed solution would stop short of confiscating Russian sovereign assets but provide additional funding to Ukraine as it faces Moscow's ongoing all-out invasion. "No evidence has been presented that these drones are of Russian origin," said Andrei Ordash, Moscow's charge d'affaires in Poland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story has been updated with additional details. Poland confirmed downing Russian drones in its airspace during a mass aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on Sept. 10 in what is the first case of a NATO member engaging Moscow's military assets over its territory during the war. "Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones," Tusk said on X, adding that those "that posed a direct threat were shot down." Polish authorities temporarily closed Warsaw's main Chopin Airport and placed the country's air defenses on high alert overnight after what they described as "an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects." The Polish Armed Forces' Operational Command said it had activated all necessary procedures to protect national airspace and scrambled both Polish and NATO aircraft in response to the threat. Earlier, Tusk confirmed that a military operation related to multiple violations of Polish airspace was underway without initially naming the drones' origin. Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly violated the airspace of Poland and other NATO members during strikes on Ukraine, but until Sept. 10, there had never been a confirmed case of local defenses shooting one down. Polish fighter jets have been scrambled before in response to the war, but previous deployments primarily involved monitoring or escorting Russian drones that briefly entered Polish airspace en route to targets in Ukraine — not engaging or shooting them down. The search for impact sites and wreckage is ongoing. Italian AWACS (Airborne early warning and control) surveillance planes and a refueling aircraft jointly operated by NATO were also involved in the operation, according to Reuters. Addressing the Polish parliament, Tusk said that 19 airspace violations were recorded, while three or four drones were shot down by Polish and allied planes — the last one at 6:45 a.m. local time. Another drone was found in a field in the central Lodz region near Mniszkow, a village roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the Ukrainian border. In addition to the drone remnants, a projectile fragment of unknown origin was also discovered at the scene, according to RMF FM. Polish authorities urged residents in the Podlaskie, Mazowieckie, and Lublin regions to stay indoors. "Our homeland's security is the highest priority and requires close cooperation," Nawrocki said on X. NATO spokesperson Allison Hart noted that the alliance is "consulting closely" with Warsaw. A notice published on the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website confirmed that Warsaw's main international airport was temporarily unavailable due to "unplanned military activity related to ensuring state security," as well as three other airports. A Kyiv Independent reporter at Warsaw's Chopin Airport said all flights were delayed, but airport officials were making no reference to Russian drones, only saying that the airspace was closed without providing further details. Congressman Joe Wilson called the Sept. 10 attack an "act of war." Russia is attacking NATO ally Poland with Iranian shahed drones less than a week after President Trump hosted President Nawrocki at the White House. This is an act of war, and we are grateful to NATO allies for their swift response to war criminal Putin's continued unprovoked… Senator Dick Durbin echoed Wilson's comments, adding that "repeated violations of NATO airspace by Russian drones are fair warning that Vladimir Putin is testing our resolve to protect Poland and the Baltic nations." U.S. President Donald Trump has not commented on the incident when asked by a reporter. "Putin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. "A weak response now will provoke Russia even more — and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe." Sybiha also said the case underscores why neighboring partner countries should intercept Russian projectiles already in Ukrainian airspace and help bolster Ukraine's own air defenses. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that according to "updated data, around two dozen Russian drones may have entered Polish airspace during the night." First drones crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border at around 0:50 a.m. Kyiv time, while at least two unmanned aircraft entered Polish airspace via Belarus, according to Zelensky. Zelensky offered to provide Poland with all relevant data on the latest attack and assist with setting up an effective alert and protection system. She added that there are indications the incursion "was intentional, not accidental." Earlier that night, Ukraine's Air Force reported on Telegram that Russian drones were moving westward and posed a potential threat to Zamosc, a Polish city located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Poland has raised an alarm over the upcoming exercises — set to begin on Sept. 12 — and announced plans to close its borders with Belarus for their duration. Russian drones flying into Poland during the massive attack on Ukraine show that Putin's sense of impunity keeps growing because he was not properly punished for his previous crimes.Putin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The developments come amid one of Russia's largest aerial assaults in recent weeks, targeting multiple Ukrainian regions and prompting alerts in neighboring countries. Ukrainian defenses intercepted 386 of the 415 strike and decoy drones and 27 of the 43 missiles launched by Russia overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force. It remains unclear whether Russia hit or targeted any military or other strategic targets in the attack on Ukraine, as Ukrainian authorities largely do not disclose such information for security reasons. This makes the full extent of casualties and damage impossible to verify. The Sept. 10 incident came just days after Russia launched its largest overnight attack, which killed at least four people and injured more than 40 across Ukraine, drawing swift condemnation from Kyiv's European partners. Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets. Decarlos Brown now faces a federal charge of murder committed on public transportation, in addition to an earlier state charge of first-degree murder.

Article 4 of the NATO treaty allows member states to request consultations with the allies if they believe their security has been threatened, without triggering a military response. The proposed solution would stop short of confiscating Russian sovereign assets but provide additional funding to Ukraine as it faces Moscow's ongoing all-out invasion. Once a settlement is reached, Washington could have "a very productive economic relationship" with both Kyiv and Moscow, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said. "No evidence has been presented that these drones are of Russian origin," said Andrei Ordash, Moscow's charge d'affaires in Poland. The remains of a projectile of an unknown origin were found in the Lublin province, Polish Interior Ministry spokesperson Karolina Galecka said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. STEVEN SIMON is a Visiting Professor and Distinguished Fellow at Dartmouth College and Senior Fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. HTS's leader, Ahmed al-Shara, created a government to oversee the country's transition. Shara is a former jihadist who once led al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. Since then, the United States has suspended sanctions against Syria and issued statements in support of Shara's interim government. Since Shara assumed power, he has courted foreign support by disavowing jihadism and raising the prospect of normalizing Syria's relations with Israel. Today, Syria is once again racked by violence, and Shara's coalition includes unreformed jihadists. The problem with Washington's Syria policy is not that it backs a former al-Qaeda ally but that it endorses Shara's vision of centralized rule over a diverse and sectarian country riven by deep mistrust. The transitional government in Damascus has fiercely repudiated federalism, which it sees as a prelude to anarchy, state disintegration, and the loss of HTS control. Nearby examples hardly inspire confidence: Lebanon's consociational system and Iraq's federal one are marginally functional. Shara and his closest advisers lack a clear vision of the country they want to build. Syria is likely to be ruled by a strongman, and without some form of federalism, intense intercommunal violence will continue. If minorities fear a predatory central government, they will resist and potentially enlist outside powers in their fight. A return to civil war is not out of the question. Syria's partners, including the United States, should encourage a power-sharing arrangement. When Assad was toppled, Shara struck many foreign governments as the right person to govern Syria. Washington recognized that its influence over the transition would be limited. The United States did have clout in northeastern Syria because for years it maintained a small military presence there to prevent the reemergence of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and to disrupt Iran's access to Lebanon. Now that ISIS appears a shell of its former self and Syria is run by a government that is staunchly opposed to Iran, Trump has begun to remove troops from seven of the eight U.S. bases in Syria. There was a moment following Shara's seizure of power when relief at Assad's departure and longing for stability might have laid the groundwork for uncompromising centralization. The composition of Assad's support base was, in reality, more complicated. Plenty of Sunnis supported and fought for the old regime. Wherever the balance of vice and virtue lay, Shara's government appeared to condone retributive violence. Although Bedouin tribes and Druze joined forces against Assad during the civil war, they have long been at odds. Competition for resources has renewed their old rivalry, and radical Islamist influencers on Telegram, a messaging app, have whipped up sectarian animosity between the two sides and have exulted in the murder and rape of Druze villagers. Israel views itself as a protector of the Druze because it has its own substantial Druze minority and wants the Syrian Druze to serve as a buffer between Israel and the new Islamist regime in Damascus. If Israel had not intervened, many more people may have died. Shara is inclined to use force to get what he wants and has a formidable tool in the Bedouin fighters at his disposal. In July, Shara's government was able to mobilize Bedouin forces from nearly all parts of Syria, aided by jihadist online influencers, many of whom are not affiliated with the government. This burgeoning digital network has terrified vulnerable minority communities, as has the government's refusal since the attacks to guarantee Druze security or allow enough aid to pass into Suwayda. Officials within Shara's government believe that any concessions to Druze would reward them for rebellion. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Kurdish militia that includes Arab fighters, allied with American troops to defeat ISIS in Syria. In pursuit of centralized rule, Shara has pressed the SDF to surrender its arms and integrate with a new Syrian army that would replace Assad's military. But after witnessing the regime support attacks on Alawites and Druze, the Kurds have lost whatever appetite they might have had for surrendering their arsenals and melting into Shara's army. The interim government was meant to hold talks with SDF leaders in Paris this summer but withdrew in August, saying that the time for negotiation was over and that the issue of Kurdish integration would be settled “on the ground,” presumably by force, with Deir ez-Zor as a possible starting point. Still, Shara's forces don't seem strong enough to subsume or challenge Kurdish militias. Even if Damascus succeeded in organizing, training, and equipping an army of this size, it would be responsible for huge swaths of land, so the SDF would continue to enjoy superiority over the smaller territory it controls. Druze leaders, who have historically been factionalized, have united to reject efforts to absorb their land into a centralized state dominated by HTS. The result will be more bloodshed, greater opportunities for foreign states—such as Israel or Iran—to intervene in Syria, and the continued impoverishment and immiseration of ordinary Syrians of all stripes. The United States would be wise to stop rejecting federalism and encourage the transfer of some power to local or regional authorities. It would also be preferable to Iraq's system, which is plagued by endless economic disputes because it devolves significant power to the Kurdistan Regional Government. Although Lebanon and Iraq still have problems, they would be worse off if their central governments were not constrained. Washington must try to persuade Syrian leaders that their quest for total centralization of power will backfire by driving intercommunal wedges deeper, stoking violence, depressing economic growth, and weakening their international credibility. The office of the U.S. special envoy for Syria still maintains that it has complete faith in Shara's competence and his commitment to a pluralistic Syria but is more wary about the high cost and feasibility of centralized rule. In August, Barrack said he supported “something short of [a federation].” Ultimately, Syrians will determine their own system of government, and that is how it should be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activists with Code Pink, an anti-war group, called the US president the ‘Hitler of our time' as they disrupted his dinner Donald Trump was shouted at by pro-Palestine protesters who accused him of being “the Hitler of our time” as he went out for dinner in Washington DC.The president took a rare evening off to sit down for a meal with members of his cabinet as he attempted to demonstrate that his crime crackdown in the US capital was working.Mr Trump has claimed the capital's nightlife is booming as a result of decreased crime levels after he took over the city's police force and deployed the national guard.Trumpeting the success of his policy, Mr Trump treated members of the administration to a meal at Joe's Seafood, located just a stone's throw from the White House. Ahead of the president's arrival, the restaurant was screened off by secret service agents, who performed security checks and turned away diners hoping to grab a walk-in table, according to the Washingtonian's food editor. In a video obtained by CNN, you can see the president is approached by protestors chanting "Free DC" and "Free Palestine" as he makes his way to his table pic.twitter.com/593jx6qMc7 But as the president sat down at his table, several women began to loudly protest, a clip shared by a CNN reporter on social media shows. In the clip, JD Vance, the US vice president, is shown shaking hands with diners amid the disturbance, telling them to “enjoy your dinner”, while Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth stands and looks on uncomfortably. The protesters were members of Code Pink, a female-led anti-war activism group. “Trump looked us in the eyes, we made sure he will never dine in peace while communities are under siege,” the group posted on Instagram after confronting the president. In a video posted to social media, one of the women who protested in the restaurant said: “We are not afraid of Trump”, adding, “he looked us right in the eyes and we stood our ground, we will continue to be steadfast in our call for the end of the occupation”. People are going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years, and it's a safe city.” Yet despite Mr Trump's claims of bringing back nightlife to the nation's capital, research from OpenTable found that the number of diners dipped by a third last month, compared to the same period in 2024. Founded in Miami, Florida, where Mr Trump spends his weekends during the colder months at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Joe's Seafood specialises in steak and crab. The president, who is known for his fast-food heavy diet, is likely to settle down in the wood-panelled dining room with a New York strip steak ($69.95) which he prefers cooked well-done, or perhaps a classic cheeseburger ($21.95), which comes with a side of French fries. A Washington Post review from last year said the dining room, where waiters wear tuxedos and bow ties, had the atmosphere of a “timeless supper club” and recommended the steak as well as the four-piece golden brown fried chicken. Mr Trump, who has declared his law and order blitz a roaring success, went on to repeat threats to expand the operation to other cities as soon as tomorrow. “The governor of a certain state would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city and same state would love us to be there,” he said, in a veiled nod to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. A month after Mr Trump announced he would deploy the National Guard in DC to rid the city of “wild youths and maniacs”, crime in the city is down, homeless camps have been cleared, and hundreds of people accused of arriving in the US illegally have been detained.</p>
