            Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was killed Wednesday after being shot at an event at Utah Valley University, President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. He was 31.
    


            As Trump remade the Republican Party, Kirk embodied the party's newfound populist conservatism in the social media age.
    


            Kirk's involvement began in the wake of the tea party movement and grew with Trump's ascendance. Having co-founded Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18, Kirk was a prominent supporter of Trump who courted young voters and used his network of nonprofits to seek to turn out voters on campuses and churches for Trump in 2024.
    


            Kirk frequently traveled to college campuses, speaking and taking questions from audience members in exchanges that often led to viral videos. Kirk's appearance at Utah Valley University on Wednesday was the first of a 14-city fall “American Comeback Tour.”
    


            Kirk was answering a question at the event when a single pop was heard. Video taken by attendees shows the crowd screaming as Kirk recoiled in his seat and appeared to reach for his neck.
    


            Among those in attendance was former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican. He said on Fox News he was at the event with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. He said Kirk “came out, he was throwing hats, riling up the crowd,” and then started taking questions before the shot rang out.
    


            “I was watching Charlie. I can't say that I saw blood. I can't say that I saw him get hit, but I did see him fall immediately backwards into his left,” he said.
    


            The American Comeback Tour had Kirk's signature “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where he would urge those who disagreed with him to debate an issue.
    


            Kirk was also an author and prominent media personality who hosted a daily three-hour radio show. He traveled with a private security contingent, a Turning Point USA aide traveling on the tour told CNN, whether he was speaking to large rallies like the one in Orem, Utah, or at smaller events.
    


            Trump has credited Kirk with galvanizing and mobilizing the youth vote for him. Kirk most recently appeared in the Oval Office in May, attending the swearing-in ceremony of Judge Jeanine Pirro.
    


            The president and dozens of other Kirk allies – as well as Democrats who had sharp disagreements with him – posted well-wishes and calls for prayer online in the wake of the shooting.
    


            An Illinois native, Kirk married Erika Frantzve in 2021. The couple had two young children.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, died Wednesday after being shot at a college event, Trump said.

The co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA, the 31-year-old Kirk is the latest victim in a spasm of political violence across the United States.

Videos posted to social media from Utah Valley University show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” 

A single shot rings out and Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators are heard gasping and screaming before people start to run away. The AP was able to confirm the videos were taken at Sorensen Center courtyard on the Utah Valley University campus.

“We are confirming that he was shot and we are praying for Charlie,” said Aubrey Laitsch, public relations manager for Turning Point USA.

A person who was arrested at Utah Valley University was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not clear if authorities were still searching the campus for a suspect.

Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political organization. Immediately before the shooting, Kirk was taking questions for an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence.

“Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience members asked. Kirk responded: “Too many.”

The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”

“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked.

Then a single shot rang out.

The event had been met with divided opinions on campus. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.”

Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit to Utah colleges was sparking controversy. He wrote, “What's going on in Utah?”

Trump and a host of Republican and Democratic elected officials decried the shooting and offered prayers for Kirk on social media.

“We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot. A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

The shooting comes amid a spike in political violence in the United States across all parts of the ideological spectrum. The attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade to demand Hamas release hostages, and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania's governor, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a campaign rally last year.

Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back.

“It seemed like it was a close shot,” Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke.

He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough.

“Utah is one of the safest places on the planet,” he said. “And so we just don't have these types of things.”

Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.

But Kirk's zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers.

Despite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, during the general election campaign.

Soon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences.

Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was in critical condition at a Utah hospital Wednesday after being shot at a college event, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. A suspect was in custody, the college said.

Videos posted to social media from Utah Valley University show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” 

A single shot rings out and Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators are heard gasping and screaming before people start to run away. The AP was able to confirm the videos were taken at Sorensen Center courtyard on the Utah Valley University campus.

“We are confirming that he was shot and we are praying for Charlie,” said Aubrey Laitsch, public relations manager for Turning Point USA.

Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political organization. The event had been met with divided opinions on campus. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.”

Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit to Utah colleges was sparking controversy. He wrote, “What's going on in Utah?”

The college said a “single shot” had been fired at Kirk and a suspect was in custody.

U.S. President Donald Trump and a host of Republican and Democratic elected officials decried the shooting and offered prayers for Kirk on social media.

“We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot. A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

The shooting comes amid a spike in political violence in the United States across all parts of the ideological spectrum. The attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade to demand Hamas release hostages, and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania's governor, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a campaign rally last year.

Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back.

“It seemed like it was a close shot,” Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke.

He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough.

“Utah is one of the safest places on the planet,” he said. “And so we just don't have these types of things.”

            “A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” the president continued.

            “People were there. And there were lots of them. You know, he came out, he was throwing hats, riling up the crowd,” he said.
    


            Chaffetz said that Kirk took a first question, which he described as a “religious question.”
    


            The second question, he said, was about “transgender shootings” and “mass killings.”
    


            “When that happened, when that question came out, and he's you know, he's going to have the interaction, one shot. I was watching Charlie. I can't say that I saw blood. I can't say that I saw him get hit, but I did see him fall immediately backwards into his left,” Chaffetz said, pausing at one point to catch his breath.
    


            “As soon as the shot went out, everybody hit the deck and everybody started scattering and yelling and screaming, as you might imagine. And I went from watching Charlie Kirk to looking over to make sure our daughter and our son-in-law were okay,” he said.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and FBI are on scene.

            “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour,” the vice president later added.
    


            Vance, along with President Donald Trump, is close with the Turning Point USA founder and top ally of the administration.
    


            Kirk has been seen at the White House frequently during Trump's second administration.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the shooting of Charlie Kirk “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.”
    


            “In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form,” Newsom said in a post on X.
    


            Notable figures are reacting to Charlie Kirk's shooting in Utah. Here's a look at what they are saying:

            “Americans of every political persuasion must unite in condemning this act,” the governor said.
    


            The FBI is “closely monitoring reports” that Charlie Kirk, a ally of President Donald Trump, was shot at Utah Valley University, the agency's director, Kash Patel, said on X.
    


                    “Agents will be on the scene quickly and the FBI stands in full support of the ongoing response and investigation,” Patel said.

Kremlin's war in Ukraine has spilled over into Nato country – but whether to create fear or test response, aim is unclear

Whatever Donald Trump discussed with Vladimir Putin in Alaska last month, the outcome has only been a stepped increase in Russian aggression that has now forced Nato's military into action. On Tuesday night 19 Russian drones entered the country's airspace, according to the prime minister, Donald Tusk – a number that cannot be easily explained away as accidental.

Until that point, Russia's war in Ukraine had not spilled over in a notable way to a Nato country. Though the drone incursion cannot be described as militarily significant (only one house has been reported damaged so far) the Polish incident is qualitatively different from anything that has happened since February 2022.

A month ago a single Russian drone exploded in eastern Poland, which was at the time notable. Two days ago, Estonia complained that a Russian Mi-8 attack helicopter had violated its airspace in the Baltic Sea for the third time this year. This time the drones forced a closure of four airports overnight, some flying via Belarus.

There is a fit with other post-Alaska Russian attacks in Ukraine, however. Last month, Russia returned to its campaign of bombing Ukrainian cities, killing at least 18 people in Kyiv in late August. On Sunday, the Kremlin went one further. For the first time, a key Ukrainian government building, the cabinet building, was struck as part of a massive nationwide assault of more than 800 drones that stayed inside Ukraine.

As for the overnight attack, it is not clear what, if anything, was being targeted. Flights paths are usually pre-set at launch, but they can be complicated. Belarus, an ally of Russia, said some drones had gone off-course because they were jammed, though that appears unlikely given that some drones landed well inside Poland.

One fragment was found in Olesno, 250 miles from the Ukrainian border, and the drone landed in a field at Mniszków, about 160 miles in. Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said their flight paths had been chosen deliberately and that there were “no grounds to suspect that this was a course-correction mistake”.

So far, as Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies has noted, all of the drone fragments recovered in Poland were of cheap, light Gerbera models, usually used as unarmed decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences, not more dangerous Shaheds, which can carry 20kg of explosive or more.

The puzzling question, though, is what does Russia gain from such an obvious escalation? At the simplest level, there was an intention to create fear. A Russian military blogger with 1.65m followers took pleasure in claiming that a Russian Shahed was “flying towards the Polish city of Rzeszów” at just before 1am Polish time, emphasising that the city was where military logistics passed from the west to Ukraine.

Citizens in three eastern Polish regions were told to remain indoors on Tuesday night, while one Polish media outlet, Wyborcza, discussed “what should be in an evacuation backpack” in its liveblog. It is a concern that will be shared across eastern Europe, where memories of past Russian domination mingle with current concerns.

Moscow may also have wanted to test Nato's air defences with its fast-evolving long-range drone capability, developed over three years of constantly attacking Ukraine. For the European defenders, the results were mixed. Certainly Nato mounted an impressive multinational defensive operation, the heart of the alliance's purpose.

Dutch F-35 fighter jets flew alongside Polish F-16s, supported by German Patriot air defences and Italian AWACS mobile radar aircraft. And above all, there were no casualties or serious damage. But, Tusk said, only three or four of the drones were shot down – a low proportion, and well below anything that Ukraine achieves. Last night Ukraine's air force reported eliminating 93% – 386 out of 415.

The reality, as Hinz observed, is that western air defences have not been designed to tackle cheap swarms of Russian drones – Geberas are made of polystyrene and cost about $10,000 each. Effective ground-based air defences such as the German Gepard have relatively short ranges. Using planes is potentially expensive and “requires a high pace of operations if the threat is continuous”.

Otherwise, the gain for Russia is less obvious. Within hours the UK defence secretary, John Healey, said he had asked the British military to “look at options to bolster Nato's air defence over Poland”. One option is to return the six RAF Typhoons that were deployed in policing Polish skies six weeks ago alongside the Dutch jets, so the most likely immediate outcome is more Nato in eastern Europe, rather than less.

But Moscow's most important audience is in the White House. The Polish incursion is a fresh test of US commitment to Nato, at a time when the White House has been considering whether to pull back from deployments in Europe in favour of defending its homeland and deterring China in Asia. Perhaps the Kremlin hopes that Trump will be so keen to avert escalating the US commitment to Europe that he will again pressure Ukraine into agreeing a peace on Russian terms.

Matthew Savill, from the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, wonders if the Kremlin intends “to expose differences in response – the US might be blase while the Europeans split along a spectrum of how firm to be”. In that respect it is an unsettling moment. Without a firm diplomatic response, perhaps in the form of sanctions escalation, there is every possibility the Kremlin will harass Poland in a similar fashion – or somewhere else in eastern Europe.

Officials claim FBI director said he had been instructed by White House to fire any agent who worked on an investigation of Trump

US politics live – latest updates

Three former senior officials at the FBI have sued its director, Kash Patel, and the federal government for wrongful termination, saying there had been widespread unlawful political influence at the bureau.

The three officials, Brian Driscoll Jr, Steven Jensen and Spencer Evans, filed the lawsuit in federal court in Washington DC, asking a judge to declare their firings were illegal, reinstate them, and award them backpay.

Driscoll briefly served as the acting director of the FBI after Trump's inauguration, Jensen was in charge of the Washington field office, and Evans was a top official in the department's human resources division and most recently the head of the agency's Las Vegas field office. All three men had decades of service at the FBI.

The complaint details an episode in which Patel allegedly told Driscoll he had been instructed by the White House to fire any agent who worked on an investigation of Donald Trump.

“Patel explained that he had to fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the president,” the complaint says. Patel explained that there was nothing he or Driscoll could do to stop these or any other firings, because “the FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it”.

The complaint also alleges Emil Bove, a staunch Trump ally and former top justice department official, asked Driscoll to compile a list of agents who worked on the investigation into the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. When Driscoll said the mass firing of those agents would not comply with FBI protocol and would endanger national security, Bove said they would be referred to the justice department for a misconduct review.

Bove, the complaint says, also told Driscoll that he received pressure from White House aide Stephen Miller to fire FBI agents en masse.

Bove also expressed his displeasure at videos that appeared to be created by FBI employees depicting him as the Batman villain Bane and Driscoll as Batman. “Driscoll responded that he did not make the video, nor could he control unknown individuals' feelings or expressions of said feelings,” the complaint says.

The firings of the three men was one of the most brazen examples of how Trump has politicized and weaponized law enforcement to target his political rivals.

“Driscoll, Jensen, and Evans were the targets of defendants' retribution for their refusals to politicize the FBI, and they seek to vindicate their constitutional and legal rights,” the complaint says.

Driscoll was fired after he opposed the firing of Christopher Meyer, an agent who had been wrongly accused of being involved in the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.

“Driscoll stated that summarily firing Meyer would be illegal based on his military veteran status, and would also violate all established FBI policies for adverse actions against personnel,” the complaint says. “Patel responded that Meyer would be fired by Friday August 8 2025, and that there was nothing either Patel or Driscoll could say or do that would stop it.”

“Patel acknowledged that the FBI would be sued and would lose in court,” the complaint says.

In a statement, Driscoll, who served as the acting FBI director after Trump's inauguration, said: “The men and women of the FBI make countless sacrifices to accomplish the bureau's mission: protecting the American people and upholding the constitution. That's why it is necessary to detail the politically motivated actions that led to our firings.

“The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.”

The complaint also details how Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, pressured Jensen to fire Walter Giardina, an FBI agent who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump and was involved in the arrest of Trump ally Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress. Bongino told Jensen that Giardina had “got to go”, the complaint says. Jensen refused to fire him, citing FBI protocols and the fact that Giardina, a veteran, had certain employment protections.

Evans was targeted after a former FBI agent friendly with Patel alleged he had denied his request to be exempt from the bureau's Covid protocols. After the former agent, Kyle Seraphin, began accusing Patel of backing out of a promise to fire Evans, Evans was removed from his job in charge of the Las Vegas field office and reassigned to a job in Huntsville, Alabama. As he was packing his truck to move, he was told he was fired. Evans was reportedly told he was not being fired for discipline, performance or misconduct.

“The public's confidence in the FBI hinges on the commitment of every FBI employee, from the newest special agent to the director, to relentlessly adhere to the rule of law without fear or favor,” Evans said in a statement. “Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one.”

The FBI Agents Association said in a statement that FBI special agents have fewer career employment protections than many federal counterparts do. “The unlawfully fired employees who filed today's lawsuit are using the limited measures they do have to fight for their constitutional right to fair treatment and due process,” it said.

            The NCAA announced three Division I men's basketball players are permanently ineligible after an investigation uncovered that they were involved in sports-betting game manipulation.
    


            “As part of a coordinated effort, the student-athletes bet on their own games, one another's games and/or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season,” a Wednesday NCAA press release states.
    


            The players involved were Mykell Robinson, Steven Vasquez and Jalen Weaver. All three men had played for Fresno State, while Vasquez later transferred to San Jose State.
    


            Fresno State and San Jose State were not penalized for the players' misconduct, the NCAA said. The three players are no longer enrolled at their previous schools.
    


            Robinson and Vasquez did not cooperate with the investigation, according to the NCAA release, while Weaver agreed to the violation in his case.
    


            Notifications from Fresno State and a sports betting integrity monitor about suspicious prop bets placed on Robinson triggered the NCAA investigation, according to the release. That led to evidence that the three players shared information on individual betting lines to manipulate outcomes to win prop bets.
    


            The NCAA shared in its findings Wednesday:
    


                    “Robinson and Vasquez had been roommates at Fresno State during the 2023-24 season. In January 2025, Robinson and Vasquez — who was then competing for San Jose State — discussed over text message that Robinson planned to underperform in several statistical categories during one regular-season game. Robinson, Vasquez and a third party bet a combined $2,200 on Robinson for his under-line performance in those categories. As a result of Robinson's underperformance, a $15,950 payout was redistributed among those who had bet.
                





                    “During that same season, Robinson also placed 13 daily fantasy sports over-line and under-line prop bets, totaling $454, on parlays that included his own performance. Robinson did not win on all of the bets but did collect $618 on one occasion.
                





                    “Notably, Robinson placed multiple bets on Weaver — who was Robinson's teammate at Fresno State — including two bets placed before a game in late December 2024 after he and Weaver exchanged information about their respective betting lines. As a result of that coordination, Weaver also placed a $50 prop bet on a parlay for himself, Robinson and a third student-athlete, and he won $260.”
                





            Per current NCAA guidelines for Division I members, the default punishment for an athlete who bet on his or her games is permanent ineligibility. However, an athlete who violated that rule could potentially be reinstated with the help of an NCAA school.
    


            Robinson played in 17 games for Fresno State last season, starting 16, and averaged 10.3 points per game. Weaver started 24 of his 25 games for the Bulldogs, averaging 12.5 points per game.
    


            Vasquez appeared in 29 games over four seasons – three with Fresno State and last season for San Jose State.

Donna Hughes-Brown, who has lived in US since 1977 and wrote cheque a decade ago, being held in isolation by Ice

An Irish grandmother who has lived in the US for most of her life and holds a green card is facing deportation because she wrote a bad cheque for $25 in 2015.

Donna Hughes-Brown, 58, was detained in July after landing in Chicago on a flight from Dublin and is being held in isolation in a detention centre in Kentucky. She has lived in the US since 1977, has five children and grandchildren, and ran a horse farm in Troy, Missouri.

Her husband, Jim Brown, a US citizen and military veteran, told reporters his wife was not a criminal and that he “100%” regretted voting for Donald Trump as president.

He said she had been detained on a misdemeanour relating to a $25 cheque she signed a decade ago and for which she made restitution and received probation.

She was detained under legislation amended on 4 July as part of Trump's sweeping “one big beautiful bill” act. The couple visited Ireland that month for a funeral. When they landed at Chicago's O'Hare airport on 29 July a police officer was waiting for her on the ramp.

Five days later she was transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Kentucky, where she told her husband conditions were “deplorable”. He lost contact with her this week when she was moved to an isolation cell, he told the Irish Times.

Brown thinks her requests for low-sodium diet might be the reason she was moved. “[They] tried to feed her hot dogs and chilli mac. She probably told them after the fifth time they tried to serve her: ‘I'm not eating that.' So they locked her up. I haven't heard from her in three days now.”

Brown said a deportation was scheduled for 17 September. “Hopefully they'll dismiss it. We have 40 character witnesses we sent to the lawyer.”

Hughes-Brown was born in England and grew up in Ireland before moving as an 11-year-old to the US, where she renewed her green card but never became a citizen.

Brown told Newsweek that his wife did volunteer work for the homeless and poor. Last October, instead of celebrating her birthday, she helped to fill a horse trailer with supplies for victims of Hurricane Helene and delivered it to North Carolina, he said.

Brown, who served in the navy and marines for decades, said he had supported Trump's promise to deport “criminal illegal immigrants” but that federal authorities were targeting other people to reach quotas.

“You look at the news, and they're not telling the truth about what's actually happening to a lot of legal immigrants. What's bad is that Trump is so demeaning to people, and he's so condescending and so retaliatory that people are afraid to say anything.”

The case has parallels with other cases, including that of Cliona Ward, a green card holder who was detained in April at San Francisco airport after a visit to Ireland because of offences dating back almost 20 years. She was released in May.

            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer moved on Wednesday to force a vote on releasing documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, putting the contentious issue front-and-center in the chamber.
    


            Schumer took a brazen procedural step on the Senate floor in order to trigger the vote.
    


            Traditionally, only the majority party takes the procedural step of “filing cloture” to set up a floor vote on a measure. In filing cloture himself and tying it to the must-pass annual defense policy package as an amendment, Schumer has guaranteed a full Senate vote.
    


            A Republican source warned that this move will be seen as a hostile act, which could jeopardize bipartisan negotiations on the defense package. Another Republican source said that it is not viewed as a serious attempt to release the Epstein files, as even GOP senators who want to see the documents released object to how Schumer has handled this.
    


            “The bottom line is the American people need to see this,” Schumer said. “The American people, Democrats, independents, Republicans are demanding it be made public, and it should be. We hope Republicans will vote for it. They should.”
    


            Asked why he didn't push for the release of the Epstein files when Democrats were in control of the chamber, Schumer said, “It's become so apparent that they're lying about it in every different way, and the demands of the American people are so great, and you've had all the different people come down and testify and this and that. The need is greater than ever now.”
    


            Schumer's office says that the text is identical to GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna's resolution in the House, and if passed, it would require the Justice Department to release all of the Epstein files within 30 days of passage.

Texas A&M also removes two senior administrators from roles after student's video sparked Republican pressure

A children's literature professor at Texas A&M was fired on Tuesday after a video showing a student objecting to course material about gender identity and sexuality went viral.

Both the dean of the school's college of arts and science and the head of department were also removed from their roles, the university president, Mark Welsh III, said in a statement.

The undated video does not show the professor or the student involved.

“I'm not sure this is legal to be teaching,” the student says. “According to our president, there's only two genders and he said he would be freezing agencies' funding programs that promote gender ideology. And this also very much goes against, not only myself but a lot of people's religious beliefs.”

Welsh said he had first learned of potential issues with the course over the summer and “made changes to ensure this course content does not continue in future semesters”.

“I made it clear to our academic leadership that course content must match catalog descriptions for each and every one of our course sections,” he wrote in a letter to faculty and students on Tuesday. “I learned late yesterday that despite that directive, the college continued to teach content that was inconsistent with the published course description for another course this fall.”

The firing of the professor, whom university officials have identified as Melissa McCoul, comes shortly after Welsh appeared in another video in which he told the student that firing the professor was “not happening”, according to the Texas Tribune.

“It is unacceptable for A&M system faculty to push a political agenda,” Glenn Hegar, the school's chancellor, said in a statement. “Early investigations appear to indicate this course failed to comply with clear instructions to align course descriptions with course materials.”

Texas A&M passed an audit earlier this year to ensure that the school complies with a new state law banning DEI in public universities, according to the Battalion, the student newspaper.

The videos prompted enormous pressure on the school from Republican politicians and officials. Brian Harrison, a Republican state lawmaker, posted the clips as well as what he said was material from the class and asked Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, to intervene to get the professor fired. He also asked the Trump administration to intervene. The post was amplified by Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the justice department's civil rights division.

Abbott called for McCourt's firing and cheered the removals on X. “The professor has now been fired,” he posted on Tuesday.

Recording on-duty law enforcement agents is protected by the First Amendment.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says filming and posting videos of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents constitutes “violence,” and has threatened to potentially charge people who take videos and photos of agents conducting immigration raids in their communities, despite First Amendment protections.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told the Center for Media and Democracy that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxxing our agents.” 

“We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.

In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem made a similar remark, saying that “violence” against ICE agents includes “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations.”

However, recording law enforcement activities is protected by the First Amendment. 

“Federal appellate courts typically frame the right to record law enforcement as the right to record officers exercising their official duties in public,” reads an Electronic Frontier Foundation guide on the topic entitled “Yes, You Have the Right to Film ICE.”

“This right extends to private places, too, where the recorder has a legal right to be, such as in their own home,” the group explains. “However, if the law enforcement officer is off-duty or is in a private space that you don't have a right to be in, your right to record the officer may be limited.” 

The Center for Media and Democracy's report comes as DHS announced on Monday that it will be flooding Chicago with federal agents to ramp up deportations of immigrants in the city. In response, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois released a statement clarifying “what the law is when it comes to recording public officials — including ICE agents — operating in a public space.”

The group noted: “To be clear, if you witness ICE activity in our community, you have the right to record a federal officer in public — including those engaged in immigration enforcement. The ACLU of Illinois encourages people recording those interactions to do so from a safe distance that does not obstruct the activity.” 

The ACLU of Illinois says those who have been retaliated against for recording law enforcement can contact their office.

Even though recording law enforcement activity is protected by the First Amendment, that did not stop ICE agents from attacking and jailing PhD student Job Garcia in June while he was documenting an ICE raid outside a Home Depot in Hollywood, California. 

“With no warning from an agent to Mr. Garcia, one of the masked agents then turned around and lunged at Mr. Garcia, reaching for Mr. Garcia's phone,” reads the claim filed on Garcia's behalf by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) against Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol, and ICE. 

“Mr. Garcia began to move backward and away from the agents,” the claim continues. “Then, the agent who lunged grabbed Mr. Garcia's phone, threw it to the ground, and tackled Mr. Garcia. Other agents, including one unmasked agent, almost immediately joined in assisting to restrain Mr. Garcia. One masked agent then retrieved Mr. Garcia's phone and placed it in Mr. Garcia's pocket as he was on the ground.”

One of the agents at the scene began speaking to Garcia in Spanish and continued to do so even after Garcia responded in English. Garcia's attempts to prove he was an American citizen were fruitless. A non-Latinx white male was also recording, but he was not arrested or tackled. 

Garcia was handcuffed and taken to Dodger Stadium, where officers interrogated him. They then took him to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal jail in downtown Los Angeles. He was released the next day.

“Mr. Garcia has previously recorded and photographed protests and community events centered around immigrants' rights as a personal passion,” the claim says. “Even though he would like to continue to document and photograph events and protests, he is fearful of encountering federal immigration agents and experiencing their abuses again.”

Recording on-duty law enforcement agents is protected by the First Amendment.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says filming and posting videos of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents constitutes “violence,” and has threatened to potentially charge people who take videos and photos of agents conducting immigration raids in their communities, despite First Amendment protections.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told the Center for Media and Democracy that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxxing our agents.” 

“We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.

In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem made a similar remark, saying that “violence” against ICE agents includes “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations.”

However, recording law enforcement activities is protected by the First Amendment. 

“Federal appellate courts typically frame the right to record law enforcement as the right to record officers exercising their official duties in public,” reads an Electronic Frontier Foundation guide on the topic entitled “Yes, You Have the Right to Film ICE.”

“This right extends to private places, too, where the recorder has a legal right to be, such as in their own home,” the group explains. “However, if the law enforcement officer is off-duty or is in a private space that you don't have a right to be in, your right to record the officer may be limited.” 

The Center for Media and Democracy's report comes as DHS announced on Monday that it will be flooding Chicago with federal agents to ramp up deportations of immigrants in the city. In response, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois released a statement clarifying “what the law is when it comes to recording public officials — including ICE agents — operating in a public space.”

The group noted: “To be clear, if you witness ICE activity in our community, you have the right to record a federal officer in public — including those engaged in immigration enforcement. The ACLU of Illinois encourages people recording those interactions to do so from a safe distance that does not obstruct the activity.” 

The ACLU of Illinois says those who have been retaliated against for recording law enforcement can contact their office.

Even though recording law enforcement activity is protected by the First Amendment, that did not stop ICE agents from attacking and jailing PhD student Job Garcia in June while he was documenting an ICE raid outside a Home Depot in Hollywood, California.

The historic program, which starts November 1, will save families an estimated $12,000 per child every year.

This story was originally published by The 19th.

In an unprecedented move, New Mexico is making child care free. 

Beginning in November, it will be the first state in the nation to provide child care to all residents regardless of income, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced this week. 

The state has been working to lower child care care costs since 2019, when it created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department and started to expand eligibility for universal child care. This latest change removes income eligibility requirements from the state's child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually. 

“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico's future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”

The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of $13,000 on child care annually. It's much higher in many states. 

In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years. 

The state's Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support. 

The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion. Latinas in New Mexico led the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said. 

The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour. 

The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options. 

Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dow told the Albuquerque Journal that she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state's child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported. 

But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation. 

“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we'll be one of the first to apply.”

A federal judge late Tuesday ruled against President Donald Trump's unlawful attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook last month, determining that the president's “for cause” argument was unconvincing as it was based on unsubstantiated accusations of wrongdoing and represented an executive overreach with worrying implications.

Trump claimed his attempted removal of Cook, whose legal team challenged it as politically motivated and an “unprecedented and illegal” violation of the Fed's statutory independence, was for falsified mortgage applications for homes Cook purchased prior to her appointment to the board. However, Judge Jia M. Cobb of the US District Court for the District of Columbia found that the alleged infractions were neither substantiated and also took place prior to her taking the position.

“According to the government, the determination of cause is committed to the president's discretion by statute, leaving no role for this court. The court disagrees,” Cobb said in her decision.

The accusations against Cook center on accusations brought by Bill Pulte, a prominent political supporter of Trump appointed by the president to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which operates the public lending arms of both Fannie and Freddie Mac. Critics of Pulte have accused him of weaponizing his access to private mortgage data by sifting through records of Trump's perceived political enemies.

As economist Dean Baker wrote in a column last week, people would be wise to recognize Pulte's outsized role in the accusations Trump made against Cook.

“While the validity of Pulte's allegations will have to be determined by the courts, the real scandal is Pulte himself,” wrote Baker. “He is supposed to be running the agency that oversees the processing of tens of millions of mortgages by two huge quasi-public agencies. We are not supposed to be paying him to rifle through mortgage documents to find and disclose dirt that Trump can use against his political opponents.”

By ruling against Trump on Tuesday, Cobb sided with Cook's request for a temporary injunction. This means she will remain in her post, with full voting rights as a governor of the Fed Board, as the case proceeds in the courts.

“Today's ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference,” said Abbe Lowell, an attorney on Cook's legal team. “Allowing the president to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law.”

For now, Lowell added, Cook will “will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.”

MOSCOW, September 10. /TASS/. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, at Warsaw's request, has invoked the use of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty and launched consultations over the violation of Polish airspace by unmanned aerial vehicles, government spokesman Adam Szlapka told the Polsat TV channel.

"NATO has invoked Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty," he said. Later, the spokesman wrote on the X social network that, at Poland's request, consultations were held within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Articles 4 and 5 of the treaty outline response measures by NATO countries in the event that one of them is threatened as well as the steps of the bloc's collective defense. According to their provisions, a threat to one NATO country is perceived as an attack on all the alliance's members. That said, the document does not indicate what exactly NATO may perceive as an attack or a threat, hence the consultation mechanism to talk over how to respond.

Early on September 10, Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command reported the destruction of several objects identified as drones that had violated the country's airspace.

The search for the downed objects is underway. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk reported that overnight from September 9 to September 10, 19 violations of the country's airspace were recorded, with all drones entering from Belarusian territory. So far, three drones have been shot down. In response to the incident, the Polish authorities decided to temporarily close airspace over part of the country, including Warsaw Chopin Airport.

Kamala Harris has condemned the “reckless” decision for Joe Biden to run for re-election to the White House.

The former vice-president took aim at the 82-year-old for placing his ego above the good of the country in an excerpt from her forthcoming book, 107 Days, detailing her whirlwind presidential campaign.

Mrs Harris took over the 2024 Democratic nomination from Mr Biden after he was forced to drop out from the presidential race following a humiliating televised debate against Donald Trump.

Despite initially doubling down on his campaign, the president was eventually pressured to give up the nomination by high-ranking party officials.

In a passage from the new book published by The Atlantic, Mrs Harris addressed his second run for the first time, issuing her most pointed comments to date about Mr Biden:

The former vice-president also said she felt “growing panic” about Mr Biden's second presidential campaign, and questioned if she should have spoken out.

“Perhaps,” she concedes, but adds that Mr Biden is “the most consistently underestimated man in Washington”. Even on Mr Biden's “worst day,” she says, he was better than Mr Trump at his best.

“I am a loyal person,” she wrote.

Mrs Harris also said she feared being accused of having an ulterior motive if she raised the issue.

“I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,” she wrote. “I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving,” she wrote.

Further laying into Mr Biden and his team, she suggests his staff grew jealous of her when she outshone him in the polls.

“Their thinking was zero-sum: If she's shining, he's dimmed.

“None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well,” Mrs Harris wrote.

The former vice-president claimed concern among voters about Mr Biden's age was compounded by worries he was writing Israel a “blank cheque” for its war with Hamas.

Mrs Harris also said she also resonated with Democrat voters in the ways she spoke about reproductive rights, a subject Mr Biden struggled to address, although his team was remiss to give her something she could “win with”.

Instead, she was tasked with taking on irregular migration: “Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more.”

She claims that when Republicans mischaracterised this role as “border czar” the White House did not help her to push back or highlight her progress.

Instead she says she was forced to “shoulder the blame for the porous border,” and points out the administration did not defend her when Fox News made claims she was a DEI hire.

“They had a huge comms team; they had Karine Jean-Pierre briefing in the pressroom every day. But getting anything positive said about my work or any defence against untrue attacks was almost impossible,” she wrote.

In another sore point, she recalls how Mr Biden did not mention or thank her until nine minutes into an 11-minute speech.

The criticisms mark a sharp departure from Mrs Harris's previous remarks about Mr Biden, whom she struggled to differentiate herself from during the election campaign.

They will also likely further complicate Mr Biden's legacy, amid widespread claims his cognitive decline was covered up by his inner circle during his time in office.

Asked during an appearance on The View in October 2024 if there was anything she would have done differently from the president during the past four years, she said: “There is nothing that comes to mind.”

The comments were later used in attack ads by the Trump campaign in the lead up to her ultimate election defeat.

Representatives for Mr Biden were approached for comment.

In 107 Days, the former vice-president breaks on certain points from her typically loyal public stance

US politics live – latest updates

Kamala Harris calls Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election in 2024 “recklessness” in her new memoir and questions the former president's judgment while revealing her own frustrations about being marginalized within the administration.

In passages published by the Atlantic on Wednesday from 107 Days, her memoir chronicling her presidential campaign, Harris breaks on certain points from her typically loyal public stance.

She writes how she felt sidelined within the White House, with her chief of staff fighting to prevent her from standing “like a potted plant” at events, and the administration failing to defend her against Fox News attacks branding her a “DEI hire”.

Of Biden's decision to run for a second term, she writes: “Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”

As vice-president, Harris says, she felt caught in an impossible position: unable to counsel Biden against running without appearing self-interested.

“And of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,” she writes. “I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: don't let the other guy win.”

Harris portrays the White House as deferential to Biden's decision-making, writing: “‘It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized.”

The excerpts reveal Harris's frustration with what she describes as systematic marginalization within the administration. In one example, she writes that her chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, “constantly had to advocate for my role at events: ‘She's not going to stand there like a potted plant. Give her two minutes of remarks. Have her introduce the president.'”

Harris adds: “When Fox News attacked me on everything from my laugh, to my tone of voice, to whom I'd dated in my 20s, or claimed I was a ‘DEI hire', the White House rarely pushed back with my actual résumé: two terms elected DA, top cop in the second-largest department of justice in the United States, senator representing one in eight Americans.”

Despite the White House having “a huge comms team” and daily press briefings, Harris writes, “getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible”.

She recounted watching Biden's Oval Office speech announcing his withdrawal from the race: “It was almost nine minutes into the 11-minute address before he mentioned me.”

Harris does, however, defend Biden's mental capacity during his presidency, attributing his struggles to age-related fatigue rather than cognitive decline.

“Many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden's infirmity. Here is the truth as I lived it,” she writes. “Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president.

“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best. But at 81, Joe got tired,” Harris continues. “That's when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.”

She suggests Biden's poor debate performance was linked to his schedule. “I don't think it's any surprise that the debate debacle happened right after two back-to-back trips to Europe and a flight to the west coast for a Hollywood fundraiser.”

Harris adds: “I don't believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.”

The memoir will be published on 23 September, and Harris has announced a book tour spanning 15 cities, including stops in the UK and Canada.

Joe and Jill Biden's office did not respond for a request for comment.

MOSCOW, September 10. /TASS/. The Russian Defense Ministry is ready to hold consultations with its Polish counterparts 'on this matter,' the military agency said.

It reported that Russian forces had carried out a strike on Ukrainian military-industrial enterprises in the Ivano-Frankovsk, Khmelnitsky and Zhitomir regions, as well as on the cities of Vinnitsa and Lvov. No facilities in Poland were planned to be targeted. The range of the unmanned aerial vehicles that have purportedly crossed the Polish border does not surpass 700 kilometers.

"However, we are ready to hold consultations with the Polish Defense Ministry on this matter," the Russian Defense Ministry emphasized.

U.S. President Donald Trump does not believe Russia should be cut off from the global economy beyond the context of its war against Ukraine, Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with One America News Network published on Sept. 10.

The statement comes as, despite Trump's repeated threats, his administration has imposed only limited penalties on Russia and, in some cases, has rolled back restrictions. 

"The president's been very open with the Europeans and the Russians that he doesn't see any reason why we should economically isolate Russia except for the continuation of the conflict," Vance said.

The vice president added that Russia remains a resource powerhouse. 

"Let's be honest, whether you like or dislike Russia, whether you agree or disagree with their underlying arguments for the conflict, the simple fact is they've got a lot of oil," Vance said.

"They've got a lot of gas. They've got a lot of mineral wealth."

According to the vice president, once a settlement is reached, Washington could have "a very productive economic relationship" with both Kyiv and Moscow.

His remarks come as Trump's peace proposals allegedly include lifting sanctions on Moscow, sparking concerns in Kyiv and Brussels that the West might lose leverage over the Kremlin.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Sept. 8 that Europe must cut purchases of Russian oil and gas if it wants Washington to step up sanctions to push Moscow toward meaningful negotiations.

In August, Washington imposed tariffs on India, one of Russia's biggest oil buyers, but stopped short of broader action. Indian officials said the tariffs would not halt their imports of Russian crude.

European Council President Antonio Costa announced on Sept. 5 that a delegation would travel to Washington to coordinate a new package of joint sanctions.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the following day that Washington is ready to expand secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil, though no further measures have been announced.

Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets.

Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland on Sept. 10, in what became the largest attack on a NATO member state since the start of Moscow's all-out war against Ukraine.

 Poland, NATO's eastern frontline state, is facing its most serious security challenge in decades. Western officials have warned of the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia in the coming years, but are Poland — and NATO — truly prepared for such escalation?

European leaders denounced Russia on Sept. 10 after Poland downed multiple Russian drones in its airspace, marking the first time a NATO member has destroyed Moscow's military assets over its territory during the war in Ukraine.

The report comes amid an escalating conflict between the SBU, which is loyal to the President's Office, and the NABU, which is seen as more independent from the executive branch. 

"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X, adding that those "that posed a direct threat were shot down."

One site south of Minsk is being rebuilt on the grounds of a former Soviet missile base, and analysts believe it could house Oreshnik.

The "unprecedented violation of Polish airspace" saw NATO activate Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Article 4 of the NATO treaty allows member states to request consultations with the allies if they believe their security has been threatened, without triggering a military response.

The proposed solution would stop short of confiscating Russian sovereign assets but provide additional funding to Ukraine as it faces Moscow's ongoing all-out invasion.

"A strike on the territory of a state acting as a mediator in the Gaza Strip peace negotiations is a gross violation of international law," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

Once a settlement is reached, Washington could have "a very productive economic relationship" with both Kyiv and Moscow, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said.

"No evidence has been presented that these drones are of Russian origin," said Andrei Ordash, Moscow's charge d'affaires in Poland.

The remains of a projectile of an unknown origin were found in the Lublin province, Polish Interior Ministry spokesperson Karolina Galecka said.

If Israel failed to kill Hamas leaders in an air strike on Qatar on Tuesday, it would succeed next time, the Israeli ambassador to the United States said after the operation, which raised concerns it would torpedo efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza.

“Right now, we may be subject to a little bit of criticism. They'll get over it. And Israel is being changed for the better,” Yechiel Leiter told Fox News' Special Report program late on Tuesday. 

Israel attempted to kill the political leaders of Hamas with the attack in the Qatari capital Doha on Tuesday, escalating its military action in the Middle East in what the U.S. described as a unilateral attack that does not advance American and Israeli interests.

The air strike took place shortly after Hamas claimed responsibility for a shooting on Monday that killed six people at a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem.

Israel launched a strike on Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they discussed a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, officials said.

The Associated Press

The widely condemned Doha operation was especially sensitive because Qatar has been hosting and mediating in negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in the Gaza war.

“If we didn't get them this time, we'll get them the next time,” Leiter said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defied global condemnation of operations like the one that struck Doha, extending military operations across the Middle East and severely weakening Israel's Iran-backed enemies since Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.

On Wednesday, Israel struck the Yemeni capital Sanaa, after killing Houthi Prime Minister Ahmad Ghaleb al-Rahwi and other senior figures in an attack in late August.

Witnesses said the Wednesday attack targeted the Houthi Defence Ministry, while Israeli Army Radio reported that Houthi headquarters and military camps were among the targets.

The Israeli military confirmed it had attacked Yemen in a statement.

The Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians since the beginning of the war in Gaza.

Hamas said five of its members were killed in the Doha attack, including the son of its exiled Gaza chief and top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. It said its top leaders survived.

The attack generated a flurry of diplomacy between Arab states.

United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan arrived in Qatar on Wednesday, UAE state news agency WAM reported.

Jordan's Crown Prince Hussein is also expected to visit Qatar on Wednesday, while Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to arrive in Doha on Thursday, an official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The visits were a show of regional solidarity with Qatar following the Israeli strikes, the official said.

The European Commission will propose sanctioning extremist Israeli ministers and the suspension of trade-related measures in a European Union agreement with Israel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

The proposals reflect growing EU criticism of Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza and increased pressure on the bloc's executive body to take action.

Germany, one of Israel's staunchest supporters, has taken note of those proposals targeting Israel and will participate in a dialogue about future measures, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Wednesday.

The Doha air strike followed an Israeli warning to Palestinians to leave Gaza City, an area once home to about a million people, as it tries to destroy what is left of Hamas.

Residents there expressed alarm the Doha strike might destroy chances for a ceasefire.

Families, some carrying their belongings on vehicles, donkey carts and rickshaws, continued to stream out of Gaza City along the coastal road in anticipation of a major Israeli offensive.

“Does this mean there is no hope a ceasefire can be reached? I am afraid that now Israel would speed up its occupation of Gaza City,” said Um Tamer, 65, a mother of five.

At least 30 people have been killed across the enclave on Wednesday, according to medics.

Asked how the strike would affect ceasefire negotiations, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Reuters: 

“The honest answer is, we simply don't know. Hamas has rejected everything so far. They continually reject every offer that's put on the table.”

The militant group, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades but today controls only parts of the enclave, on Saturday once again said that it would release all hostages if Israel agreed to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza.

Netanyahu is pushing for an all-or-nothing deal that would see all of the hostages released at once and Hamas surrendering.

The Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the Palestinian militant group killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians and 251 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's military response in Gaza killed over 64,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to local health authorities, and reduced the Palestinian enclave to rubble.

Poland confirmed downing Russian drones in its airspace during a mass aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on Sept. 10 in what is the first case of a NATO member engaging Moscow's military assets over its territory during the war.

In the wake of the incident, Warsaw requested consultations with NATO allies under Article 4, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.

"The situation brings us the closest we have been to open conflict since World War II," he told the Polish parliament.

The incident occurred as Russia launched waves of drones and missiles across Ukraine overnight, primarily targeting central and western regions and inflicting civilian casualties.

"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones," Tusk said on X, adding that those "that posed a direct threat were shot down."

Polish authorities temporarily closed Warsaw's main Chopin Airport and placed the country's air defenses on high alert overnight after what they described as "an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects."

The Polish Armed Forces' Operational Command said it had activated all necessary procedures to protect national airspace and scrambled both Polish and NATO aircraft in response to the threat.

Earlier, Tusk confirmed that a military operation related to multiple violations of Polish airspace was underway without initially naming the drones' origin. The prime minister added that he has informed the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte about the situation.

Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly violated the airspace of Poland and other NATO members during strikes on Ukraine, but until Sept. 10, there had never been a confirmed case of local defenses shooting one down.

Polish fighter jets have been scrambled before in response to the war, but previous deployments primarily involved monitoring or escorting Russian drones that briefly entered Polish airspace en route to targets in Ukraine — not engaging or shooting them down.

The Polish military later said the Polish and allied aircraft, including Dutch F-35 fighters, concluded their operation by 7:42 a.m. local time, and air defenses and radar systems resumed normal activity. The search for impact sites and wreckage is ongoing.

Italian AWACS (Airborne early warning and control) surveillance planes and a refueling aircraft jointly operated by NATO were also involved in the operation, according to Reuters.

Addressing the Polish parliament, Tusk said that 19 airspace violations were recorded, while three or four drones were shot down by Polish and allied planes — the last one at 6:45 a.m. local time.

However, the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported that up to 23 Russian drones were detected and were fired upon primarily by the Dutch F-35s.

A damaged drone was discovered in a field near the village of Czosnowka in the Lublin region, around 60 kilometers (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border, local law enforcement officials said.

A Russian drone also hit a house in Wyryki (around 20 kilometers, or 12 miles from the Ukrainian border) in the same region, damaging the roof and a car parked on the property, Polsat News reported, citing a local police official. No casualties were reported.

Another drone was found in a field in the central Lodz region near Mniszkow, a village roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

As of the evening of Sept. 10, emergency services had recovered debris from 11 drones launched by Russia the previous night at the crash site. In addition to the drone remnants, a projectile fragment of unknown origin was also discovered at the scene, according to RMF FM.

Polish authorities urged residents in the Podlaskie, Mazowieckie, and Lublin regions to stay indoors.

The Lublin region borders Ukraine directly; Podlaskie is about 50–70 kilometers (30-43 miles) from the border at its closest point, while Mazowieckie is located roughly 120–150 kilometers (75-93 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki said he has been in constant contact with Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz since the start of the incursion and held a meeting of the National Security Bureau with Tusk.

"Our homeland's security is the highest priority and requires close cooperation," Nawrocki said on X.

NATO spokesperson Allison Hart noted that the alliance is "consulting closely" with Warsaw. An undisclosed source told Reuters that the alliance does not treat the incursion as an attack.

A notice published on the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website confirmed that Warsaw's main international airport was temporarily unavailable due to "unplanned military activity related to ensuring state security," as well as three other airports. 

The Rzeszow–Jasionka Airport in southeastern Poland—a key hub for passenger travel and arms shipments to Ukraine — was among the airports temporarily closed, according to the FAA.

A Kyiv Independent reporter at Warsaw's Chopin Airport said all flights were delayed, but airport officials were making no reference to Russian drones, only saying that the airspace was closed without providing further details.

Officials later said the Warsaw airport resumed operations but warned that all flights might be delayed during the day, according to the reporter.

Meanwhile, U.S. Congressman Joe Wilson called the Sept. 10 attack an "act of war." 

Russia is attacking NATO ally Poland with Iranian shahed drones less than a week after President Trump hosted President Nawrocki at the White House. This is an act of war, and we are grateful to NATO allies for their swift response to war criminal Putin's continued unprovoked…

Senator Dick Durbin echoed Wilson's comments, adding that "repeated violations of NATO airspace by Russian drones are fair warning that Vladimir Putin is testing our resolve to protect Poland and the Baltic nations." 

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been reportedly briefed on reports of Russian drones over Poland, according to CNN. U.S. President Donald Trump has not commented on the incident when asked by a reporter.

"Putin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha commented.

"A weak response now will provoke Russia even more — and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe."

Sybiha also said the case underscores why neighboring partner countries should intercept Russian projectiles already in Ukrainian airspace and help bolster Ukraine's own air defenses.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that according to "updated data, around two dozen Russian drones may have entered Polish airspace during the night." He added that the number suggests the incursion was likely not an accident.

First drones crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border at around 0:50 a.m. Kyiv time, while at least two unmanned aircraft entered Polish airspace via Belarus, according to Zelensky.

"An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe. Whether there will be further steps depends entirely on the coordination and strength of the response," the president said. 

Zelensky offered to provide Poland with all relevant data on the latest attack and assist with setting up an effective alert and protection system.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called the incident "the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began." She added that there are indications the incursion "was intentional, not accidental."

The Russian Embassy in Warsaw has denied the accusations as "unfounded."

Earlier that night, Ukraine's Air Force reported on Telegram that Russian drones were moving westward and posed a potential threat to Zamosc, a Polish city located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The post was later deleted. 

The incursion took place just a few days before the planned start of the Russian-Belarusian Zapad 2025 drills. Poland has raised an alarm over the upcoming exercises — set to begin on Sept. 12 — and announced plans to close its borders with Belarus for their duration.

Russian drones flying into Poland during the massive attack on Ukraine show that Putin's sense of impunity keeps growing because he was not properly punished for his previous crimes.Putin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no…

The developments come amid one of Russia's largest aerial assaults in recent weeks, targeting multiple Ukrainian regions and prompting alerts in neighboring countries.

Several waves of explosions were heard overnight in Ukraine's central and western regions, including Vinnytsia, Lutsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv. 

Ukrainian defenses intercepted 386 of the 415 strike and decoy drones and 27 of the 43 missiles launched by Russia overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

A drone and missile strike against western Zhytomyr Oblast killed one person and injured five, Governor Vitalii Bunechko reported. Several enterprises and houses were damaged.

In neighboring Khmelnytskyi Oblast, three people were wounded in the strikes. A sewing factory, a gas station, houses, and cars were damaged, according to Governor Serhii Tiurin.

It remains unclear whether Russia hit or targeted any military or other strategic targets in the attack on Ukraine, as Ukrainian authorities largely do not disclose such information for security reasons. This makes the full extent of casualties and damage impossible to verify.

The Sept. 10 incident came just days after Russia launched its largest overnight attack, which killed at least four people and injured more than 40 across Ukraine, drawing swift condemnation from Kyiv's European partners.

Russia launched a record 810 drones and 13 missiles into Ukraine overnight on Sept. 7, including four Iskander-M (KN-23) ballistic missiles and nine Iskander-K cruise missiles.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 747 drones and four cruise missiles, but several others struck 33 locations across the country during the Sept. 7 attack. For the first time, the Russian strike damaged a major government building in Kyiv.

Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets.

Decarlos Brown now faces a federal charge of murder committed on public transportation, in addition to an earlier state charge of first-degree murder.

Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland on Sept. 10, in what became the largest attack on a NATO member state since the start of Moscow's all-out war against Ukraine.

 Poland, NATO's eastern frontline state, is facing its most serious security challenge in decades. Western officials have warned of the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia in the coming years, but are Poland — and NATO — truly prepared for such escalation?

European leaders denounced Russia on Sept. 10 after Poland downed multiple Russian drones in its airspace, marking the first time a NATO member has destroyed Moscow's military assets over its territory during the war in Ukraine.

The report comes amid an escalating conflict between the SBU, which is loyal to the President's Office, and the NABU, which is seen as more independent from the executive branch. 

"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X, adding that those "that posed a direct threat were shot down."

One site south of Minsk is being rebuilt on the grounds of a former Soviet missile base, and analysts believe it could house Oreshnik.

The "unprecedented violation of Polish airspace" saw NATO activate Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Article 4 of the NATO treaty allows member states to request consultations with the allies if they believe their security has been threatened, without triggering a military response.

The proposed solution would stop short of confiscating Russian sovereign assets but provide additional funding to Ukraine as it faces Moscow's ongoing all-out invasion.

"A strike on the territory of a state acting as a mediator in the Gaza Strip peace negotiations is a gross violation of international law," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

Once a settlement is reached, Washington could have "a very productive economic relationship" with both Kyiv and Moscow, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said.

"No evidence has been presented that these drones are of Russian origin," said Andrei Ordash, Moscow's charge d'affaires in Poland.

The remains of a projectile of an unknown origin were found in the Lublin province, Polish Interior Ministry spokesperson Karolina Galecka said.

NATO has activated Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty following the incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace, Polish government spokesperson Adam Szlapka told Polsat News on Sept. 10.

The announcement came after Poland, for the first time during the full-scale war, confirmed downing Russian drones in its airspace amid a mass Russian aerial attack on Ukraine.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk earlier said Warsaw formally requested the consultations under Article 4, which allows member states to call for discussions with allies if they believe their security is threatened, without triggering an automatic military response.

"Allied consultations have now taken the form of a formal request to activate Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty," Tusk said in an address to the Polish Sejm, the lower chamber of the country's parliament.

Tusk said the decision was preceded by consultations with Polish President Karol Nawrocki, adding that this is "just the beginning."

Nineteen airspace violations were recorded overnight, while three or four drones were shot down by Polish and allied planes — the last one at 6:45 a.m. local time, according to the prime minister.

"We will expect significantly greater support during the consultations. This is a confrontation that Russia has declared against the free world," Tusk told Polish lawmakers.

Separately, Nawrocki called the incident "an unprecedented moment in NATO's history and Poland's modern history."

Warsaw's NATO allies and Kyiv have denounced the incursion and voiced support for Poland, with Ukraine offering assistance with setting up an effective alert and protection system.

NATO spokesperson Allison Hart noted that the alliance is "consulting closely" with Warsaw. An undisclosed source told Reuters that the alliance does not treat the incursion as an attack.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also commented on the Russian drone incursion over Poland, calling the response "a very successful reaction by NATO and Allies."

"Whether it (the incursion) was intentional or not, it is absolutely reckless. It is absolutely dangerous," he said. "But I think last night demonstrated that we are capable of defending every inch of NATO territory, including, of course, its airspace."

Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly violated the airspace of Poland and other NATO members during strikes on Ukraine, but until Sept. 10, there had never been a confirmed case of local defenses shooting one down.

Since 1949, NATO's Article 4 has been invoked seven times. Poland first used it in 2014 over Russia's occupation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas, and again in 2022 with allies following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Poland is invoking Article 4 of the NATO treaty after a number of drones were shot down over its territory during an overnight Russian attack on western Ukraine, marking the first time NATO has responded to an incursion.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk told parliament Wednesday that the military recorded about 19 drone incursions overnight. He added that three or four were shot down and that a significant number had flown into Polish airspace from Belarus.

“This is not a war only for Ukrainians, this is a war, this is a confrontation that Russia has declared against the entire free world, and this must finally reach everyone without exception,” Mr. Tusk said.

Article 4 of the NATO treaty calls for member states to consult whenever “the territorial integrity, political independence or security” of a member is threatened. It has been invoked only seven previous times in the 76-year history of the alliance, most recently in 2022, when Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia called for consultations after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump reacted cryptically on Wednesday morning. “What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!” he wrote on Truth Social.

Mr. Trump last month trumpeted progress on his efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a troop of European leaders at the White House.

But despite Mr. Trump backing down on his demand that Mr. Putin agree to a ceasefire – and conceding to Russian demands that Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO and also give up territory to Russia – Mr. Putin has continued his attack on Ukraine. A meeting between Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky, which Mr. Trump was pushing last month, has yet to happen.

Earlier Wednesday, the military said about a dozen drones had entered the country's airspace. The Dutch Defence Ministry confirmed that its F-35 fighter jets based in Poland had “helped ensure safety in Polish skies tonight.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney called Russia's incursion “reckless and escalatory” in a post on X Wednesday morning, adding that Canada stands with Poland and NATO allies.

“We are closely coordinating with them, and we will remain vigilant against Russia's attempts to widen and prolong the conflict with Ukraine,” he said.

Mr. Carney said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is demonstrating a complete disregard for the path of peace.

“Russia's actions – following a week of brutal attacks on Ukrainian civilians – underscore the importance of our steadfast support for Ukraine,” he said. “To bring lasting peace to Ukraine and Europe, we must increase the pressure on Putin to end this war.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand also condemned the attack in a post on X Wednesday morning.

“Overnight, Russian drones violated Polish, and NATO, airspace during an attack against Ukraine. Yet another horrendous example of Putin's refusal to seek peace,” she wrote. “Without question, Canada stands in full solidarity with Poland and Ukraine. We continue to call on Russia to put an end to its unjustified and illegal war.”

Mr. Tusk held an emergency cabinet meeting Wednesday morning. “The first test has been passed. Procedures and plans for such incidents have been implemented. There is no reason to panic,” he told reporters after the meeting.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Italian AWACS radar planes – as well as German Patriot anti-aircraft batteries and NATO air-to-air refuelling aircraft – had also taken part in Wednesday's operation.

“What we have seen last night was a very successful reaction by NATO and allies, including of course Poland itself, but also the Dutch and the Italians and the Germans – everybody involved,” Mr. Rutte said, adding that a “full assessment” of the incident, including whether Russia had intended to send drones into Polish airspace, was taking place. 

“Whether it was intentionally or not, it is absolutely reckless. It is absolutely dangerous,” he said.

CNN reported that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been briefed on the violation of Polish airspace. However, there has been no response so far from Mr. Rubio or the White House.

Poland says it shot down drones that entered its airspace on Wednesday, with the NATO member calling the incursion 'an act of aggression.' It marks the first time a member of the alliance has fired shots in the war.

Reuters

There are reports in Polish media that one drone struck the roof of a residential building in Wyryki, in eastern Poland, and that there were no injuries. The remains of another drone were found in two towns near the borders with Ukraine and Belarus.

“As a result of attack by the Russian Federation on Ukrainian territory, there was an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects. This is an act of aggression that posed a real threat to the safety of our citizens,” Poland's military said in a statement on X. 

“Polish and allied assets radar-tracked several objects, and the Operational Commander of the Polish Armed Forces made decisions to neutralize those that could pose a threat. Some of the drones that entered our airspace were shot down.”

Four Polish airports, including Warsaw's main Chopin Airport, were closed for several hours, and NATO jets were scrambled in response.

The airport in Rzeszow, a city just 100 kilometres from the border with Ukraine that has become a major hub for Western military aid to the country – and which is protected by several U.S. Patriot missile batteries – was also closed. Air-raid sirens did not sound in Rzeszow, though mobile phones buzzed with alerts that drones “have violated the borders of the Republic of Poland” and warning citizens not to approach the crash sites.

There were also calls for Poland and its allies to close their airspaces to all Russian air traffic, which would complicate civilian flights to Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave wedged between Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea.

“We want a strong strategic signal sent to Russia, though this does not rule out responding bilaterally as well,” said Adam Eberhardt, deputy head of the Centre for East European Studies at the University of Warsaw. “I think we will request more allied air patrols along the eastern flank and reinforcement of missile and drone defences.”

“A Russian drone attack on Poland justifies a joint and united response from the alliance – for example, closing NATO airspace to all aircraft travelling to and from airports in Russia, as well as suspending navigational services for flights to Kaliningrad,” said Slawomir Debski, a visiting professor of strategy and international relations at the College of Europe in Natolin, Poland. “Such measures can be agreed upon by the alliance precisely on the basis of Article 4.”

The incursion has caused alarm in capitals across Europe, where there have long been fears of an escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

“The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine poses a threat to the security of all of Europe,” said Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. “Poland has every right to defend its airspace. We give our full support to Poland, as a NATO ally and EU member. Sweden and Poland stand united in our support for Ukraine.”

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the drone incursions an “egregious and unprecedented violation of Polish and NATO airspace.”

“This was an extremely reckless move by Russia and only serves to remind us of President Putin's blatant disregard for peace, and the constant bombardment innocent Ukrainians face every day,” he said in a statement.

Lithuania's Foreign Affairs Minister, Kęstutis Budrys, expressed his country's solidarity with Poland and called for tougher sanctions against Russia. “The reality is clear: As long as Putin is allowed to continue waging his bloody war against Ukraine, no country – not even within NATO – is safe. Sanctions must strike at the heart of the Kremlin's war economy. Putin will not stop unless we stop him,” Mr. Budrys said on X.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that at least eight Russian drones had targeted Poland during Wednesday's raid, which involved some 415 drones and more than 40 cruise and ballistic missiles. One person was killed in Ukraine and three others were reported injured so far, he added.

The attack was “an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe,” Mr. Zelensky added. “Increasing evidence indicates that this movement, this direction of strike, was no accident. There have been previous incidents of individual Russian drones crossing the border and travelling a short distance into neighbouring countries. But this time, we are recording a much larger scale and deliberate targeting.”

The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, also called for a tough response from Western allies. “Last night in Poland, we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,” she wrote on X. “Russia's war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost on Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europe's defence.”

NATO's North Atlantic Council, the alliance's main decision-making body, was holding a regular meeting Wednesday morning and would discuss how to respond to the drone incursion. “Numerous drones entered Polish airspace overnight and were met with Polish and NATO air defences,” NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said on X. Mr. Rutte was consulting closely with Polish officials, she added.

Pavel Muravyeika, the Deputy Defence Minister of Belarus, said Wednesday that the drones entered Polish airspace accidentally, after their navigation systems were jammed.

A Russian diplomat in Poland denied Russian forces deliberately targeted the country. “We consider the accusations groundless. No evidence has been presented that these drones are of Russian origin,” Andrei Ordash told Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti.

 Start With Embracing Federalism

 Steven Simon and Adam Weinstein

In December, a band of rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham shocked the world by ousting Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. HTS's leader, Ahmed al-Shara, created a government to oversee the country's transition. Shara is a former jihadist who once led al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. Nonetheless, U.S. President Donald Trump soon threw his weight behind him, describing him as “tough” and “attractive” after meeting him in May. Since then, the United States has suspended sanctions against Syria and issued statements in support of Shara's interim government.

Since Shara assumed power, he has courted foreign support by disavowing jihadism and raising the prospect of normalizing Syria's relations with Israel. Such rhetoric, combined with his relatively successful rule over Syrian Sunnis in Idlib Province during the final years of the civil war, persuaded current and former U.S. officials that Shara was the man for the moment.

Today, Syria is once again racked by violence, and Shara's coalition includes unreformed jihadists. The problem with Washington's Syria policy is not that it backs a former al-Qaeda ally but that it endorses Shara's vision of centralized rule over a diverse and sectarian country riven by deep mistrust. In July, the U.S. special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, went so far as to rule out U.S. support for any sort of federal arrangement, such as allowing for local control of policing.

The transitional government in Damascus has fiercely repudiated federalism, which it sees as a prelude to anarchy, state disintegration, and the loss of HTS control. Nearby examples hardly inspire confidence: Lebanon's consociational system and Iraq's federal one are marginally functional. And some of Shara's allies believe it is the prerogative of Syria's Sunni Muslims, who make up a majority of the population, to rule over religious minorities.

Shara and his closest advisers lack a clear vision of the country they want to build. They are used to running Idlib, a small city with one main street, as a haven for Islamists—not a large, multiethnic state. Moreover, Shara is not an all-powerful authoritarian; he is constrained by his inner circle and makes decisions in consultation with them. His advisers are inclined to hoard power.

For the country to have a chance at recovering from 50 years of despotism and a decade of civil war, it must allow minority communities to retain a degree of autonomy. Syria is likely to be ruled by a strongman, and without some form of federalism, intense intercommunal violence will continue. If minorities fear a predatory central government, they will resist and potentially enlist outside powers in their fight. A return to civil war is not out of the question. Syria's partners, including the United States, should encourage a power-sharing arrangement.

When Assad was toppled, Shara struck many foreign governments as the right person to govern Syria. Syria's Sunni Arabs assumed that the country could no longer be ruled by a religious or ethnic minority—such as the Assads, who were Alawite—and that the Islamists who forced Assad out would be part of the next government. Washington recognized that its influence over the transition would be limited. The United States did have clout in northeastern Syria because for years it maintained a small military presence there to prevent the reemergence of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and to disrupt Iran's access to Lebanon. Now that ISIS appears a shell of its former self and Syria is run by a government that is staunchly opposed to Iran, Trump has begun to remove troops from seven of the eight U.S. bases in Syria.

There was a moment following Shara's seizure of power when relief at Assad's departure and longing for stability might have laid the groundwork for uncompromising centralization. Today, Shara's government controls a corridor from Daraa in the south to Aleppo in the north, along the M5 highway, as well as Idlib and the Alawite coast in the northwest of the country. It does not control Suwayda in the southwest or the Kurdish northeast.

The possibility of centralization, however, was curtailed in March when Sunni fighters—some of whom belong to Syria's new government forces—killed at least 1,500 Alawites. Shara's government has blamed the Alawites for initiating the cycle of violence and said that the killings should be seen in the context of a natural desire for vengeance against a community that had supported Assad's malignant regime. The composition of Assad's support base was, in reality, more complicated. Plenty of Sunnis supported and fought for the old regime. And the Assads did little to alleviate poverty among Alawites to ensure they would remain trapped in servitude to the army and the state. Wherever the balance of vice and virtue lay, Shara's government appeared to condone retributive violence.

Then, in July, Shara's government facilitated attacks against another minority religious community, the Druze, who populate Suwayda Province, which stretches from the south of Damascus to the Jordanian border. Syria's Druze live in an impoverished area and adhere to an esoteric religion rejected by many Muslims as un-Islamic. The government accused the Druze of resisting its rule and, in combination with tens of thousands of Bedouin tribal fighters, attacked Druze villages, killing hundreds of people, including many noncombatants. They also blockaded Suwayda, restricting road access to a southern checkpoint where they regulated the entry of humanitarian convoys. Although Bedouin tribes and Druze joined forces against Assad during the civil war, they have long been at odds. Competition for resources has renewed their old rivalry, and radical Islamist influencers on Telegram, a messaging app, have whipped up sectarian animosity between the two sides and have exulted in the murder and rape of Druze villagers.



Israel views itself as a protector of the Druze because it has its own substantial Druze minority and wants the Syrian Druze to serve as a buffer between Israel and the new Islamist regime in Damascus. Israeli forces ended the assault on the Druze by launching airstrikes against Bedouin fighters and bombing Syria's defense ministry. If Israel had not intervened, many more people may have died.

Shara is inclined to use force to get what he wants and has a formidable tool in the Bedouin fighters at his disposal. During the Assad regime, the state enlisted some Bedouin tribes to fight its battles but did so on a much smaller scale. In July, Shara's government was able to mobilize Bedouin forces from nearly all parts of Syria, aided by jihadist online influencers, many of whom are not affiliated with the government. This burgeoning digital network has terrified vulnerable minority communities, as has the government's refusal since the attacks to guarantee Druze security or allow enough aid to pass into Suwayda. Officials within Shara's government believe that any concessions to Druze would reward them for rebellion.

These bouts of violence have galvanized yet another minority, Syria's Kurds, who occupy a stretch of territory in the country's northeast. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Kurdish militia that includes Arab fighters, allied with American troops to defeat ISIS in Syria. In pursuit of centralized rule, Shara has pressed the SDF to surrender its arms and integrate with a new Syrian army that would replace Assad's military. But after witnessing the regime support attacks on Alawites and Druze, the Kurds have lost whatever appetite they might have had for surrendering their arsenals and melting into Shara's army. Indeed, SDF representatives have described the shift in their attitude toward the interim government as “pre-Suwayda” and “post-Suwayda.”

The interim government was meant to hold talks with SDF leaders in Paris this summer but withdrew in August, saying that the time for negotiation was over and that the issue of Kurdish integration would be settled “on the ground,” presumably by force, with Deir ez-Zor as a possible starting point. Still, Shara's forces don't seem strong enough to subsume or challenge Kurdish militias. The Syrian government says it has recruited 100,000 soldiers, including 30,000 from the former Syrian National Army, but these numbers appear inflated. Even if Damascus succeeded in organizing, training, and equipping an army of this size, it would be responsible for huge swaths of land, so the SDF would continue to enjoy superiority over the smaller territory it controls. Druze leaders, who have historically been factionalized, have united to reject efforts to absorb their land into a centralized state dominated by HTS. And Druze militias have come together to form a so-called national guard to protect the territorial integrity of Suwayda.

The more the government represses minorities, the more minority groups will resist the government's push for centralized rule. The result will be more bloodshed, greater opportunities for foreign states—such as Israel or Iran—to intervene in Syria, and the continued impoverishment and immiseration of ordinary Syrians of all stripes. The United States would be wise to stop rejecting federalism and encourage the transfer of some power to local or regional authorities. Fiscal and monetary policy, foreign relations, and defense of Syria's borders should remain with the central government. Such a system could avoid the political gridlock that consociationalism has produced in Lebanon by allowing minorities to wield some power in the parts of the country where they make up a majority rather than forcing inclusivity at the federal level. It would also be preferable to Iraq's system, which is plagued by endless economic disputes because it devolves significant power to the Kurdistan Regional Government. Although Lebanon and Iraq still have problems, they would be worse off if their central governments were not constrained. Washington must try to persuade Syrian leaders that their quest for total centralization of power will backfire by driving intercommunal wedges deeper, stoking violence, depressing economic growth, and weakening their international credibility.

American policymakers seem to be slowly coming around to the idea of a federal structure for Syria. The office of the U.S. special envoy for Syria still maintains that it has complete faith in Shara's competence and his commitment to a pluralistic Syria but is more wary about the high cost and feasibility of centralized rule. In August, Barrack said he supported “something short of [a federation].”

Ultimately, Syrians will determine their own system of government, and that is how it should be. Yet the Trump administration must recognize the weight of its words and ensure that it is not inadvertently encouraging the interim government's worst inclinations, which could wind up pushing the country back into civil war.

Donald Trump was shouted at by pro-Palestine protesters who accused him of being “the Hitler of our time” as he went out for dinner in Washington DC.The president took a rare evening off to sit down for a meal with members of his cabinet as he attempted to demonstrate that his crime crackdown in the US capital was working.Mr Trump has claimed the capital's nightlife is booming as a result of decreased crime levels after he took over the city's police force and deployed the national guard.Trumpeting the success of his policy, Mr Trump treated members of the administration to a meal at Joe's Seafood, located just a stone's throw from the White House.

Ahead of the president's arrival, the restaurant was screened off by secret service agents, who performed security checks and turned away diners hoping to grab a walk-in table, according to the Washingtonian's food editor.

But as the president sat down at his table, several women began to loudly protest, a clip shared by a CNN reporter on social media shows.

The women stood in the restaurant screaming: “Free DC! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!” and were led across the street by law enforcement.

In the clip, JD Vance, the US vice president, is shown shaking hands with diners amid the disturbance, telling them to “enjoy your dinner”, while Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth stands and looks on uncomfortably.

Other patrons booed Mr Trump and the cabinet members as the protesters continued to chant and held up Palestinian flags and keffiyehs.

The protesters were members of Code Pink, a female-led anti-war activism group. The group said it was fighting for Gaza and for the safety of people in DC.

“Trump looked us in the eyes, we made sure he will never dine in peace while communities are under siege,” the group posted on Instagram after confronting the president.

In a video posted to social media, one of the women who protested in the restaurant said: “We are not afraid of Trump”, adding, “he looked us right in the eyes and we stood our ground, we will continue to be steadfast in our call for the end of the occupation”.

A post shared by CODEPINK (@codepinkalert)

The video from Code Pink shows Secret Service members grabbing the protesters and bundling them out of the restaurant.

It is unclear how the group knew the details of Mr Trump's plan to dine out.

Speaking outside the restaurant, Mr Trump claimed that Washington DC was “one of the most unsafe cities in the country” but that “restaurants now are booming”.

“I am standing out in the middle of the street. I wouldn't have done this three months ago, four months ago, I certainly wouldn't have done it a year ago,” he said.

“This was one of the most unsafe cities in the country. Now it's as safe as there is in the country.

“The restaurants now are booming. People are going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years, and it's a safe city.”

Yet despite Mr Trump's claims of bringing back nightlife to the nation's capital, research from OpenTable found that the number of diners dipped by a third last month, compared to the same period in 2024.

Founded in Miami, Florida, where Mr Trump spends his weekends during the colder months at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Joe's Seafood specialises in steak and crab.

The president, who is known for his fast-food heavy diet, is likely to settle down in the wood-panelled dining room with a New York strip steak ($69.95) which he prefers cooked well-done, or perhaps a classic cheeseburger ($21.95), which comes with a side of French fries.

A Washington Post review from last year said the dining room, where waiters wear tuxedos and bow ties, had the atmosphere of a “timeless supper club” and recommended the steak as well as the four-piece golden brown fried chicken.

Mr Trump, who has declared his law and order blitz a roaring success, went on to repeat threats to expand the operation to other cities as soon as tomorrow.

“The governor of a certain state would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city and same state would love us to be there,” he said, in a veiled nod to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

“We'll announce it probably tomorrow.”

A month after Mr Trump announced he would deploy the National Guard in DC to rid the city of “wild youths and maniacs”, crime in the city is down, homeless camps have been cleared, and hundreds of people accused of arriving in the US illegally have been detained.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is set to take over the country's compensation program for individuals who have been severely injured by vaccines next year from an outside company that has been subject to criticism over its administration practices.

Guillaume Bertrand, director of communications for Health Minister Marjorie Michel, said in a statement to The Globe and Mail that a funding agreement with OXARO Inc., an Ottawa-based company, will conclude at the end of March. 

He said the federal government plans to transition the administration of the Vaccine Injury Support Program to PHAC.

“This is also part of our commitment to significantly reducing reliance on external consultants, while improving the capacity of the public service to hire expertise in-house,” Mr. Bertrand said. 

“We will publicly share further details on how the program will be delivered under PHAC when they become available.”

The decision to amend who administers the Vaccine Injury Support Program, or VISP, which allows Canadians to make claims for serious injuries and deaths related to Health Canada-approved vaccines, follows criticism, including from the federal Conservatives and New Democrats. 

The political attention stemmed from a Global News investigation that detailed allegations about the company's inability to manage the program that were levelled by injured claimants, as well as employees. The Globe and Mail has not independently spoken to these individuals.

From 2024: Ottawa injects another $36.4-million into vaccine injury compensation fund

OXARO did not immediately issue comment on the coming transition of VISP to PHAC next year, nor did it respond to allegations made about how the company administers the program when contacted by e-mail on Tuesday afternoon.

The VISP was announced in December, 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was created to provide financial support for Canadians who experienced a serious and permanent injury after receiving a Health Canada-approved vaccine on or after Dec. 8, 2020.

It officially launched in June, 2021. The program applies to all individuals vaccinated in Canada, with the exception of those inoculated in Quebec who can receive coverage from the province's compensation program.

Online statistics from June of this year indicate the VISP has received 3,317 claims and 234 have been approved by a medical review board that determined a “probable link between the injury and the vaccine and that the injury is serious and permanent.”

Mr. Bertrand said at Ms. Michel's request, PHAC initiated an audit of OXARO and its management of the program. The audit process was accelerated this summer after an initial review was done on the program.

“PHAC has been reviewing the program to better inform its future delivery, given its complexity and importance,” Mr. Bertrand said.

In July, Ms. Michel said Ottawa would try to improve the program and that what it was hearing about it was “unacceptable.”

Mr. Bertrand said the government's new approach will align with other Group of Seven countries that manage programs internally. PHAC will work closely with OXARO to ensure a smooth transition, he added. He also said the federal government understands some Canadians have faced challenges with the program. 

The program defines a serious and permanent injury as a severe, life-threatening or life-altering injury that may require admission to hospital or prolong a hospital stay. 

It also says there must be “persistent or significant disability or incapacity or where the outcome is a congenital malformation or death.”

Individuals who are deemed eligible may receive support such as income replacement indemnities, death benefits, coverage for funeral expenses and reimbursement for eligible costs that would otherwise be uncovered medical expenses. 

A briefing note to inform the Health Minister about the VISP in June said OXARO advised the government that claims can take 12 to 18 months to process once they are assigned to a case manager. The note also said $80.8-million has been allocated to OXARO for administration and claim payments over five years.

Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams reports from North Carolina as the family of murdered Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska speaks out.

Silicon Valley is stepping in after the killing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska shocked the nation.

Eoghan McCabe, CEO and founder of Intercom, committed $500,000 to commission murals of Zarutska's face in major U.S. cities. 

"I am offering $500k in $10k grants to paint murals of the face of Iryna Zarutska in prominent US city locations," McCabe wrote. 

Those who want to participate in or donate to the initiative are encouraged to contact McCabe's chief of staff, Katie Brenske Tolstedt. 

McCabe's post caught the attention of billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who replied with an offer to contribute $1 million. Musk has also been vocal about Zarutska's case, particularly media coverage of the killing and public reaction.

A person working with the campaign who spoke with Fox News Digital under the condition of anonymity said that they are currently in talks with more than 1,000 artists across the country and are looking for the right locations for the murals. There are also poster campaigns in the works, which will appear in major U.S. cities.

The person also said that McCabe was inspired by a desire to not let Zarutska be forgotten or ignored by mainstream media after her life was taken in such a brutal way. The person also cited a realization about the failures of leftist policies.

Notably, after George Floyd's 2020 killing, murals and statues in his honor appeared across U.S. cities.

Surveillance video of Zarutska's stabbing has gone viral, sparking debate about how criminals are handled and public safety. The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., had 14 prior arrests when he allegedly stabbed Zarutska to death on a train in Charlotte, N.C.

President Donald Trump, who has taken a controversial tough-on-crime approach to cities across the country, condemned the murder and said the video was "horrific." He also questioned why the suspect, who he called a "mentally deranged lunatic," was allowed to walk free despite a lengthy criminal record.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HITS CHARLOTTE TRAIN STABBING SUSPECT WITH FEDERAL CHARGES

"I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious War in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic. The perpetrator was a well known career criminal, who had been previously arrested and released on CASHLESS BAIL in January, a total of 14 TIMES. What the hell was he doing riding the train, and walking the streets? Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP," Trump said.

Zarutska came to the U.S. in August 2022 to escape the Russia-Ukraine war. She was working at Zepeddie's Pizzeria and was in her uniform when she was killed.

"This could have been anyone riding the light rail that night. We are committed to making sure this never happens again," Zarutska's family said in their first statement since she was murdered.

Zarutska was on a Lynx Blue Line train in Charlotte when she sat in front of a man in a red hoodie later identified as Brown. After a few moments of sitting behind Zarutska, Brown is seen in the video standing up and stabbing the young woman.

Brown was arrested soon after the attack and has been charged with first-degree murder. The Justice Department on Tuesday added a charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

NEW YORK (AP) — Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison wrested the title of the world's richest man from longtime holder Elon Musk early Wednesday, according to wealth tracker Bloomberg, as stock in his software giant rocketed more than a third in a stunning few minutes of trading. 

A college dropout, the 81-year-old Ellison is now worth $393 billion, Bloomberg says, several billion more than Musk, who became the world's richest for the first time four years ago. Stock in one of Musk's biggest holdings, Tesla, has been moving in the opposite direction of Oracle's, dropping 14% so far this year as of Tuesday.

The switch in the ranking came after a blockbuster earnings report from Oracle powered by multibillion dollar orders from customers as the artificial-intelligence race heats up.

Another news organization with a long history of tallying the world's richest, Forbes, still has Musk at the top, at $439 billion. Bloomberg put his net worth at $385 billion. The difference is partly in how the two estimate the value of Musk's private holdings, which include rocket maker SpaceX and the former Twitter, now called X.

With Ellison's surging fortune Wednesday, he could fund the lifestyles of 5 million American families for a year, about the entire population of Florida, allowing them to all quit their jobs, assuming the U.S. median household income. 

Or Ellison could just tell all of South Africa to take a vacation for year and produce nothing, based on its gross domestic product. 




Ellison owns about 40% of Oracle, which means its surging stock added $100 billion to his net worth in little over a half-hour after stock market opened. The company had announced more than $300 billion worth of new contracts when it reported earnings. It said that it now expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to jump 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year. then rise to $144 billion in four years after that.

Ellison said about the bold projections, “AI Changes Everything.”

Musk is hoping the same for Tesla and his own net worth, but he's been struggling to convince investors.

The company had been promising a big turnaround in electric car sales after they fell sharply earlier this year, but the bounce back hasn't happened. Musk has been downplaying the bad numbers by trying to shift investors' focus to Tesla's other business of making robots and advances in the artificial intelligence behind its cars and robotaxis. 

While he keeps talking up the Tesla future, though, the bad news keeps coming. 

Tesla sales in the European Union plunged 40% earlier this summer, the seventh month in row of drops, as customers balked at buying his cars after he took to X to support extreme right-wing politicians there. The company has been losing market share in the U.S., too, as buyers angry with his embrace of Donald Trump have stayed away from Tesla showrooms.

NEW YORK (AP) — NBA players can now fire up those end-of-quarter heaves from deep without their shooting percentages being adversely affected.

The league has approved a change in the way statistics on those shots are recorded, which could spur players to take more heaves from very, very deep with hopes of a miracle make. It was finalized at the league's board of governors meeting on Wednesday.

The rule change was tried out at Summer League in Las Vegas back in July, as well as the smaller leagues that month in Utah and California.

For stat-keeping purposes, the NBA will tell teams that any shot taken within the final three seconds of the first three quarters and is launched from at least 36 feet away on any play that starts in the backcourt will count as a team shot attempt — but not an individual one.

Many players have avoided taking the miracle 50-footer or deeper shot at the end of quarters to protect their personal shooting percentages. The “heave rule,” the league hopes, will fix that.

According to SportRadar, players last season made about 4% of shots taken in the final three seconds of the first three quarters of a game with the 36-foot minimum distance. Based on its tracking data, Golden State's Stephen Curry made four shots under those criteria last season and Denver's Nikola Jokic made three.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Wednesday, at the end of the league's board of governors meeting, that he hopes to have the details on this season's All-Star Game — one that will have a U.S. vs. the world format — finalized by the start of the regular season.

The AP and other outlets reported on Sept. 3 that the league is closing in on finalizing another new format for this season's All-Star Game, one where three eight-man teams — two from the U.S. and one composed of international players — would square off in a round-robin tournament.

Having 16 All-Stars from the U.S. and eight from other countries would be in line with the current breakdown of where NBA players are from; the league is about two-thirds American players, one-third international players.

“People have great memories of All-Star games. It's part of the fabric of this league, the excitement that comes from it and the engagement from our players,” Silver said. “So, we want to fix it.”

The league has been heading in this direction for several months, especially after last season's All-Star mini-tournament — untimed games to 40 points, with four teams of eight players each — was a flop.

Silver has wanted a more competitive All-Star format for years. Nobody has been willing to play much in the way of defense at the game in recent seasons — a 211-186 game in 2024 was the last straw there — so the league tried the tournament plan this past season.

Talks on how to proceed with a new NBA-backed league in Europe, in partnership with FIBA, are continuing, Silver said.

“I think our basketball people now are very engaged in how the competition will work,” Silver said. “Our lawyers are thinking hard on how we can take ... a sort of cap-based system and revenue-sharing system with players and how we could apply that in a European framework.”

Silver also said the league's governors got an update on domestic expansion plans at its meeting that concluded Wednesday. The NBA said in July that it was beginning the process of formally exploring adding to its current 30-team league, though there is no timetable for when that will happen.

Seattle and Las Vegas have long been believed to be major candidates for NBA expansion if the league formally decides to move forward.

The NBA Cup, which has had a Final Four setup for its semifinals and final in Las Vegas — and will again this season — will be changing in 2026-27.

The league has decided that semifinals will be played at the home arena of the higher-seeded team in each conference starting next season. The final — which doesn't count on either team's record — will be the only game played at a neutral site.

The board approved a change to coach's challenges, starting this season.

During review following a challenge of an out-of-bounds violation, the replay center official — not the crew chief — “will determine whether a proximate foul should have been called,” the league said.

The NBA says it will expedite review times.

Last season was the first where referees could determine whether a proximate foul should have been called on certain plays. The change was unanimously recommended by the competition committee and league office.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her decision to deploy the state's National Guard to support ICE agents and share an update on the statewide school phone ban.

EXCLUSIVE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement's recruitment efforts are proving to be a quick success with 141,000 applications and 18,000 tentative job offers since the recruitment push started at the end of July.

The Trump administration launched a campaign earlier this summer to boost ICE staff, including by offering major perks, such as up to $50,000 as a sign-on bonus, student loan forgiveness and special retirement benefits.

"ICE has received more than 141,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S. We have already given more than 18,000 tentative job offers," Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

"Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country," Noem continued.

The agency has been conducting large operations in major cities throughout the country, including in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., in order to execute mass deportations as well as arresting those in the country illegally with other criminal charges or convictions. More detention centers have also opened throughout the country to hold individuals before deportation, including Alligator Alcatraz in Florida.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July provides funding for 10,000 ICE agents. As of mid-August, there were 100,000 applicants since the effort began. Notably, the age cap, which is typically 37 or 40, was nixed by the administration and it is encouraging retired law enforcement officers to join.

"We are ENDING the age cap for ICE law enforcement. Qualified candidates can now apply with no age limit," Noem posted to X on Aug. 6.

ICE currently has various operations underway to achieve the administration's goals, including "Operation Midway Blitz" in Chicago and "Operation Patriot 2.0," which each have the primary goal of targeting criminals.

While many Democratic leaders have been unwilling to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, many Republican leaders are openly assisting ICE. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Tuesday that the state's National Guard will help out ICE in the state with 40 people.

"The Arkansas National Guard stands ready to support this mission by providing requested administrative and logistical assistance to the Department of Homeland Security," Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas' adjutant general, stated. "Our Guardsmen are highly trained and committed to enabling federal agents to focus on their core operations."

NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.

They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance — ideally in labs on Earth — before reaching any conclusions.

While acknowledging the latest analysis “certainly is not the final answer,” NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said it's ”the closest we've actually come to discovering ancient life on Mars.”

Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life, past or present. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.

Calling it an “exciting discovery,” a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — SETI Institute's Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Mario Parente — were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.

“That's part of the reason why we can't go so far as to say, ‘A-ha, this is proof positive of life,''' lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. “All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.”




Either way, Hurowitz said it's the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover's search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30. The findings appeared in the journal Nature. 

“It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?” Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's “a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.” 

Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance's science instruments before the drill came out.

This image provided by NASA shows the 360-degree view of a region on Mars called “Bright Angel,” captured on June 12, 2024 by NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and is made up of 346 individual images that were stitched together after being sent back to Earth. (NASA via AP)



Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.

“There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,” Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial. 

There's no evidence of present-day life on Mars, but NASA over the decades has sent spacecraft to Mars in search of past watery environments that might have supported life way back when.

When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort.

Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz. 

NASA's acting Administrator Sean Duffy said budgets and timing will dictate how best to proceed, and even raised the possibility of sending sophisticated equipment to Mars to analyze the samples on the red planet. “All options are on the table,” he said.

Ten of the titanium sample tubes gathered by Perseverance were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, all part of NASA's still fuzzy return mission.

Brett Eagleson, whose father was killed in the attacks, said in New York the judge's recent "historic, landmark decision" to advance a long-running lawsuit against Saudi Arabia was based on "indefensible evidence."

Family members of 9/11 victims celebrated on Wednesday a court victory they said brings them one step closer to holding Saudi Arabia accountable for its alleged role in the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Brett Eagleson, whose father, John, was killed in the attacks, said during a press conference in New York City the judge's "historic, landmark decision," issued two weeks ago, to move forward with a long-running lawsuit against the Saudi Arabian government was based on "indefensible evidence."

"There were at least 13 Saudi government officials connected to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. They were working and operating in and out of the Saudi consulates and the Saudi embassies," Eagleson said. "There were funneling support from the Ministry of Islamic Affairs in Washington, D.C., to their embassies in San Diego, to the hijackers' handlers, right down to the hijackers themselves."

Eagleson also named two people who he alleged were part of an "advance team" sent by the Saudi government to assist the Islamic extremist group al Qaeda in plotting the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Saudi Arabia has denied the claims.

"It's been 24 years of pain and anguish and fighting for our families. What happened to this community, what happened to America that day, was horrific. However, what's happening currently and what's been happening for the past 24 years has been an abomination," Eagleson said of the drawn-out legal fight.

MILITARY APPEALS COURT RULES DEFENSE SEC AUSTIN CANNOT RESCIND 9/11 PLEA DEALS

Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York said in a 45-page decision that a person could reasonably infer that the two individuals had some knowledge that they were supporting the plane hijackers who perpetrated the deadly attacks on the World Trade Center towers and Pentagon. Daniels said evidence also showed the pair were following instructions from senior officials in the Saudi embassy and that the court has jurisdiction to examine the merits of the plaintiffs' claims that the Saudi government had a hand in planning the attacks.

"Some of the disputed facts cannot be resolved at this stage of the litigation, because weighing the evidence or assessing witnesses' credibility will need to take place at trial," the judge wrote. "Nonetheless, the entire body of undisputed facts, and the Court's preliminary assessment of certain disputed facts, are adequate for the Court to conclude that the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate here."

Daniels' decision means the two-decade case is likely headed for trial, a point Eagleson made during the press conference.

"This is what we've all known for 20 years," Eagleson said. "It's time for America to learn what we've been fighting.… This is the best thing that we can do for the memories of our loved ones is let's stand up for what's right and just and let's have truth accountability and closure."

The attacks on Sept. 11 were carried out by 19 suspects associated with al Qaeda, led at the time by Usama bin Laden. They hijacked four commercial airplanes in the United States, crashing two into the twin towers in New York City, one into the Pentagon and another into a field in Pennsylvania. The 19 died in the attacks. Five others were charged in military tribunals and are being held at Guantanamo Bay.

The NCAA banned three Division I college basketball players by permanently revoking their eligibility on Wednesday, saying they had bet on their own games at Fresno State and San Jose State and were able to share thousands of dollars in payouts.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an enforcement investigation that uncovered violations by Mykell Robinson, Steven Vasquez and Jalen Weaver. The NCAA said the three bet on one another's games and/or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season; two of them manipulated their performances to ensure certain bets were won.

The NCAA said a sports integrity monitoring service in January notified Fresno State and NCAA enforcement staff that a Nevada sportsbook operator had flagged suspicious prop bets on Robinson. The investigation began a week later. The schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the former players could not immediately be located by The Associated Press.

According to the NCAA, Robinson and Vasquez had been roommates at Fresno State during the 2023-24 season. In January 2025, Robinson, who was still at Fresno State, and Vasquez, then at San Jose State — discussed over text message that Robinson planned to underperform in several statistical categories during one regular-season game. Robinson also placed multiple bets on Weaver, his teammate at Fresno State in 2024-25, the NCAA found.

During one game, Robinson, Vasquez and a third party bet a combined $2,200 on Robinson to underperform, and a $15,950 payout was redistributed among those who had bet, the NCAA said. 




During that same season, Robinson placed 13 daily fantasy sports over-line and under-line prop bets totaling $454 on parlays that included his own performance. He collected $618 on one occasion.

Robinson placed multiple bets on Weaver, including two bets placed before a game in late December 2024 after he and Weaver exchanged information about their respective betting lines, the NCAA said. Weaver also placed a $50 prop bet on a parlay for himself, Robinson and a third athlete, and he won $260.

Vasquez and Robinson failed to cooperate with the enforcement staff's investigation, the NCAA said. Weaver cooperated and agreed to the violation in his case.

All three were released from their respective teams and are no longer enrolled at their previous schools. Neither school was punished.

The latest case comes eight years after a 2017 federal investigation into off-the-books payments to players and their families that, at the time, was against NCAA rules and one of the biggest scandals in the sport's history.

Since then, the growth of legalized gambling across the United States has raised different concerns for college sports leaders and there have been scattered allegations, including some earlier this year, against programs involving betting.

The NCAA in June said that “several sports betting-related violations by staff members at NCAA schools” have been resolved in recent years and noted its enforcement staff was working on issuing notices of allegations in several ongoing gambling cases.

“The enforcement staff's sports betting-related caseload has significantly increased in recent years, and our staff — including our new sports betting integrity unit — has been effective in detecting and pursuing violations,” Jon Duncan, NCAA vice president of enforcement, said then. 

The nation's largest college sports organization, overseeing some 500,000 athletes, also said it was considering a proposal that would allow athletes and staff members to bet on professional sports and shift enforcement efforts to college sports betting and “behaviors that directly impact game integrity.” The Division I Council introduced the proposal that will be considered this fall and be implemented if Divisions II and III officials also approve.

Current NCAA rules do not allow athletes or institutional staff to engage in sports betting for any sports that have NCAA championships; bets by an athlete on their own team or own sport risks a lifetime ban from college athletics. Those rules would not change under the pending proposal.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three high-ranking FBI officials were fired last month in a “campaign of retribution” carried out by a director who knew better but caved to political pressure from the Trump administration so he could keep his own position, according to a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday that seeks reinstatement of the agents.

The complaint asserts that Director Kash Patel indicated directly to one of the ousted agents, Brian Driscoll, that he knew the firings were “likely illegal” but was powerless to stop them because the White House and the Justice Department were determined to remove all agents who helped investigate President Donald Trump. It quotes Patel as having told Driscoll in a conversation last month “the FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it.”

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Driscoll, Steve Jensen and Spencer Evans, three of five agents known to have been fired last month in a purge that current and former officials say has unnerved the workforce. It represents a legal challenge from the top rungs of the FBI's leadership ladder to a flood of departures under Trump's Republican administration that has wiped out decades of experience. Fired agents have leveled unflattering allegations of a law enforcement agency whose personnel moves are shaped by the White House and guided more by politics than by public safety.

“Patel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the FBI over protecting the American people,” the suit says. It adds that “his decision to do so degraded the country's national security by firing three of the FBI's most experienced operational leaders, each of them experts in preventing terrorism and reducing violent crime.”

Spokespeople for the FBI declined to comment on the lawsuit, as they also did after the agents were ousted.

The suit was filed in federal court in Washington, where judges and grand juries have pushed back against Trump administration initiatives and charging decisions. It names as defendants Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as the FBI, the Justice Department and the Executive Office of the President.




Besides reinstatement, the suit seeks, among other remedies, the awarding of back pay, an order declaring the firings illegal and even a forum for them to clear their names. It notes that Patel, in a Fox News Channel interview two weeks after the terminations, said “every single person” found to have weaponized the FBI had been removed from leadership positions even though the suit says there's no indication any of the three had done so.

“This false and defamatory public smear impugned the professional reputation of each of the Plaintiffs, suggesting they were something other than faithful and apolitical law enforcement officials, and has caused not only the loss of the Plaintiffs' present government employment but further harmed their future employment prospects,” the suit states.

The three fired officials, according to the lawsuit, had participated in and supervised some of the FBI's most complex work, including international terrorism investigations.

“They were pinnacles of what the rank-and-file aspired to, and now the FBI has been deprived not only of that example but has been deprived of very important operational competence,” said Chris Mattei, one of the agents' lawyers. “Their firing from the FBI, taken together, has put every American at greater risk than when Brian Driscoll, Steve Jensen and Spencer Evans were in positions of leadership.”

Another of their attorneys, Abbe Lowell, said the lawsuit shows FBI leadership is “carrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs.”

Perhaps the most prominent of the plaintiffs is Driscoll, a former commander of the FBI's specialized hostage rescue team who served as acting director between when then-Director Christopher Wray resigned in January and Patel was confirmed in February.

In that job, he had a well-publicized standoff in the first days of the Trump administration with a senior Justice Department official, Emil Bove, over Bove's demand for a list of agents who worked on the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol. Driscoll resisted the order in a dispute that led Bove to accuse him of “insubordination.”

Driscoll survived the dispute and took another high-profile position overseeing the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group, or CIRG, which deploys to crises. But new problems arose last month, the complaint says, when an FBI pilot whose duties including flying the bureau's private jet was falsely identified on social media as having been a case agent on the investigation into Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.

The complaint says Driscoll was told that the pilot, Chris Meyer, could no longer fly Patel on the FBI plane. Driscoll acceded to the request but refused to strip Meyer entirely of his pilot duties and balked when told of Trump administration desires to fire him.

The lawsuit recounts a conversation from early August in which Driscoll told Patel that it would be illegal to fire someone based on case assignments. Patel, according to the suit, said he understood the actions were “likely illegal” but that he had to fire who his superiors wanted him to “because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President.”

Meyer was later fired but is not among the plaintiffs in Wednesday's suit.

One of the plaintiffs, Jensen, was picked by Patel to run the bureau's Washington field office despite a backlash from Trump loyalists about his earlier leadership role coordinating investigations into the Capitol riot. The suit says that even as Jensen was publicly defended by FBI leadership, he was told by Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino that they were spending “a lot of political capital” to keep him in the position.

In May, according to the complaint, Bongino told him he would have to fire an agent assigned to his office who'd worked on Trump-related cases but also investigations into officials of both major political parties. That agent, Walter Giardina, was also among the five who were fired.

Another plaintiff, Evans, says he was targeted for retribution over his leadership role in the FBI's Human Resources Division during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which made him responsible for reviewing accommodation requests from employees seeking exemption from vaccine requirements. 

That position exposed Evans to a barrage of criticism from a former agent who the lawsuit says regularly aired his grievances against Evans on social media and maintained access to Patel.

Evans was among senior executives told in late January to either retire or be fired, but he was given a reprieve and permitted to remain in his job as leader of the Las Vegas field office. Despite being reassured that he had the support of Patel and Bongino, he was told in May that he would have to leave his position.

On Aug. 6, the lawsuit says, Evans was packing for a new FBI assignment in Huntsville, Alabama, when he was notified that he had been fired. The stated cause was a “lack of reasonableness and overzealousness” in implementing COVID-19 protocols, though the suit says he has no recollection of having ever denied a request for a vaccination exemption.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Jacksonville law enforcement officers violated the civil rights of a 22-year-old Black college student when they pulled him from his car and beat him during a traffic stop, according to a lawsuit filed in a federal court in Jacksonville on Wednesday. 

A video showing a Jacksonville Sheriff's officer punching and dragging William McNeil from his car during a stop in February went viral online this summer and sparked nationwide outrage.

Prosecutors announced in August they would take no action after determining the conduct of Officer D. Bowers of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office did not constitute a crime, according to an investigative report released by the State Attorney's Office for the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida.

McNeil's attorneys Ben Crump and Harry Daniels say Jacksonville Sheriff's Office's policies allow officers to engage in racial profiling and “illegal or excessive use of force” without fear of consequences. Crump is a Black civil rights attorney who has gained national prominence representing victims of police brutality and vigilante violence.

“It's an unjustifiable, unnecessary and most importantly unconstitutional use of force,” Crump said.

The attorneys said the lawsuit is aimed not only at addressing the treatment of their client, but at changing the culture of policing in the area.

Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters has said there's more to the story than the viral cellphone video and that McNeil was repeatedly asked to exit his vehicle. Waters, who is Black, said the footage from inside the car “does not comprehensively capture the circumstances surrounding the incident.”




The lawsuit names Waters, Bowers, and another officer named D. Miller, as well as the City of Jacksonville and Duval County government. A spokesperson for the sheriff's office declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.

According to a prosecutors' report, Bowers stopped McNeil for failing to turn on his headlights and buckle his seatbelt, after seeing his SUV parked outside a house the officer was surveilling for “drug activity.”

Questioning the justification for the stop, McNeil requested a supervisor respond to the incident. Based on a review of body camera footage, interviews with officers and statements by McNeil, prosecutors said Bowers gave McNeil a dozen “lawful commands,” which he disobeyed. 

Crump has claimed officers' accounts of the incident are unreliable and has fiercely criticized prosecutors' finding that officers did not commit any criminal wrongdoing, saying his client remained calm while the officers who are trained to de-escalate tense situations were the ones escalating violence. Crump said the case harkened back to the Civil Rights movement, when Black people were often attacked when they tried to assert their rights.

According to his attorneys, McNeil suffered a laceration to the chin and lip, a fractured tooth, and has been diagnosed with an “ongoing traumatic brain injury.” McNeil also continues to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder-like symptoms, including nightmares and flashbacks of the incident, his lawyers wrote in a legal filing.

McNeil's attorneys have also formally called on the Department of Justice to conduct its own investigation of the incident and what they described as “excessive force” and “systemic failures” by Jacksonville officials.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Protests in Nepal have revealed the extent of young people's frustration with the lack of opportunity in the Himalayan nation, as they spiraled into a broader challenge to the government. While around a fifth of young people are unemployed, many note that the children of the political elite seem to enjoy luxury lifestyles and numerous advantages.

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Soldiers in Nepal's capital ordered people to stay home Wednesday after the military came out in force overnight to halt two days of deadly unrest that prompted the government's collapse as protesters set buildings on fire.

Representatives of the protesters met with military officials at the army headquarters in Kathmandu to discuss a transitional leader, with some of them pushing for Sushila Karki, a popular former chief justice. 

The demonstrations by thousands of protesters were sparked Monday by a short-lived government ban on social media, drawing a police crackdown in which officers opened fire. The protests escalated Tuesday with attacks on government buildings. The overall death toll in the violence has reached 25, the Health Ministry said Wednesday, with 633 people injured.

The protests prompted Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli to resign Tuesday, and the country's ceremonial President Ram Chandra Poudel asked him to lead a transitional government until a new one can be put in place. But Oli fled from his official residence, and his whereabouts were not clear.

Rehan Raj Dangal, a representative of the protesters, said his group has proposed to military leaders that Karki head an interim government. Karki, the only woman to serve as chief justice of Nepal's Supreme Court, was a popular figure when she served in the post in 2016 and 2017.




However, other protesters from among the crowd who had gathered outside the army headquarters opposed the choice of Karki.

Armed troops guarded the main areas of Kathmandu, restoring some order after the violence and chaos of the previous days. Soldiers checked vehicles and people and told residents to stay in their homes.




The military is rarely mobilized in Nepal, and soldiers initially stayed in their barracks as police failed to control the protesters and the situation spun out of control. Late Tuesday, the security forces started to mobilize, saying they were committed to preserving law and order. 

On Wednesday, soldiers quelled a jailbreak in the heart of Kathmandu. Inmates at the main jail had overpowered guards, set fire to buildings and tried to escape. Soldiers fired into the air, apprehended the escaping inmates and transferred them to other jails. No injuries were reported.

The demonstrations — dubbed the protest of Gen Z — began after the government blocked social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube, saying those companies had failed to register and submit to government oversight.

The social media ban was lifted on Tuesday, but the protests continued, fueled by rage over 19 deaths of protesters blamed on police and despite government vows to investigate the deaths. 

The protests spiraled to reflect broader discontent. Many young people are angry that the children of political leaders — so-called nepo kids — seem to enjoy luxury lifestyles and numerous advantages while most youth struggle to find work. 

With youth unemployment running at about 20% last year, according to the World Bank, the government estimates that more than 2,000 young people leave the country every day to seek work in the Middle East or Southeast Asia.

Videos shared on social media show protesters beating up Nepali Congress party leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, the current foreign minister. Both appeared to be bleeding, while one video shows the party leader being helped to safety. The party is the country's largest and is part of the governing coalition. 

Protesters also set fires at the the parliament building, presidential house, the central secretariat that houses the offices of the prime minister and key ministries, and the prime minister's official residence.

Smoke was still rising from those buildings on Wednesday. 

The building of Kantipur publication, Nepal's biggest media outlet, also was torched and damaged. Car showrooms were also torched and burned-out vehicles dotted the streets. 

The violence unfolded as Nepal's government pursues a broader attempt to regulate social media with a bill aimed at ensuring the platforms are “properly managed, responsible and accountable.” 

The proposal has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and for punishing government opponents who voice their protests online.

The bill would require companies to appoint a liaison office or a point of contact in the country. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and fundamental rights.

The registration requirement applied to about two dozen social networks widely used in Nepal. Those that didn't comply were blocked last week, though TikTok, Viber and three other platforms that registered were operating without interruption.

Jerry O'Connell was looking for zen, but was left with a burden instead.

O'Connell, 51, claimed an unknown woman took his belongings while he was taking a yoga class in the Los Angeles area.

The "Pictionary" game show host said that his phone and wallet were stolen out of a pair of shoes he stashed in the studio before taking a class. O'Connell dubbed the woman who swiped his things the "yoga bandit," according to People.

The woman allegedly requested to use the restroom at the studio, which O'Connell later learned she lied about being late to class. When the session was over, O'Connell's belongings – which included cash – were missing.

"I wear the same pair of dirty old sneakers to yoga class and before class, I took them off and slipped my wallet and phone into the dirty shoes. I've done that over 100 times — I know this because my app says I've taken 107 classes," he told People.

He said it "made no sense" that his items were missing "since the door is locked."

"I told the guy at the desk in a hushed tone since I was still feeling the zen, and if there's a place where no one is going to freak out, it's a yoga studio," he told the outlet.

NBC first reported that Los Angeles Police Department officials took a theft report, and said the crime was caught on security cameras.

"We check the feed and we see her. She has pigtails, wearing yoga clothes, carrying a yoga mat and is wearing a yoga arm sleeve."

O'Connell added, "You can see her saying, ‘Oh shucks, I'm late for class,' and she bends down next to my dirty shoes and pulls out my wallet and phone, and leaves."

The culprit allegedly immediately charged "almost $500 at a department store and 100 bucks at the gas station," O'Connell said, before adding that American Express already had a new card ready for him.

The woman allegedly has a repeated history of incidents stealing from yoga studios.

"I went to the police station, and it turns out she'd gone to the yoga studio to case it a few times, and to other studios," the actor said.

"The only real bummer is that I had a photo of Rebecca from high school in my wallet, a four-leaf clover Jack McBrayer had given me, a $2 bill I got while shooting ‘Stand By Me,' and my grandfather Charles Witkowski's obituary."

The television host also kept his Powerball lottery tickets in the wallet.

"So if Gus's Liquor hits the jackpot, it could be the yoga bandit," he said before adding, "What are the rules about that? Is it my ticket or the yoga bandit's ticket?"

O'Connell added, "By the way, I have an Android, so good luck selling that. And Find My Android doesn't work."

The theft didn't stop the father-of-two from returning to the studio to perfect his practice.

"I was back today and took a class," he said. "Shout out to Zack, my yoga teacher – I can touch my toes because of him, so all things ended well."

New York City police are urging residents to be on alert for a man suspected of torturing an elderly Queens couple for hours before killing them and setting their home on fire – all under the guise of needing to come inside to charge his phone. 

The NYPD has released new photos of 42-year-old Jamel McGriff, an ex-con with a decades-long rap sheet, as police warn he is considered armed and dangerous. 

The victims have been identified as Frank and Maureen Olton, 76 and 77.

Police say surveillance video shows McGriff approaching a home around 10 a.m. and asking the resident if he could come inside to charge his phone, which the homeowner declined. 

McGriff proceeded to walk to the Oltons' home, where Frank initially let him into the backyard before both men were seen entering the house. 

Surveillance footage captured McGriff exiting the home around five hours later at 3 p.m., carrying two bags and walking eastbound on 87th Drive. Shortly after, the victims' son, an active-duty FDNY EMT, received a security alert that his parents' house was on fire and called 911.

"Once the flames were under control, two victims were found deceased inside the home – 76-year-old Frank Olton, who was the one seen on video interacting with the suspect outside, and Mr. Olton's wife, 77-year-old Maureen Olton," NYPD Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. "Mr. Olton was found in the basement tied to a pole with multiple stab wounds; Mrs. Olton was found on the first floor severely burned."

Tisch said McGriff's "modus operandi" includes distraction robbery, in which a suspect talks their way into a victim's residence before committing a crime. 

"Do not allow anyone you don't know or who you are not expecting into your home," Tisch added.

McGriff has a lengthy criminal history spanning decades, including a 16-year-long prison sentence stemming from a 2006 robbery conviction in which he was out on parole, FOX 5 reported. He is also wanted for two recent robberies – one at a Harlem GameStop in July and another at a Manhattan Verizon store, where he was reportedly fought off by a store clerk who noticed he was carrying a fake gun, police said. 

Last year, McGriff also failed to register as a sex offender, a parole violation, police said.

            The average American's diet is nutritionally disastrous and hurting children's health, according to the Make America Healthy Again Commission's latest action plan released Tuesday by the White House.
    


            Exposure to dangerous chemicals, overmedication, a lack of physical activity, poor sleep, too much screen time and stress are the other key drivers of the decline in children's health, according to the MAHA commission's latest report, “Make Our Children Healthy Again.”
    


            But does the new strategy report, spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., truly address the changes needed to improve children's well-being?
    


            CNN asked leading nutrition researchers, food safety advocates, pediatricians and health policymakers for their thoughts.
    


            Overall, experts CNN spoke with agree with the main MAHA diagnosis:  American children are increasingly affected by chronic disease that is largely preventable.
    


            “There is much in this report that is on target, especially the need to improve diet quality and increase physical activity while reducing screen time,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
    


            “However, some of the programs that would support better nutrition for children may be cut by the administration, such as the fruit and vegetable component of WIC, which is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children,” Willett said.
    


            “If we want to see healthier pregnancies and birth outcomes and more children having a healthy start in life, this benefit must be protected from any cuts,” the nonprofit National WIC Association stated in June when the 2026 budget was announced.
    


            More examples include the administration's “unprecedented cuts” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — and similar cuts to Medicaid, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    


            The SNAP program, which provides monthly benefits to help low-income individuals and families buy groceries, is the “most effective tool available to prevent hunger in America,” according to the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality.
    


Medicaid provides free or low-cost health coverage to the elderly, people with disabilities and some low-income pregnant women, families and children. Cuts to Medicaid hurt children by limiting their access to critical check-ups and preventive care and creates financial instability for families, experts say.
    


            The administration's cuts to key safety nets for children, “along with its chaotic, confusing actions restricting vaccine access are worsening — not resolving — efforts to improve children's health,” Kressly said in a statement.
    


            In addition, the administration has eliminated several programs of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that address chronic disease, while proposing budget cuts of at least 40% for research at the National Institutes of Health, said Dr. Peter Lurie, the president and executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit nutritional health advocacy group.
    


            There are also glaring blind spots that need to be addressed for American children to be truly healthy, Willett added.
    


            “Notably missing is mention of the No. 1 cause of death in children — gunshots,” he said. Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death in the United States for children and teens ages 1 to 19 years old, according to the CDC.



            “The authors say that they want to look for underlying causes of the chronic disease epidemic in children, but don't mention poverty and systemic racism, which are clearly important underlying contributors,” Willett added.
    


            The report includes little about sugar-sweetened beverages or lead in water, which Willett says are “huge and well-documented issues.” The report also ignores proven strategies — such as taxes on soda — “that can easily be implemented without further research, especially when the income is used to support nutrition and activity programs in children.”
    


            “Food dyes, fluoride and vaccine injury get a lot of attention, but are almost surely minor contributors to the epidemic, if they contribute at all,” Willett said.
    


            That's because the MAHA campaign has focused on Kennedy's “pet peeves,” and fails to marshal proven interventions for the underlying drivers of chronic disease, said Lurie, a former associate commissioner for public health strategy and analysis at the US Food and Drug Administration.
    


            “The actual causes of chronic disease in this country relate to added sugars, sodium and fats,” he said. “They relate to smoking, they relate to alcohol. But fixing those issues is either absent from this report or addressed in a very weak way.”
    


            The 2025 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, or DGAC, which analyzes recent nutrition research and suggests recommendations for new federal dietary guidelines, for the first time called for Americans to turn away from red and processed meats and embrace plant-based protein sources known to improve health, such as beans, peas and lentils.
    


            However, it appears that Kennedy and the MAHA Commission have “dismissed” the committee's work, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California, who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center's Nutrition Studies Research Group. Gardner was a key member of the DGAC scientific advisory panel — the final report from the administration is due out in December.
    


            “Given my recent participation in (the US Dietary Guidelines) process, my sense is the administration is disregarding solid science and replacing it with whim and whimsy — substituting seed oils with beef tallow for deep-frying french fries and cane sugar for high fructose cane syrup in soda,” Gardner said.
    


            “That's not going to help address the root causes of childhood obesity and poor health.”
    


            On average, children in the United States get nearly two-thirds of their calories from ultraprocessed foods packed full of additives and high-calorie sugars, salt and fat, according to a recent CDC report.
    


            This type of poor diet is contributing to alarming rates of childhood obesity and a rise in type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, high blood pressure and more in the nation's youth, experts say.
    


            A February review of 45 meta-analyses on almost 10 million people found just one extra serving of ultraprocessed food per day led to a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death. The review also found that eating more ultraprocessed foods may also increase the risk of obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression by 20%.
    


            While vilifying ultraprocessed foods has been a rallying cry for Kennedy and the MAHA movement, there is only a brief mention in the final report, said Barry Popkin, the W.R. Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health.
    


            “Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” said Popkin via email. “Sadly, they will support research and issue guidelines but provide no regulations or laws to mandate change.
    


            “In my opinion, it shows the food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries got to the White House and won the day,” he said.
    


            The MAHA commission's overriding message is still “more research needed,” said Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University in an email.
    


            “On reducing intake of ultra-processed foods, the report says it will try to develop a definition as a base for future research and policy — a distant goal,” said Nestle, author of numerous books on food politics and marketing, including 2015's “Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning).”
    


            “The big issue for me is what are they going to do about food marketing to children?” said Nestle, who has spoken out about the billions of dollars industry spends on advertising soda and ultraprocessed foods to children, especially minority children.
    


            “They will ‘explore' ‘potential' guidelines for industry. Really? That's all? This is such an opportunity,” Nestle said. “I sure wish they had taken it.”

New Mexico officials announced Monday that it will become the first state to make child care free regardless of one's income.

The universal child care program will build on an existing program that has provided child care at no cost to thousands of children. The expansion will begin in November.

“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico's future prosperity,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said in a statement announcing the expanded program Monday. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”

The governor's office said expanding the program will save New Mexico families an average of $12,000 per child per year. Lujan Grisham first campaigned on the issue during her first run for governor in 2018.

In 2022, voters in the state overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment to allocate a portion of the state's Land Grant Permanent Fund, which is largely funded by taxes on oil and gas, toward funding early childhood and public school education. The amendment paved the way for the state to begin offering free child care to most families. New Mexicans earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or annual household incomes of about $124,000, had qualified for free child care under the program.

In New Mexico's most recent budget, the Early Childhood Education and Care Department received a $113 million increase in funds, bringing its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that fund will go toward child care payment support.

“New Mexico is creating the conditions for better outcomes in health, learning, and well-being,” Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health, and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of the Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities, said in a statement. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.

New Mexico additionally announced plans to invest millions to construct, expand, and renovate child care facilities.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's emergency order over the nation's capital, which federalized its police force and launched a surge of law enforcement into the city, is set to expire overnight Wednesday after Congress failed to extend it.

But the clash between Republicans and the heavily Democratic district over its autonomy was only set to intensify, with a House committee beginning to debate 13 bills that would wrest away even more of the city's control if approved.

Mayor Muriel Bowser's office said the order expires at midnight. The National Guard and some other federal agencies will continue their deployment and it's not clear when that might end.

Trump's takeover of Washington's policing and Wednesday's discussions in the House underscore how interlinked the capital is with the federal government and how much the city's capacity to govern is beholden to federal decisions. 

For the last 30 days, the city's local Metropolitan Police Department has been under the control of the president for use in what he described as a crimefighting initiative. 

Local police joined hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and agents on sweeps and roundups and other police operations. About 2,000 members of the National Guard from D.C. as well as seven states were also part of the surge of law enforcement. 

Crime has dropped during the surge, according to figures from the White House and the local police department, but data also showed crime was falling in the lead up to the federal takeover.




Congress, satisfied by steps that Bowser has taken to ensure that the cooperation with the city will continue, decided not to extend the emergency, returning the police to district control. 

But Bowser, who has walked a tightrope in collaborating with Trump in an effort to protect the city's home rule, must now pivot to a Congress that has jurisdiction over the city. The next order of business is a series of proposals that will be debated Wednesday by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 

Thirteen of the bills call for repealing or changing D.C. laws. Some provisions in play would remove the district's elected attorney general, who recently asked a judge to intervene in the takeover. Others would allow the president to appoint someone to the position. 

There is also a move to lower the age of trying juveniles to 14 from 16 for certain crimes, and one to change the bail system and remove methods the council can use to extend emergency bills.

Even if the bills pass the committee and House, the question is whether they can get through the filibuster-proof Senate. D.C. activists have already begun lobbying Senate Democrats.

Bowser urged the leaders of the House Oversight Committee to reject those proposals. 

She argued that a bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Gosar, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, would “make the District less efficient, competitive, and responsive.” She said she looks forward to working with the committee to build a “productive partnership” that “respects the will of D.C. residents and honors the principles of home rule.”

Republican Rep. Ron Estes and several Republican colleagues said they want their constituents to feel safe visiting the capital, and noted the recent murder of an intern who worked in Estes' office. “We want to make sure that we have a capital that Americans are proud of,” Estes said.

Members of the Republican Study Committee in the House held a news conference Sept. 2 praising Trump's intervention and supporting codifying his executive order. 

“Congress has a clear constitutional authority over D.C., and we will use it without hesitation to continue making D.C. safe and great again,” said Rep. August Pfluger, chairman of that committee.

Bowser said the bills are an affront to the city's autonomy and said “laws affecting the district should be made by the district.”

The district is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973 but federal political leaders retain significant control over local affairs, including the approval of the budget and laws passed by the D.C council. 

Bowser has said repeatedly that statehood, a nonstarter for Republicans in Congress, is the only solution.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Within a week of Donald Trump's election, Sen. Lindsey Graham counseled the president-elect to quickly send a message to the drug cartels from the White House.

“Blow up something,” Graham told Trump.

The brazen military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling speedboat carrying 11 people from Venezuela this month is just what the South Carolina senator had in mind. But it has cleaved fresh divisions within the Republican Party over Trump's campaign promise to keep the U.S. out of foreign entanglements and the reality of a commander in chief whose America First agenda is pursuing a tougher military stance.

And it's raising stark questions about just how far Trump intends to wield his presidential power over the U.S. military without a robust check on the executive branch from Congress. 

Already, Trump has dropped 30,000-pound (13,600-kilogram) bombs on Iran's nuclear sites without any new authorizations from Capitol Hill. He deployed the military to Los Angeles over the objections of California's Democratic governor and wants the National Guard in other cities, too. Trump's allies pressured senators to confirm Pete Hegseth as defense secretary despite objections to his past behavior and skepticism of “warrior culture” at the Pentagon. And last week Trump rebranded the Department of Defense as the Department of War. 

“I don't care whether it's a Republican president or a Democrat president,” said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, once a Trump rival for the White House. “We can't just want to kill people without having some kind of process.”

“We're just going to blow up ships? That just isn't who we are,” Paul said.




The Trump administration, and the president himself, have said the lethal strike on the vessel from Venezuela was intended to make it clear that the U.S. would not tolerate drugs being shipped into this country. They said those killed on the boat in the Caribbean included members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which operates from Venezuela, though details have been scarce.

“Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military,” Vice President JD Vance posted on social media.

When a prominent commenter suggested that killing civilians without due process would be a war crime, Vance replied that he didn't care “what you call it.”

Paul, the senator, responded to Vance with his own questions.

“Did he ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?” Paul wrote. “Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation??

“What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial.”

A bipartisan briefing on the matter for the Senate's top national security staff was abruptly canceled last week. And Tuesday's rescheduled session left many questions unanswered. 

The Trump administration did not explain its authority for the strike and would not provide legal opinion, according to a person familiar with the briefing who insisted on anonymity because it was closed.

“Where is the legality here?” said Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut.

“I understand the need for us to be able to take out drug dealers from being able to deliver drugs into the United States,” he said. “There's a legal way to do that.”

But Kelly said he worries for the military officers involved with the mission. “What situation did we, did the White House, just put them in?” he said. “I don't know if this was legal or not.”

After Trump announced the strike, Venezuelan state television showed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores walking the streets of his childhood neighborhood. A television presenter said Maduro was “bathing in patriotic love” as he interacted with supporters.

Maduro did not immediately address the strike directly but charged that the United States was “coming for Venezuela's riches,” including the world's largest proven oil reserves.

Republicans have been shifting their national security priorities since Trump's first term moved the GOP away from its traditional mooring as a party with a muscular approach to confronting adversaries and assisting allies abroad.

Trump's America First approach initially launched a new era of U.S. neo-isolationism more aligned with the libertarian-leaning Paul than traditional defense hawks like Graham.

But in his second term, Trump is testing not his national security vision but his power to enact it.

Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he is “extremely confident” that the target of the boat bombing was “a group of narco-terrorists.”

“I can't tell you how many lives were saved by the president of the United States when he pulled the trigger on that,” Risch said Tuesday. “There were tons of drugs that went down with that that would've wound up right here in the USA.”

Gesturing to the Supreme Court building across from the Capitol, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he believes the president's actions fall under his Article II authority, since the administration said the drugs were heading to the U.S.

“My gut intuition is it's within the president's commander in chief powers,” Hawley said.

But Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for lawmakers to receive a full briefing from the Trump administration, including the legal rationale for the military strike.

If the president exceeded his authority, then the Senate must consider all remedies available, including limiting the use of funds for further unauthorized military operations, he said. “We cannot risk the life of American servicemembers based on secret orders and dubious legal theories,” Reed said.

Graham, a former judge advocate general, or JAG, officer in the Navy, recalled his advice as Trump prepared to return to the White House.

“Whether it's a lab, I don't care if it's in Mexico, I don't care where it is,” Graham recalled. “I said, ‘Look for a target that changes the game.'”

Asked if the strike on the Venezuelan boat was it, Graham said: “Works for me.”

Heather and Jared Barnhart, both from the digital forensics firm Cellebrite, discuss some of the evidence they recovered from Bryan Kohberger's cellphone and laptop - including 'American Psycho'-style selfies and searches for serial killers.

Idaho student killer Bryan Kohberger posed around his Washington State University apartment making faces at his phone camera, creepy newly released selfies show.

Wearing cordless headphones and standing in front of a closet full of blue shirts, the bare-chested Kohberger salutes the camera in a selfie, showing a cut on one of his knuckles.

In another, he's making a contorted face, revealing a row of yellow teeth as he grins.

(Bryan Kohberger)

And in a third, the gaunt 30-year-old killer flexes, purses his lips and squints.

The images, first published by NewsNation, were recovered from Kohberger's phone after his arrest on Dec. 30, 2022, at his parents' house in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania. Digital forensics experts dug through it, looking for his search activity, contacts and other data to help police build their case against him.

Jared and Heather Barnhart, from the digital forensics firm Cellebrite, previously described the images in an interview with Fox News Digital.

"I watched ‘American Psycho' back in the day, and how vain he was, where he would always take like naked photos of himself flexing, similar to that, like with him just in pants, but topless from the waist up, flexing [in] a mirror forward, backward, making different expressions, but just for himself," said Heather Barnhart, the senior director of forensics research at Cellebrite. "It was like he admired his body."

Even more odd, he didn't share his many pictures with anyone, said her husband, Jared Barnhart.

"He takes his shirt off, flexes his muscles, and takes a picture of himself, and then just goes back to whatever he was doing before," he told Fox News Digital. "Nonsense."

While the Barnharts did not have the authority to share the photos, they described them as "narcissistic" and strange. He even took photos at bizarre angles, highlighting himself from behind and in profile.

Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one of felony burglary last month.

He is serving four-consecutive life sentences, plus another 10 years, for the murders of University of Idaho students Xana Kernodle, 20, Ethan Chapin, 20, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Madison Mogen, 21.

The plea deal required him to waive his right to appeal and his right to seek a sentence reduction.

President Donald Trump addresses the deadly stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina from the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump called for Decarlos Brown Jr. to face the death penalty for the alleged murder of Iryna Zarutska on Wednesday.

Trump made the statement on social media, saying the trial for suspect Decarlos Brown Jr. should be "quick." 

"The ANIMAL who so violently killed the beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety, should be given a ‘Quick' (there is no doubt!) Trial, and only awarded THE DEATH PENALTY," Trump posted on Truth Social. "There can be no other option!"

Zarutska's slaying has brought about heavy criticism of Democrats, who critics accuse of adopting soft-on-crime laws that allow violent criminals to roam the streets. Trump argued Monday that the victim's "blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail."

Trump also placed blame for Zarutska's killing on former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is now running for the Senate in battleground North Carolina in a crucial 2026 showdown that may determine if Republicans keep control of the chamber.

Brown, who is Black, was arrested soon after the stabbing and charged with first-degree murder. On Tuesday, the Department of Justice charged Brown with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

Records obtained by Fox News Digital showed that Brown has a history of arrests going back more than a decade, including convictions for felony larceny and felony breaking and entering in 2013, and a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon that sent him to prison for more than six years. He was released in 2020 but remained on parole until 2021, and subsequent charges against him included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year.

On Monday, Trump noted other recent killings in the U.S., saying that actions, like his administration's push to end cashless bail, must be taken.

"This cashless bail started a wave in our country where a killer kills somebody and is out on the street by the afternoon and, in many cases, going out and killing again, cashless bail," Trump said.

HUD Secretary Scott Turner discusses President Donald Trump's plan to combat sky-high home prices on 'Fox & Friends.'

EXCLUSIVE: One of the House GOP's staunchest housing affordability advocates is calling President Donald Trump's rumored emergency order on the issue a "game-changer."

House Main Street Caucus Chair Mike Flood, R-Neb., who also chairs the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee on the House Financial Services Committee, told Fox News Digital that he is hoping Trump ultimately follows through on declaring an emergency on housing affordability.

"When you have a housing shortage and a supply issue, it pushes up valuations, which pushes up your property taxes, because your valuation goes up. It pushes up home insurance premiums because the value of your home is more expensive if there was some kind of a claim," Flood explained.

"So the president of the United States putting his thumb on the scale and saying that housing is in a crisis situation, and it's an emergency – that changes the entire conversation."

Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner told FOX Business on Tuesday that talks were ongoing on the issue but declined to make any firm declarations ahead of Trump.

"Those discussions are being had, not just from an emergency declaration standpoint, but what can we do in order to bring the costs down… and bring the supply up," Turner said.

Home prices have skyrocketed in recent years, outpacing wage growth and making small houses that were once considered "starters" for young families out of reach for millions of Americans.

Zoning restrictions, high building costs, regulatory issues and insufficient levels of new construction have all been named as reasons for the current crisis.

Additionally, new tariffs on materials like steel, aluminum and lumber are projected to add about $10,900 to the cost of building a new single-family home, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

"It's going to take the federal government, the state governments and the municipalities, most notably, to fix this," Flood said.

He added that his panel was also working on bipartisan legislation, expected in October or November, to make housing more affordable nationwide.

"We have been working in our subcommittee and on Financial Services on our effort that will, I think, take a few steps forward, and hope to mark that up later this year in maybe October, November," Flood said. "But the president coming in and making this a priority is what's going to push this at light speed across the finish line."

He added: "I truly think we can get something done by June of next year."

Flood also stressed that housing affordability is a key election issue for Americans.

"Since 2020, we've seen 20% inflation, home insurance premiums are more expensive, mortgage rates are higher. You know, you've got all these rules in the federal programs that make it nearly impossible to be really effective with the assistance that HUD provides," Flood said.

"And with the president doubling down on an issue that I am very passionate about, I think that this is going to resonate with Americans, because this is what people are talking about."

It is as horrific as anything you'll ever see happen to an innocent person: A young Ukrainian woman, minding her own business on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, suddenly attacked from behind by a black man wielding a knife, stabbing and killing her before walking off and saying, “I got the white girl.”

And the murder is all on video. Iryna Zarutska was a refugee from Ukraine who fled the country after the Russians invaded for the alleged safety and security in the United States. But that thought process turned out to be an illusion, because our so-called leaders and judges have made this country infinitely less safe for no good reason.

CRIME IN US CITIES AS TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND CRACKDOWN: LATEST COVERAGE

The suspect is Decarlos Brown Jr. He has a rap sheet that includes several counts of federal larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon, assaulting his sister, trespassing, and calling 911 from a hospital, among other crimes.

So the question is: How was the person not already in prison? The answer, of course, is that he was continually arrested only to be put back on the street despite being a clear danger to others.

This case was originally not covered at all by most legacy media outlets despite being a top trending story on social media sites such as X. But when it got too big to ignore, what we read and heard out of networks such as Axios and CNN was, and there's no other word to describe it, despicable.

Here's an actual Axios headline on Monday:

“The gruesome video of the fatal knife attack on Iryna Zarutska on a light-rail car in Charlotte is drawing attention from MAGA influencers seeking to elevate the issue of violent urban crime — and accuse mainstream media of under-covering shocking cases.”

Wait, what? The fatal knife attack is only drawing attention from MAGA influencers? It's creating, per Axios's clear implication, a perception that violent urban crime is somehow exaggerated?

Let's look at the numbers where this latest murder took place, in Charlotte. In 2018, according to the Charlotte Police Department, there were 57 murders recorded. In 2024, that number nearly doubled to 110. Are “MAGA influencers” therefore wrong in elevating the issue of violent crime in Charlotte and other major cities?

Thankfully, the Axios story was eviscerated online for its blatant bias and dishonesty. But it didn't stop there: Enter CNN's Brian Stelter, who piously lectured earlier this week that race had absolutely, positively nothing to do with Zarutska's execution.

“Most murders in the U.S. never become national news,” Stelter said Monday. “This one's got our attention for a couple of reasons. No. 1, first and foremost, the recent release of that gruesome video. Second, the energy from pro-Trump activists. They picked up on this video from local news and ran with it.

“In this case, it is Trump-aligned influencers who are posting up a storm about this case on social media, really over the weekend. Elon Musk, Charlie Kirk, other Trump-aligned figures succeeded in making this senseless death a symbol of big-city crime.

“I have to say, some of the replies to Musk, some of the comments around this story are baldly racist, stoking fear of African Americans because this man attacked a White woman. The open racism on sites like X today, it's eye-popping.”

Stelter never mentioned that the alleged killer boasted, “I got the white woman” after stabbing her to death. Race absolutely played a factor here. But Stelter is especially accomplished at the bias of omission to push false narratives. He didn't disappoint here. Nor did Van Jones, who once somehow chalked up President Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton to racist voters.

“We don't know why this man did what he did,” Jones said Monday night before blaming Kirk for assigning a motive to the murder based on race. But when the alleged murderer invokes race after committing the act, as was the case here, it's only common sense to assign that very motive.

“I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed in Charlotte by a madman, a lunatic,” Trump said Monday. “She's just sitting there, it's on the tape. It's not really watchable because it's so horrible, just viciously stabbed. They're evil people. We have to be able to handle that. If we don't handle that, we don't have a country.”

The effort by the media in their coverage of the Charlotte murder is part of a larger effort to attack Trump on his tough-on-crime policy. We've seen it for weeks, starting with Trump's decision to send in the National Guard to Washington, resulting in a steep drop in crime. He wants to send the National Guard into Chicago next, but Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) is resisting at every turn in offering zero cooperation while claiming that Chicago has become a much safer city.

But on cue, over Labor Day weekend alone, 54 people were shot in Chicago. Nine were killed. Last weekend, 19 people were shot, and seven were killed. Yet Pritzker, because he really wants to be president, continues to deny Trump's offer to help simply to play the role of resistance hero in an effort to boost poll numbers with progressive Democrats.

Speaking of progressive Democrats, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) weighed in to share what the role of law enforcement is really about. And if you thought stupidity is a handicap in politics, think again.

“I want to be clear that, like, law enforcement isn't to prevent crime,” she said on a podcast ironically called Grounded. “Law enforcement solves crime, OK? That is what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to solve crimes, not necessarily to prevent them from happening, per se.”

OK, so by this logic, if police raid the home of a possible mass shooter before he carries out such an attack, they're not doing their job? Or if a highway patrol officer pulls over a drunk driver before he or she kills someone, that's also not part of the job?

Back to the Charlotte murder, the suspect, Brown, once told officers after being arrested that he believed that he was given some kind of material that “controlled what he ate,” according to police records. When officers told Brown they couldn't help him with this fabricated condition, a judge simply released him without bail. Overall, Brown had been arrested in the same county 14 times, including for violent crimes, yet was continually released back into the public.

From 2017 until earlier this year, North Carolina was run by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who plans to run for Senate in 2026. And just as it is with Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Pritzker, it will be interesting to hear how he's going to defend himself on his record when it comes to what appears to be an unofficial catch-and-release policy in the Tar Heel State.

A recent Ipsos poll shows that then-President Joe Biden was 26 points underwater in August 2024 on how voters viewed his handling of crime. Trump has surged on this issue following the National Guard deployment to Washington, with a majority of people now approving of his tactics.

Once again, Democrats and their allies in the media are on the wrong side of a major issue.

Zarutska should be alive today.

Brown should have been in a prison cell for some time now.

The system failed her.

MASS SHOOTINGS ARE A CULTURAL SICKNESS WITH NO LEGISLATIVE CURE

The media continue to fail us.

Israel struck the headquarters of Hamas' political leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as the group's top figures gathered to consider a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

The tiny, gas-rich Gulf Arab state of Qatar hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. It has evacuated tens of thousands of American citizens from Afghanistan. It has been designated a U.S. “major non-NATO ally.” It has even lavished a $400 million jumbo jet on President Donald Trump for use as Air Force One.

None of that protected this quiet peninsula in the Persian Gulf from coming under an Israeli aerial attack on Tuesday as it mediated U.S.-backed negotiations to end the Israel-Hamas war.

Israel struck a meeting of Hamas' exiled political leadership in Qatar's capital of Doha, sending plumes of smoke and debris rising over a city of air-conditioned World Cup stadiums and luxury malls typically shielded by U.S. interceptor batteries.

Since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited its war in Gaza, the Israeli military has targeted Hamas leaders far afield. 

But while Israel considers Tehran and Beirut fair game, it had refrained from striking Hamas' political office in Qatar, the key mediator and U.S. ally that Israeli leadership relied on as a back channel to the Palestinian militant group.

On Tuesday, Israel made a dangerous gamble, analysts say, poisoning Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks, sending political shock waves through the region and raising doubts about historical U.S. security guarantees for its Gulf Arab allies. 

It didn't immediately pay off for Israel: Hamas claims its senior leadership survived the strike. 




“This is a broader shock for the international order, raising questions about sovereignty and the free rein being given to Israel,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House. “The reliability of the United States in the Middle East will be questioned.” 

Qatar has long come under fire for hosting Hamas and faced rising pressure to evict its top leadership. 

But it was a U.S.-supported arrangement that allowed Hamas to open its political office in Doha in 2012 as Washington sought to establish indirect lines of communication with the Palestinian militant group it designates as a terrorist organization.

Hosting Hamas and other armed groups, such as the Taliban, has helped Qatar carve out an influential position in global conflict mediation. Qatari officials believed that the emirate's designation as a major U.S. non-NATO ally and its Al Udeid Air Base, regional headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, lent it security cover that would restrain Israel. 

Israeli strikes shattered that illusion on Tuesday, crashing into central Doha despite all the U.S. missile batteries and radar systems tracking aerial threats from Al Udeid.

The U.S. said Israel alerted it before striking. Whatever warning the White House said it passed to Qatar was too little, too late: Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said his country was only notified as the bombs were falling.

The apparent U.S. disregard for Qatari security and sovereignty rattled nerves across the sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, which, despite past ideological disputes over Qatar's Islamist sympathies, marshaled a strong show of unity.

“The security of the Arab Gulf states is indivisible, and we stand heart and soul with the sisterly Qatar, condemning the treacherous Israeli attack,” said Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates.

Although the U.S. remains the only country willing to station thousands of troops across the Persian Gulf, the perception of Washington as an unreliable ally to Gulf Arab nations has grown in recent years, analysts say. The UAE and Saudi Arabia in particular have sought to diversify their relationships, growing closer to China and Russia.

“They don't want to rely solely on the U.S. for security, they want ties with a range of global actors,” said Will Todman, a senior fellow with the Middle East program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “(Israel's) strikes will accelerate that trend.” 

Gulf Arab countries — with small militaries and oil-dependent economies uniquely vulnerable to shocks of any kind — now see Israel's belligerence as a source of growing concern, even more so than Iran's.

While Emiratis and Saudis view political Islam as a threat and loathe Hamas, experts say they'd prefer a detente with their weakened rivals to the continuation of an ever-widening war that could trigger strikes on their soil.

“The Gulf states are not secretly happy about the strikes on Hamas,” said Vakil. “They see Israel's continued military activities as destabilizing for the region. Traditionally, Iran was the most serious threat, but now — with Iran weakened but not defeated — it's Israel they are worried about.” 

That doesn't bode well for Israel's ambitions to expand the so-called “Abraham Accords,” which established ties between Israel and four Arab countries, first among them the UAE and Bahrain in 2020. 

Before the Israel-Hamas war, there were signs that regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia might join as well, regarding such an alliance as a bulwark against Iran and its unruly regional proxies.

But Israel has since pummeled Iran and its allies. Its devastating campaign in Gaza has ignited anger across the Arab world, prompting Saudi Arabia to revive its insistence on Palestinian statehood as a condition for normalizing ties with Israel.

Tuesday's strike now dashes any lingering hopes that Israel might have of cozying up to other Arab countries, analysts say.

“For all intents and purposes, normalization is dead for Gulf Arab states today,” said Dina Esfandiary, the lead Middle East analyst at Bloomberg Economics, a research group. “How do you normalize with the country that's attacking one of your brothers?”

Doha has been a focal point since the war started for delicate negotiations with Israel to end the fighting and free dozens of Israeli hostages still held captive in Gaza. 

The Hamas leaders targeted in Israel's attack had been meeting to discuss the Trump administration's latest ceasefire proposal, which called for Hamas to immediately release the 48 Israeli hostages still in Gaza — 20 of whom are believed to be alive. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, beholden to his far-right political allies, has resisted calls to end the war and planned a new ground offensive to seize Gaza City — an escalation that many fear will doom remaining Israeli hostages and exacerbate a humanitarian crisis for Palestinians.

Qatari Prime Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he thought it wasn't worth continuing the ceasefire negotiations in light of the attack. Even without killing top Hamas leaders or altering the course of the war, the strike confirmed the worst fears of risk-averse Gulf Arab states, experts said.

“The attack was a message not just to Hamas but to the region,” Vakil said. “Military pressure will continue, with Washington seeing Israeli dominance as effective.”

PUTIN'S IMPUNITY UNIMPEDED: As President Donald Trump continues to threaten, but fails to deliver, tough new sanctions in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's rejection of Trump's peace overtures, members of his party are calling on him to take action. 

Tuesday night was another night of drone and missile attacks, in what has been a major escalation of Russian air assault since the summit meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska nearly four weeks ago. Overnight, at least eight Russian drones lost their way and ended up being shot down by Polish and NATO fighter jets after they crossed into Polish airspace. At least one house was hit, but no injuries were reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a post on X, accused Russia of intentionally attacking Poland with the goal of humiliating the NATO member. “Increasing evidence indicates that this movement, this direction of strike, was no accident,” Zelensky alleged while noting that if NATO jets can shoot down drones over Poland, why not over Ukraine, where Russia targets civilians with impunity. “Ukraine has long proposed to its partners the creation of a joint air-defense system to ensure the guaranteed downing of ‘Shaheds,' other drones, and missiles through the combined strength of our combat aviation and air defenses.”

POLAND SCRAMBLES AIRCRAFT TO DESTROY RUSSIAN DRONES VIOLATING ITS AIRSPACE

TRUMP ‘HAS BEEN TERRIBLE ON RUSSIA': As Putin continues to thumb his nose at Trump, Republicans in Congress are growing weary of Trump's constantly moving “two-week” deadlines to impose a cost on Russia for failing to engage in meaningful negotiations. “He's been weak on Russia,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) told CNN's Manu Raju Tuesday morning. “I think he's been great on Iran, but he has been terrible on Russia.”

“We've tried to be hoping the president would get to the right spot on Russia and Ukraine, and he's not,” Bacon said. “And, you know, Biden was weak. And Biden's actions in Afghanistan helped fuel this thing with Ukraine. But what I see with this president is even worse.”

In a later appearance on CNN, Bacon said Trump is “being ill-served by leaders within the DOD,” particularly when it comes to Trump administration plans to end security assistance to Baltic countries on NATO's eastern flank. “He's got people in his administration pulling the wrong way, and it's time for fellow Republicans like me to be calling these guys out,” Bacon said. “I'm going to, we're going to fight and make the case for keeping funding for the Baltic Security Initiative, but also to ensure that our friends in Ukraine receive the weapons they need, that we do the sanctions against Russia.”

PUTIN ‘IS DIRECTLY TESTING OUR RESOLVE': While many Republicans are hesitant to criticize the president, Bacon is not a lone voice. “Putin is no longer content just losing in Ukraine while bombing mothers and babies, he is now directly testing our resolve in NATO territory,” Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) posted on X Tuesday night. “Russia is attacking NATO ally Poland with Iranian Shahed drones less than a week after President Trump hosted President Nawrocki at the White House. This is an act of war.

“I urge President Trump to respond with mandatory sanctions that will bankrupt the Russian war machine and arm Ukraine with weapons capable of striking Russia,” Wilson wrote. “Putin stated that ‘Russia knows no borders.' Free and prosperous nations will teach Russia about borders.”

On Sunday, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) posted on X, “President Trump met with Putin 3 weeks ago. Since then, Putin met with his fellow authoritarians to conspire against the US. Then he returned to Moscow to authorize the largest airstrike on Ukraine since the start of his illegal invasion. It's time to stop this liar and murderer.”

“The president has done a number of things to demonstrate that he was being patient. But now is the time to actually put Putin in a position where he is going to fail,” Tillis said in an appearance on CNN. “I don't believe that that man deserves a seat at the table, and I believe that the Ukrainians deserve our full support and the support of the Western world.

“I really believe if you don't have a counterweight to a growing threat of totalitarianism, and the litmus test is in Ukraine, we fail in Ukraine, we're going to put far more American lives at risk, having to regain the foothold that we have for democracy in Europe,” Tillis said. “So, now is the time.”

HAPPENING TODAY: TRUMP ‘UNHAPPY,' AGAIN: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dealt a fatal blow to Trump's effort to broker a final settlement of the war with Hamas and may have sealed the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages when he ordered an airstrike on the Hamas negotiators who had assembled in Doha, Qatar, to begin another round of negotiations to consider a U.S. proposal to end the fighting.

Israel notified the United States of the strike as it was apparently already getting underway, and the U.S. tried to warn Qatar, but the heads-up came too late for Qatar to do anything. Five “lower-ranking” members of the Hamas negotiating team and a security official reportedly died in the attack, according to Hamas.

Qatar, a major U.S. ally that hosts a sprawling U.S. air base and recently gifted a luxury jet to Trump for use as Air Force One, felt humiliated, and Trump was angry. “I was very unhappy about” the strike, Trump told reporters. “Very unhappy about every aspect.”

Shortly after the strike, Trump vented on his Truth Social page, “This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me. Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals.

“I view Qatar as a strong Ally and friend of the U.S., and feel very badly about the location of the attack. I want ALL of the Hostages, and bodies of the dead, released, and this War to END, NOW!” Trump wrote. “I also spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu after the attack. The Prime Minister told me that he wants to make Peace. I believe this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for PEACE. I also spoke to the Emir and Prime Minister of Qatar, and thanked them for their support and friendship to our Country. I assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”

TRUMP FUMES OVER ISRAEL'S ATTACK ON DOHA AND ASSURES QATAR IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN

‘POTENTIALLY THE END OF THE ROAD FOR THE HOSTAGES': Netanyahu has expressed no regrets or reservations about the attack, even as it completely upends the prospects for any negotiated settlement and puts the lives of remaining hostages in jeopardy. 

“Today's action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation,” he said in a statement released by his office on Facebook. “Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility.”

Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said on CNN, “This certainly diminishes the prospects of returning the hostages and particularly those who are still alive. Because what Hamas is saying right now is that the United States lured these people into Qatar in order to set up the Israeli strike. So that undercuts our ability to be an interlocutor and someone that can help moderate a peace. And it certainly increases their disbelief in whether Netanyahu is serious about a ceasefire and a release of the hostages.”

Former NATO Commander retired Adm. James Stavridis said on CNN, “I think it's potentially the end of the road for the hostages. I certainly hope not. But their situation is going to be dire in the days ahead. Operationally, I think this will kind of greenlight the Israeli operations in Gaza, continuing to drop major apartment complexes, subdue the entire Gaza City. That's a tall order. But this is showing the Israelis' intent to do that.”

OPINION: WHY ISRAEL'S STRIKE ON HAMAS LEADERS IN QATAR MATTERS

US AND INDIA TALKING AGAIN: After a period when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was reportedly refusing to take Trump's calls and was seen warmly embracing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin at a summit in China, Trump seemed to be writing off the erstwhile U.S. ally. “Looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday. “May they have a long and prosperous future together!”

But as of Wednesday morning, it appears the old pals have patched things up.

“I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks,” Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday night. “I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!

“India and the US are close friends and natural partners. I am confident that our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership,” Modi responded on X Wednesday morning. “Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump. We will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people.”

            As public outrage grew over last month's killing on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, Mayor Vi Lyles focused her initial statement on addressing mental health issues, warning that “we will never arrest our way” out of some of the underlying causes of crime.
    


            A day later, facing accusations that she had downplayed the stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, Lyles pivoted. She announced an increased law enforcement presence on the transit system and accused the local courts of “tragic failure.”
    


            “Our police officers arrest people only to have them quickly released, which undermines our ability to protect our community and ensure safety,” Lyles said.
    


            The shift in tone illustrates Democrats' ongoing challenges in messaging on public safety.
    


            Five years after the murder of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a brief push among some Democrats to cut funding from police departments to provide money to social services, the party has failed to articulate a vision that addresses concerns over crime and criminal justice reform.
    


            Zarutska's death, and the release last week of surveillance video capturing the attack, has ignited several veins of the national debate over public safety.
    


            Democrats agree that their messaging lacks the simplicity and cohesion of Republicans' tough-on-crime approach. There is also a growing consensus that, even if federal statistics show that crime is down, that doesn't change voters' perception of their own safety.
    


            “We need to learn at long last that data does not make people feel and it doesn't shift perception,” said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank. “Data is a tool, but only a fairly useless one in politics.”
    


            While the party struggles to define its own policies, it risks being defined by President Donald Trump, who has threatened to send more federal forces to Democratic-led cities after deploying the National Guard to Washington, DC.
    


            Republicans including Trump and North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley have claimed that Democratic prosecutors, judges and lawmakers have supported policies that allow people like the alleged attacker to be on the streets.
    


            “For far too long, Americans have been forced to put up with Democrat-run cities that set loose savage, bloodthirsty criminals to prey on innocent people,” Trump said in an Oval Office video posted Tuesday.
    


            An AP-NORC poll released August 31 found that 55% of US adults said deploying the National Guard to assist police departments was acceptable or somewhat acceptable to them. A slight majority, 53%, said they approved of how the president is handling crime, compared with 43% who approve of his handling of the economy.
    


            The poll found that 66% of adults think crime is a “major problem” in the United States.
    


            “Republicans actually take the issue seriously,” said Matt Mercer, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party. “For years now you've seen Democrats really talk about how we really need to feel more sorry for the people committing crimes than those who suffer from them.”



            Democratic messaging in North Carolina has varied. Soon after Lyles' initial response, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein called on the legislature to pass his proposal to boost pay for law enforcement and correctional officers.
    


            “We need more cops on the beat to keep people safe,” he wrote on X. “That's why my budget calls for more funding to hire more well-trained police officers.”
    


            Republicans have argued the suspect, Decarlos Brown — who had a history of mental illness and convictions for breaking and entering, armed robbery and felony larceny — should not have been free to allegedly commit the crime in the first place. In January, Brown was charged with misuse of 911, a Class 1 misdemeanor, after he called for help to deal with what he described as a “man-made” substance controlling him. A judge released him on cashless bail after he provided a written promise he would return to court.
    


            “Democrat politicians, liberal judges and weak prosecutors would rather virtual signal than lock up criminals and protect their communities,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Tuesday press briefing as she railed against cashless bail.
    


            Republicans have criticized former Gov. Roy Cooper, the party's front-runner in next year's US Senate race, pointing to a task force for racial equity he created via executive order in June 2020, weeks after Floyd was murdered.
    


            The panel, which was co-chaired by Stein when he was the state's attorney general, was asked to recommend solutions to “end disparate outcomes in the criminal justice system, mitigate the effects of bias and discrimination, and increase accountability in law enforcement and criminal justice.”
    


            It recommended increased training and accountability from police, addiction and mental health treatment, and eliminating cash bail for low-level offenses unless there is a threat to public safety. Cooper signed legislation in 2023 implementing stricter bail laws for violent criminals.
    


            The task force didn't release its recommendations until after Brown completed a five-year sentence for robbery with a dangerous weapon in September 2020, and it didn't recommend releasing inmates early. In 2021, the North Carolina prison system reached a settlement with the NAACP to fast-track the release of at least 3,500 inmates due to overcrowding during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            “This was a heartbreaking, despicable act of evil and Iryna Zarutska's family and loved ones are in our prayers,” a spokesperson for the Cooper campaign said in a statement. “Roy Cooper knows North Carolinians need to be safe in their communities; he spent his career prosecuting violent criminals and drug dealers, increasing the penalties for violence against law enforcement, and keeping thousands of criminals off the streets and behind bars.”



            Democrats have long struggled to settle on a consistent message on public safety in a way that resonates with voters, a majority of whom trust Republicans more on the issue. The party has specifically struggled when Republicans tie them to specific instances of violence that capture national attention.
    


            During the 1988 presidential campaign, supporters of George H.W. Bush released the racially divisive Willie Horton attack ad against Democrat Michael Dukakis. Horton, a Black man and convicted murderer, raped a White woman while he was out on a Massachusetts prison furlough program while Dukakis was governor. Bush won in a landslide.
    


            Four years later, Bill Clinton won the presidency running on a tough-on-crime platform, then signed the 1994 crime bill into law. The legislation added funding for policing and banned assault weapons. It also implemented several policies — such as the “three strikes” provision — that Democrats later blamed for mass incarceration.
    


            In recent years, Democrats have struggled to find a political middle ground between the Clinton crime bill and the post-2020 “defund the police” movement.
    


            “The biggest challenge for Democrats is that the only narrative that the public has heard when it comes to crime and when terrible, tragic incidents happen — like the stabbing and murder in Charlotte — is a GOP narrative of ‘We need to crack down and get tough on crime,'” said Insha Rahman, the director of Vera Action, which works to limit mass incarceration.
    


            Rahman has called on Democrats to go on the offensive when discussing public safety by focusing on aspects such as reducing gun violence and providing medical treatment for addiction and mental illness.
    


            “It's not about being tough or soft on crime, but it's about being serious about safety,” she said. “Safety is the thing we all want. Crime is the thing we don't.”
    


            Bennett of Third Way, who worked on Clinton's presidential campaigns, said his party should argue that Trump and his use of federal forces in cities is actually interfering with attempts to reduce crime. He pointed to messaging about the intervention in Washington, DC, by Mayor Muriel Bowser, who noted Republicans cut $1 billion from the city's budget, including money for law enforcement.
    


            “All it requires is saying, ‘Let me be 100% clear, we have a crime problem in America, and we need to address it with serious law enforcement … and the problem with Trump is what he's doing is actually getting in the way of that,'” Bennett said.

            Having rebranded the Department of Defense as the Department of War, the president is going on offense with the US military.
    


            Donald Trump has foisted National Guard troops on Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. Other cities are on edge, particularly after he posted an apparently artificially generated image of himself dressed up like Robert Duvall's surfing cavalry commander in “Apocalypse Now,” a meme that seemed to suggest he was threatening war on the city of Chicago.
    


            Trump later clarified that the US would not go to war on Chicago, but he's clearly comfortable joking about it. And he's of the opinion his authority over the military is absolute.
    


            “Not that I don't have the right to do anything I want to do. I'm the president of the United States,” he said at a Cabinet meeting in August, when he was asked about the prospect of Chicagoans engaging in nonviolent resistance against the US military.
    


            He's reorienting the US military to focus on drug traffickers as terrorists and told Congress to expect more military strikes after the US destroyed a boat in the Caribbean last week.
    


            All of this projects the kind of strongman decisiveness Trump admires.
    


            A lot of it might also be illegal.
    


US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled this month that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth committed a “a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act” when they deployed federalized troops to Los Angeles over the objections of the state's governor and mayor.
    


            The Posse Comitatus Act was passed by Congress in 1878 as Southern states worked to oust federal troops and end Reconstruction. Questions over how and whether troops can be used to enforce laws goes back to the pre-Civil War period, when federal marshals sought help from citizens and militiamen in recovering fugitive slaves and putting down the protests of abolitionists, according to the Congressional Research Service.
    


            It is not clear why Trump has not yet, as he has promised, called up the National Guard to patrol in Chicago, but he may be waiting for the Supreme Court, which has been extremely deferential to his claims of authority, to weigh in on a preliminary basis.
    


            Trump has more authority to deploy the military inside Washington, DC, which the Constitution says Congress controls. But Congress has ceded some authority to locally elected officials in recent decades. DC's Attorney General Brian Schwalb has sued the Trump administration over the deployment.
    


            Trump's strike on a boat in the Caribbean is also on murky legal ground.
    


            After Vietnam, Congress overrode Richard Nixon's veto to pass another law, the War Powers Act of 1973, which requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of a military strike. And Trump did do that, at least his third such notification since taking office in January. Trump also sent notifications to Congress about his strike against an Iranian nuclear facility and Houthi rebels who were attacking shipping routes.
    


            The Reiss Center at New York University maintains a database of War Powers Act notifications going back to the 1970s.
    


            In the notification about the Caribbean strike, Trump's administration argued that it has declared drug cartels are terrorist organizations and that he operated within his constitutional authority to protect the country when he ordered the strike.
    


            Strikes against terrorists have been authorized under the catchall vote that authorized the use of military force against Islamic terrorists after the 9/11 terror attacks.
    


            But Congress, which the Constitution puts in charge of declaring war, has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuelan drug cartels.
    


            Over the weekend, CNN's Katie Bo Lillis, Natasha Bertrand and Zachary Cohen reported that the Pentagon abruptly canceled classified briefings to key House and Senate committees with oversight of the military, which means lawmaker have been unable to get the legal justification for the strike.
    


            Many Americans might celebrate the idea of a military strike to take out drug dealers, and the administration is clearly primed to lean on the idea that the cartels are terrorists.
    


            Here's a key quote from CNN's report:
    


            “The strike was the obvious result of designating them a terrorist organization,” said one person familiar with the Pentagon's thinking. “If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the US, would anyone even ask this question?”
    


            It's not yet clear which military unit was responsible for the strike, what intelligence suggested there were drugs onboard, who was on the boat or what the boat was carrying.
    


            “The attack on the smuggling vessel in the Caribbean was so extraordinary because there was no reported attempt to stop the boat or detain its crew,” wrote Brian Finucane, a former State Department legal advisor now at International Crisis Group for the website Just Security. “Instead, the use of lethal force was used in the first resort.”
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US could have interdicted the boat and made a legal case against those onboard, but it decided instead to blow up the boat. The notice to Congress makes clear the administration will continue with other strikes.
    


            “The decision to blow up the boat and kill everyone onboard when interdiction and detention was a clearly available option is manifestly illegal and immoral,” Oona Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges at Yale Law School, told me in an email.
    


            The view of the administration could be best summarized by Vice President JD Vance stating that using the military to go after cartels is “the highest and best use of our military.”
    


            When a user on X replied that the extrajudicial killing of civilians without presenting evidence is, by definition, a war crime, Vance, himself a Yale-educated lawyer, said this:
    


            “I don't give a sh*t what you call it.”
    


            That's not an acceptable response even for some Republicans.
    


            “Did he ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?” wrote Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky in his own post on X. “Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation?? What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial.”
    


            Congress has the power to stop Trump's campaign against boats in the Caribbean. The War Powers Act allows lawmakers in the House and Senate to demand the president seek approval before continuing a campaign longer than 60 days. But that seems unlikely to occur at the moment.
    


            After the strike against Iran earlier this year, Paul was the only Republican senator to side with Democrats and demand Trump seek approval for any future Iran strikes.
    


            During his first term, seven Republicans voted with Senate Democrats to hem in Trump's ability to strike against Iran after he ordered the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. But there were not enough votes to overcome Trump's veto that year.
    


            Trump's authority to use military force without congressional approval of the Caribbean operation technically expires after 60 days after he reports on the use of force, although he can extend it by an additional 30 days, although he could also declare a new operation is underway.
    


            The use of these kinds of tactics has likely been in the works for some time.
    


            In February, Trump designated drug cartels, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, as foreign terror organizations. In April, CNN reported the CIA was reviewing whether it had authority to use lethal force against drug cartels.
    


            But the military strike against the alleged cartel boat happened as part of a broader campaign against Venezuela, including positioning US ships, aircraft and a submarine in the Caribbean, according to a CNN report.
    


            Trump may have campaigned as a president who would end wars, but he's governing like a president who is very comfortable using his military.

            The national debate around crime and law-and-order politics has largely focused on America's biggest cities in blue states: Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, as well as the federal government's backyard of Washington, DC.
    


            But the unprovoked stabbing last month of a Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, has thrust the “Queen City” squarely into that conversation.
    


            The gruesome video of what police said was Decarlos Brown's random attack on Iryna Zarutska was released Friday and quickly sparked a wave of right-wing criticisms of Democratic-led cities and criminal justice reform policies.
    


            The suspect has a lengthy criminal history, including convictions for armed robbery, felony larceny and breaking and entering. He spent more than five years behind bars for robbery with a dangerous weapon, state records show. Family members told CNN Brown, who is homeless, has a history of mental health struggles.
    


            Most recently, after a misdemeanor charge of misusing 911, he was released on the condition of a written promise he would appear for his next hearing, according to court records.
    


            The White House said his release left him “free to slaughter an innocent woman just months later.”
    


            Brown has been charged on the state level with first-degree murder for allegedly stabbing Zarutska. He was also charged federally Tuesday with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. CNN has reached out to Brown's attorney for comment.
    


            “We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence — he will never again see the light of day as a free man,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
    


            The unprovoked attack is also being investigated by the FBI.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday he's investigating the possibility of cutting federal funding from the city's light rail system. The state auditor announced on Monday his office is also investigating the city's transit system.
    


            President Donald Trump posted about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting Republican candidate in next year's closely watched Senate race.
    


            “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.
    


            Right-wing politicians have long used horrific crime stories – particularly those featuring Black suspects and White victims – to make broader criticisms of Democrats as soft on crime. It's a playbook infamously honed in the “Willie Horton” campaign ad of the 1988 presidential race to attack presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
    


            US Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina Russ Ferguson said Tuesday the case was not about politics.
    


            “If this was a political grandstand, there would be an opposite side to this. Is the opposite side let's allow murders on our light rail? Is the opposite side let's let people out of state prison so they can commit other crimes?” Ferguson said. “There's no other side of this. There's no politics of this. This is a pure and simple federal case.”
    


            According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, in the first half of this year, “Charlotte experienced a 25% reduction in violent crime, which includes homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults, encompassing shootings” compared with the same time period last year. Overall crime has decreased 8%, the department said.
    


            And Charlotte does not cleanly fit the partisan attacks the White House has waged in Chicago, LA or New York.
    


            A Democratic-led city in a purple state dominated by a Republican legislature, Charlotte has only occasionally been a source of national political controversy, notably in its LGBTQ “bathroom bill” debate nearly a decade ago.
    


            Incumbent Mayor Vi Lyles will win the Democratic primary in the race for her fifth two-year term, CNN projects. She faces a Republican and Libertarian in November, but the city has had a Democratic mayor for the past 16 years.

            Much of the criticism has centered on the response from Lyles, whose initial statement did not significantly address the victim and instead focused on offering empathy to the suspect and addressing homelessness and mental illness.
    


            “We, as a community, must do better for those members of our community who need help and have no place to go,” she wrote.
    


            A follow-up statement notably thanked the media outlets who did not share video of the stabbing. Then her latest statement took a different tack and blamed courts and magistrates for allowing repeat offenders to remain on the streets.
    


            “We need a bipartisan solution to address repeat offenders who do not face consequences for their actions and those who cannot get treatment for their mental illness and are allowed to be on the street,” she wrote.
    


            Brown's mother told CNN affiliate WSOC the court should have never let her son be out in the community given his previous arrests and mental health issues. She said they did everything they knew to try to get him help, but “the system failed him.”
    


            On the ground in Charlotte, residents spoke to CNN about their safety concerns in light of the attack even as they questioned whether more security could have prevented it.
    


            Zarutska was stabbed in Charlotte's South End, a neighborhood transformed into an area of high-end apartments, restaurants, shops and breweries — fueled by the 2007 debut of the light rail system.
    


            Unlike extensive transit systems in New York or Chicago, the Charlotte Area Transit System, known as CATS, has a more limited area. It consists of a bus system, north-south blue line light rail and an east-west gold line street car, with proposed plans for further expansion.
    


            “As a native of Charlotte, I'm so sad to say that our city has gotten to this place,” Ferguson, the US Attorney, said Tuesday in announcing federal charges.
    


            “To think now that you can't even feel comfortable riding that train hits me deep. The light rail brought this city access to jobs, access to education. People could take the train to college. It really put Charlotte on the map. And this incident has really, really injured that,” he said.
    


            Channing Chasco said he doesn't really ride the light rail in Charlotte. But the new business owner, who lives near the East/West Boulevard stop not far from where the attack took place,  said he has never felt unsafe in his neighborhood. He said he believes the national reaction to the killing stems from a mix of political opportunity and real concern about safety.
    


            “I didn't realize it was making national coverage,” he said. “Obviously, this was way more brutal and it's something very different for this area, but I wasn't expecting this to get all over the news nationally.”
    


            Kathryn Dean, who lives in Charlotte's Lower South End, the area where Zarutska worked and boarded the train, says her boyfriend rides the light rail every single day. Since the attack, she and her boyfriend have grown “more aware” and “feel uneasy,” she said, adding she often sees homeless people hanging out at train stops but usually tries to avoid places they congregate.
    


            Dean takes early morning runs, and “as a small, 28-year-old blonde girl,” she said she is more aware of her surrounding since the stabbing. It's made her take notice of her habits in public, like wearing headphones.

            Amy, who only wanted her first name used, told CNN she rides the light rail to work every day.
    


            “I feel uncomfortable now, since it happened,” she said. “Before, the light rail was my choice, but now I think about just driving and parking since it happened.”

            “Maybe they should do some more safety, fare checks. It's hard because there are no gates. But maybe more checks would make you feel safer,” Amy said. She also acknowledged that after seeing video of the stabbing that she isn't sure what police could have done in the moment to stop it.
    


            Sheryl, who did not want to give her last name, told CNN she can't stop thinking about the killing. Now, though, the Chicago native believes the attack is being used for political posturing on the national level.
    


            “This is political. I don't have anything against Trump, but he's overstepping his power by doing things like sending the National Guard to cities. You see how he talks about Chicago? That's where I'm from. I think he's talking about this tragedy here for political reasons, too,” she said.

            Justice Brett Kavanaugh's breezy suggestion this week that Americans who are roughed up by ICE can sue agents in federal court is drawing pushback from civil rights attorneys who note the Supreme Court's conservative majority has in recent years made those cases nearly impossible to win.
    


            Writing to explain the court's emergency ruling Monday that allowed the Trump administration to continue “roving” immigration patrols in Southern California, Kavanaugh brushed aside concerns that masked ICE agents had pushed, shoved and detained Hispanics – in one instance throwing a US citizen against a fence and confiscating his phone.
    


            “To the extent that excessive force has been used,” Kavanaugh wrote in a 10-page concurrence, “the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action, and remedies should be available in federal court.”
    


            But in a series of recent decisions – including two that involved incidents at the border – the Supreme Court has severely limited the ability of people to sue federal law enforcement officers for excessive force claims. Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the court by Trump during his first term, was in the majority in those decisions.
    


Gorsuch and Kavanaugh warn lower court judges in Trump cases



            “It's bordering on impossible to get any sort of remedy in a federal court when a federal officer violates federal rights,” said Patrick Jaicomo, a senior attorney at the libertarian Institute for Justice who has regularly represented clients suing federal agents.
    


            Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said that it can be incredibly difficult for a person subjected to excessive force to find an attorney and take on the federal government in court.
    


            “What we've seen is, term after term, the court limiting the avenues that people have available to sue the federal government,” Bonds told CNN.
    


            To stop a person on the street for questioning, immigration officials must have a “reasonable suspicion” that the person is in the country illegally. The question for the Supreme Court was whether an agent could rely on factors like a person's apparent ethnicity, language or their presence at a particular location, to establish reasonable suspicion.
    


            A US district court in July ordered the Department of Homeland Security to discontinue the practice of making initial stops based on those factors. The Supreme Court on Monday, without an explanation from the majority, put that lower court order on hold – effectively greenlighting the administration's approach while the litigation continues in lower courts.
    


            In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor cited the stories raised by several of the people in Southern California who had been caught up in the crackdown.
    


            “The government, and now the concurrence, has all but declared that all Latinos, US citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents' satisfaction,” wrote Sotomayor, joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
    


            Jason Gavidia, a US citizen, was approached in June by masked agents who repeatedly questioned his citizenship status, pressing him to name the hospital in which he was born, according to court records. When he could not answer that question, he said, agents racked a rifle, took his phone and pushed him up against a metal fence.
    


            He was later released.
    


            Another US citizen, Jorge Viramontes, was grabbed and escorted by agents into a vehicle and held in a “warehouse area” for further questioning, according to court documents.
    


            Richard Re, a Harvard Law professor, viewed Kavanaugh's remark in the opinion differently. Maybe, Re wrote on Tuesday, Kavanaugh was attempting to signal something about where he thinks the law should go.
    


            “When you have an important sentence that's very ambiguous, it's usually deliberately so,” Re, who clerked for Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge, told CNN.
    


            “I think it's not clear what to make of that remark,” Re said. “It could suggest a genuine interest, on at least one pivotal justice's part, in revitalizing Fourth Amendment remediation.”
    


            The court has for years been limiting the ability of people who face excessive force to sue federal agents, litigation that proponents say can act as a check on such behavior.
    


            In 2020, the court's conservative majority blocked a damages lawsuit from the family of a 15-year-old Mexican boy who was shot and killed across the border by a Border Patrol agent.
    


            Three years ago, the court similarly rejected a suit from a US citizen who owned a bed and breakfast near the Canadian border and who said he was pushed to the ground as Border Patrol agents questioned a guest about their immigration status.
    


            Lawsuits against federal police are controlled by a 1971 precedent, Bivens v.Six Unknown Named Agents, that involved federal drug agents who searched the home of a man without a warrant. The Supreme Court allowed that lawsuit, but in recent years it has significantly clamped down on the ability of people to file suits in any other circumstance besides the warrant involved in the Bivens case. The right to sue federal agents, the court has maintained, should be set by Congress, not the courts.
    


Supreme Court to hear arguments over Trump's ‘Liberation Day' tariffs



            Americans may also sue the government for damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, if its employees engage in wrongdoing or negligence. But federal courts have carved out a complicated patchwork of exceptions to that law as well. Earlier this year, in a case involving an FBI raid on the wrong house, a unanimous Supreme Court allowed the family to sue, but also limited the scope of a provision of the law that was aimed at protecting people who are harmed by federal law enforcement.
    


            The tort law, Bonds said, is “incredibly narrow, incredibly complex and definitely not a sure thing.”
    


            Kavanaugh's opinion came as the court has faced sharp criticism in some quarters for deciding a slew of emergency cases in Trump's favor without any explanation.
    


            The Supreme Court has consistently sided with Trump recently, overturning lower courts' temporary orders and allowing the president to fire the leadership of independent agencies, cut spending authorized by Congress and pursue an aggressive crackdown on immigration while litigation continues in lower courts.
    


            Those emergency cases don't fully resolve the legal questions at hand – and the court is often hesitant to write opinions that could influence the final outcome of a case – but they can have enormous, real-world consequences.
    


            Emergency cases are almost always handled without oral argument and are addressed on a much tighter deadline than the court's regular merits cases.
    


            In that sense, Kavanaugh's opinion provided some clarity about how at least one member of the court's majority viewed the ICE patrols.
    


            He noted Sotomayor's dissent and pointed out that the issue of excessive force was not involved in the case.
    


            “The Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard continues to govern the officers' use of force and to prohibit excessive force,” Kavanaugh said.
    


            What he didn't explain, several experts note, is how a violation of those rights could be vindicated.
    


            “Sincerely wondering,” University of Chicago law professor William Baude posted on social media, “what remedies does Justice Kavanaugh believe are and should be available in federal court these days for excessive force violations by federal immigration officials?”

The Trump administration is reviewing material about slavery, the destruction of Native American culture, climate change and more at federal parks after employees flagged information that could be “disparaging” to Americans, according to screenshots shared with The Associated Press.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing the Interior Department — which manages parks, monuments and other designated land — to ensure public property doesn't contain elements that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.” Instead, it said to “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people” and “the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” 

The National Park Service had until July 18 to flag “inappropriate” signs, exhibits and other material, according to a document shared with the AP by the National Parks Conservation Association, which obtained internal information from an anonymous source within the Interior Department. The public was also encouraged to participate. 

“As we carry out this directive, we'll be evaluating all signage in the park along with the public feedback we've received,” said Elizabeth Peace, spokesperson for the Interior Department. “This effort reinforces our commitment to telling the full and accurate story of our nation's past.” The department said any signage inconsistent with the executive order will be removed or covered and reinstated once edits are made. The administration said it would remove all “inappropriate” material by Sept. 17, according to The New York Times, citing internal agency documents. 

The directive has raised concerns about sanitizing and erasing dark sides of American history.




“Pretending that the bad stuff never happened is not going to make it go away,” said Alan Spears, a senior director with the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonpartisan group separate from the national parks system that advocates for it. “We need to be able to talk about these things if we're going to have any hope of bringing people together.”

A look at some of the material that was flagged for review:

WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: A sign titled “The Air We Breathe” was flagged because it discusses the importance of clean air. Pollution from human-caused ozone, it explains, threatens people's health and vegetation, and power plants, cars and industries that burn fossil fuels are the pollutant's primary sources.

In North Carolina's Cape Hatteras National Seashore, there are signs about sea level rise due to climate change. “We do not believe it to be in violation, but would like someone to review if messaging of climate change and sea level rise reduces the focus on the grandeur, beauty and abundance,” one employee wrote. 

THE BACK STORY: Emissions from burning fossil fuels are heating the planet, causing ice sheets and glaciers to melt and seawater to expand. Rising seas threaten the people and ecosystems that live by the coast. 

THE REACTION: Carlos Martinez, climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks the agency should be educating the public about the threats national parks face. 

These public parks are places to learn about pollution, climate change and environmental degradation, he said, and eliminating this information “limits the ability for our population, especially for the younger generation, to understand these issues that allow them to then take action.” 

WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: At a gift shop in Charles Pinckney National Historic Site in South Carolina, marked for review were books for sale, including “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl” by Harriet Jacobs. Similar books were flagged elsewhere, including at the Washington Monument, where someone identified a book discussing George Washington as a slave owner. 

In Pennsylvania's Independence National Historical Park, flagged were descriptions of the whipping, kidnapping, rape and other brutality slaveholders inflicted on Black people. At another, an employee identified an exhibit about Black Americans escaping to freedom that names slave owners. 

THE BACK STORY: The legacy of slavery and racism has laid the foundation for the inequalities Black people face in the U.S., including greater rates of poverty, disease and illness, and incarceration at more than five times the rate of white people.

THE REACTION: “Slavery is not a side story. It's the engine of American economic growth for more than two centuries,” said Cedric Haynes, vice president of policy and legislative affairs with the NAACP. “And there are individuals who played a part in this.” 

It's important to name the people who perpetuated slavery's atrocities, he said, because that legacy is embedded in American laws, institutions and the nation's wealth.

WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: At Sitka National Historical Park in Alaska, an employee flagged a panel about missionaries who sought to destroy the language and culture of Alaska Natives and forcefully remove them from their lands. The “concerning text” says: “The history of this land includes a series of actions that attempted to remove the Sheet'ka Kwaan from their land, culture, and language which includes forced relocations under both Russian and American governance.” 

In Florida's Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, tagged was a panel discussing imprisonment of Plains Indians. “Text of panel needs review for language referring to tribes having choice of extinction or assimilation. Language of U.S. Government giving the ‘choice' of extinction could be considered negative towards the United States,” they wrote. 

THE BACK STORY: “The relationship between the United States and Indigenous nations has been fraught, violent, dispossessive and complex over the centuries, and the national parks are part of that story,” said Jessica R. Cattelino, American Indian studies professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “To cut off parts of those stories because they might make someone uncomfortable, that's a disservice to the ecological and cultural value of these lands.” 

Brenda Child, a Red Lake Ojibwe tribe member and American and American Indian studies professor at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, said it's only been about two decades since we started telling the accurate history of the United States and Native Americans. 

THE REACTION: It's sad to think about efforts to rewrite it now, she says, at a time when more accurate portrayals of Indigenous history in the U.S. finally exist. “But the way I always look at these things is: You can try to suppress it, but the cat's out of the bag. We know what happened. The books have been written.”

WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: Is Florida's Everglades National Park a slight to industrial development in America? Stories of the lands' urbanization, agriculture and more presented across the park “could be conceived as being disparaging to the development of Industrial America,” one employee wrote.

THE BACK STORY: The Everglades is a subtropical wilderness that protects 1.5 million acres of habitats and biodiversity and is a vital source of drinking water for millions. The Seminole and Miccosukee tribes have called these lands home for centuries. 

Decades of urban and farming development degraded the ecosystem, until, in 1947, the park was established to protect what remained. Underway is a massive state-federal project, approved by Congress in 2000 with bipartisan support, that aims to undo the damages. 

THE REACTION: People committed these harms “generations ago without knowing better. And we know better now, and we cannot lose sight of the lessons learned,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “If we don't keep in clear view that history and the mistakes that we made in our past, then we are doomed to repeat them.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump had dinner Tuesday night at a seafood restaurant near the White House, promoting his deployment of the National Guard and federalizing the police force in an effort to crack down on crime in the nation's capital. 

His motorcade made the short distance to Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab on 15th Street in the northwestern quadrant of the city following weeks of the president boasting about mobilizing federal authorities and the military that he says have made Washington “a safe zone.” 

Cheers were heard as the president stepped from his limo — though there was also a smattering of boos and chants from protesters opposing U.S. policy in support of Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza. 

“We're standing right in the middle of D.C., which as you know about, over the last year, was a very unsafe place — over the last 20 years — and now it's got virtually no crime,” Trump told reporters.

He added that he wouldn't have stood out “in the middle of the street” as recently as a couple of months ago. The suggestion was farcical, however, and didn't actually reflect whether crime levels had changed in Washington, since the president is always surrounded by heavy security wherever he goes. 

After entering the restaurant, a video posted on social media showed Trump shaking hands with some diners inside. But he also stared for an extended period at a small group of protesters who held up miniature Gaza flags and chanted: “Free D.C.! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!” 




The president moved closer to them and could be seen gesturing briefly, but didn't appear to speak. 

Some restaurants have reported drops in reservations since Trump first announced the federal crackdown on Aug. 7, while there have been frequent street protests decrying his actions. Increased military and police presence also has occasionally sparked standoffs between residents and authorities in normally quiet neighborhoods. 

Trump has nonetheless said repeatedly that he's spoken to friends who tell him local restaurants are full and that people have noticed a drop in crime. He says he's also heard that people appreciate crews working to remove homeless encampments as part of the crackdown. 

Accompanying the president for dinner were Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. In his comments before going into dinner, Trump said, “The restaurants are booming.” 

“People are going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years,” he said. 

After Trump returned to the White House after 10 p.m., press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who was also among those who dined with Trump, said he had eaten crab, shrimp, salad, steak and dessert.

The excursion was notable since Trump rarely dines away from the White House when he's in Washington. And such outings have gotten even less common since he sold the hotel bearing his name a few blocks away, which was a key meeting point for administration officials and supporters during his first term.

The White House reported Tuesday that there had been nearly 2,200 arrests since Trump first announced the Washington crackdown on Aug. 7. 

In addition to Washington, Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and has threatened to send troops to other, largely Democratic cities, including Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago — where state and local authorities already are bracing for operations to sharply increase immigration enforcement. 

He said Tuesday night, “We're going to be announcing another city that we're going to very shortly,” then said it could be as soon as Wednesday. He added that the mayor of that city and the governor of the state it is in “would love us to be there.” 

That follows Trump posting over the weekend a parody image from “Apocalypse Now” featuring a ball of flames as helicopters zoom over the lakefront and skyline of Chicago, the nation's third-largest city. 

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,'” Trump wrote on his social media site. “Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.”

In the post, Trump offered no details beyond the label “Chipocalypse Now,” a play on the title of Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Vietnam War film, in which a character says, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning.” 

Last week, Trump signed an executive order seeking to rename the Defense Department as the Department of War — even after months of campaigning to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize. The renaming requires congressional approval.

In his own post in response, Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called Trump a “wannabe dictator.” He has joined state and city officials — and many Chicago residents — in decrying the idea of a federal crackdown as unnecessary.

President Donald Trump discredited the Epstein letter that showed his alleged signature and slammed Israel's strike on Qatar during a trip to Joe's Seafood in Washington on Tuesday evening.

He said he was “not thrilled” about the strike and said the letter is “nonsense.” The Epstein estate recently released a letter from Trump to convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein on his birthday. The letter shows Trump telling Epstein that they had certain things “in common.”

“It's not my signature and not the way I speak. Anybody that's covered me for a long time knows that's not my language. It's nonsense. And frankly, you're wasting your time,” he told reporters.

The House Oversight Committee's release of the letter has stirred up more speculation about Trump's relationship with Epstein. The president was friends with the financier until they had a falling out.

“It's time for the president to tell us the truth about what he knew and release all the Epstein files,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA), the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said.

Then the president addressed Israel's strike on Qatar on Tuesday. The nation wanted to kill the top Hamas leadership meeting in Doha, but Trump did not approve of the strike. The attack reportedly infuriated Trump advisers who wanted to negotiate peace in Gaza.

Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express concern about the attack and talk about the need for peace in the region. He also called the Qatari emir and prime minister to say such an attack would not occur in the future.

Trump said Tuesday evening that Israel did not tell him in advance but that he's not “surprised by anything.”

“I'm never surprised by anything, especially when it comes to the Middle East,” he added.

At the dinner, Trump was greeted with protesters who loudly chanted inside the restaurant.

They yelled phrases such as “Free Palestine” and “Free D.C.,” also calling Trump the “Hitler of our time.”

Vice President JD Vance stopped to greet one patron and smiled. “Enjoy your dinner,” he said. Trump appeared to acknowledge the protesters, but it wasn't clear if he said anything to them.

A federal grand jury in Washington declined to indict a lawyer accused of threatening National Guard troops patrolling the city as part of President Donald Trump's federal crime surge, adding to a growing list of felony rejections facing U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office.

Paul Anthony Bryant, a West Point and Columbia Law School graduate, was arrested on Aug. 24 after allegedly shouting “I'll kill you” and slamming his shoulder into a Guardsman. Prosecutors charged him with threatening a federal official and making threats to injure — felonies carrying maximum penalties of 10 and 20 years. His attorney called the case “baseless” and said there is no video evidence due to National Guard troops not wearing body cameras.

Pirro's office told a magistrate judge Tuesday that grand jurors had returned a no true bill for Bryant, two people familiar with the matter told a local CBS affiliate, WUSA9. The government subsequently dropped its appeal of the magistrate judge's decision to release Bryant pending his trial, according to a notice on the docket Tuesday evening.

The grand jury's no true bill is at least the eighth felony case rejected since Trump's federal takeover of Washington law enforcement, prompting concerns of jury nullification. Pirro has warned of a “politicized jury,” noting jurors previously declined to indict those who threatened to assassinate the president and assaulted federal agents.

Prosecutors could now ask a magistrate judge at Bryant's Wednesday hearing to find probable cause and re-present the case to another grand jury. Alternatively, they may file misdemeanor charges, which do not require grand jury approval.

Bryant, who carried a legally owned firearm at the time of his arrest, was not charged with any gun-related offenses. He remains out on bond but turned himself in on Tuesday concerning a warrant out of Maryland.

Neither Pirro's office nor Bryant's legal team responded to requests for comment.

Poland deployed aircraft to shoot down Russian drones that were “repeatedly” violating its airspace early Wednesday, testing the NATO alliance's resolve as Russia wars with Ukraine.

“During today's attack by the Russian Federation carrying out strikes on targets located in the territory of Ukraine, our airspace was repeatedly violated by drone-type objects,” the Polish operational command said. 

“An operation is underway aimed at identifying and neutralizing the objects. On the orders of the Operational Commander of the Polish Armed Forces, weapons have been deployed, and services are actively working to locate the downed objects,” it added.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that the military “used armaments” to destroy the drones, writing that “an operation is underway related to multiple violations” of the country's airspace, with the country's defense minister, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, writing that “aircraft have used weapons against hostile objects” and adding that Poland was in “constant contact” with NATO command.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CNN he had been briefed on the incursion.

Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) said Russia was targeting Poland to test NATO, writing on X, “Russia is attacking NATO ally Poland with Iranian shahed drones less than a week after President Trump hosted President Nawrocki at the White House.”

“This is an act of war, and we are grateful to NATO allies for their swift response to war criminal Putin's continued unprovoked aggression against free and productive nations. I urge President Trump to respond with mandatory sanctions that will bankrupt the Russian war machine and arm Ukraine with weapons capable of striking Russia. Putin is no longer content just losing in Ukraine while bombing mothers and babies, he is now directly testing our resolve in NATO territory. Putin stated that ‘Russia knows no borders.' Free and prosperous nations will teach Russia about borders,” he concluded.

POLAND ACCUSES RUSSIA OF ‘PROVOCATION' AFTER DRONE CRASH ON BORDER

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) reflected a similar sentiment earlier in the evening.

“Repeated violations of NATO airspace by Russian drones are fair warning that Vladimir Putin is testing our resolve to protect Poland and the Baltic nations. After the carnage Putin continues to visit on Ukraine, these incursions cannot be ignored,” he said.

Oracle's stock is surging, and so is CEO Safra Catz's net worth.

The 63-year-old tech executive saw her personal wealth increase by roughly $412 million in the New York Stock Exchange's first six hours of trading on Wednesday, according to a Forbes estimate. The jump is tied to the software giant's stock price, which has soared by roughly 40% after the company's Tuesday afternoon report showed a massive $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized.

Catz's estimated net worth is now $3.4 billion, as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Forbes — up from $3 billion at the start of the day. Oracle's stock performance has benefited co-founder Larry Ellison's net worth even more: He's now estimated to be the second-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $386.3 billion, up from $293 billion on Wednesday morning.

"Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz said on Oracle's Tuesday earnings call. Oracle's growth projections come from a fast-growing cloud infrastructure business, and deals signed with several large artificial intelligence companies, she said: "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD, and many others."

She became a co-CEO at Oracle in 2014 when Ellison stepped down from the role, and has been the company's sole CEO since the death of her co-lead, Mark Hurd, in 2019. Under Catz's leadership, Oracle's stock is reaching record levels and a type of surge it hasn't seen since the 1999 tech boom, CNBC reported.

Catz was born in Israel, and her family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts, when she was 6 years old, according to Time. She graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983, where she later earned a law degree.

She spent more than a decade working on Wall Street as an investment banker, and joined Oracle as a senior vice president in 1999. She quickly climbed the ladder, joining the company's board of directors in 2000 and becoming its president in 2004.

Before her CEO appointment, Catz led an aggressive mergers and acquisitions team that acquired dozens of companies during her tenure and helped propel Oracle's growth. She's credited with steering acquisitions of fierce software rivals like PeopleSoft (acquired for $10.3 billion in 2004) and Sun Microsystems ($7.4 billion in 2009), navigating major antitrust hurdles to complete both deals.

During her tenure as Oracle's CEO, dating back to 2014, the company's stock price has increased by more than 800%. Catz ranked as one of the highest-paid U.S. CEOs as recently as 2022, when she earned $138 million in total compensation, the bulk of it in the form of stock options. In 2024, she earned nearly $6.5 million in total compensation, according to government filings by Oracle.

Outside of Oracle, Catz has been active in national politics over the past decade, joining U.S. President Donald Trump's transition team in 2016 ahead of his first term in office. She currently serves on the Homeland Security Advisory Council alongside fellow CEOs like General Motors' Mary Barra, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan and Chobani's Hamdi Ulukaya, along with Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen.

In June, Catz was the 40th-richest self-made woman in the world, according to a Forbes ranking.

Some Wall Street analysts, including at Bank of America, predict that Oracle's stock price could continue climbing based on the company's revenue growth projections. On Tuesday's earnings call, analyst Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank said he and other Wall Street analysts were "in shock, in a very good way," from viewing Oracle's report. John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities said he was "blown away."

Catz touted Oracle's "astonishing quarter" while promising more multibillion-dollar cloud pacts in the coming months, in a statement on Tuesday.

Conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking to a large crowd at Utah Valley University in Orem, President Donald Trump said.

Kirk, 31, was shot at least once in the neck just after noon local time, about 20 minutes into his event, according to statements from UVU.

A university spokeswoman said that Kirk was shot by a rifle from the Losee Center, about 200 yards away from where he had been speaking.

A suspect was not in custody, according to UVU's spokeswoman. Students earlier had described an older man being taken into custody.

UVU closed its campus and cancelled classes, telling people still on campus to "secure in place until police officers can escort you safely off campus."

"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie," Trump wrote.

"He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!"

Kirk, who was married with two children, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he had been in surgery before Trump announced his death.

Kirk was the co-founder of Turning Point USA and head of multiple related political organizations. HIs movement aimed at young conservatives has raised hundreds of millions of dollars.

A staunch Trump supporter, Kirk also was a person friend to a number of top officials in Trump's administration.

He was at Utah Valley University on Wednesday for the first stop on Turning Point's "American Comeback Tour," according to the group's website.

The event featured Kirk seated at his "prove me wrong table," a format in which he debates with people who challenge his views.

UVU is Utah's largest public university, with nearly 47,000 enrolled students as of fall 2023.

Jason Chaffetz, a former Republican congressman from Utah, in an interview with Fox News said he was at the event, and that Kirk had been asked a question about "transgender shootings, mass shootings."

"As soon as this shot rang out, everybody hit the deck, and then everybody started scattering and yelling and screaming, as you might imagine," Chaffetz said. "I can't say I saw blood. I can't say I saw him get shot, but as soon as that shot went out, he fell back into his left and everybody hit the deck."

Kirk's wife, Erika Kirk, tweeted a biblical verse after the shooting.

"Psalm 46:1 - God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble," Erika Kirk wrote.

Trump, in a Truth Social post, said, "We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot,"

"A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!" wrote Trump.

FBI Director Kash Patel said, "Our thoughts are with Charlie, his loved ones, and everyone affected."

FBI agents and Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms agents were at the shooting scene, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

Shortly before the news of the shooting broke, Kirk's official X account tweeted about the event.

"WE. ARE. SO. BACK," Kirk wrote. "Utah Valley University is FIRED UP and READY for the first stop back on the American Comeback Tour."

Kirk was scheduled to return to Utah on Sept. 30 for a similar event at Utah State University.

An online petition seeking to bar Kirk from speaking at that school garnered nearly 6,900 signatures.

"Say a prayer for Charlie Kirk, a genuinely good guy and young father," Vice President JD Vance said in a tweet.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that he is "praying for my friend Charlie Kirk during this difficult time."

Blanche said the Department of Justice "is actively investigating this senseless act of violence."

California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X, "The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, vile, and reprehensible."

"In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form," Newsom wrote.

The Goldman Sachs tech conference is happening in San Francisco this week. The headliner was OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, who shared a ton of fascinating data on the AI startup's booming business.

I attended the talk and compiled the highlights of her disclosures. The room was packed for her talk on Tuesday. Even the overflow room was full, with many analysts and investors sitting on the floor to watch. I've never seen so many loafers and crossed legs at the same time.

OpenAI is raising billions of dollars at a $500 billion valuation. Employees are also selling billions of dollars of stock. Investor interest in this company's performance is intense. Here's a taste of what Friar told Wall Street.

Klarna shares popped 30% in their New York Stock Exchange debut Wednesday, opening at $52, after the Swedish online lender priced its IPO above its expected range.

The company, known for its popular buy now, pay later products, priced shares at $40 on Tuesday, raising $1.37 billion for the company and existing shareholders. The offering valued Klarna at about $15 billion.

The IPO marks the latest in a growing list of high-profile tech IPOs this year, suggesting increased demand from Wall Street for new offerings. Companies like stablecoin issuer Circle and design software platform Figma soared in their respective debuts. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Gemini is expected to go public later this week.

"To me, it really just is a milestone," Klarna's co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday. "It's a little bit like a wedding. You prepare so much and you plan for it and it's a big party. But in the end — marriage goes on."

Klarna's entry into the public markets will test Wall Street's excitement about the direction of its business. The company has in recent months talked up its move into banking, rolling out a debit card and personal deposit accounts in the U.S.

Klarna has signed 700,000 card customers in the U.S. so far and has 5 million people on a waiting list seeking access to the product, Siemiatkowski told CNBC. He added that Klarna Card represents a different proposition to rival fintech Affirm's card offering, which has attracted 2 million users since its launch in 2021.

"We're attracting a slightly different audience maybe than the Affirm card," Siemiatkowski said. "I get the impression that is more a card where people use it simply to be able to have financing with interest on slightly higher tickets."

In addition to Affirm, Klarna also competes with Afterpay, which was acquired for $29 billion in 2021 by Square, now a unit of Block.

Klarna faces some potential regulatory headwinds. In the U.K., the government has proposed new rules to bring BNPL loans under formal oversight to address affordability concerns regarding the market.

The IPO is poised to generate billions of dollars in returns for some of Klarna's long-time investors. Existing shareholders are offering the bulk of Klarna shares— 28.8 million — on the public market. At its IPO price of $40, that translates to over $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, Klarna raised $222 million from the IPO.

Sequoia, which first backed in Klarna in 2010, has invested $500 million in total. The venture firm sold 2 million of its 79 million shares in the IPO, meaning it's generated an overall return of about $2.65 billion, based on the offer price.

Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia, told CNBC that he was still in college when Sequoia made its first investment in an "alternative payments company in Stockholm." The early work, he said, was around expanding in Europe.

"Being here in New York 15 years later with over 100 million consumers and over $100 billion of GMV [gross merchandise value] and close to a million merchants, it is staggering what one year after another of execution and growth and Sebastian's long-term vision can do," Reed said.

Another Klarna investor hasn't been so lucky. Japan's SoftBank led a 2021 funding round in Klarna at a $46 billion valuation and has since seen the value of its stake plunge significantly.

Hundreds of people who were among those detained by U.S. immigration authorities while working on building an electric vehicle battery plant for Hyundai and LG Energy Solution in Georgia are expected to fly home to South Korea on a chartered plane out of Atlanta as early as Wednesday.

A Korean Air Boeing 747-8I that departed from Seoul landed in Atlanta on Wednesday to collect those workers.

U.S. officials have not said if or when any of the workers will be released from detention and allowed to return to South Korea.

South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C. Cho arrived in the United States earlier this week, intent on helping his fellow citizens return to Korea. 

A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told reporters Tuesday that the plan was to fly about 300 LG employees home on Wednesday, and that a detailed plan would be announced when preparations were finished.

As of Wednesday at midday, however, there had not yet been any announcements about flight plans.

Nonetheless, the landing of a charter plane at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport appeared to signal that the return process was underway.

"Our nationals who had been detained by U.S. immigration authorities will soon be returning home," South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said Tuesday during a cabinet meeting.

Lee held a friendly meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Aug. 25. But he has since blasted the controversial detention of hundreds of Korean engineers and energy specialists in the massive raid on Sept. 4.

"I hope that there will never again be an unjust infringement upon the activities of our people and companies in pursuit of the shared development of South Korea and the United States," said Lee.

"Our government will move quickly, through close consultations with the United States, to advance reasonable institutional improvements so that similar cases do not occur again," Lee said.

American officials said last Friday that 475 people were detained after a raid Thursday at the huge site near Savannah. More than the 300 South Korean nationals were among those rounded up for allegedly lacking necessary documentation to work in the United States.

The vast majority of the detained people reportedly worked as subcontractors.

The raid came on the heels of South Korea pledging to invest a whopping $500 billion in strategic U.S. industries. That pledge included a $26 billion commitment by Hyundai.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday appealed a federal judge's order blocking him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit challenging his removal of her continues.

The appeal came a day after U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb, in her decision, said, "The public interest in Federal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cook's reinstatement."

Cobb also said that Cook has "made a strong showing" that Trump's purported removal of her violated the Federal Reserve Act's requirement that board governors be removed only for legal "cause."

Trump announced on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook, who is the first black woman to serve as a Fed governor.

The president claimed he was doing so because of allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that she committed mortgage fraud.

Cook denies any wrongdoing. Her attorneys have argued that Trump is using Pulte's claims as a pretext, and that her would-be removal is part of a pressure campaign by the president on the Fed to cut interest rates.

Trump has appointed two of the Fed's seven governors, who participate in decisions setting interest rates.

House before his appeal was filed on Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee in a part-line vote recommended that the full Senate approve Trump's nominee Stephen Miran for a Fed governor's seat left vacant by the surprise resignation of Adriana Kugler last month.

If Cook is ultimately removed from the Fed, Trump would be on track to nominate a majority of the central bank's board.

The U.S. Department of Education may soon begin sharing information with students and families on "the benefits and risks" of federal student loans, the Trump administration recently announced.

The department's Office of the Ombudsman will take "a proactive approach to improve financial literacy," according to a Sept. 5 press release, so that students "are better equipped to make careful borrowing decisions."

The agency said its effort comes as outstanding federal student debt nears $1.7 trillion, and "loan defaults and delinquencies remain at record highs."

Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors, said that "addressing financial literacy and college costs in the process of financial aid is never a bad thing."

Historically, the Ombudsman's office dealt primarily with complaints from student loan borrowers. However, it's unclear what the fate of that work will be after the Education Department's sweeping layoffs in March.

Experts say the staff cuts also raise questions about how the Trump administration will be able to launch this new borrowing education effort.

"The real question is whether there's anybody left in the Ombudsman's office to do any of this," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

The Trump administration said more financial guidance is needed for borrowers amid the student loan portfolio's "sobering statistics."

More than 42 million Americans carry federal student loan debt. As of June, over 6 million borrowers were delinquent, and more than 5 million were in default, the Education Department said.

"By providing clearer guidance and support at the front end of the college journey, we believe students will make more informed decisions that lead to lower debt burdens, stronger repayment outcomes, and greater satisfaction with their educational investment," said Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, in a statement.

Consumer advocates said the Education Department's efforts could pull resources needed to address more pressing problems, including fixes for millions of borrowers who are unable to access affordable repayment options.

"By shifting focus to borrower education, it diverts attention from the urgent need to resolve consumer complaints and systemic servicing failures," said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

As of the end of July, the Education Department had a backlog of more than 1.3 million applications from borrowers trying to get into an income-driven repayment, or IDR, plan, recent court documents show.

The pileup of applications is due, in part, to the end of President Joe Biden's SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education, plan. That program was meant to significantly lower millions of borrowers' bills but was met with Republican-led legal challenges and eventually repealed this summer in President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill."

Many student loan borrowers now can't afford the repayment plan options available to them, consumer advocates said. The monthly payments on SAVE were much lower than those offered under other plans, and recent legislation further narrows borrowers repayment choices.

"There is no amount of financial literacy that will solve the more than 1.3 million IDR application backlog or give answers to borrowers who have to wait on hold for several hours to find out the status of their loans," said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.

In this article

Larry Ellison became more than $110 billion richer on Wednesday, a day after Oracle, the software company he helped to start in 1977, issued dramatic cloud growth projections for the next five fiscal years.

Those projections sent Oracle's stock price flying, up more than 40% on Wednesday, lifting Ellison's net worth to about $391 billion. The total puts Ellison closer to dethroning Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual. Forbes says Musk, 54, CEO of automaker Tesla, is worth just over $436 billion.

Ellison, 81, remains active in Oracle as chief technology officer and chairman. Rather than gradually sell off his position in the database software maker, he has maintained it, holding more than 1.1 million shares for over 25 years. His disciple Marc Benioff, who runs sales management software company Salesforce, has done the opposite, and now Benioff, 60, is worth about $10 billion. Musk's share of Tesla has gone up thanks to generous pay packages, and the value of his SpaceX holding has multiplied in the past decade.

In 2022, Ellison stepped down from the Tesla board after almost four years, but he's been keeping busy ever since.

He has sharpened his focus on the health-care industry with Oracle's $28 billion acquisition of Cerner in 2022, he ramped up his philanthropy with the launch of the Ellison Institute of Technology at the University of Oxford in December and he helped complete the $8 billion Paramount Global-Skydance merger last month. Ellison has also become an arms dealer for artificial intelligence infrastructure, most significantly allying Oracle with ChatGPT provider OpenAI.

On Tuesday, Oracle said that its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, now stood at $455 billion, up 359% from last year. Oracle also said its cloud infrastructure revenue stands to jump from $10 billion in the most recent fiscal year to $144 billion in fiscal 2030.

"Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Ellison said at the beginning of Oracle's earnings call on Tuesday, during which analysts competed to toss the highest compliments at him and CEO Safra Catz. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD and many others."

Meanwhile, Oracle has continued to grow in the sales of standard software.

"And by the way, we're much bigger than Workday or ServiceNow. And we're solving a larger portion of the problem," Ellison told the analysts. ServiceNow and Workday were worth a combined $256 billion on Wednesday morning. Oracle's market capitalization exceeded $950 billion. Only nine companies on the S&P 500 index are worth more.

Ellison has long been a supporter of President Donald Trump, donating to his campaigns and helping him raise outside money. The relationship offers a potential business benefit to the Oracle co-founder.

Trump has been delaying the sale of TikTok's U.S. business, and said in January that he'd be open to ByteDance selling that business to Musk, who previously worked for the administration, or to Ellison.

A leadership shakeup is brewing within xAI's data annotation team.

At least nine high-level employees appear to no longer be with the team. Their Slack accounts were deactivated over the weekend, according to screenshots seen by Business Insider.

The employees worked on the human data management team, which oversees the AI tutors who train Grok. Previously, the managerial ranks included around a dozen people, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles and workers with knowledge of the team. Several of the managers had posted Slack messages as recently as September 5.

One of the deactivated accounts was a member of the technical staff who oversaw the team's managers, according to a screenshot seen by Business Insider. The employee had previously worked on Tesla's Autopilot data annotation team.

A representative for xAI did not respond to a request for comment.

The data annotation team consists of more than 1,500 contract and full-time staff, a large portion of whom are AI tutors, according to a tally of the company's internal Slack.

The company has also been scheduling one-on-one meetings with some employees, four workers said. In the meetings, workers have been asked to present their work and how they've added value to the company, the people said.

One worker told Business Insider that the meetings have created a "sense of panic."

Unlike most AI companies, which often use third-party employment agencies, xAI hires many of its US tutors directly. This can provide the company with more control and privacy; it can also be more expensive.

XAI briefly outsourced some of its work to Scale AI, but ended the partnership earlier this year, Business Insider previously reported. XAI is also working with Mercor, a recruiting and data annotation services company. Mercor confirmed the arrangement but declined to comment.

The AI tutors play a crucial role in developing the company's chatbot. They label, categorize, and contextualize raw data to teach Grok how to better understand the world. Though the team works in tandem with engineers, it uses a separate Slack, called TeachX, and has different email domains. Within TeachX, AI tutors are broken into specialized groups, including science, coding, and translation.

Earlier this year, the company planned to hire thousands of AI tutors, Business Insider previously reported. Since February, xAI has added around 700 workers to the data annotation team, according to a tally in the company's Slack.

Musk's AI company has nine roles listed for the data annotation team, including six AI tutor roles, with pay ranges between $35 and $80 per hour.

The Labor Department's internal watchdog said Wednesday it has opened an investigation into how jobs and inflation data is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The probe by the department's Office of Inspector General comes as BLS is under pressure from the Trump administration, which has pointed to recent downward revisions to employment data to argue that the agency's data cannot be trusted.

President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August, accusing her of being motivated by politics hours after her agency released a weak monthly jobs report.

The inspector general is a nonpolitical appointee whose office is independently staffed and legally insulated from interference by the Labor secretary or other political appouintees. The office is currently being led by acting deputy Inspector General Michael Mikulka, according the Labor Department's website.

In a letter sent Wednesday morning, the watchdog said it "is initiating a review of the challenges" that BLS "encounters collecting and reporting closely watched economic data."

Read the full letter here.

The OIG said it was initiating that probe after BLS announced a reduction in its data collection for two key inflation metrics, the consumer price index and the producer price index.

The review also comes in light of BLS recently issuing a "large downward revision of its estimate of new jobs in the monthly Employment Situation Report," assistant inspector general for audit Laura Nicolosi wrote.

The Labor Department in a preliminary report Tuesday revised jobs data sharply downward for the year ending March 2025, posting a drop of 911,000 from initial estimates. The revisions were the largest on record in more than two decades.

Nicolosi wrote Wednesday that the OIG's "focus will be on the challenges and related mitigating strategies for (1) collecting PPI and CPI data, and (2) collecting and reporting, including revising, monthly employment data."

The letter was addressed to William Wiatrowski, who has served as BLS' acting commissioner since Trump fired McEntarfer on Aug. 1, hours after BLS issued a weaker-than-expected monthly jobs report for July.

The move stunned some experts, who warned that it undermined confidence in the integrity of the financial statistics that are heavily relied upon by investors and policymakers alike.

But Trump and his supporters defended McEntarfer's removal, arguing that BLS' data had become increasingly unreliable and claiming its actions were politicized.

They have pointed to previous large revisions by the agency, though Trump has mischaracterized those figures and when they were released.

Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said Tuesday that the BLS' latest downward revision "gives the American people even more reason to doubt the integrity of data being published."

"It's imperative for the data to remain accurate, impartial, and never altered for political gain," DeRemer said.

Sandwich shop chain Potbelly will be acquired by convenience-store operator RaceTrac in a $566 million all-cash deal, the company announced Wednesday.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of the year. Shares of Potbelly shot up more than 30% following the announcement.

The Chicago-based Potbelly has more than 445 stores in the U.S., including franchised locations, with a goal of reaching 2,000, according to the company. RaceTrac, a family-owned company headquartered in Atlanta, operates more than 800 convenience stores across 14 states.

"RaceTrac's strategic vision including their commitment to quality align perfectly with our mission to delight customers with great food and good vibes," Potbelly CEO Bob Wright said in a statement. "We have positioned Potbelly for accelerated franchise-led growth in recent years, and this transaction fortifies our path while delivering certain and immediate value to our shareholders."

The deal will value Potbelly shares at $17.12 each, marking a roughly 47% premium to Potbelly's price as of Tuesday. The company's stock is up more than 75% this year.

Wednesday's deal is RaceTrac's second significant acquisition, after its 2023 deal to acquire Gulf Oil.

In 2003, Ghislaine Maxwell gifted Jeffrey Epstein a scrapbook for his 50th birthday.

In between memorabilia from childhood friends, heartfelt letters from family, and photos of nude women, some of the world's wealthiest men and most prominent business leaders wished Epstein a happy birthday.

Leon Black wrote a poem and signed it "love and kisses." Les Wexner doodled a woman's chest. Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft executive and associate of Bill Gates, sent several photos of animals having sex and with erect penises.

A copy of the book, which spans over 200 pages, was released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday after it was obtained from Epstein's estate.

The book includes apparent messages from now-President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as from childhood friends and family members.

Wide swaths of it are redacted under sections titled "Girlfriends," "Children," and "Girl-friends."

Inclusion in the book is not an indication of wrongdoing. Palm Beach police didn't start investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of girls until several years after Epstein received the book, in a case that culminated in a 2008 guilty plea on prostitution charges.

Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for far more serious rape and sex-trafficking allegations. A jury later found Maxwell guilty of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex, and she's serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the book in July, writing that it included a "bawdy" letter from Trump with a cryptic message that said "Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," bracketed with an outline of a naked woman and the now-president's signature in the place of pubic hair.

Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against The Journal over the publication of its story and called the letter "fake." The Journal has stood by its reporting. On Monday, a White House spokesperson said Trump didn't write the letter.

Here's a look at what eight business leaders wrote in Epstein's birthday card, according to the copy of the book published by the House Oversight Committee.

The former Apollo Global Management CEO — and one of Epstein's only known financial clients — wrote a handwritten poem in Epstein's honor in the "friends" section.

"A Liver, a Lover, a Jeff, a Jeffrey," reads one sample verse. "Let's all give a cheer, for today he's Fifty!"

Another rhyme reads "Blonde, Red or Brunette, spread out geographically" followed by "With this net of fish, Jeff's now 'The Old Man and The Sea,'" with "Old Man" underlined.

A spokesperson for Black declined to comment to Business Insider.

Black has previously said he regrets his association with Epstein and wasn't aware of any sexual misconduct.

An Apollo-commissioned investigation found that Black paid Epstein over $150 million between 2012 and 2017 for financial advice, including for tax maneuvers that saved him around $600 million. An investigation from US Sen. Ron Wyden put Black's payments to Epstein at closer to $170 million.

Black's 2003 letter appears to reference Epstein's forte with taxes: "Green eyeshades, schemes and plans, a unique tax strategy," it reads.

According to the copy of the book published by the House Oversight Committee, Trump's birthday note appears to be an imaginary dialogue between him and Epstein about "having everything." The words are bracketed by the outline of a nude woman, with ink strokes representing breasts. It appears in the "friends" section.

"Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?" Trump muses in the exchange.

"As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you," Epstein replies.

"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," Trump says.

Trump's lawyers described the letter as "nonexistent" in a defamation lawsuit against the Journal after it published its story in July. The Journal has stood by its reporting.

On Monday, a representative for Trump's personal legal team directed Business Insider to a statement from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who described reporting about the letter as a "hatchet job."

"As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it," Leavitt wrote.

Trump's lawsuit against The Journal is ongoing.

Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, wrote a brief note to Epstein in honor of his 50th birthday, the card shows.

"I wanted to get you what you want… so here it is…" Wexner wrote.

Underneath that text is an illustration of what appears to be a woman's breasts, followed by Wexner's signature. His note was published in the "friends" part of the book.

A spokesperson for Wexner declined to comment to Business Insider for this story.

Wexner was one of Epstein's biggest and earliest financial clients, paying him tens of millions of dollars between the 1980s and the 2000s to manage the billionaire's personal financial life.

Wexner said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007, amid a Florida law enforcement investigation into his sexual abuse of girls. In the process, Wexner said, he learned that Epstein "had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family."

William Elkus, the founder of the venture capital firm Clearstone, was connected to Epstein through the latter's J. Epstein Foundation. Elkus was a trustee at the organization's founding in 1991.

In his note to Epstein, Elkus recounted a time in 1988 when Epstein visited him in Fairfield, Iowa, where he said he was managing the money of a wealthy local family. The note appeared in the "friends" section.

"It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women," Elkus wrote. "But not many people know that he can create them out of thin air."

In that corner of Iowa, he added, "there's more than a little truth to the saying that it's hard to tell the difference between the girls and the hogs."

In an email on Tuesday, Elkus told Business Insider the event he recalled in the birthday letter was "long before any articles ever came out about Epstein, good or bad" and that the reference to girls and hogs jokingly cited an "old folk saying."

Elkus recounted in his letter that, while visiting a local bookstore, "a spectacular tall blonde woman" approached Epstein, who then "did his magic, and she ended up going home with him to New York for the weekend."

"I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow arranged the whole episode through some long-distance escort service" before being proven wrong after meeting the woman in Manhattan a week later, Elkus wrote.

Elkus wrote in his email to Business Insider that the story referenced in the letter was not meant to be viewed nefariously.

"I did not say that Epstein did anything inappropriate (and he didn't do anything inappropriate that I could see then or at any time before or after this incident)," Elkus wrote. "This was a mature woman who was a sales rep, not a young student. I was highlighting his charisma."

One of the many lewd entries was from Nathan Myhrvold, who was listed as a friend of Epstein.

At the time, Myhrvold had retired from his role as Microsoft's chief technology officer and was working as the CEO of Intellectual Ventures, a firm that incubates and markets inventions. He would go on to found the global health organizations Global Good and the Institute for Disease Modeling with Bill Gates.

In an introductory letter published in the "friends" part of the book, Myhrvold wrote that he "agonized long and hard about what to write." He wrote that he decided to eschew the "philosophical" or "silly and salacious." Instead, he included a series of photos that he said he took on a trip to Africa.

"They seemed more appropriate than anything I could put in words," he wrote.

The wildlife photos depict animals in various suggestive ways, including a pair of lions mating, a zebra with a large penis, and a monkey with an erection.

A spokesperson for Myhrvold told Business Insider that he regretted meeting Epstein.

"Mr. Myhrvold knew him from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific research," the spokesperson said. "He regrets that he ever met him."

A spokesman previously told The Wall Street Journal that Mhyrvold didn't recall the submission and "regularly shares photos of and writes about animal behavior."

The former CEO of Bear Stearns, Alan "Ace" Greenberg, who died in 2014, was one of the bank's leaders during Epstein's stint in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

"Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure, and watching his meteoric success has given me many vicarious thrills," Greenberg wrote in his note, which was included in the book's considerably less scandalous "business" section.

Kathryn Olson Greenberg, Greenberg's widow, told Business Insider that Epstein and Greenberg did not have a relationship beyond Epstein's time at Bear Stearns. She said that her husband "would never say no" if he were asked to write a birthday message.

Another former Bear Stearns CEO, James "Jimmy" Cayne, handwrote a brief note to Epstein. Like Greenberg's note, it was published in the "business" section.

The finance exec wished him a happy birthday and added what seems to be an inside joke: "From a 'six' to another 'six.'"

Cayne died in 2021. His daughter did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Zuckerman, the billionaire media and real estate mogul, wrote an apparently satirical letter saying he found extensive records of Epstein in the archives of The New York Daily News, which Zuckerman owned at the time.

"It shows his vital statistics, his birthday (23rd), his date of birth (July 11), his country of birth (Lichtenstein), his family life (wife, 3 children), and his profession," Zuckerman wrote.

In reality, Epstein's birthday was January 20, and he was born in Brooklyn, according to a copy of the birth certificate included elsewhere in the birthday book. At the time of his death, he had no publicly known wife or children.

The note is followed by a photo of then-President George W. Bush with his face blurred out, as well as a mock tabloid article headlined "International funny man of history revealed as alien in disguise."

Epstein and Zuckerman briefly worked together on different media ventures. The pair, along with Harvey Weinstein and other investors, led a failed bid to buy New York Magazine in the early 2000s. Epstein and Zuckerman later briefly financed the celebrity magazine Radar.

Zuckerman did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the birthday letter or his relationship with Epstein. Representatives for US News & World Report, where he is the editor in chief, and Boston Properties, where he is the chairman, did not respond to requests for comment either.

Business Insider Edition 

A day after Ethiopia inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Egypt has renewed warnings that the project poses a serious threat to its water security.


        The $5 billion dam, built on the Blue Nile, is Africa's largest hydroelectric project and is expected to more than double Ethiopia's power capacity.
    


        But Cairo has long opposed it, describing the dam as a direct danger to the livelihoods of more than 100 million Egyptians who rely on the Nile River for nearly all their freshwater needs.
    


        For Egypt, the Nile is more than a river; it is the country's lifeline. Almost 95% of its people live along the Nile valley and delta, and the river provides the water needed for farming, drinking, and industry.
    


        Any significant disruption in the flow could have devastating effects on food supplies and daily life. This is why Egyptian leaders have described the GERD as an “existential threat.”
    


        Officials in Cairo argue that Ethiopia pressed ahead with filling the dam's massive reservoir without proper consultation or a legally binding agreement.
    


        Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs insists this violates international law, pointing to long-standing treaties that gave Egypt special rights over the Nile. These include the 1929 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which granted Egypt and Sudan a dominant share of the river's flow.
    


        Former members of Egypt's assessment team have also raised the alarm.
    


        Mohamed Mohey el-Deen, formerly part of Egypt's team assessing GERD's impact, told reporters that the GERD is not only about water but about stability.
    


        “A major drop in supply threatens Egypt's internal security. The stakes are economic, political, and deeply social,” he said.
    


        Over the years, Cairo has taken the issue to the UN Security Council, appealed to international allies, and worked with the Arab League to raise pressure on Ethiopia.
    


        Egypt also claims it reserves the right to use “all available means” to protect its water interests, though so far it has avoided direct confrontation.
    


        Despite more than a decade of talks, no agreement has been reached on how the dam should be filled and operated.
    


        Negotiations mediated by the United States, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and the African Union have all stalled.
    


        Ethiopia maintains that it has the right to use its own resources to fight poverty and grow its economy, while Egypt insists on guarantees that its water supply will not be harmed.
    


        The African Union has attempted to mediate in recent years, but its efforts have not led to a breakthrough. Observers say the core issue remains trust, and without compromise, the dispute risks dragging on for years.
    


        Ethiopia has consistently defended the GERD as a symbol of national pride and development.
    


        Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said during the inauguration that the project would never harm downstream countries.
    


        “Ethiopia has no intention of harming anyone and wants the dam to be seen as a regional asset rather than a regional threat”, he declared.
    


        Addis Ababa argues that the dam is essential to lifting millions of Ethiopians out of poverty.
    


        The government says the GERD will change this reality by doubling national electricity capacity, boosting industries, and providing power exports to neighbours such as Kenya, South Sudan, and Tanzania.
    


        “Ethiopia will never take away your rightful share. The hunger of our brothers in Egypt and Sudan is also our hunger. We must share and grow together.”
    


        Ethiopia also points out that more than 90% of the project's funding came from its own people, through state contributions, diaspora donations, and bond sales.
    


        For many Ethiopians, the dam is a matter of sovereignty and proof that the country can pursue development on its own terms, without relying on foreign donors or lenders.
    


Why it matters



        The Blue Nile contributes about 85% of the water that flows into the larger Nile River, which supports more than 250 million people across 11 countries.
    


        For Egypt, which relies on the Nile for 95% of its water, the stakes are extremely high. For Ethiopia, the dam represents a once-in-a-generation chance to transform its economy.
    


        The GERD therefore sits at the intersection of development and security. If managed cooperatively, it could power growth across East Africa and improve resilience against droughts and floods.
    


        If not, it risks deepening mistrust between neighbours and fuelling one of the continent's most enduring geopolitical flashpoints.

The producer price index, a gauge of costs at the wholesale level in the U.S. economy, posted an unexpected 0.1% decline in August. Here's what to know:

"Tomorrow's CPI will carry more weight, but today's PPI print essentially rolled out the red carpet for a Fed rate cut next week. After last week's jobs report, though, the market was already expecting the Fed to begin an easing cycle, so it remains to be seen how much of a near-term impact this will have on sentiment" — Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.

"The worst-case scenario on inflation isn't playing out. The doves will be happy to see the year-over-year number back below 3 percent. Combined with the weak jobs data recently, this keeps us on track for rate cuts. However the speed and intensity might depend more on the big consumer index tomorrow morning." — David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation.

"Inflationary pressure in PPI appears to be muted overall. ... We see nothing in this report (or its implications for core PCE) that would dissuade Fed officials from cutting 25bp in September and proceeding to cut 25bp at each upcoming policy meeting." — Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst.

Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans.

Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported.

Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans.

The responses were varied and, at times, humorous: 341 employees reacted with a sad face emoji, 167 used an emoji reading "no," 149 chose a sweat-faced sad emoji. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. 

A small proportion appeared to signal approval of the plans, including 19 thumbs-up emojis and 14 rocket ship emojis. 

Other popular reactions included 131 sad cat emojis, 90 facepalm emojis, 86 crying emojis, and 73 clown face emojis. Some employees went for more whimsical options: 62 selected the "Homer Simpson backing into a bush" emoji, and 17 used a child going down a slide saying "bye" emoji.

Klarna declined to comment.

Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. 

The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses.

Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. Losses for the quarter ended June 30 surged to $52 million, up from $7 million a year earlier, even as revenue climbed to $823 million from $682 million.

"That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said.

In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?

The Senate Banking Committee voted Wednesday to advance the nomination by President Donald Trump of Stephen Miran, a top White House economic advisor, to become Federal Reserve governor for at least the next several months.

The 13-11 vote along party lines came a day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked Trump from firing another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, while her lawsuit challenging his removal of her plays out in court.

And it came a week before the Fed board is set to meet to discuss possibly cutting interest rates, as Trump has demanded it do for months.

"Just out: No Inflation!!! "Too Late" must lower the RATE, BIG, right now," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

"Powell is a total disaster, who doesn't have a clue!!!" Trump wrote.

Every Republican on the Banking Committee voted to send Miran's nomination to the full Senate, and every Democrat voted no on that question.

Trump tapped Miran, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to replace Adriana Kugler, who unexpectedly resigned in August. Kugler has given no reason for her departure from the seven-member board.

If confirmed by the full Senate, Miran would serve until Jan. 31, the end of Kugler's term.

Miran has said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisors if he is confirmed for the Fed post. That has rankled Democrats in the Senate, who want him to resign from the council if he becomes a Fed governor.

Trump said in nominating Miran that "we will continue to search for a permanent replacement. That left open the door to nominating someone else for a full 14-year term on the central bank's board.

Trump last month said he was removing Cook because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud.

She denies those claims, and is suing the president to permanently block him for removing her for that purported cause.

If Cook were to be removed, Trump would have the chance to nominate a majority of Fed governors.

In this article

Five years after its splashy $1.3 billion acquisition of Zoox, Amazon has officially entered the U.S. robotaxi race, which to date has been dominated by Alphabet's Waymo.

Zoox's first public launch kicks off Wednesday on the Las Vegas strip. The company is offering free rides from a few select locations, with plans to expand more broadly across the city in the coming months. Riders will eventually have to pay, but Zoox said it's waiting on regulatory approval to take that step.

Amazon is jumping into a market that's all about the future, but one where Waymo has a major head start, having offered commercial driverless rides since 2020. Earlier this year, Waymo said it surpassed 10 million paid rides, and the company now operates in five cities, with Dallas, Denver, Miami, Seattle and Washington, D.C., coming next year.

Tesla, meanwhile, began testing a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June, though with human supervisors on board.

But unlike Waymo and Tesla, Zoox's electric robotaxi doesn't resemble a car. There's no steering wheel or pedals, and the rectangular shape has led many in the industry to describe it as a toaster on wheels. Zoox co-founder and technology chief Jesse Levinson says, "We use robotaxi or vehicle or Zoox."

"You can shoehorn a robotaxi into something that used to be a car. It's just not an ideal solution," Levinson told CNBC in an interview in Las Vegas. "We wanted to do that hard work and take the time and invest in that, and then bring something to market that's just much better than a car."

Zoox was founded in 2014, five years after Google formed the project that became Waymo. Following Las Vegas, the company said it plans to debut an early rider program in San Francisco before the end of the year. The company has been testing a fleet of 50 robotaxis in San Francisco and Las Vegas.

Austin and Miami will be Zoox's next locations, the company said. Zoox will soon begin testing robotaxis in those markets, and said it's already driving retrofitted test vehicles in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Seattle.

"We think it's very, very early days, and the future is not written yet," said Levinson, during a demo ride with CNBC.

Zoox's Las Vegas depot spans 190,000 square feet, which is about the size of three football fields. At the facility, the company houses the dozens of vehicles set to start operating around the city. Smartphone users will be able to order them from Top Golf, Area15, Resorts World Las Vegas, New York-New York Hotel & Casino and Luxor Hotel & Casino. 

The robotaxi features two rows of seats that face each other and can transport up to four people at a time. The front and rear are identical, with bidirectional wheels that allow it to move forward or backward without turning around. The vehicle can run for 16 hours on a single charge.

Floor-to-ceiling windows provide a sightseeing experience for passengers who want a clear view of the endless rows of casinos. But the interior design is meant to enable easy conversation with fellow riders.

"It's not a retrofitted car," said Zoox CEO Aicha Evans. "It's built from the ground up around the rider."

CNBC interviewed Evans at Zoox's headquarters in Foster City, California, a short drive north of Google's sprawling Silicon Valley campus.

In addition to offering a unique kind of vehicle, Zoox is taking a very different approach getting to market than Waymo, which has teamed up with carmakers such as Chrysler, Jaguar and Hyundai.

Zoox is going it alone, reflecting the vision of co-founder Tim Kentley-Klay, an Australian entrepreneur, who subsequently started an artificial intelligence robotics company. Kentley-Klay, whose background was in marketing, initially learned about autonomous vehicles by going around Silicon Valley and interviewing experts in the nascent field under the premise that he was a filmmaker working on a related project, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about the co-founder.

For technical expertise, Kentley-Klay teamed up with Levinson, who had worked on self-driving technology at Stanford University. Levinson's father is Apple board chair and former Genentech CEO Arthur Levinson.

Kentley-Klay and Levinson decided to build the automobile of the future instead of just retrofitting cars so they could drive on their own. Neel Mehta, a former autos analyst at Morgan Stanley, signed up to join them in 2016, when Zoox was still in stealth mode.

"If you have a fully autonomous vehicle, then why do you need a steering wheel?" said Mehta, who ran multiple teams, including corporate strategy, during his five years at Zoox.

It was a laborious process.

While rivals were taking existing models and adding sensors and software, Zoox was using 3D printers to create entirely new car parts, people familiar with the matter said. When challenges arose and employees suggested a different approach, Kentley-Klay and Levinson refused to waver, the people said.

But Kentley-Klay was ousted in 2018. Early the following year, Zoox brought in Evans, who had been a longtime executive at Intel, starting at the chipmaker as a test manager in 2006.  

"I had a job. Life was good, and I had lots of other opportunities," Evans said. "This was a choice, a very deliberate choice, and Jesse was part of that choice."

Evans was much more corporate, more polished and a little less approachable than her predecessor, said a person with knowledge of the matter. But with added bureaucracy came organizational skills that helped the company mature, two people said. The sources asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak about the company.

Evans said her goal was to bring together Zoox's experts on compute, cloud and robotics. 

"It's a big vision – you're not going to get there overnight," she said. "So it was, how do we break it down? What things do we have to prove? In what order?"

Within Amazon, Zoox falls under the sprawling devices and services business, led by former Microsoft executive Panos Panay. The category includes everything from Alexa and Kindle to Project Kuiper, the internet satellite business.

Zoox has continued to function largely as an independent subsidiary, two people familiar with the matter said. The leadership team has remained intact, unlike at several of Amazon's acquired businesses, such as Whole Foods, One Medical and PillPack, which saw a shuffling at the top after joining.

"It's been 5½ years, so we're way past the dating period," Evans said. "Their expectations are quite reasonable. Do what you say you're going to do, and when you do it, great."

Leadership is still paying close attention.

In honor of Zoox's anniversary in July, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other executives paid a visit to headquarters, said a person who was in attendance. The mood was celebratory, and Jassy congratulated employees on Zoox's success to date, the person said.

Ahead of its launch, Zoox had been testing its technology in Las Vegas since 2019. Robotaxi tests began there in 2023, and the company started offering demo rides to curios spectators at Resorts World in late July.

Zoox chose Las Vegas due to its hefty concentration of tourists near the strip and the fact that a drive to the airport doesn't require getting on the highway.

Russell James, 68, was an early tester.

James, who lives in San Francisco, is no stranger to robotaxis. He said he often rides in Waymos when he's home, preferring the privacy of a driverless car.

"It does what you want it to do," he said. "It picks you up and gets you where you want to go."

In June, during one of his frequent trips to Las Vegas, James said he took a friend up on an offer to take an early Zoox ride.

There were some hiccups.

The first vehicle that staff summoned for him at Resorts World wasn't fully charged, he said. After another three pulled up, James was instructed to hop into the car that still had sufficient battery power remaining. (During CNBC's visit to Las Vegas last week, all of the cars that pulled up to get passengers were charged.)

James said that, as a tall man, he appreciated the spaciousness of the vehicle.

"I usually have to scrunch my head down," he said. "There was none of that."

James compared the experience to the "trams that take you between terminals at an airport." He described his short loop around the resort as uneventful, "which is kind of exactly what you want."

But not all of Zoox's rides have been without incident.

In April, an unoccupied Zoox in Las Vegas collided with a car that Levinson said was "driving a bit erratically."

It was a minor crash and no one was injured. But after reviewing the log file, Zoox determined its vehicle could've handled the situation better, Levinson said. The company paused rides in Las Vegas for a short period. In May, Zoox recalled 270 vehicles to address a software defect concerning its ability to predict the movements of other road users. 

A few weeks later, Zoox ordered another software recall after one of its robotaxis was struck by an e-scooter rider in San Francisco. The robotaxi was stopped at the time of the collision, but then began to move to complete a turn. 

"We're happy to admit that we're not perfect, and so anytime we find opportunities to improve our software, we take those opportunities," Levinson said.

Safety has been a big challenge in the robotaxi industry's short history.

Prior to Uber selling off its AV division in 2020, one of the company's test cars collided with and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in 2018. General Motors said it would no longer fund its Cruise division in December. Cruise's robotaxi business became engulfed in scandal in 2023 after one of its cars dragged a woman, who was knocked into its path, for 20 feet in San Francisco.

"Our bar is not being perfect. It's being significantly safer than a human," Levinson said. "Our safety record so far is very much consistent with being significantly safer than humans."

Levinson said Zoox is starting out with free rides to get the word out, before turning its attention to making a business out of it.

"Obviously we have a path to do that or else it wouldn't make sense for Zoox to exist," said Levinson. In terms of timing for profitability, Levinson said, it's "not weeks from now, it's not decades from now. So somewhere in between."

A more pressing priority is scale. Earlier this year, Zoox opened a sprawling manufacturing facility in Hayward, California, across the San Francisco Bay from its headquarters. 

The site is currently producing one vehicle per day, but the company says it will eventually get to roughly three robotaxis per hour, or 10,000 a year, when it's at full scale. Waymo says it currently has more than 2,000 vehicles in its commercial fleet. 

Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry, said that given the hefty costs of building and operating a full robotaxi service, "It's probably going to be at least 2030, or maybe later, before any of these businesses are actually profitable."

Amazon insists that it's willing to be patient. The company has poured billions of dollars into Zoox since the acquisition in 2020, and finally gets to show the public what's in store.

"One of the things that I feel Amazon doesn't get enough credit for is that it's very good at picking some long-term big bets and actually making them happen," Evans said. "We're setting out to show that, yes, this is real, and it's coming to you."

Alphabet's life sciences unit, Verily, plans to restructure its business as it anticipates a fresh round of investment.

In a town hall meeting on Monday, Verily CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily would transform from a Limited Liability Company to a C-corp, a business structure generally considered more investor-friendly, according to a person who heard the remarks and asked to remain anonymous because they were not permitted to speak to the press.

Gillett told employees the change was happening as Verily anticipated a fresh round of investment and stopped short of confirming whether any investment had been secured and by whom.

Employees were also told on Monday that their Verily shares were being revalued, the person said. The value of each share has been reduced by around 80% compared to its 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.

Gillett told staff during the Monday meeting that Verily's valuation was too high compared to its earnings, according to the person who heard the remarks.

A Verily spokesperson declined to comment.

Business Insider previously reported that Verily was trying to secure a new round of funding this year.

Verily last month told staff it was closing down its long-running devices business and laying off staff, Business Insider first reported. The company, which began life inside Google's moonshot lab, has been on a multi-year cost-cutting and streamlining mission. 

It has also been gradually detaching its technology and other dependencies on Google as it prepares to eventually spin out into an independent company no longer under Alphabet.

"The path forward requires difficult decisions, but I remain confident in Verily's future and grateful for the exceptional team that will continue building it," wrote Gillett in an email to staff last month.

Elon Musk said he has not visited Washington, D.C., since stepping down from his role at the White House DOGE office.

"I haven't been to D.C. since May. That was a hell of a side quest," Musk said during an interview at the All-In Summit.

The All-In Summit, which featured other business leaders such as Mark Cuban, took place in Los Angeles from September 7 to September 9. A recording of Musk's interview was uploaded to the "All-In Podcast" YouTube channel on Tuesday.

"The government is basically unfixable," Musk said when asked about the lessons he learnt from running DOGE.

"If you look at our national debt, which is insanely high, the interest payments exceed the War Department budget," Musk added. "So, if AI and robots don't solve our national debt, we are toast."

Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Musk was a huge backer of President Donald Trump during the latter's 2024 election campaign. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent at least $277 million supporting Trump and other GOP candidates.

After Trump was elected, Musk joined the Trump administration as a special government employee, leading DOGE. Musk continued to run his businesses while working in government. His 130-day stint as a special government employee ended in May.

In January, Musk was optimistic about what he could accomplish with DOGE. He told political strategist Mark Penn during a livestream on X that DOGE had a "good shot" at saving $1 trillion.

The government is "a very target-rich environment for saving money," Musk told Penn.

"It's like being in a room full of targets. Like, you could close your eyes, and you can't miss," he said.

It is unclear just how much money DOGE saved for the federal government. In April, Musk said the cost cutting outfit was on track to cut nearly $150 billion in spending for the 2026 fiscal year.

In June, Musk's relationship with the president imploded publicly after they posted heated messages to each other on X and Truth Social, respectively.

Musk took aim at Trump's signature tax bill, calling it a "MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK." He also took credit for Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election.

"Such ingratitude," Musk wrote in an X post on June 5.

Trump had earlier threatened to cancel the government's contracts with Musk's businesses, but has since taken a more conciliatory tone with Musk.

Last week, Trump said during an interview on "The Scott Jennings Show" that Musk was a "good man."

"He's got 80% super genius, and then 20% he's got some problems. And when he works out the 20%, he'll be great," Trump said of Musk.

Robinhood is encroaching on Reddit's territory.

At the company's annual "Hood Summit in" Las Vegas on Tuesday, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev announced that the company is building a social media platform where users can post their trades and track what other investors are buying or selling.

Robinhood Social will show users a "for you" page that recommends trades that are trending or those they'd be interested in, said Abhishek Fatehpuria, the vice president of product management at Robinhood, during a live demo on Tuesday.

The platform will also show publicly reported trades from hedge funds and politicians, he said.

Users can check the performance of a post's author to see exactly when someone bought or sold a security and how much profit or loss they made.

The brokerage will roll out a beta version of the platform to roughly 10,000 users in the first quarter of next year, with a wider launch date yet to be announced.

Robinhood was a major player in the meme stock mania of January 2021, which involved throngs of inexperienced investors using Robinhood to buy stocks of companies like GameStop and AMC Entertainment after discussing them on Reddit.

Robinhood faced backlash for suddenly restricting trading on these meme stocks and for gamifying short-term investing, which critics say poses serious financial risks. Lawmakers and billionaire Warren Buffett have accused the company of treating the stock market like a casino.

In 2021, Tenev and Wall Street hedge fund managers were questioned in a congressional inquiry into the GameStop trading event. In 2023, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying that customer agreements allowed the company to limit transactions.

Robinhood, which was founded in 2013, went public in 2021 and is now worth about $105.3 billion. It's one of the latest companies to join the benchmark S&P 500 index.

Robinhood is up 218% so far this year.

AI disruption has sent shockwaves through the software sector this year. On Tuesday, a top OpenAI executive hammered home the potential threat to this lucrative industry.

During a talk at a Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar was asked about recent comments her boss made about the SaaS business.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently tweeted, "entering the fast fashion era of SaaS very soon."

Friar explained that the fast fashion phenomenon radically changed the apparel retail industry, and now the software-as-a-service business may be about to experience a similar disruption.

"The whole value chain is getting disrupted. The people who will get left behind are not embracing AI fast enough," Friar said. "I don't think it's AI that steals your job or steals your company. It's someone who is using AI deeply that's going to disrupt you."

Software stocks, including Salesforce and HubSpot, have slumped this year on concern that AI tools could make it easier for companies and developers to build their own software, rather than buying SaaS services.

This "buy versus build" debate has been a hot topic on Wall Street in recent months, with one study warning that over 100 public software companies risk getting squeezed between nimble AI startups and powerful AI-ready tech giants.

OpenAI's Friar poured gasoline on this fiery debate on Tuesday.

Talented engineers and developers used to be in limited supply, so companies bought more software off the shelf from SaaS vendors. Now, AI coding tools make it easier to build software in-house, she explained.

"Why do I buy planning software off the shelf? Why do I buy procurement software off the shelf? Because no executive in their right mind is going to use their most precious resource, which is coders and developers, to build stuff like that," Friar said.

But in the new world of autonomous software development, it's now possible to create bespoke software like this in-house.

"Why wouldn't I code the kind of software that is exactly what OpenAI needs? Not what Goldman needs or any other company needs," the CFO continued. "I think that is going to change the whole face of how software is developed."

She cited an example of how impactful this could be.

In her finance team at OpenAI, many employees are coding agents and other tools to help them get their job done more quickly. This is partly why OpenAI's finance group is roughly 18% of the size of finance teams at companies of similar size, the CFO explained.

"I love that, all day, every day," Friar said.

A US ban on advanced AI chip exports has supercharged China's chip stocks, sending investors piling into homegrown players. The stock boom has gotten so intense that at least one company warned its share price may be divorced from reality.

The rally was first sparked by the breakout of cheap AI model DeepSeek early this year and picked up speed after Washington's chip restrictions opened more room for domestic competitors.

"It essentially gives them a bigger market to address, given the absence of Nvidia," Ray Wang, the research director for semiconductors and emerging technology at Futurum Group, told Business Insider.

Despite China's yearslong property crisis and a trade war with the US, the Hang Seng Tech Index has surged 67% in 2025, reversing years of weakness following Beijing's tech crackdown.

The bull market comes as China — the world's largest chip importer — has been "doing more with less," wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a September 2 note.

The analysts pointed to DeepSeek, which was built using cheaper chips at a fraction of the cost, and noted reports that Chinese firms have accessed some high-end chips through back doors.

"Critically, it has been developing (inferior but improving) chips of its own to reduce its dependence on the US and potential exposure to security risks from US chips," the analysts added.

That drive for AI self-reliance was underscored this earnings season. Chinese AI chipmaker Cambricon posted blockbuster results and Alibaba's reported strong AI and cloud growth, putting China's tech sector back in the spotlight.

"Despite the US export bans, China is a large player in AI hardware manufacturing and has been promoting a localization strategy," wrote Winnie Wu, the cohead of China equity research and chief China equity strategist at BofA Global Research, in a September 4 report.

Wu added that China is the global runner-up in AI after the US and is competing across "nearly every level of the supply chain."

A significant beneficiary of China's tech rally has been Beijing-based Cambricon, whose revenue surged a staggering 4,300% to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan, or $403.3 million, in the first half of 2025. Its Shanghai-listed stock has nearly doubled this year, lifting its market value to 536 billion yuan.

"Cambricon's value reflects not only current performance but also its future potential from an investor's perspective, because right now its top competitor, Nvidia, is limited in China due to export controls," said Wang.

Cambricon's shares have risen more than sevenfold over the past five years. Investors took notice when it turned profitable in the fourth quarter of 2024 after years of losses.

The stock's rally has been so intense that Cambricon warned on August 28 of investment risks after its stock surged more than 130% in a single month.

"There is a risk that stock prices will deviate from current fundamentals," the company wrote in the announcement.

Other Chinese chip stocks are soaring too: SMIC is up 83% this year, while Hua Hong Semiconductor has surged 118%.

China's AI stock rally may be overheating, wrote BofA's Wu.

The boom isn't confined to chips.

Tech giants Alibaba and Tencent are up 66% and 48% year-to-date. These companies are plowing resources into generative AI, cloud computing, and related infrastructure.

Wang said the competition in China is as fierce as in the US, with tech companies investing heavily in AI.

Wang named Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, Huawei, and Cambricon as frontrunners in China's AI race — though still far behind Nvidia.

"The H20 is a very downgraded chip designed for the Chinese market. But even then, there's still significant demand for Nvidia's offering because of the systematic edge it provides," Wang said.

But Chinese firms are cutting back on Nvidia chips, according to analysts at Bernstein last month. Instead, they've been training models on regular devices like PCs and laptops and shifting much of the output work to homegrown alternatives.

The US first restricted advanced AI chip exports in 2022 under President Biden to block Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology. The Trump administration has since tightened those rules, barring Nvidia and AMD from selling their most powerful chips to Chinese buyers. Even Nvidia's downgraded H20 model has faced curbs.

Last month, Washington partially eased its stance: Nvidia and AMD can now sell some chips — including Nvidia's H20 chips — to China under a deal requiring them to share 15% of their China revenue with the US government.

Meanwhile, the US plans to revoke chipmaking giant TSMC's special export licences for sending gear to its fab in Nanjing, China, by the end of the year. This could curb chipmaking capabilities in China.

Following the strong gains this year, Chinese chip and tech stocks have been volatile in the last week as some investors lock in profits. Cambricon shares are down 17% over the last five trading days, but still 87% higher year to date.

The question now is whether there's more upside left.

"I'm not sure I can say these companies will grow another 20% or 30%, given the already significant gains this year," Wang said, referring to chip stocks.

Instead, he advised investors to examine other niche areas of the supply chain, including optics and other hardware components, for opportunities.

In this story:

Caitlin Clark may be out for the remainder of the WNBA season, but it didn't stop a momentous sale of a one-of-one NFT on the Panini blockchain. On Sept. 8, Clark's Green Kaboom digital card sold for $175,000, only one day after it was pulled from a digital pack. 

The $175,000 sale is the largest sale ever on the Panini blockchain, which has been in operation since Jan. 2020.

The buyer was spinotron, a well-known collector who has been bullish on digital cards. A longtime collector of rare Kobe Bryant physical cards, among others, spinotron has grown a large digital collection. According to his Panini profile, spinotron owns 7,269 NFTs and 7,396 unopened packs. Spinotron believes in digital cards because they remove the friction points of the physical hobby, including authentication, grading, and physical transfer.

"I'm a big physical collector of 17 years," spinotron told Collectibles on SI via text. "Panini Blockchain is 5-10% of my portfolio. I'm always chasing the best cards, which I would call 'coffin cards.' They are hugely irreplaceable, historically significant, and represent one's identity for the long term, if not forever.

"The Clark Kaboom Green 1/1 blockchain card is a coffin card. The person who pulled it is arguably the biggest primary pack buyer on chain. He has a reputation for never selling anything of note. So I assumed it was gone and unavailable, but decided to make a run at it before it formed a strong emotional connection with the guy who pulled it. I offered at $110k, then it was surprisingly listed at $175k. To my surprise, I was outbid two times by another hardcore collector from the crypto side at $135k. Further bidding might trigger [Buy it Now] by others, so I took it at full ask." 

The seller later told spinotron he was glad he sold it to him. Spinotron bought the Steph Curry Green Kaboom - Vertical NFT a week earlier for $99,999. He was happy to pair the Clark Green Kaboom with it. 

The Clark Green Kaboom was pulled from the 2024 WNBA Rookie Royalty digital packs, which were sold via a Dutch auction on Aug. 28. The starting price of the packs was $15,000, and the lowest possible price was $500. The price lowered every 5 minutes until the product sold out. Packs sold out at $1,100, with the average sale price being $1,400.

"I'm not nervous about spending $175k on a single card, because I know what it stands for going in and know the market and demand," spinotron said. "Competition was only $40k away, and I didn't test his limit. The Panini blockchain has made significant progress recently, which validates my vision and logic, and surely makes me more bullish. Many big physical collectors are coming in and staying long term."

The physical card collecting domain is rapidly evolving from a personal hobby or family pastime into a model dominated by capital operations. In terms of information transparency and data-driven decision-making through big data analytics, Panini NFT clearly possesses superior… https://t.co/5CKeRL1sxK

The impact of NFT community activity is frequently instrumental in shaping success and relevance in the crypto and NFTs space. In a recent announcement through LunarCrush analytics, Phoenix Group has identified the top projects by social activity on September 10, 2025. 

TOP #NFT PROJECTS BY SOCIAL ACTIVITY$LINK $PENGU $APE $ICP $XTZ $FET $MASK $VRA $RENDER $GALA pic.twitter.com/7tuCMiHLvJ

The ranking was determined by engaged posts and the overall interactions, likes, comments, retweets, and upvotes. This snapshot mirrors the increasing influence of online communities in creating an impetus on the ecosystems.

Chainlink occupies the top rank in the list with 14.4K posts active, and 2.8M interactions. Chainlink has not just been active in blockchain oracles, but a recent move into NFTs is indicative of its expanding ecosystem and its expanding role in DeFi and digital collectibles. 

It is clear that the scale of participation LINK has achieved has no parallel in terms of usefulness and community based support.

In second place, Pengu (PENGU) had 7.1K engagements posts and 1.2M engagements. The charming and social community-driven aspect of the project still draws in dedicated fans who survive off of posting memes, artwork, and merchandise.

In the meantime, ApeCoin was ranked number-three with 5.3K posts engaged and 1.5M interactions. Related to the legendary BAYC ecosystem, ApeCoin demonstrates the long term resilience of NFT brands that fuse exclusivity with a rich cultural impact. Regardless of such market volatility, ApeCoin has been one of the most socially active projects with the power of its NFT legacy supporting it.

Internet Computer (ICP), got the fourth position with 4.8K engaged posts and 212.8K interactions. Its current interest in NFT creation underscores the fact that the project is focused on creating decentralized applications right on-chain, and NFTs are one of the fronts to explore.

Tezos (XTZ) was next with 3.8K associated posts and 179.9K interactions. One aspect of Tezos that has appealed to the artists and developers who prioritize sustainability is energy-efficient NFTs. The social traction reaffirms the continued relevance of Tezos in the market because it has a balance of both eco-friendly solutions and community interaction.

Fetch.ai (FET) has registered 3.6K engaged posts and 134.3K interactions. Whereas providing mainly AI and blockchain integration features, Fetch.ai NFT presence is acquiring a following as the project endeavors to discover new applications that combine artificial intelligence and digital assets.

Mask Network (MASK) featured 3.1K posts engaged and 146.3K interactions, which indicates its effectiveness in increasing the power of the Web3 movement via social networks. Its NFT operation depicts the integration of the social engagement tools in the realm of decentralized finance and the digital property.

Verasity (VRA) has done well with 2.9K engaged posts and 389.8K impressions, a figure that many of the projects higher in the rankings have attained. Video games and eSports-oriented programs used by Verasity resonate with viewers, and it is becoming increasingly an emerging leader in NFT-based communities.

The top list was completed by Render (RNDR) and Gala (GALA). Posted 2.7K engaged and 297.8K interactions, Render also had an advantage of its GPU-based decentralized platform of rendering which links NFTs to the modern production of visual content. Its position in giving creators a voice is still of interest both to artists and developers.

Gala (GALA) was also competing with Render in engaged post (2.7K) but was at 49.8K in terms of interaction. Gala is known to have a stable community as a result of their blockchain based games and entertainment. Even though its interactions are underdeveloped in comparison with others, the project still displays a continuation of relevance in NFT-powered gaming ecosystems.

The recent rankings show how various projects, including established ones, such as LINK and APE, and innovative ones, such as PENGU and VRA, are leveraging social engagement as a way to stay visible and relevant. The community involvement in terms of posts and interactions remains the factor determining the adoption.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission once again delayed making a decision on a handful of crypto-related ETF rule changes.

The SEC said on Wednesday in a series of filings that it needs more time to review applications to allow staking for Ethereum ETFs issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Exchange-traded funds proposed by Franklin Templeton that would track the price of altcoins XRP and Solana also met with delays.

While SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has been vocal in his support of digital assets, his agency continues to punt on deciding on many ETFs. Meanwhile, new altcoin-based ETF applications continue to be submitted on what seems like a weekly basis as financial institutions show their eagerness to list funds that offer exposure to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.

According to a chart created by Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst James Seyffart, over 90 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC approval.

"At this rate we'll have one for every top 30-40 [cryptocurrency] inside 12 months, even with delays," McKayResearch founder James McKay said on X with a post including Seyffart's chart.

In July, the SEC said it was looking for comments on a rule change that would permit BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust to add staking. Issuers' interest in adding staking to their Ethereum ETFs kicked into high gear after the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance said in May that certain blockchain staking activities don't involve the offering of securities. Many people took that to mean crypto ETF staking would be allowed.

Last month, the SEC delayed making a decision on whether Grayscale could add staking to its Ethereum exchange-traded fund.

Franklin Templeton's two proposals for spot XRP and Solana ETFs will also have to wait longer for the SEC to make a decision. The firm first applied to list the ETFs in March.

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said on Wednesday he anticipates a strong end to the year for SOL with the expectation that ETFs tracking Solana will finally go live. Besides Bitwise and Franklin, Grayscale, VanEck, Fidelity, Invesco/Galaxy, and Canary Capital have filed for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S.

It's apparently entering a 'foundation alpha' September 22

We reported previously about extraction MMOFPS Reaper Actual and its curated presence at this year's Gamescom, which granted invited attendees a look at the various game mechanics and systems as it eyes an early 2026 release. Despite the event being long over, an interview from WCCFTech with Distinct Possibility's John Smedley and Matthew Higby has offered a few additional details to note.

The first thing of note is the scale of the game world in Reaper, which Smed describes as “absolutely stunningly massive,” with plenty of buildings to scale or some to enter into, lots of sniping positions, and plenty of POIs, locations, and mission objectives that can spawn all across the map in order to give a sense that players are constantly surrounded by firefights and combat. As reported previously, the full game space can currently support up to 200, but the aim is to “get over a thousand” at some point “a little bit after launch.”



The MMO-like size isn't just about the map either, as Higby and Smedley also talked about large-scale player features like player-to-player trading via an auction house-style system, crafting that “should feel more like something from an EVE game” in terms of its complexity and depth, and the clan system known as outfits that promises to be more in-depth than other guild systems, including larger outfit bases with more features like vehicle garages.

Another major point of note was discussion about the separate and optional blockchain version. Here Higby talks about how the devs are looking to create “NFT or crypto assets [that can] actually be utility-based as opposed to just being speculative value.” The current solution being considered is the ability to create a purpose-built base designed as a medical waystation, bundle it up as a blueprint, and sell it off as both an NFT and a useful in-game asset.

Earlier in that same portion of the interview, however, Smed also pointed out that trading between the Web3 and standard versions of the game won't be possible, so presumably the same granted example could be done in the regular game, which once again raises the question of why this needs to be a thing to begin with when actual gamers neither want nor need it.

On the subject of imposed digital scarcity For Reasons, the interview confirms that access to a “foundation alpha” of the game will be sold on both Steam and the Epic Games Store starting Monday, September 22nd, which will be sold in very limited quantities. This is to “let up a small number of people in and actually play the game because we want players to come in and actually tell us if the game is fun, and teach us the things we don't know about our own game,” according to Smed.

Oops, something went wrong

An updated edition of the July 23, 2025 article.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, stablecoins and other altcoins run on blockchain technology, which uses advanced cryptography and decentralized software to maintain immutable records. This tamper-resistant system enhances security and transparency, making blockchain a core driver of cryptocurrency adoption. Recent policy and regulatory shifts have further boosted the industry. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) repealed an accounting rule and dropped lawsuits against Coinbase COIN and Robinhood HOOD, signaling a more supportive stance. The passing of the GENIUS Act on July 17 provides a legal background to stablecoins. Other pending regulations — The CLARITY Act and The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act — bode well for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.Cryptocurrencies have been benefiting from the liberal policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. An executive order by President Trump that directed a working group to study and propose changes to cryptocurrency regulations bodes well for crypto enthusiasts. President Trump's announcement of creating a crypto reserve augurs well for cryptocurrency miners, including IREN Limited, Cipher Mining CIFR, and exchanges like Coinbase and CME Group.Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has been soaring due to increasing acceptance as a non-sovereign asset, as well as higher institutional and corporate adoption. However, volatility remains a headwind. Over the trailing 12 months, bitcoin has traded between a low of $57,359.74 and a high of $123,313.78. Over the past seven days, bitcoin has increased 0.8%. Apart from cryptocurrency miners and exchanges, Amazon AMZN and NVIDIA NVDA are attractive choices. NVIDIA offers Cmp Hx, a dedicated GPU for professional mining. NVDA's GPUs help in accelerating blockchain transaction validation and reducing energy consumption. Amazon offers Amazon Managed Blockchain and has partnerships with platforms like Ethereum and Avalanche.

Robinhood benefits from higher retail participation in markets, which is expected to drive trading revenues. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company's initiative to diversify its product base to acquire new clients and gain market share is noteworthy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Launch of tokenized stocks in the European Union (EU) in June, prediction markets hub (March 2025), options trading in the U.K., Futures market, Tax Lots feature for its investors, Robinhood Gold Card (March 2024) for its Robinhood Gold customers, thereby venturing into the credit card space, are noteworthy. Acquisition of the global cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp marks a major step in expanding Robinhood's crypto business. The WonderFi buyout expands HOOD's presence in Canada's crypto market. In February 2025, the company acquired TradePMR, thus foraying into the RIA custody market.However, HOOD operates in a highly regulated industry and, hence, is exposed to regulatory risks. In July 2025, Florida authorities launched an investigation into the crypto unit of Robinhood over misleading promotional tactics. In March 2025, two units of Robinhood agreed to pay $26 million to settle the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's allegations for failing to respond to red flags about potential misconduct and not verifying the identities of thousands of customers.NVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance computing (HPC). The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA's Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs, set to launch later in 2025, are expected to deliver up to 25 times the token throughput for AI inference compared to Hopper 100.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive. NVIDIA is currently working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. NVIDIA's focus on incorporating AI into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues. NVDA sees a $300 billion revenue opportunity in this space.NVIDIA has received approval to sell its H20 AI chips in China after signing a deal with the U.S. government. Under the terms of the agreement, NVIDIA will pay 15% of total revenues from H20 sales in China to the U.S. government. While this revenue-sharing condition may slightly impact margins, the deal opens a valuable door to China, one of the largest AI markets globally.Another Zacks Rank #2 stock, Cipher Mining, is expected to benefit from expanding opportunities at Black Pearl and Barbara Lake. Black Pearl is the company's 300 MW data center in Wink, TX. In the second quarter of 2025, the company began bitcoin mining at Black Pearl data center Phase 1 (150 MW). Cipher hit 16.8 exahash per second at the end of the second quarter and remains on track to reach 23.5 exahash per second by the end of the third quarter. New Bitmain rigs, along with a small batch of miners from Canaan, will help CIFR reach this target and improve efficiency (16.8 joules per terahash against 20.8 joules per terahash reported at the end of the second quarter).Cipher's current operating capacity stands at 477 MW with the addition of Black Pearl Phase 1, and potential pipeline capacity expansion of up to 2.6 gigawatts in the coming years. The Phase 2 supports both hydro bitcoin mining and HPC compute applications simultaneously.

Ethereum ETFs have fully overtaken Bitcoin in terms of inflows in a dramatic shift in investor preference. For years, Bitcoin dominated the institutional portfolios as the safe digital asset. Now, the story is getting broader. Institutions are rotating over to ETH for the staking rewards, deflationary design and more use cases.

Interestingly, retail traders are shifting as well. Many see short term upside with slow growth of Bitcoin vs. Ethereum. This spinning is spreading beyond ETH and to smaller altcoins where riskier bets can pay off bigger gains. One of the evident beneficiaries of this trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE, an altcoin that is gaining momentum due to the capital seeking higher returns.



Data from Glassnode and SoSoValue shows Ethereum ETFs attracted $3.87 billion in inflows during August. Bitcoin funds, meanwhile, had $751 million in outflows.

Momentum continued into September. ETH ETFs recorded $1.24 billion in inflows during the first week and Bitcoin did $440.8 million. Fidelity's FETH and BlackRock's ETHA took the lead, driving total ETH ETF inflows to more than $13.34 billion.

There was some cooling. On September 2 ETH ETFs experienced $135 million in outflows. Analysts describe this as a healthy pause. With ETH near $4,400, retest of $3400 at the 21-week EMA could provide the base for another rally.

Bitcoin ETFs also showed life, posting $332.7 million in inflows on September 2. Fidelity's FBTC and BlackRock's IBIT triggered the recovery. BTC price bounced back up to $111,000, testing its 20-week simple moving average.

Still, analysts warn this recovery might be temporary. It is sustained inflows that are necessary for a true recovery. Ethereum's advantage appears to be more structural.

ETH/BTC volume ratios reached 2.71, the highest-ever ratio recorded. Perpetual futures open interest also reached a record high in more than a year. These data points provide a certain confirmation that traders are favoring Ethereum while spreading capital more and more across other altcoins.

Several factors account for Ethereum's increasing ETF lead:



MAGACOIN FINANCE is presenting itself as one of the tokens receiving the investor's attention on this rotation. As capital flows out of the majors, traders are turning to high upside altcoins where smaller investments can lead to outsized returns. This is the overall appetite for risk among altcoin buyers.

Analysts point out that MAGACOIN FINANCE might benefit from exchange speculation and visibility as demand rotates to lower cap assets. Its growing community and transparent foundations helps it stand out in a crowded meme market. With investors looking their eyes outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting itself up as a future contender in the world of altcoins.

The influx of ETH ETFs way past Bitcoin is a signal of the changing market structure. The institutions are looking for Ethereum's deflationary mechanics and staking yields while the retail investors are looking for more growth opportunities. Taken together, these flows confirm that investors are shifting from Bitcoin's dominance towards altcoins with stronger narratives.

Out of them, the most prominent is: MAGACOIN FINANCE . It's a combination of the appeals of the meme and scarcity, as well as community hype and exchange speculation potential. Investors are turning to MAGA because it represents something we have not seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum: exponential upside from a smaller base. As altcoin momentum builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing itself as one of the more attractive places to send new capital.

Bitcoin's first layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), stands to gain a lot from potential Bitcoin movements in the coming months. The original cryptocurrency, BTC, has been clinging to the $111,000 level for some time as investors wait for U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers on Thursday.

Many anticipate a rate cut from the FOMC next week, which could serve as the trigger for BTC to move decisively higher.

However, while the market focuses on macro, an even bigger demand driver for BTC is quietly taking shape. After raising nearly $15 million in capital, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) – the beast of Bitcoin Layer-2 – is about to be unleashed.

With Solana's speed under the hood and Bitcoin's security as the bedrock, Bitcoin Hyper is firing on all cylinders, able to support the most demanding applications across the crypto space.

And in less than 16 hours, the project will close its current funding stage, after which each HYPER token will cost more than today's $0.012885.

The market is now almost certain that a rate cut will happen at the FOMC meeting on September 17–18.

On prediction platform Polymarket, bettors are heavily backing a 25 basis point cut next week, assigning an 83% probability versus just 4% for no change. In these markets, the price of a “Yes” share reflects the implied probability of an outcome, with $1 representing certainty.

Historically, a rate cut leads to a weaker dollar, which has tended to support Bitcoin. The U.S. M2 money supply has often grown in parallel with BTC's price, underscoring Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative asset.

Still, traders appear cautious this September. The market sees the highest probability for Bitcoin ending the month at $114,000, followed by $116,000. Some even believe BTC could drop to $107,000, in line with its historical tendency to underperform in September.

This shows that even though investors widely expect a rate cut, many don't believe it will translate into a major Bitcoin rally this month. However, Polymarket bettors also assign a 14% chance to a 50 basis point cut, a scenario that would shock markets and depends on Friday's CPI data coming in soft enough to justify it.

If that happens, Bitcoin could stage a surprise rally in September, setting up its seasonally strong months of October and November. 

There's also a broader liquidity backdrop to consider: nearly $7.26 trillion is sitting in money market funds. That pool of capital isn't idle cash – with rate cuts lowering yields, even a small fraction flowing out could be a powerful catalyst for BTC.

Beyond these macro moves, the longer-term catalyst for Bitcoin may come from utility-driven demand. With nearly $15 million already raised, Bitcoin Hyper is the project that could begin channeling that demand when it launches in the weeks ahead.

In earlier cycles, it was the retail crowd that carried Bitcoin higher – first to $1,000 in 2013 and then to $20,000 in 2017. A mix of retail speculation, pandemic liquidity, and cheaper money later pushed it past that 2017 apex. Since then, the narrative has shifted to institutions, with companies like Strategy leading the charge by expanding their Bitcoin treasuries.

Although the institutional wave may not be over, demand risks drying up if Bitcoin offers nothing more than its role as a store of value. It's one thing to proudly claim how much BTC you hold, but that value rests heavily on the “digital gold” narrative.

Bitcoin Hyper changes this dynamic by making BTC useful across a much broader set of applications – not just payments, but also DeFi platforms, real-world assets (RWA), gaming, and other use cases that people never originally envisioned on the Bitcoin blockchain.

All of this unfolds inside Bitcoin Hyper's Layer-2 ecosystem. At its core is the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the world's fastest execution layer. It can run dApps at Solana speeds while still anchoring settlement to Bitcoin's immutable and decentralized base layer.

Bitcoin Hyper functions as a Layer-2 anchored to Bitcoin, but it doesn't bundle every transaction back to the main chain the way Ethereum rollups do. 

Instead, activity runs at high speed inside Hyper's own ecosystem using wrapped BTC, while periodic state commitments are anchored to Bitcoin Layer-1 for integrity. 

Whenever users want their BTC back, they simply burn the wrapped version on Hyper to unlock the original coins on the base chain. This makes Bitcoin Hyper faster and more flexible, while still tied to Bitcoin's trust layer.

In practice, this means developers and users can interact in an environment that feels like Solana – quick, cheap, and highly scalable – while knowing Bitcoin remains the settlement anchor. 

It also no longer traps Bitcoin's liquidity in passive storage but actively circulates across DeFi, payments, gaming, and other apps on Hyper. 

The end result is a system where Bitcoin doesn't just sit in treasuries or cold wallets; it becomes the fuel for a broader digital economy.

All of these factors explain why Bitcoin Hyper is now closing in on $15 million in presale funding.

Many investors see HYPER, the token that powers gas fees, staking, and governance across the ecosystem, as a second chance at the kind of early returns they missed with BTC – precisely because of how closely the two assets are linked within this ecosystem.

If you want that shot at HYPER's potential upside, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website. Tokens can be purchased using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.

For a seamless experience, Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet, one of the best crypto wallets available. HYPER is listed under Upcoming Tokens, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

Dogecoin rallied sharply during the September 9–10 session, reclaiming the $0.24–$0.25 range with volume surging above 1.5 billion tokens. The move comes as REX-Osprey prepares to debut the first U.S. Dogecoin ETF on September 11 under the ticker “DOJE.” Technical traders flagged a bullish pennant breakout pattern, while large-scale whale accumulation added to growing confidence that institutional demand is building around the launch.

• REX-Osprey DOGE ETF is scheduled to begin trading September 11, making it the first U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking a memecoin with no declared utility.• Whale addresses accumulated roughly 280 million DOGE in the past week, indicating strong institutional-sized flows.• Technical analysts highlight a pennant breakout with upside targets of $0.28–$0.30 if the $0.25 level is held.• ETF speculation has driven retail and social media enthusiasm, with DOGE trending heavily on prediction markets and derivatives desks.

• DOGE advanced 4% during the September 9 13:00–September 10 12:00 session, moving from $0.236 to a peak of $0.245.• Early decline saw DOGE drop from $0.247 to $0.236 by 14:00, backed by massive 1.55B volume that set a strong floor.• Price consolidated within $0.238–$0.242 through most of the day, suggesting strategic accumulation.• Final hour breakout lifted DOGE from $0.240 to $0.245, underpinned by 114.7M volume at the peak.• Session closed at $0.244, just shy of resistance, confirming bullish momentum into ETF launch week.

• Support: $0.236–$0.238 range validated by repeated high-volume rebounds.• Resistance: $0.245–$0.247 remains the key ceiling; break above could target $0.28.• Volume: Session highs of 1.55B and late-hour 114.7M significantly exceeded 24-hour average of 334M.• Structure: Pennant breakout confirmed by higher lows and accelerating final-hour volumes.• Indicators: RSI hovering mid-60s suggests room for further upside before overbought conditions emerge.

• Whether DOGE can sustain closes above $0.245 and set up a push toward $0.28.• ETF launch on September 11, expected to be a structural liquidity event for DOGE.• Whale accumulation trends — continued inflows would validate institutional conviction.• Derivatives positioning as ETF hype builds, with potential for heightened volatility around launch.• Broader crypto market sentiment tied to Federal Reserve policy decisions later in the month.

Solana has been a recent outperformer among major cryptos — ahead 24% over the past month — but that could just be precursor to an epic end of year run, writes Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan.

"For the last 18 months, the recipe for strong returns in crypto has been clear," said Hougan. "Take one part ETP inflows, add strong corporate treasury purchases, and voilà — you get big returns."

Hougan reminded that "recipe" sent bitcoin from $40,000 to its current level and ether more than tripling, and the same setup is forming around SOL.

Seven major asset managers — including Bitwise itself, alongside Grayscale, Fidelity, and VanEck — have filed to launch spot Solana ETPs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is due to rule on them by October 10. If even a few are approved, retail and institutional investors could soon be buying SOL the same way they would a stock.

That's not the only tailwind, said Hougan. This past weekend, a previously quiet publicly traded microcap, Forward Industries (FORD), announced it had raised $1.65 billion from crypto investment heavyweights Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. 

The company's playbook is simple: buy SOL, stake it, and generate yield — turning solana itself into a revenue-generating asset on a public balance sheet. At the helm is Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin and one of Solana's earliest champions.

Hougan likens Samani to the Michael Saylor of Bitcoin or Tom Lee of Ethereum — visible, vocal, and capable of turning a technical narrative into a mainstream headline. Still, Solana has to earn the attention.

Its pitch is speed. Unlike Ethereum, which uses additional layers to scale, Solana runs everything on one chain. A new upgrade — soon to go live — will shrink transaction finality time from 12 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Transaction fees remain under a cent.

Those gains do come with tradeoffs, Hougan allowed. Solana's critics argue that its structure is more centralized than other blockchains, potentially leaving it exposed to network failures. Supporters counter that it's the only chain fast and cheap enough to support high-volume use cases — like tokenized assets or stablecoins — at a global scale.

And growth is happening. Solana is now third in stablecoin liquidity and fourth in tokenized assets, with asset volume up 140% this year, said Hougan.

Then there's its size. With a market cap of $116 billion, Solana is still a small fish compared to Bitcoin's $2.2 trillion or Ethereum's $519 billion. That means smaller inflows can move the needle in bigger ways. According to Hougan, Forward Industries' $1.65 billion could have the same impact on SOL as a $33 billion investment would on BTC.

That's why he's watching closely. “My suggestion?” Hougan wrote. “Keep your eye on Solana.”

Key Takeaways:

South Korea's biggest crypto exchange, Upbit, is preparing to step into blockchain development with a mysterious new project called “Giwa.” The teaser has triggered intense speculation in the crypto community, with full details set to emerge at the Upbit Developer Conference (UDC).

Upbit quietly launched a Giwa teaser website featuring a live countdown and the tagline “trusted structure, not just shape.” While sparse on details, the site links directly to UDC, where industry watchers expect a formal presentation.

The move signals Upbit's push to go beyond its role as South Korea's largest exchange – one that often moves markets with its token listings and build infrastructure at the protocol level.

So far, Upbit has not confirmed whether Giwa will be a Layer-1 (L1) blockchain or a Layer-2 (L2) scaling network. However, early hints and regulatory factors suggest an L2 design is more likely.



Analysts consider that Giwa may form a stablecoin liquidity platform of South Korea. The purpose of the won-pegged digital assets has been growing in demand, driven by retail usage and institutional interest in regulated Web3 rails.

Should Giwa offer a safe and interoperable system to issue and redeem stablecoins, it would transform the place of South Korea in the crypto liquidity of the region. This would also be in line with the global trends, of exchanges having their own proprietary blockchain, to manage their liquidity and user interaction.

The entry is timed with the increasing pace of crypto adoption in South Korea which has high trading volumes and retail-based markets. Already, exchanges such as Upbit command a lot of power – token listings often result in dramatic price changes.

By introducing its own blockchain, Upbit could:

This strategy mirrors moves by Binance (BNB Chain) and Coinbase (Base L2), both of which leveraged blockchain launches to expand beyond trading.

South Korea is very strict in regards to crypto platforms. Regulatory requirements could make regulating at the L2 structure rather than a complete L1 blockchain, and thus Giwa will be easier to integrate into existing infrastructure.

An L2 solution would similarly make Giwa an Ethereum-scaling solution or a comparable base chain, with the advantage of security but with more affordable and quicker transactions.

It will be important to the observers that interoperability will be central. To be successful, Giwa should not only appeal to the Korean users, but also need to integrate itself with the international liquidity pools.

The Giwa teaser, in spite of the little information available, has become a source of intense discussions in the crypto forums and social media. A large number of traders are optimistic about the blockchain of Upbit establishing new liquidity lines, and possibly affecting the prices of tokens in the exchange.

Crypto observers equate this expectation to the hype of Base, the L2 by Coinbase introduced in 2023 that rapidly emerged as a significant point of liquidity. Provided that Upbit adopts the same approach, Giwa will potentially become one of the key drivers of the future of Web3 in South Korea.

Everybody now looks forward to the Upbit Developer Conference, where Giwa design, technical features, and ecosystem roadmap will most probably be announced. To that point, speculation persists, with ideas of both stablecoin-centric infrastructure and a wider Korean crypto hub.

Whatever form it takes, Giwa represents one of the most significant blockchain developments in South Korea's digital asset market this year.

When MEI Pharma announced it was considering its “strategic alternatives” in the wake of a failed merger last year, the options seemed pretty mundane. But, rather than winding down the company as the biotech had suggested, MEI has delved into the world of digital currency.

From now on, MEI Pharma—previously best known for its investigational leukemia drug—will be called Lite Strategy. The rebrand reflects the company's move last month to secure more than $100 million in a cryptocurrency called Litecoin, while becoming the first U.S.-listed public company to adopt Litecoin for its corporate treasury.





Lite Strategy will continue to list on the Nasdaq, although its ticker is changing from "MEIP" to "LITS" as of Sept. 11. This marks a move to “expand its business model beyond its portfolio of drug candidates to focus on pioneering institutional-grade digital asset treasury strategies, in partnership with leading innovators across blockchain, finance, and technology.”









“Litecoin has proven itself for over a decade as one of the most secure, reliable, and scalable digital assets in the world,” said Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin who has now joined Lite Strategy's board. “This rebrand and treasury strategy are important milestones that demonstrate how Litecoin can serve as a cornerstone for a strategy built with a digital asset infrastructure.”

The rebranded company hasn't completely forgotten its biotech roots, however. In the same release, Lite Strategy said it “continues to evaluate its pipeline of drug candidates.” This includes drawing up a preclinical strategy for both the oral CDK9 inhibitor voruciclib and the PI3Kδ inhibitor zandelisib.





MEI's story appeared to come to an end in July 2024 after a planned merger with Infinity Pharma was scuppered after investors made their own bid and MEI's shareholders ultimately voted against the transaction. It led MEI to plan a reduction in force “as soon as practicable” and discontinue all clinical activities related to voruciclib, which had been in development for acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell malignancies.

That restructure also saw CEO David Urso and Chief Medical Officer Richard Ghalie, M.D., depart the company, with Chief Financial Officer Justin File moving up to acting CEO, a position he still holds.

In this morning's release, File said the rebranded company's “forward-looking approach … creates a powerful model for how public companies can incorporate Litecoin into treasury operations in a way that is both innovative and accessible to traditional investors.”

It's not the first time a biotech has dabbled in cryptocurrencies. A number of drug developers have announced plans to create stockpiles of bitcoin over the past year, spurred on by the Trump administration's enthusiasm for the decentralized digital currency.

 The SEC's Paul Atkins commented on Project Crypto, proposing one regulatory framework for trading, lending and staking digital assets. 

US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins said that “most crypto tokens are not securities,” while outlining a sweeping plan to integrate crypto activities like trading, lending and staking under a unified regulatory framework. 

“It is a new day at the SEC,” Atkins said during a keynote address at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Roundtable in Paris on Wednesday. 

“Policy will no longer be set by ad hoc enforcement actions,” he added, contrasting the previous administration's aggressive crackdown on crypto firms. “We will provide clear, predictable rules of the road so that innovators can thrive in the United States,” Atkins said.

Under the Project Crypto initiative, the SEC aims to modernize its securities regulations to accommodate blockchain-based financial markets. According to Atkins, the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has already delivered a “bold blueprint” to support this mission.

The SEC's updated strategy includes allowing platforms to operate as “super-apps” that can facilitate trading, lending and staking of digital assets under one regulatory umbrella. Atkins said that these platforms should also have the flexibility to offer multiple custody solutions.

“I believe regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation needed to protect investors, and no more,” Atkins stated. “We should not overburden entrepreneurs with duplicative rules that only the largest incumbents can bear.”

Atkins also praised the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, saying it provides “a comprehensive digital assets regime” and noted that US policymakers could learn from Europe's early regulatory steps.

The SEC chief called for international cooperation to “facilitate more innovative markets.” “Working together, as Alexandre de Tocqueville might have put it, we can ‘extend the sphere' of freedom and prosperity,” he concluded.

Last month, the European Banking Authority (EBA) finalized rules that will require EU-based banks to hold significantly more capital against unbacked cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). These draft regulatory standards are now pending review by the European Commission.

Under the proposed framework, unbacked digital assets such as Bitcoin fall into “Group 2b” and carry a hefty 1,250% risk weight, meaning banks must set aside a substantial capital buffer. 

The EBA's conservative approach contrasts with moves in other jurisdictions. In the US, the FDIC now allows supervised banks to engage in crypto activities without prior approval, while Switzerland has updated its DLT laws to support crypto custody and stablecoin guarantees.

 EIP-7943 author Dario Lo Buglio told Cointelegraph that the standard's goal is to solve industry fragmentation with standardized functions for compliance. 

A coalition of Web3 companies has introduced a new Ethereum token standard designed to streamline compliance and reduce fragmentation in the growing real-world asset (RWA) sector.

According to an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, the standard, ERC-7943, creates a minimal, modular interface designed to work across Ethereum layer-2s and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, while remaining agnostic to implementation and vendor-specific infrastructure. This means it can work in any setup and isn't locked into any specific company's tools. 

Dario Lo Buglio, the co-founder of Brickken and the author of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7943, told Cointelegraph that the new standard acts as a “universal layer” that sits on top of any token type. This allows developers and institutions to avoid having to use wrappers and custom bridges while integrating tokenized assets into apps. 

ERC-7943 is backed by a coalition of Web3 and fintech firms, including Bit2Me, Brickken, Compellio, Dekalabs, DigiShares, Hacken, Forte Protocol, FullyTokenized, RealEstate.Exchange, Stobox and Zoth.

According to Lo Buglio, EIP-7943 is a direct response to developer frustration and a “perfect storm of institutional interest.”

Data from the RWA tracker RWA.xyz shows that the total value of tokenized RWAs onchain has reached $28.44 billion, up nearly 6% in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, stablecoins' total stablecoin value and total asset holders are up nearly 7% and 9%, respectively. 

The growth of RWAs shows that institutions are currently adopting RWAs at scale, with issuers competing for market share. Lo Buglio said this highlights the need for a new token standard that addresses the needs of developers and financial institutions alike. 

“Financial institutions want programmable controls that match their compliance frameworks. Developers, on the other hand, are stuck rewriting custom logic for every RWA token,” Lo Buglio told Cointelegraph. “We needed a common foundation.”

Lo Buglio told Cointelegraph that the standard entered the review stage of the EIP process and has already received feedback from compliance professionals and other token standard authors. 

“The EIP still stands on the review stage, which is where the main feedback will be proposed and incorporated.”

Earlier efforts to standardize RWA tokenization on Ethereum include ERC-1400 and ERC-3643. ERC-1400 introduced a hybrid model blending features of fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with built-in compliance tools.

ERC-3643 focused on regulated assets like securities, integrating onchain identity and permission layers to enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. 

Lo Buglio said ERC-1400 aims to focus on separating logic from storage and said that ERC-3643 is strong for securities, but it's tightly coupled to its own identity and permissioning stack. Unlike these solutions, he said, it differentiates itself by being a minimal, implementation-agnostic interface.

“EIP-7943 defines only what must exist — not how it's built — so any project or protocol can slot it into their stack without friction,” Lo Buglio told Cointelegraph. 

“Its primary goal is to solve the problem of industry fragmentation by providing a single, standardized set of functions for compliance.”

An analyst claims XRP could hit $300 if Ethereum reaches $25,000, but the math shows this is very unrealistic.

Every bull market produces far-fetched predictions, but this one might be among the most extreme. An anonymous analyst known as Whale Guru says XRP (XRP-USD) could soar to $300 if Ethereum (ETH-USD) reaches $25,000 in the next big pump. On paper, the numbers look astronomical. In practice, they look nearly impossible.





Ethereum trades near $4,300 today. To climb to $25,000, it would need a 481% rally. That type of gain sounds wild, but it isn't unheard of in crypto cycles. Standard Chartered has floated a similar long-term target, though the bank does not expect it to materialize until 2028, possibly during the next bull run.

If Ethereum ever does break into five-digit territory, it could lift the broader altcoin market along with it. Historically, when ETH makes large moves, liquidity often spills over into other major tokens, and that can fuel rallies across the board. This is the logic behind Whale Guru's prediction, where Ethereum's strength acts as a catalyst that could lift XRP dramatically higher.

Whale Guru believes that if Ethereum hits $25,000, XRP could surge from its current $2.95 price to $300. That would represent a 101-fold move, equal to more than 10,000% upside. It would also make the XRP/ETH pair explode higher, creating the appearance that XRP had vastly outperformed Ethereum itself.

These kinds of numbers sound exciting to holders who have been waiting years for XRP to repeat its 2017-style rally. However, the leap from under $3 to $300 is so steep that it demands scrutiny. Even in crypto, where extreme price swings are possible, this scale of growth would defy not just past performance but the basic structure of the market.

This is where math collides with market reality. XRP has a circulating supply of 59.61 billion tokens. At $300 each, its market capitalization would balloon to $17.8 trillion. To put that in perspective, that would make XRP more valuable than Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) combined. No asset in financial history has ever commanded that type of valuation in such a short time frame.

Beyond the sheer numbers, XRP faces other hurdles. Liquidity constraints limit how easily the token can absorb such massive flows, since much of its supply is locked in escrow or concentrated in large wallets. Adoption also lags behind Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD), with the XRP Ledger trailing in developer activity, DeFi traction, and tokenization projects. Even though Ripple's battle with the SEC is over, regulatory clarity is still uneven worldwide, and banks remain cautious about using XRP at scale. Finally, history shows that XRP has struggled to sustain even its biggest rallies. In 2017, it topped out at $3.65. Repeating that rally more than 80 times over to reach $300 is an almost impossible stretch.

Some analysts argue that $300 is theoretically possible, but not in this decade. Changelly, for example, models a $300 price for XRP by 2040. This timeline stretches fifteen years into the future and assumes sustained adoption of XRP Ledger technology, wider institutional partnerships, and broader recognition of its role in payments.

The crypto market does have a history of surprising even the most experienced traders, which is why predictions like this grab attention. Still, the distance between a 2040 forecast and Whale Guru's implied “next pump” highlights how difficult it is to bridge the gap between excitement and execution. For now, the $300 number belongs more in the realm of speculation than serious analysis.

Whale Guru's optimism was not limited to XRP. He also predicted Solana could rally to $2,000, Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) could finally breach the $1 mark and eventually reach $5, and Sui (SUI-USD) could climb to $10. These numbers reflect the highly speculative nature of altcoin predictions, where imagination often runs ahead of fundamentals.

The forecasts also serve as a reminder that one analyst's vision can move sentiment, but not necessarily markets. Each of these targets would require not just favorable technical setups but also unprecedented inflows of capital, adoption breakthroughs, and regulatory clarity across multiple regions. Without that, the gap between prediction and reality will remain wide.

Investors should treat this prediction as a thought experiment rather than a roadmap, keeping in mind the scale of the challenges involved.

At the time of writing, XRP is sitting at $2.9747.

Key Takeaways

Collecting has always conjured up vivid images.

Boxes of action figures still in their packaging, lined up neatly on shelves. Pages of baseball cards in plastic sleeves. Crates of records sitting beside the stereo. A stash of old coins tucked away in a closet.

But behind those nostalgic scenes are items that cost a fortune, endless searches through dusty shops and eBay listings, and excess packaging that comes with every delivery.

And for many fans outside major markets, geographical restrictions add insult to injury.

As someone who grew up collecting in New Zealand, I knew how hard it was to access the same collectible culture that seemed so normal in the U.S. Finding and affording physical collectibles was nearly impossible.

Collecting has been part of human culture for millennia, and the global collectibles market is expected to reach $512 billion  this year.

And yet, despite its longevity and value, the industry hasn't evolved in a way that solves these persistent problems of access, waste, shipping, and scalability.

With the increasing pressure on companies and countries to be more climate-conscious and the ever-changing politics of global trade, physical collecting is beginning to show its cracks.

By moving collectibles onto secure, transparent, and public ledgers, we can make rare, meaningful fan items accessible to anyone, anywhere, with full authenticity and zero waste.

In 2017, we saw the official birth of NFTs. At the time, it seemed like this was a way to bring collecting online.

But I believe NFTs created a kind of bubble, one which only those who understood the technology and its purpose could access. This bubble appeared parallel to cryptocurrency, where both were, for a time, viewed by their small group of investors as money-making schemes.

In 2025, that bubble has popped, and what's left is the foundation of something more meaningful.

Just as cryptocurrencies have matured, NFTs are maturing too. We've seen the financial world evolve around blockchain through ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenised assets.

Institutions now see crypto as a viable part of the modern financial system.

Digital collectibles are the cultural counterpart to that financial evolution.

They're the sustained advancement of what NFTs originally set out to do. To use blockchain to verify ownership and authenticity in a digital world.

Yes, they're backed by blockchain. Yes, they exist in the digital realm. But unlike the speculative hype of early NFTs, digital collectibles are rooted in fandom, not finance.

They're about making collecting smarter, more accessible, and better aligned with how people actually engage with their favourite characters, games, or stories.

The connection between collecting and blockchain is natural. Collecting is about rarity, status, and authenticity – exact traits that blockchain technology was purpose-built to verify and protect.

Digital collectibles use that tech to expand collecting opportunities for fans, who are already the same people who would buy a comic book or go to HobbyTown, or the antique store looking for stamps.

Thanks to AR and VR, digital items can have more depth and creativity than physical-factory manufacturing allows. Designs aren't limited by production costs or shipping constraints. Instead, artists and creators can build immersive, detailed pieces with features impossible to replicate physically.

The metaverse also offers something meaningful here. In digital spaces, fans can connect regardless of where they live.

It's a new version of standing in line outside the comic store at 7am to get the limited drop, except now, anyone in the world can line up, and the rarity is guaranteed on-chain.

Physical collecting also comes with real-world costs. Plastic packaging, emissions from global shipping, warehousing, and overproduction.

Digital collecting avoids all of that. And with modern blockchains moving toward carbon neutrality, digital merchandise becomes a more sustainable, ethical choice.

Meanwhile, tariffs, material shortages, and inflation are adding to this physical accessibility issue. In the U.S. and elsewhere, fans and IPs alike are raising concerns about quality, affordability, and supply chain reliability.

Digital solves for that. There's no waiting, no shipping fees, and no risk of bent corners or customs delays.

This is how we future-proof collecting.

Of course, blockchain and crypto still have an aura of complexity. That's why digital collectibles can be a perfect on-ramp.

When fans download an app that lets them buy officially licensed collectibles or the comics they already love – and that just happens to use blockchain under the hood – they're stepping into this world organically.

It's the same principle that made ETFs an accessible entry point into investing. Digital collectibles can do that for blockchain.

Millions are already being onboarded this way. We're seeing a popular response from our community to “phygital” drops – digital items paired with physical ones, and publishers moving into licensed digital comics that retain the same rarity and fan value as their print counterparts.

These are clear examples of blockchain that keep the soul of collecting intact. You still get that sense of ownership, of discovery, of being able to own something others might not have. But now it's easier, greener, and finally global.

The digital collectibles market is forecast to grow from about USD$11 billion  today to more than $48 billion by 2033. People love collecting. They always have. Blockchain just gives us a better way to do it.

The crypto market may appear tethered to Bitcoin's dominance, but several altcoins are breaking away with explosive momentum.

Recent data from CoinMarketCap's trend-tracking algorithm highlights three standout tokens: MYX Finance, Worldcoin, and KAITO. Each tells a very different story, ranging from speculative mania to institutional validation and niche innovation.

MYX Finance has been the week's headline maker, soaring nearly 300% in a single day and more than 1,400% over the past week. The rally is fueled by excitement around its upcoming V2 launch, promising zero-slippage trading and broader cross-chain support. Adding to the hype, Binance Alpha confirmed a listing, pushing trading volumes up over 4,000% to $850 million. Yet the spectacular rise comes with red flags – thin liquidity and $14 million in short liquidations suggest the move is highly speculative. Traders will be watching closely to see if activity holds above half a billion dollars once the upgrade is live.



Worldcoin's resurgence looks less like hype and more like validation. A $250 million treasury allocation by Eightco and a $20 million investment from BitMine have shifted sentiment around the project. On the technical side, Worldcoin has escaped a 1.5-year downtrend, confirming a bullish reversal. With more than 26 million users, the project now faces the challenge of turning adoption into consistent growth while regulators scrutinize its biometric data model. As long as support around $1.40 remains intact, traders see room for continuation.



KAITO is emerging as the poster child of a new trend dubbed “InfoFi,” which tokenizes access to crypto analytics. The token surged over 37% as whales staked millions on its platform and the project integrated with the BASE chain.



Its modest $334 million market cap leaves room for outsized gains, especially if partnerships materialize. Early listings, including on Niza.io, have added liquidity, but sustaining that volume will be key to keeping momentum alive.

While MYX thrives on speculative frenzy, Worldcoin and KAITO reflect deeper shifts—one through institutional confidence and the other through niche utility. The bigger question is whether these assets can break free from Bitcoin's gravitational pull. With Bitcoin dominance still at 57% and the Altcoin Season Index climbing toward 60, the market may be preparing for a broader rotation. If Ethereum can sustain its momentum, these altcoins could mark the beginning of a more defined altcoin cycle.







Grayscale is expanding its exchange-traded product lineup, filing fresh applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot ETFs tied to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC).

Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as traders point to historical patterns and on-chain signals that suggest a major rally could be brewing.

Cboe Global Markets has unveiled plans to roll out Continuous futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether on its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) starting November 10, 2025, pending regulatory approval.

A closely watched technical setup is emerging across the altcoin market, and traders believe it could signal the start of a powerful new rally.

As November draws near, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about which digital coins could deliver astronomical returns.

Many cryptocurrencies with real promise are stumbling over new regulations. Yet, an unexpected player in the meme coin arena might break through these barriers.

Altcoin Vector has outlined the conditions for a potential altseason, noting that while the framework is forming, the final confirmation has yet to arrive.

A bipartisan push on Capitol Hill is giving America's biggest merchants a new reason to dabble in blockchain.

Amazon shareholders are gearing up for a pivotal decision at their annual meeting next year: whether the company should explore incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) into its corporate treasury.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to rise, fueled by developments such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and the return of pro-crypto policies under Donald Trump's leadership.

Amazon briefly sparked political controversy after exploring the idea of showing shoppers how tariffs are impacting product prices—a move that quickly drew fire from President Trump's team.

A U.S. city is raising alarms about the negative impact of a nearby Bitcoin mining operation.

Following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, shares of Trump Media (DJT) surged approximately 70% in premarket trading on the first trading day following the incident.

Worksport, a US-based manufacturer, is making strides into the cryptocurrency space by incorporating Bitcoin and XRP into its corporate treasury strategy.

A pastor from Washington state, Francier Obando Pinillo, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding over 1,500 people through a cryptocurrency scheme called Solano Fi.

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) has introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act, a landmark bill that seeks to modernize federal home loan underwriting by including digital assets in mortgage eligibility assessments.

An american has been sentenced to over seven years in prison for his involvement in a large-scale drug trafficking operation that relied on cryptocurrency for payments and money laundering.

Connecticut has officially distanced itself from government adoption of digital assets like Bitcoin. On June 30, Governor Ned Lamont signed House Bill 7082 into law, placing sweeping restrictions on how the state and its agencies can engage with cryptocurrencies.

The University of Wyoming has unveiled the UW Bitcoin Research Institute, the first academic center dedicated to Bitcoin studies, with Dr. Bradley Rettler, an Associate Professor of Philosophy, appointed as its first director.

A U.S. woman recently became the victim of a major cryptocurrency scam, losing millions of dollars after falling for a well-crafted deception.

A new nationwide survey has revealed a surprising shift in American attitudes toward monetary policy and national assets: a majority now favor adding Bitcoin to the country's reserve holdings.

TL;DR

-  The market sentiment around Stellar (XLM) had been bearish to start off July.
-  However, Stellar (XLM) is up 12% in the past 24 hours, continuing a positive 14% trend in the past week.
-  Despite the upward trend, the smart money is instead focusing on low-cap gems with greater upside potential such as Clandeno (CLD).
-  Clandeno (CLD) is a decentralized P2P e-commerce platform unlocking blockchain-based secure transactions between buyers and sellers. Its unique value proposition is drawing massive investment as it kicks off its ICO with high expectations.

Bitcoin's surge to new all-time highs is playing out differently than previous rallies, according to a July 11 report by crypto research and investment firm Matrixport.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Crypto staking platform Kiln said it is initiating an "orderly exit" of all its Ethereum validators following Monday's exploit targeting SwissBorg, which caused at least $40 million in losses on Solana.

The incident stemmed from hackers exploiting a vulnerability in an API provided by Kiln, SwissBorg's staking partner, which allowed unauthorized access to wallets used in their Solana Earn program. But the platform has pledged full reimbursement from its treasury and confirmed that core user funds remain secure.

In response, Kiln initiated an orderly exit from all of its Ethereum validator nodes on September 10, 2025, as a precautionary measure to protect customer assets amid the ongoing investigation into the incident. The process is expected to take 10–42 days, during which staking rewards will continue to accrue, and withdrawals may take up to 9 days.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Paris-based Kiln said that no additional funds have been compromised beyond those tied to the SwissBorg case, and that the exit process is a "precautionary measure designed to ensure the continued integrity of the staked assets."

"Client assets remain secure," Kiln said, adding that the exit process is expected to take between 10 and 42 days, depending on the validator. Withdrawals, once initiated, may take up to nine days to process. "Validators still earn rewards while exiting," the team added.

Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT said Monday that SwissBorg lost about 192,600 SOL, worth roughly $41.3 million, due to the security breach.

Laszlo Szabo, co-founder and CEO of Kiln, said the company acted immediately after identifying a potential compromise in its infrastructure. "Exiting validators is the responsible step to protect stakers, and we are monitoring the process closely to ensure the security and reliability of our services," said Szabo.

Kiln has also temporarily suspended access to certain services while strengthening its infrastructure security. The company said it plans to publish a post-mortem once the review is complete.

SwissBorg said it intends to tap its Solana treasury to help users recover a substantial share of their balances, with final amounts to be determined soon. It added that it has engaged white-hat hackers and security partners in an effort to recover the stolen funds.

Some of the biggest gainers today as HASH, IP, and PUMP.

Bitcoin's price took a sharp turn for the worse yesterday when it was rejected at $113,000 and pushed south by over two grand. However, the bulls are making a return as of press time.

Most of the larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, but many of the mid and lower caps are exploding.

The primary cryptocurrency has endured enhanced selling pressure around the $113,000 mark for the past several days. Recall that the asset surged to and just over that level last Friday, after the release of the latest US jobs report. However, it was rejected immediately and driven south by over three grand in less than an hour.

After a few days of consolidating around the $110,500 level, the bulls went on the offensive once again on Monday and especially on Tuesday, pushing bitcoin to $113,200. The scenario repeated once again, as the bears reemerged and didn't allow a breakout.

In the following hours, the digital asset dropped to $110,800 (on Bitstamp) before the bulls came back to play. They initiated another leg up on Wednesday morning, which drove BTC to almost $113,000 as of press time.

Did you like this market update? This is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets. Start receiving this recap, for free, every day:

Its market cap has slipped to just under $2.250 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts sits at 56.1%.

As mentioned above, most of the larger-cap alts have failed to produce any big moves in the past 24 hours. ETH, XRP, ADA, LINK, SUI, and XLM are slightly in the red, while SOL, DOGE, HYPE, TRX, and AVAX are with minor gains.

The situation down the board is much different. HASH has taken the spotlight today with a 33% surge to over $0.037. IP (21%), PUMP (14%), and MNT (12.5%) complete the double-digit price gainers club.

The total crypto market cap has remained at essentially the same level as yesterday at around $4 trillion on CG.

Tinubu, speaking through the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, at the 18th Annual Banking and Finance Conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) in Abuja on Tuesday, said the speed at which Nigerians are embracing cryptocurrencies and other digital payment systems outside the traditional banking sector has become a matter of concern. 

President Bola Tinubu has directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other regulatory agencies to step up surveillance of cryptocurrency and digital payment transactions in the country.

Tinubu, speaking through the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, at the 18th Annual Banking and Finance Conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) in Abuja on Tuesday, said the speed at which Nigerians are embracing cryptocurrencies and other digital payment systems outside the traditional banking sector has become a matter of concern. 

“There is a digital revolution. Many people now make payments without using the banking system. They've turned to stablecoins and digital currencies.

“To this end, I have directed capital market and banking authorities to get hold of this narrative and track it while it is still evolving,” he said

He argued that digital tools, artificial intelligence, and open banking were no longer futuristic ideas but unavoidable realities Nigeria must embrace if its economy is to grow.

For his part, Central Bank Governor, Olayemi Cardoso, boasted that diaspora remittances could rise to as much as $1billion every month by next year.

“When we began this journey, remittances were at $250 million a month. We targeted $500 million, and today we are at $600 million. By next year, our projection is $1billion a month,” Cardoso said. 

Also speaking at the conference was President and Chairman of the Council of CIBN, Prof Pius Olanrewaju.

“Since 2024, 16 listed banks have raised more than N2.5 trillion in fresh capital to strengthen their balance sheets.

“Net domestic credit to the private sector has risen to over N82 trillion this year, supporting businesses and job creation,” Olanrewaju said.

In February, the Nigerian Government filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange company Binance Holdings Limited, seeking $79.51billion and ₦231million in damages for alleged economic losses caused by its operations in the country. 

The Federal Inland Revenue Service, in a charge marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1444/2024, is also demanding $2.001 billion in income taxes for 2022 and 2023.

Binance and its executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, were accused of violating Nigerian laws, including failure to register with the FIRS for tax compliance. 

This lawsuit was the third currently before the Federal High Court in Abuja against Binance. 

The FIRS and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission were also charged the company with tax evasion, money laundering, and foreign exchange violations before Justice Emeka Nwite.

The lawsuit included penalties for non-payment of taxes, interest rates based on the Central Bank of Nigeria's lending rate, and other financial sanctions. 

The FIRS alleges that Binance concealed its business activities despite having a significant economic presence in Nigeria.

The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with new projects and established altcoins competing for attention.

Many investors today are exploring presale crypto opportunities as well as long-standing altcoins to diversify their portfolios.

Presale cryptocurrency projects often gain traction by offering early access at discounted entry points. They can provide not only speculative value but also innovative ideas shaping the next generation of Web3. At the same time, established altcoins like Cardano and Avalanche continue to anchor the market with strong ecosystems.

In this article, we look at one of the top crypto presales, Based Eggman ($GGs), and compare it with leading altcoins such as Cardano and Avalanche.

Based Eggman is currently positioning itself as one of the top crypto presales on the market. The project combines gaming, streaming, and meme culture to create a Web3 ecosystem powered by the $GGs token. For many in the crypto community, it has become a talking point within the broader crypto presale list due to its mix of entertainment and utility.

At the time of writing, the presale has raised 38,490.2 USDT with 4,879,164.2 $GGs tokens sold at a price of $0.006389 per token. These figures highlight growing demand among participants in token presales.

What makes Based Eggman stand out is its approach to onboarding. Instead of forcing users through complex wallet setups, the project integrates simple logins and instant wallets. This allows newcomers to enter Web3 crypto presales more easily while still giving them access to advanced features later.

Key aspects of $GGs include:

The platform solves the common barrier of accessibility by connecting games, streams, and trading into one ecosystem.

With presale crypto tokens like $GGs, the emphasis is not only on speculation but also on building an experience that blends culture and blockchain functionality.



Cardano remains one of the most notable altcoins in the crypto market. Its reputation for research-driven development has made it a steady feature on nearly every crypto presale list and altcoin comparison.

While not a presale coin, ADA continues to attract attention because of its consistent focus on academic rigor and peer-reviewed upgrades.

Recent developments such as Hydra scaling solutions and smart contract improvements have strengthened Cardano's infrastructure. These updates provide greater efficiency and prepare the network for larger-scale adoption, which remains crucial as more applications seek secure and scalable blockchains.

Despite these advancements, Cardano's price performance has been relatively quiet. Unlike presale crypto tokens that can deliver fast-paced gains, ADA has moved cautiously. This slower pace has raised questions among traders about whether ADA's future growth will be gradual or transformative.

The possibility of a Cardano-based ETF has added a new dimension to the conversation. Such an approval could create pathways for institutional investors, but regulatory hurdles remain.

For now, Cardano continues to emphasize reliability and long-term sustainability, making it a different kind of option compared to fast-moving presale crypto projects.



Avalanche earned recognition during the bull markets of 2021 and 2023 when its transaction speeds and cost efficiency attracted both developers and traders. AVAX quickly climbed from under five dollars in 2020 to a peak above $140, rewarding early participants with massive gains.

Today, AVAX trades near $25 with a market capitalization exceeding $13 billion. It continues to rank as one of the most important players in DeFi and smart contract adoption. Its technology supports thousands of transactions per second, keeping it relevant within lists of crypto presale projects and altcoin discussions.

However, repeating its earlier growth trajectory is difficult. For Avalanche to reach Ethereum-level valuations, its market cap would need to rise beyond $150 billion.

While the protocol still delivers impressive performance, it may now be viewed more as a stable altcoin than a high-risk, high-reward opportunity often associated with new crypto token presales.



The cryptocurrency space offers different opportunities depending on risk tolerance and goals. On one side, presale crypto tokens like Based Eggman ($GGs) are reshaping engagement by merging gaming, streaming, and trading into one cultural ecosystem.

These types of new crypto presales often appeal to those seeking early exposure to emerging Web3 models.

On the other hand, established altcoins such as Cardano and Avalanche provide more stability and proven infrastructures. They may not match the rapid momentum of token presales, but their ecosystems play a key role in the broader blockchain landscape.

Whether through presale crypto coins or long-term altcoins, the market continues to show that innovation and resilience can coexist.

For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the different types of cryptocurrency presales and altcoins is essential for navigating the ever-changing digital economy.

Cancer development and response to treatment are evolutionary processes1,2, but characterizing evolutionary dynamics at a clinically meaningful scale has remained challenging3. Here we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based on natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time4, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that initial tumour growth rate, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe faster initial tumour growth in more aggressive disease subtypes, and that evolutionary histories are strong independent prognostic factors in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Using EVOFLUx for phylogenetic analyses of aggressive Richter-transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples detected that the seed of the transformed clone existed decades before presentation. Orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences is provided using additional genetic data, including long-read nanopore sequencing, and clinical variables. Collectively, we show how widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measure cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.

Cancer development is an evolutionary process1,2; consequently, the evolutionary history of a cancer may set its future trajectory and allow inference of the clinical path of a patient5. However, testing this hypothesis directly is challenging because longitudinal patient samples are required to document evolutionary history. Consequently, evolutionary histories are typically inferred from single timepoint data; for example, somatic (epi)mutations are patterned in distinctive ways by differing evolutionary dynamics3. In the haematological system, genome sequencing of single cells or single-cell colonies have been used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among cells6,7,8. The expense of this approach has restricted analyses to small numbers of cases, limiting suitability for clinical translation.

DNA methylation can serve as a lineage marker, recording the clonal architecture of cell populations9,10,11,12,13 or the proliferative history14,15. We have recently identified DNA methylation at some CpG sites, which stochastically fluctuates over time at a timescale measured in years4. These fluctuating CpGs (fCpGs) function as a ‘methylation barcode', providing a low-cost strategy to provide high temporal resolution lineage tracing in patient samples4. In this study, we constructed a quantitative modelling framework called evolutionary inference using fluctuating methylation (EVOFLUx). This framework enables precise quantitative inference of the evolutionary history of cancer cells from input fCpG data derived from clinical specimens, at scale (Fig. 1a).

Three scenarios are depicted: in a polyclonal population with a distant MRCA, diverse fCpG methylation (unmethylated in white, heterozygous in grey and methylated in black) results in a unimodal distribution of average methylation near the steady state (top). Following a recent clonal expansion (cell number 3 of the top panel), identical fCpG methylation across cells yields a characteristic ‘W-shape' in the bulk methylation distribution (middle). Post-bottleneck, ongoing fluctuations generate diverse fCpG methylation patterns, changing the distribution of bulk methylation values (bottom). c, A hierarchically clustered heatmap of the 978 fCpGs identified in lymphoid cells (n = 2,204 samples).

EVOFLUx works by considering the heterogeneity of fCpG methylation values within a sample. At a diploid locus, each fCpG can take one of three states: neither allele methylated, one allele methylated or both alleles methylated (0%, 50% or 100% methylated, respectively), so n fCpG sites can take 3n possible methylation patterns. fCpGs fluctuate methylation status independently, meaning that they function as an ‘evolving barcode' to track clonal evolution: two somatic cells with close ancestry will share a near-identical pattern of fCpG methylation, whereas distantly related cells will have divergent fCpG methylation patterns (Fig. 1b). In bulk populations of clonal somatic cells, the dominant fCpG pattern represents the fCpG state of the founder cell of the population. Therefore, the precise distribution of fCpG methylation is determined by the evolutionary history of the population, meaning that mathematical modelling can be used to recover the evolutionary history of a sample from input fCpG data.

Here we focused on lymphoid neoplasms, which cover a broad spectrum of diseases and subtypes with highly variable clinicobiological features, from highly proliferative acute disease to indolent chronic leukaemia, arising in infants to older adults, with tumour samples across disease stages16,17. These tumours have been extensively profiled by DNA methylation arrays, which have provided insights into their cellular origin, pathogenesis and clinical behaviour18. Although their temporal clonal dynamics has been partially analysed in few patients19,20, their precise evolutionary histories remain poorly characterized. Applying EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid malignancies, we precisely measured individual tumour evolutionary history and show that these histories are associated with disease outcome.

We assembled bulk Illumina methylation array data of normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells from 2,430 samples14,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 (Methods; Supplementary Tables 1–3). Following quality control, we retained 2,204 samples from 2,054 patients and 389,180 CpGs. As fCpG loci are tissue specific4, we constructed a pipeline to identify lymphoid-specific fCpGs (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 1a) using 1,471 samples from multiple lymphoid tumour entities (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). We identified 978 pan-lymphoid cancer fCpGs (Supplementary Table 4). Methylation at fCpGs shows a characteristic ‘speckled' pattern across cancers (Fig. 1c) because (de)methylation occurs independently in each tumour, in stark contrast to the orderly patterns observed for traditional methylation clocks or a random subset of CpGs (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). fCpGs did not cluster the samples by disease (Fig. 1c), and there was also no clustering based on disease subtype or array platform (Extended Data Fig. 1e–i), except for some B and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (B/T-ALLs) and multiple myeloma cases that exhibited global hypermethylation or hypomethylation, respectively, as previously reported14. This is consistent with fCpGs behaving as a stochastic ‘barcode' encoding lineage information. By comparison, methylation at CpGs excluded by our selection filters either did cluster by disease, had very low heterogeneity across samples or had unequal methylation and demethylation rates (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).

We then examined the methylation value distribution of these 978 fCpG in individual samples (Supplementary Table 5). In each cancer sample, the fCpGs followed a characteristic ‘W-shaped' distribution that depicts the fCpG methylation pattern of the founder cell of the cancer sample (Fig. 1d). By contrast, the healthy B cell subpopulations, which were not included in the discovery set, had unimodal distributions with intermediate methylation levels consistent with these being polyclonal populations (that is, average of the three methylation states; Fig. 1d).

Methylation values across fCpGs were uncorrelated, except for a small number of fCpGs located within 1 kb of another fCpG (74 of 978; Extended Data Fig. 2a). In whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data of sorted bulk B and T cell populations31, methylation at fCpG loci in these polyclonal normal samples was largely intermediate. Over a small window of 100 bp, as the distance from the fCpGs increased, an increasing fraction of the neighbouring CpGs were either hypermethylated or hypomethylated (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Together, these analyses suggest that the local 3D genome structure influences (de)methylation processes.

We sought to verify fCpGs as ‘evolving barcodes'. Analysis of fCpG methylation fluctuation over time confirmed that inter-patient fCpG heterogeneity was not caused by common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Methods; Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3). We generated long-read nanopore sequencing32 on normal B cells (n = 6) and matched chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)-Richter transformation samples (n = 2 pairs) to simultaneously detect genetic mutations and DNA methylation, and confirmed that fCpG methylation variation is not a consequence of underlying somatic mutation (Extended Data Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4). In matched data, fCpG methylation levels measured by bead array or long-read sequencing were highly concordant (Extended Data Fig. 2e), and similar excellent concordance was observed in additional WGBS data (Extended Data Fig. 2f). We constructed fCpG methylation haplotypes using long-read sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 2g) and additional single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing6, and detected lower intra-haplotype heterogeneity within CLL samples than normal B cell samples (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with the leukaemia being a clonal expansion, whereas normal B cells are polyclonal.

We utilized somatic copy number alterations in 492 CLL and 85 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) samples26,33 (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7) to distinguish between alleles and show the (de)methylation at fCpGs occurred independently on each allele (Extended Data Fig. 3a), despite copy number alterations being rare in our cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, fCpGs show independent ongoing allele-specific changes to methylation, uniquely labelling cell lineages.

As the DNA methylome is influenced by age34, we tested whether fCpGs showed evidence of age-dependent epigenetic modulation. In normal blood samples, mean fCpG methylation was not correlated with age, suggesting that fluctuations continue throughout life, whereas fCpG methylation variance increased with age (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Variance is higher in samples where there has been a recent clonal expansion (that is, homozygous methylated or unmethylated alleles become more prominent; Extended Data Fig. 3c), suggesting that fCpGs were detecting age-related clonal expansions of cells of the haematopoietic system4,35,36.

We analysed the genomic features of fCpG sites. fCpGs were enriched on the shores of CpG islands (Fig. 1e), underrepresented in gene-associated regions (Extended Data Fig. 3d) and, notably, were distinct from CpGs used in other epigenetic clocks (Extended Data Fig. 3e and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). At the chromatin level, fCpGs were enriched in normal and neoplastic B cell weak promoters and enhancers as well as H3K27me3-marked regions, and significantly underrepresented in active promoters and H3K36me3-marked regions (Fig. 1f). RNA-sequencing analysis of CLL samples demonstrated that genes associated with fCpGs have significantly lower expression levels (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3f), with no association between fCpG methylation status and associated gene expression in matched cases (Fig. 1g). No correlation was observed between fCpG methylation and the expression of key DNA methylation modifier genes (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that fCpG-associated genes were underrepresented in pathways ubiquitously expressed across multiple tissue types but enriched in developmental pathways (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Although these results do not provide a detailed molecular understanding of the mechanisms underpinning fCpG fluctuation; together, they indicate that fCpGs tend to be located in silent regions of the genome and do not regulate transcription, so are likely to be neutral lineage markers.

We developed EVOFLUx, a stochastic mathematical modelling and Bayesian inference framework, to simulate how clonal evolution quantitatively determines fCpG methylation values and enable inference of evolutionary history of individual tumour samples (Fig. 2a).

a, Schematic of the EVOFLUx method that simulates the evolutionary dynamics of a growing cancer. EVOFLUx relies on a mathematical model describing how the fCpG distributions vary with the evolutionary parameters of a cancer. The model is split into two phases: before the MRCA (τ) in which methylation changes occur in the single-cell lineage that is subsequently transformed, and following the MRCA in which the population grows exponentially (θ). At each time step, epigenetic switching is allowed to occur between the three possible states (rates μ, ν, γ and ζ). b,c, Simulated fCpG methylation distributions for cancer with a distant versus recent MRCA (b), and rapid versus slow growth (c). d, Fisher plot showing the change in the subclonal composition within a simulated set of longitudinal samples (top).

Source data

EVOFLUx simulates the ongoing gain and loss of methylation at fCpGs within a lineage from the birth of a patient until the beginning of a cancer-associated clonal expansion at some specified time, and then continues to simulate methylation fluctuations within the growing population of cancer cells until the cancer sample was collected at time T (Methods; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Information). The key parameters in the model are:

Cancer growth rate per year (θ), assuming an exponentially growing population.

Cancer age, measured in terms of the age of the patient in years at the time the cancer started growing (τ).

fCpG switching rates per allele per year. Four parameters corresponding to the four possible transitions between homozygous unmethylated, heterozygous methylated and homozygous methylated (μ, ν, γ and ζ).

By combining the cancer growth rate and age, the cancer effective population size (Ne) — the number of long-lived lineages in the cancer — is calculated as Ne = eθ(T −τ).

Computational simulations of the model recapitulated the observed W-shaped fCpG methylation distribution. Altering model parameters caused notable shifts in the distribution: increasing cancer age caused the flanking peaks of the W-shaped distribution to move towards the central peak, whereas slower growth broadened peak width (Fig. 2b,c). Hence, the distribution of fCpGs encoded the evolutionary history of a tumour.

We added simulations of a single advantageous subclone within the cancer (Methods). Sampling longitudinally from model simulations and comparing fCpG methylation between timepoints showed that subclone outgrowth was marked by the small number of fCpGs with distinct methylation status in the subclone, becoming detectable only when the subclone was sufficiently large (Fig. 2d,e).

EVOFLUx contained an extensive Bayesian inference method to learn model parameters from input fCpG methylation distribution data, accounting for tumour purity and the technical noise introduced by the methylation array (Methods; Fig. 3a). We generated simulated fCpG distributions with prespecified (that is, known) model parameters and validated the ability of EVOFLUx to accurately recover the ‘ground truth' in these simulated data (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Information), even when the assumptions underlying the method were weakened (Extended Data Fig. 4c–h and Supplementary Information).

Differences between subtypes were tested using MWU tests, with Holm–Bonferroni corrections applied.

Source data

We applied EVOFLUx to 1,976 samples of lymphoid cancers (including T-ALL, B-ALL, CLL, MCL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multiple myeloma) and premalignant conditions (that is, monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) for which we had age and tumour cell purity information, to infer the individual growth rate of each cancer, time since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and epigenetic switching rates (Supplementary Table 12). Posterior distributions were well formed (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and posterior predictive distributions recapitulated the input data well (Extended Data Fig. 5b), emphasizing the excellent fit of the model to data. Inferred parameters were not significantly affected by tumour cell content of samples (Supplementary Fig. 8) or exclusion of copy number alteration-altered regions (Extended Data Fig. 5c–e and Supplementary Fig. 9). Most parameters were also insensitive to the number of fCpGs excluded (Extended Data Fig. 5f,g), except the effective population size (Extended Data Fig. 5h).

Paediatric ALL and adult lymphoid neoplasms exhibited markedly different evolutionary histories (Fig. 3b). ALLs demonstrated much higher growth rates (θ; Extended Data Fig. 6a; P = 9.3 × 10−306, Mann–Whitney U (MWU) test, Holm–Sidak correction), smaller effective population sizes (Ne; Extended Data Fig. 6b; P = 8.1 × 10−25) and shorter times since the MRCA (Extended Data Fig. 6c; P = 6.0 × 10−306) than other lymphoid malignancies. T-ALL grew faster than B-ALL (P = 0.0017, Holm–Sidak correction) and showed more homogenous growth rates (P = 0.00044, Levene test). In adult cancers, MBL (a precursor to CLL) displayed lower growth rates and longer time since the MRCA than CLL (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c; P = 9.7 × 10−10 and P = 9.9 × 10−13, respectively). DLBCL notably had the largest Ne despite comparable growth rates.

fCpG switching rates varied significantly across diseases, with paediatric ALLs showing much faster switching than adult malignancies (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Paediatric ALLs also demonstrated a strong positive correlation between fCpG switching rate and growth rate (Extended Data Fig. 6e; P = 2.4 × 10−98 and R2 = 0.44 in B-ALL and P = 5.9 × 10−6 and R2 = 0.22 in T-ALL) and a strong negative correlation with patient age (Extended Data Fig. 6f–k; P = 3.3 × 10−137 and R2 = 0.56 in B-ALL and P = 3.6 × 10−18 and R2 = 0.6 in T-ALL). These findings suggest that fCpG (de)methylation rates are decreased in adult lymphoid cancers.

In CLL, we estimated the ‘contemporary' growth rate derived from multiple longitudinal clinical measurements of the lymphocyte count preceding treatment. The EVOFLUx inferred growth rate, which represents the rate of the initial clonal expansion of the disease, was moderately correlated with the contemporary growth rate (P = 2 × 10−5, R = 0.27; Extended Data Fig. 6l and Supplementary Fig. 10).

We examined how cancer evolutionary history related to molecular subtypes. In B-ALL, MLL-rearranged cases had a significantly higher growth rate (Fig. 3d; P = 1.3 × 10−13, MWU, 44.3 ± 6.1 versus 11.7 ± 0.2 per year (mean ± standard error)), but lower effective population size Ne (P = 3.7 × 10−7, 1.8 × 105 ± 0.2 × 105 versus 3.0 × 105 ± 0.06 × 105 cells) than the other subtypes, consistent with their distinct clinical behaviour37. In MCL, the generally more indolent leukaemic non-nodal MCL26 had a lower growth rate (Fig. 3e; P = 1.1 × 10−3, 1.7 ± 0.1 versus 2.1 ± 0.1 per year) and Ne (P = 7.4 × 10−5, 4.7 × 105 ± 1.4 × 105 versus 1.5 × 106 ± 0.2 × 106 cells) than the more aggressive conventional MCL. In DLBCL transcriptomic subtypes38, there was no significant differences, probably due to the smaller number of cases and the lower sample purity (Supplementary Fig. 11).

In CLL, two major molecular subtypes are defined based on the extent of somatic hypermutation in the heavy-chain variable region of the IG gene (IGHV): unmutated CLL (U-CLL) and mutated CLL (M-CLL). The more aggressive U-CLL subtype39,40 showed significantly higher growth rates (Fig. 3e; P = 1.3 × 10−32, 2.3 ± 0.04 versus 1.8 ± 0.02 per year) and larger Ne (P = 2.1 × 10−22, 7.2 × 105 ± 0.3 × 105 versus 4.1 × 105 ± 0.3 × 105 cells) than M-CLL, independent of tumour purity (Supplementary Fig. 12). Similar results were obtained when analysing its precursor condition MBL (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Patients with mutations in specific driver genes, such as TP53, are well known to have a worse prognosis41. We compared the inferred growth rates and effective population sizes accounting for IGHV status for the most prevalent driver genetic alterations in CLL: TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, ATM, POT1 and IGLV3-21R110, del(11)(q22.3), del(13)(q14.3), del(17)(p13.1) and trisomy 12 (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 7). Patients with M-CLL with TP53 mutations had a higher growth rate and effective population size (P = 0.030 and P = 0.036, respectively, MWU test, false discovery rate corrected; Fig. 3g). Trisomy 12 was associated with increased effective population size in both U-CLL and M-CLL (P = 0.036 and P = 0.036, respectively), but no difference in growth rate.

As new advantageous subclones can arise during cancer evolution, we also examined subclonal architecture in our cohort. In CLL, a small fraction of cases presents two or more clones with independent origins42. In genetic data, subclonal, independent and monoclonal (Extended Data Fig. 8a) architectures are distinguishable by characteristic patterning of mutation allele frequencies43,44. Similarly, in fCpG data, clonal architectures are depicted by additional intermediate peaks in the methylation distribution (Fig. 2d,e). Simulations showed that subclone inference by EVOFLUx was limited to detect only strongly selected subclones arising at an intermediate timepoint in the history of the tumour (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Information), for reasons analogous to limitations of subclone detection in genetic sequencing data45. We describe the evolution in tumours without detectable subclones as effectively-neutral.

Applying EVOLFUx in our cohort revealed that most cancers (1,610 of 1,976) showed no evidence of either subclonal or independent clones (Extended Data Fig. 8b and Supplementary Table 12). The frequency of subclone detection varied considerably between cancer types, ranging from over 30% in CLL (232 of 718) to less than 5% in DLBCL (1 of 57).

We verified EVOFLUx inferences with matched whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 425 CLL cases (Supplementary Table 13). Using the MOBSTER subclonal deconvolution tool43, subclones were detected in 78 of 425 cancers (Supplementary Table 14), and these cancers had significantly higher EVOLUFx subclonality weights (P = 2.0 × 10−4, MWU test; Extended Data Fig. 8c). MOBSTER was more likely to detect subclones in cancers with more mutations (Extended Data Fig. 8d), suggesting limited power to detect subclones in WES. We therefore obtained matched whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for 127 CLL samples (Supplementary Table 15) and observed better agreement between EVOFLUx and MOBSTER subclone calls (P = 3.9 × 10−4; Extended Data Fig. 8e and Supplementary Table 16), in which MOBSTER subclone calls were then independent of single-nucleotide variant count (P > 0.05). A classifier to predict WGS subclone architecture using EVOFLUx outperformed a WES-based classifier (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.73 versus AUC = 0.62) and performed equivalently to a classifier using both EVOFLUx and WES (AUC = 0.74; Extended Data Fig. 8f). Hence, EVOFLUx was more effective at detecting ongoing subclonal selection than MOBSTER applied to WES data.

CLLs with two independent clonal origins were detected in 22 of 718 cases. Validation through comparing IG gene rearrangements from WES or WGS and RNA sequencing46 (Supplementary Table 17) showed that patients with multiple IG gene rearrangements had elevated independent origin model weightings (Extended Data Fig. 8g; P = 0.028).

Some patients with CLL undergo Richter transformation, the emergence of an aggressive phenotype with dismal prognosis. We assembled longitudinal matched WGS and methylation data27 for two patients with CLL developing Richter transformation followed for 19.5 and 14.5 years, respectively. WGS data provided ground-truth measurement of clonal evolution during the decades of longitudinal follow-up, which we contrasted with clonal inference from methylation data (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 18).

Source data

In CLL case 12, between T1 and T2 (13.1 years), WGS data showed that a subclonal expansion occurred, and this was mirrored in fCpGs (Fig. 4a). In the short (1 month) period between T2 and T3, the patient received ibrutinib treatment, but there was no clonal expansion detected in WGS nor methylation data. The patient then received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (R-CVP) combination treatment, but by T4 (5.6 months after T3) presented a clinical manifestation of Richter transformation, and WGS showed that the Richter transformation clone had expanded to form 77% of the tumour. This very large clonal expansion was clearly evident in fCpG methylation data.

In CLL case 19, the initial samples at T1–T4 spanned a period of 7.1 years. WGS showed gradual expansion of a subclone that was mirrored in fCpG methylation data (Fig. 4b). At T5 (5.5 years later), there had been a large nested subclonal expansion detected by WGS that was also evident in fCpG data. At T6 (2.8 years later), the patient was diagnosed with Richter transformation. WGS showed near-fixation of the Richter transformation clone and there was a correspondingly stark signal in fCpG data.

We used EVOFLUX on these longitudinal fCpG methylation data to construct phylogenetic relationships between samples (Methods). In both cases, the phylogenies (Fig. 4a,b) showed that the Richter transformation clone diverged exceptionally early, roughly a decade before the MRCA of the samples containing non-transformed CLL cells (9 and 12 years for cases 12 and 19, respectively). This was consistent with our previous analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing and DNA sequencing that detected Richter transformation cells at low frequencies within the diagnostic CLL sample27, but suggests, remarkably, that the initial Richter transformation divergence occurred well before diagnosis, over 30 years before the clinical presentation of Richter transformation.

We validated the fCpG phylogenetic inferences by comparing them with phylogenetic trees from matched WGS data27 and comparing it with methylation data (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). fCpGs exactly recapitulated the WGS tree topology and had highly similar branch lengths unlike other CpG sets (Supplementary Figs. 14–16). Hence, fCpGs are a high-resolution phylogenetic character.

We also performed phylogenetic analysis on B-ALL cases from diagnosis to relapse (Extended Data Fig. 9c–e). All relapse samples formed a separate clade from the initial diagnostic sample, suggesting a major treatment-induced evolutionary bottleneck. In patients with B-ALL with matched cancer–remission samples, we consistently observed that the W-shape (indicating a clonal expansion) was replaced by a unimodal distribution (indicating no clonal expansion) following successful treatment, with similar variance as normal blood (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). In two patients with matched diagnosis, remission and relapse samples, we found that the unimodal fCpG distribution during remission was replaced with a W-shaped distribution at relapse similar in shape to the diagnostic sample, due to the clonal expansion driving recurrence (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9h). Comparing the fCpG distributions between diagnostic versus relapse samples revealed subclonal evolution through treatment (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9i).

To investigate the relationship between the evolutionary history and future clinical trajectory of a cancer, we leveraged a series of 478 CLL cases with well-annotated follow-up data. Using univariate Cox models, we tested the effect of evolutionary parameters on time to first treatment (TTFT), which reflects the natural cancer biology, and then on overall survival, which is a more complex end point as it convolves disease biology with treatment responses.

In univariate analysis, faster growing CLLs had markedly shorter TTFT (Fig. 5a; P = 1.4 × 10−30, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.95) and worse overall survival (P = 0.0053, HR = 1.51). The Ne of a cancer did not have a strong effect on TTFT (P = 0.058, HR = 1.17), but was associated with shorter overall survival (P = 1.3 × 10−4, HR = 1.41). The patient age at the time of the MRCA of the CLL population was highly correlated with the age of the patient (Supplementary Fig. 17), so unsurprisingly, older patients had worse overall survival (P = 2.3 × 10−11, HR = 1.79). The decrease in risk of progression with cancer age (P = 3.8 × 10−17, HR = 0.65), measured by the time since the MRCA, was probably due to confounding with the growth rate, as these parameters were negatively correlated (Supplementary Fig. 17). The epigenetic switching rate parameters were largely uninformative of prognosis.

The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. A log-rank test was used in the Kaplan–Meier curves and Wald tests for Cox models. A Schoenfeld residuals test was used to test proportional hazard assumptions. No multiple comparison adjustments were done.

Source data

As the growth rate was different between U-CLL and M-CLL (Fig. 5b), we analysed its prognostic impact within each group separately. Higher growth rates consistently correlated with shorter TTFT in both subtypes (Fig. 5b; P = 1.4 × 10−5 for M-CLL, P = 1.56 × 10−7 for U-CLL and overall P = 2.1 × 10−53). In a multivariate Cox regression model, growth rate maintained a strong independent prognostic impact as quantitative variable (P = 2.2 × 10−10, HR = 2.28) even when controlling for the IGHV mutational status and TP53 aberrations, as well as age (Fig. 5c). Of note, the effect of TP53 mutations on TTFT appeared mediated by increased growth rate. The cancer Ne was more significantly correlated with overall survival than the growth rate, and this effect was preserved in the U-CLL subtype (Extended Data Fig. 10a; P = 0.55 for M-CLL, P = 9.90 × 10−7 for U-CLL and overall P = 4.72 × 10−9) and in the multivariate setting with IGHV status, TP53 aberrations and age at sampling (Extended Data Fig. 10b; P = 0.025, HR = 1.33).

Although the inference of the evolutionary parameters on our initial cohort was wholly blinded to the clinical outcomes, we also validated our findings using a second independent cohort of 209 patients with CLL (135 untreated at sampling)28,29 (Supplementary Table 2). These results verified tumour initial growth rate as a predictor of TTFT (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e). Furthermore, the EVOFLUx-derived growth rate was prognostic even when controlling for the contemporary rate of change of lymphocyte counts (P = 0.018; Extended Data Fig. 10f).

These results demonstrate that the evolutionary parameters inferred from a cost-effective methylation array could have a direct clinical application by contributing to predict the clinical behaviour of patients with CLL independently from well-established prognostic variables.

Our study establishes a computational framework called EVOFLUx, which enables quantitative measurement of the evolutionary history of human malignancies at massive scale using only widely available and low-cost bulk methylation data as input. Evolutionary histories are fundamentally distinct from characterizations of the contemporary phenotype of cancer cells, such as the fraction of proliferating cells. EVOFLUx methodology should also work identically for sequencing-based methods to measure methylation such as bifulfite-based47,48 and bisulfite-free approaches32,49 (for example, long-read nanopore), which show an excellent correlation with our array data. In theory, these methods allow for assessment of many more fCpGs, increasing inference accuracy. EVOFLUx should also be applicable to tumour-derived cell-free DNA extracted from blood.

Evolutionary histories are strongly associated with disease phenotype and clinical outcomes across lymphoid disease types. We consider this strong evidence that clonal evolution, the fundamental cellular process of disease development, underlies the clinical course of the disease. Consequently, we expect these results to generalize across all cancer types. We note that genome-wide DNA methylation analyses also measure other important biological features of a cancer (for example, molecular subtype14) that could be combined with EVOFLUx-based inference of evolutionary history to further improve the prognostic value of DNA methylation data.

In summary, we present a cost-effective high-throughput platform for measuring cancer evolutionary dynamics at the population scale in patient samples. These fundamental measurements of the disease biology hold substantial prognostic value and represent an innovative asset in the field of precision oncology.

We assembled and processed with a harmonized pipeline14 (v4.1; see Code availability section) 2,430 bulk sample Illumina methylation array data of normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells from previous publications14,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30. As healthy control samples, this dataset contained sorted CD19+ B cells (n = 40), CD3+ T cells (n = 35), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 6) and whole-blood samples (n = 6). As tumour samples, we included precursor 797 B-ALLs and 90 T-ALLs at diagnosis, 28 B-ALLs and 2 T-ALLs at relapse, as well as 74 B-ALLs and 12 T-ALLs at complete remission (that is, normal blood); 149 MCLs; 722 CLLs, 55 of its precursor condition MBL and 6 samples from patients with CLL undergoing a DLBCL transformation called Richter transformation; 62 primary DLBCL, not otherwise specified; and 104 multiple myeloma and 16 of its precursor condition monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In brief, raw idat files were loaded and processed with R (v4.3.1) using the minfi package50,51 (v1.46.0) in batches as specified in the column ‘SSNOB_NORMALIZATION_BATCH' of Supplementary Table 2. In brief, the data were processed for each batch as follows. First, idats files were loaded into a RGChannelSet object, and minfi quality metrics using the qcReport function were performed, removing samples with unexpected distributions of methylation values (that is, distributions markedly distinct from a bimodal centred around 0 and 1 β-values and/or from the remaining samples) and low signal intensities of internal control probes for each sample, including bisulfite conversions I and II, extension hybridization, hybridization, non-polymorphic, specificities I and II, and target removal probes.

Next, further quality metrics were derived using the function minfiQC on the unnormalized RGChannelSet obejct. Those samples with median signal intensities of unmethylated and methylated channels of at least 10.5 in log2 scale were considered as having good signal intensities. Subsequently, detection P values were calculated across all CpGs and samples using the detectionP function for the unnormalized RGChannelSet object. Samples were considered as good if having a mean detection P value across all CpGs of P ≤ 0.01. On a CpG level, we retained CpGs with a detection P ≤ 1 × 10−16 in 90% or more of the samples, which has been shown to improve the quality of downstream analyses52,53. The RGChannelSet object was normalized with the single-sample batch-independent preprocessNoob function with dye bias correction. We next retained only CpGs (excluding CH probes) that did not contain any SNP neither in the interrogated CpGs nor in the probe extension using the dropMethylationLoci and dropLociWithSnps functions with default options (minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0). Further analyses using long-read nanopore data, Illumina array control probes, annotation packages and a data-driven approach were used to ensure the lack of any genetic confounding in the methylation values of the resulting fCpGs (see the next sections).

Furthermore, CpGs with any previous evidence of potential cross-hybridization were excluded54 and only CpGs mapping to autosomal chromosomes were subsequently retained for downstream analyses. Finally, to further confirm the accuracy of the filtering criteria, we checked the distribution of normalized methylation values and performed principal component analyses separately for samples passing all quality checks as well as those considered as bad samples. The final DNA methylation matrix contained 2,204 samples and 389,180 CpGs passing all the aforementioned quality controls, and included 2,054 patients (22 technical replicates, 3 synchronic and 125 longitudinal samples from the same patients)55 (Supplementary Table 2).

To determine the purity of samples, we used our previously deconvolution strategy to infer tumour cell content by DNA methylation14, which was used as a consensus purity in all the tumour samples except for DLBCL and multiple myeloma. In these two tumour entities, we have previously identified a DNA methylation signature loss causing inaccurate tumour purity predictions using DNA methylation data, and therefore we used available genetic or flow cytometry data for DLBCL and multiple myeloma, respectively.

We constructed a pipeline to identify fCpGs in lymphoid tumours, based on the following criteria:

Heterogeneous across different participants with the same disease (by accepting CpG loci with the top 5% of standard deviation of methylation value within a cancer type).

Equally likely to be methylated or unmethylated (by selecting CpGs with average methylation of approximately 0.5 within a cancer type).

Unlikely to be associated with specific cell or cancer types. We used an unsupervised Laplacian score feature selection metric56 to rank CpG loci by their tendency to preserve the nearest-neighbour graph, and accepted the 5% least-informative CpGs.

We performed a series of analyses to exclude the potential genetic confounding (germline SNPs and somatic SNVs) on our fCpGs. We first excluded the possibility that common germline SNPs caused methylation heterogeneity at fCpG sites between individuals. We observed very distinct methylation dynamics of array control probes containing SNPs (which had been removed during the initial array processing) versus fCpGs. SNP probes showed the same distribution in all samples (Extended Data Fig. 2c), including longitudinally followed cases (Supplementary Fig. 3), whereas fCpGs only showed a W distribution in cancer samples with ongoing fluctuations over time. Thus, although SNPs reflect the stable genetic identity of the individual, fCpGs reflect the identity of a single cell and its evolving lineage. In addition, we used the packages SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38 (v0.99.24) and MafH5.gnomAD.v4.0.GRCh38 (v3.19) to check for any known significant germline or somatic genetic confounding on the resulting 978 fCpGs. We found approximately 60% of fCpGs reported in the gnomAD v4 database (with the array background having approximately 65%), but with a very low MAF (median of 1 × 10−5 and mean of 1 × 10−3). To exclude the possibility of unknown or very rare genetic confounding, we used the data-driven gaphunting algorithm57 available in the minfi R package, which further discarded a possible cancer-specific single-nucleotide variation (SNV) that could confound the methylation values at the 978 identified fCpGs. Finally, Oxford Nanopore long read of a subset of normal and neoplastic samples further validated that fCpGs represent de/methylated cytosines (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e; see next section).

For long-read methylation sequencing in CLL and Richter transformation samples, concentration was assessed using the Qubit assay and DNA integrity was analysed either with the Femto Pulse System (Agilent) or the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent). When more than 6 µg of material with good integrity was available, DNA was additionally treated with the Short Fragment Eliminator Kit XS (PacBio) and eluted in EB buffer. Approximately 4 µg of DNA was used for library preparation according to the standard LSK114 kit and protocol from Oxford Nanopore. The time for DNA repair and end-prep was increased up to 30 min at 20 °C and 30 min at 65 °C. Adapter ligation was performed for 1 h at room temperature. All elutions were performed at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and 550–600 ng of DNA was loaded onto a FLO-PRO114M (CLL cells) flow cells. Flow cells were washed (EXP-WSH004) after 1–2 days, if pore count decreased to less than 30%. A total of 1–4 washes were performed for each flow cell. Flow cells were run for 100 (CLL cells) hours in total with the Fast model (MinKNOW 23.11.7, Dorado 7.2.13). The raw data were rebasecalled using dorado duplex (v0.5.3) and applying the SUP and modified call to detect 5mC and 5hmC, (model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.3.0_5mCG_5hmCG@v1).

In normal B cell samples, 1–3 µg of DNA was used for WGS. Libraries were prepared with the DNA ligation kit LSK110 with no modifications. Libraries were loaded onto a flow cell version FLO-PRO002 (R9.4) and were run for 90–110 h. The basecalling was performed on live mode with the Guppy basecaller (v6.2.7), included in the MinKNOW (v22.08.6), using the SUP model for base modification detection of 5mC and 5hmC (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_sup.cfg).

In all samples, the generated unmapped BAM files after the basecalling were converted to FASTQ files using the SAMtools fastq -T Mm, Ml command. The FASTQ files were then mapped to BAM files using the command minimap2 -ax map-ont -y../GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.mmi. The methylation values were extracted from the BAMs into bedMethyl files using the in-house tool bam2bedmethyl (v0.3.2) and compressed/indexed using bgzip/tabix. Reads from each strand were combined to generate DNA matrices for each CpG and were used for obtaining the methylation values of all fCpGs.

In addition, mini BAM files containing all reads from the 976 fCpGs were generated (in hg38 genome assembly). The reads showed excellent mappability, with a mean of perfect nucleotide matches (NM tag; Levenshtein distance) for all fCpGs across samples of 96.41% (range of 73.31–97.90), and mean mapping quality (MAPQ) of all the reads covering all fCpGs across samples of 59.510 (range of 2–60). Subsequently, long reads were phased using variants called using Clair 3 (v1.0.9, model r941_prom_hac_g360 + g422)58 with the Longphase package (v1.7)59. The methylation status of each CpG was called using the modcall function within the Longphase package. At fCpGs, only 2.7% of the reads were non-canonical bases (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The variant allele frequency (VAF) of these mutations tended to be low and was negatively correlated with the coverage at that site (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Hence, the majority of these non-canonical base pairs are probably due to errors in nucleotide assignment. There is also no association between the methylation status of different reads and the variants present within a 50-bp window of each fCpG locus (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Hence, assessment of fCpG methylation via bead array was not majorly confounded by miscalled variants. The fCpG methylation patterns seen in the bead array data were replicated in the long-read data (Extended Data Fig. 2e) and the correlation between the fraction methylated measured via bead array and long-read sequencing at fCpGs was excellent (Extended Data Fig. 2e). The same correspondence was observed in WGBS data (Extended Data Fig. 2f).

To assess the intra-sample long-read diversity for each sample, the pairwise Hamming distances were calculated between every read on both haplotypes. The two lists of Hamming distances were concatenated, and the mean calculated as a summary statistic of the read diversity for each sample. One normal B cell sample contained only two reads from one haplotype, and zero from the other, and so was excluded from further analysis.

Previously published single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) data were obtained6 and the fCpG methylation values extracted methylation values for normal B cells from 6 donors and CLL cells from 12 patients. There was a high dropout rate, so to extract meaningful patterns we plotted a subset of 40 cells and 20 fCpGs with a high density and overlap of fCpGs across single cells as examples (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b).

To compare the full set of data accounting for the high degree of missing data, we used a metric of heterogeneity at a given fCpG that weights by the number of non-missing fCpGs according to:

Where ni is the number of non-NaN values for the ith fCpG, \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is the total possible pairwise comparisons between a set of n objects and σ(βi) is the standard deviation across the methylation values of the ith fCpG (Supplementary Fig. 5c).

To characterize the genomic and regulatory context of fCpGs, we used a series of statistical analyses and database annotations. We annotated fCpGs using Illumina manifest and other genomic annotation packages available at Bioconductor including IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 (v0.6.1) and IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 (v0.6.0). We additionally used the packages SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38 (v0.99.24) and MafH5.gnomAD.v4.0.GRCh38 (v3.19) to check any possible germline or somatic genetic confounding on the resulting 978 fCpGs. We found approximately 60% of fCpGs reported in the gnomAD v4 database (with the array background having approximately 65%), but with a very low MAF (median of 1 × 10−5 and mean of 1 × 10−3). In addition, we used the Illumina 450k and EPIC array internal SNP probes and showed a dramatically distinct methylation dynamics compared with fCpGs in single-timepoint (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and longitudinal (Supplementary Fig. 3) samples. Finally, the data-driven gaphunting algorithm available in the minfi R package was applied with all the previously published thresholds and cut-offs57, which further discarded possible cancer-specific SNV that could confound the methylation values at the 978 identified fCpGs.

We used Chi-squared tests to assess the enrichment of fCpGs in distinct genomic regions or elements. We performed gene-set enrichment analysis on the fCpG-associated genes using gProfiler60, specifically focusing on the Gene Ontology biological processes61 and the Human Protein Atlas62. The statistical domain space was limited to genes targeted by at least one CpG in the 389,180 candidate CpG set and significance was determined using the g:SCS algorithm63. Previous chromatin segmentation of normal and neoplastic B cells was used to assess the chromatin-state enrichment of fCpG14,64.

fCpGs were checked for their overlap with previous ‘epigenetic clocks', including mitotic14,65,66,67,68, chronological age69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78, gestational age79,80,81,82,83, biological age and mortality84,85,86 and trait predictors87,88. The package methylCIPHER (https://github.com/MorganLevineLab/methylCIPHER) was used to obtain the CpGs for most of the epigenetic clocks. The package methylclock (v1.10.0) was used to calculate all epigenetic clocks but epiCMIT, which was derived as previously described14.

Previously available RNA sequencing data for 294 patients with CLL were obtained33 and processed as previously described26. Matched RNA sequencing data and DNA methylation data for the same patients at the same timepoint were available for 224 patients with CLL. Transcript per million counts were used to represent differential gene expression values across genes and samples. We used the gene annotation provided in the R Bioconductor package IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 to classify genes associated with fCpGs. Genes targeted by any fCpG were considered as ‘fCpG genes'.

In each methylation sample, the 978 fCpGs were discretized as homozygous demethylated, heterozygous methylated or homozygous methylated (coded as [0,1,2], respectively). This was done by separately fitting a β-mixture model with three components to each sample using Stan89 and extracting the component mixture probability. The gene expression value for genes classified as having and fCpG with 0, 1 or 2 alleles methylated were plotted as previously described.

External DNA methylation data were download from the Gene Expression Omnibus database using the GEOquery R package (v2.72.0). For sorted immune cells, these include GSE137594 and GSE184269. For whole-blood samples, these include GSE72773, GSE55763, GSE40279 and GSE36054. Data were analysed with the normalization procedure used in each study together with the metadata provided. Mean and standard deviation for fCpGs were calculated with fCpGs present in the provided normalized matrices.

We built a generative computational model of how the patterns of fCpGs vary over time (t) according to the evolutionary history of a cancer. Initially, our model focused on neutral evolution, before expanding to non-neutral modes of tumour evolution below. For the full explanation of the model, see the Supplementary Information.

Our model was parameterized in terms of the age of the patient at which the MRCA emerged (τ), the exponential growth rate of the cancer (θ) and the epigenetic switching rates of the fCpGs (μ, ν, γ and ζ). The model was partitioned into two phases: before and after the emergence of the MRCA. At time t = 0, the fCpGs were assumed to be equally likely to be homozygously methylated or demethylated. The fCpG status of the MRCA at time t = τ was calculated by applying matrix exponentiation.

The second phase of the model consisted of a discrete time Markov process. The effective population size of the growing cancer was modelled as growing according to a deterministic exponential growth equation, Ne = eθ(T − τ). Each fCpG was considered independently; at each time step, t → t + δt, the number of homozygous-methylated (m), heterozygous-methylated (k) and homozygous-demethylated cells (w) at a specific fCpG was updated according to the epigenetic switching rates.

At the time of sample, T, the fraction methylation of each simulated fCpG was calculated by summing the number of methylated alleles and normalizing by the total number of alleles in the population:

We further accounted for contaminating normal cells and the technical noise introduced by the methylation bead array. The methylation of the contaminated samples was assumed to be an average of the cancer methylation, βc(t), weighted by the tumour purity ρ, and the average of the normal population, βn, weighted by 1 − ρ. Following our previous work, the bead array was assumed to saturate at extreme methylation values, shifting the minimum and maximum methylation by δ and ε, respectively4. The noise of the bead array was assumed to be β-distributed, with precision parameter κ.

Alongside our model of neutral exponentially growing cancer populations, we devised two alternative models of cancer growth:

A subclonal selection model in which a single cell within the cancer develops a selective advantage and begins to grow at an increased growth rate.

An independent clonal origins model, in which a patient has developed two distinct cancers concurrently.

For the subclonal selection model, we replaced the growth rate (θ) and the time of the MRCA (τ) with the growth rates and time of the MRCA of the initial, slower-growing population (θ1 and τ1, respectively), and that of the more recently emerging, faster-growing population (θ2 and τ2), constraining τ1 < τ2 and θ1 < θ2 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). We assumed that the initial cancer population began exponentially growing at τ1 as above, but at time t = τ2, we selected a single cell with a set of fCpG states drawn according to the cancer population and allowed this second population to grow concurrently with a growth rate θ2.

The independent-cancer model followed the same scheme as the nested subclonal selection model, except the methylation status of the emerging cancer was that of an independent cell that experienced random fluctuations between t = 0 and t = τ2.

If we let the number of cells in the less fit subclone in each methylation state be {m1, k1, w1} and in the fitter subclone be {m2, k2, w2}, following the convention above, then in both cases the measured methylation patterns at the time of sample are:

Where \({N}_{e}(T)={e}^{{\theta }_{1}(T-{\tau }_{1})}+{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(T-{\tau }_{2})}\).

We modified the simulations of how the fCpG methylation distribution changes over time to allow for multiple sequential sample collections. These simulations allow for neutral, independent clones, a single subclonal expansion or two subclonal expansions, which can either be nested or emerge from the clonal trunk in parallel. This required pre-specification of sampling times, along with the emergence times of any subclones or independent clones, which we collected to form a set of ‘landmark times'. The discrete time steps of the simulation were split into phases between the landmark times, which evolved according to the discrete time Markov process outlined above. At each sampling time, the fCpG methylation fraction was calculated as above and stored as a column in the output matrix.

For each methylation array blood sample, we had matched age (T) and purity (ρ) information. Hence, the parameters to be inferred are the growth rate (θ), the age of the patient when the MRCA emerged (τ), the epigenetic switching rates (μ, ν, γ, ζ), the average fraction methylated of contaminating normal cells (βn), the β-offsets from 0 and 1 due to the background noise on the methylation array (δ and ε, respectively) and the precision of the β-distributed noise (κ).

These parameters are constrained either to be positive (θ, μ, ν, γ, ζ, κ > 0) or to lie within a specified range (0 < τ/T, δ, ε < 1), which we achieved using appropriate prior distributions. To better allow for priors to be set on a biologically meaningful scale, the priors for the log-normal distribution were set in terms of the real scale mean and standard deviation, rather than the standard log-scale. To reduce correlations in the posterior and make sampling more efficient, the variables ν and ζ were normalized by μ and γ, respectively.

The priors are as follows:

When fitting non-neutral models of tumour growth, the inference was parameterized in terms of the relative growth of the fitter subclone, \({\tilde{\theta }}_{2}=\frac{{\theta }_{2}}{{\theta }_{1}}\), and the fraction of the population consisting of the fitter subclone, \(f=\frac{{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(t-{\tau }_{2})}}{{e}^{{\theta }_{1}(t-{\tau }_{1})}+{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(t-{\tau }_{2})}}\). The age at which the second clone emerges is then:

This parameterization induces less correlation in the resulting posterior, which greatly improves the sampling efficiency. The priors on these additional parameters are:

All the other priors were the same as in the neutral case.

We developed a stochastic estimator of the log-likelihood function at a given set of parameters by simulating the fCpG methylation distribution a large number of times, correcting for the bias inherent with using a finite number of simulations and penalizing the log-likelihood for extreme values of the Ne (see Supplementary Information for details).

The standard Bayesian algorithms developed to infer the posterior for a given set of data (for example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), nested sampling) are typically used when the log-likelihood is analytically tractable and can be calculated exactly. It has been shown that, as long as the stochastic approximation of the log-likelihood is unbiased, MCMC methods can obtain an exact Bayesian inference of the true posterior, as in pseudo-marginal Metropolis–Hastings90.

Here we used a nested sampling approach using the dynesty package91,92,93. Unlike pseudo-marginal Metropolis–Hastings, nested sampling is able to efficiently explore multimodal posterior landscapes (which can occur under the subclonal and independent cancer models).

We used an expected log pointwise predictive density94 approach to compare our competing models of evolution for each sample using the arviz Python package95, which uses PSIS-LOO-CV to compare the out-of-sample prediction accuracy between models while naturally penalizing more complex models. This required the log-likelihood per data point and the posterior predictive for every point in the posterior. The weights of the respective models were calculated using pseudo-Bayesian model averaging using Akaike-type weighting, stabilized using the Bayesian bootstrap96.

Previous mutated annotation files from WES46 and WGS27 data were used to further validate our distinct EVOFLUx evolutionary modes (that is, neutral, subclonal and independent) and Richter transformation phylogenies.

To detect subclones in bulk WES and WGS data, we used MOBSTER43, which fits the VAF spectrum with a mixture model containing a Pareto distribution to account for the neutral tail97 and a variable number of β-distributions to account for the clonal and subclonal peaks.

We ran MOBSTER using the default parameters, except using a minimum 5% VAF threshold and lowering the minimum number of mutations to compose a cluster to five in WES samples due to the low number of mutations. We then manually quality controlled all 377 WES samples and 10 WGS, tuning the fitting parameters to better represent the data (for instance, when the clonal peak had been called at a low frequency despite the median tumour purity being 95%).

A novel Bayesian phylogenetic method was used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships and the time to MRCA of longitudinal samples from the same patients. This was carried out in the BEAST (v1.8.4) framework98,99 using custom models implemented in PISCA100 (v1.1; available from https://github.com/adamallo/PISCA).

EVOFLUx provided an estimate of the age of the patient when the MRCA of each bulk sample emerged. To estimate the methylation status of each fCpG at the MRCA of the sample in each of our longitudinal samples, we discretized the fCpGs as described above (see the section ‘CLL RNA sequencing data').

We implemented a four-parameter biallelic binary substitution model analogous to the pre-growth EVOFLUx model in PISCA. This plugin contains all the required statistical machinery to use this model for somatic phylogenetic estimation. The biallelic binary substitution model has three relative rate parameters: (1) heterozygous methylation \(\tilde{\upsilon }\), (2) homozygous demethylation \(\tilde{\gamma }\), and (3) heterozygous demethylation \(\tilde{\zeta }\), where homozygous methylation \(\tilde{\mu }\) was normalized to 1. For all relative transition rate parameters, a log-normal prior with mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0.6 was used, with a half-normal prior with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.13 for the molecular clock rate, using a strict clock model for the rate of evolution across the tree. Two demographic tree models, constant population size101 and exponential growth102, were compared by marginal likelihood estimation using path-sampling103 and a constant population model was deemed more appropriate.

MCMC chains were run for 100 million generations sampled every 100,000 generations and convergence was assessed using Tracer (v.1.7)104, ensuring effective sample sizes (ESS) greater than 500 for all parameters. Maximum clade credibility trees were then made using 10% burn-in and medium node heights. The resulting trees were plotted using ggtree105.

Each bulk sample is represented by a set of clonal mutations found during the deconvolution of WGS data (see above). Where a mutation was deemed absent in the clonal peak, the reference nucleotide was used. Mutational signature assignment106 was used to select mutations in the clock-like SBS1 channel107. BEAST (v1.10)108 was then used with the simple binary substitution model (as SBS1 effectively represents just C-to-T substitutions), a strict clock model, a constant population size prior101 and a flat prior on the age of MRCA (from zero to earliest patient sample), with ancestral state estimation at the root. Chains were run and ESS values assessed as described above. The distances between the ancestral state of the root at each MCMC state and the clock rate were used to calculate the expected evolution distance between the root and the known germline. This was used to inform the length of the branch between germline (at birth) and the MRCA of the samples.

Clinical analyses were performed in CLL for TTFT and overall survival from the time of sampling. Tumour growth rate (θ), effective population size (Ne) and epigenetic switching rates were analysed as continuous variables in univariate Cox regression models for both TTFT and overall survival. The effect size of HRs for each evolutionary variable were analysed considering different scaling factors. In particular, the growth rate was analysed assuming exponential growth (that is, for θ = 1, the population is e = 2.71 times bigger per year), the Ne was considered per million cells, and the cancer age or time from the MRCA was analysed for each 10 years. Individual switching rate parameters (μ, ν, γ and ζ) were largely uninformative of prognosis and were summarized into a mean epigenetic switching rate, which was scaled by a factor of 100. In addition, growth rate and effective population were analysed as continuous variables in multivariate Cox regression models together with TP53 aberrations (considering mutations and deletions together), IGHV gene mutational status and the age of patients at sampling. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated for low and high growth rates and effective population size within IGHV subtypes using maximally selected log-rank statistic using the maxstats package (v0.7-25). P values from Kaplan–Meier curves were derived using the log-rank statistic. Survival (v3.5-7), survminer (v0.4.9) and ggsurvfit (v0.3.1) packages were used under R (v4.3.1). Plots were generated using ggplot2 (v3.5.2).

Historical records of the absolute number of lymphocytes in blood obtained via haemocytometer were collected for patients with CLL over the whole disease course (that is, an approximate of the number of malignant CLL cells in blood). In 231 patients with CLL, we could obtain at least 10 sample timepoints (that is, at least 10 medical appointments, median n = 27 and mean n = 34) before the first treatment, allowing us to track the natural history of the disease before treatment intervention for the tumour (Supplementary Fig. 10). We fitted a linear model to all 231 cases and obtained the slope of the observed log number of lymphocytes (that is, the coefficient of the univariate linear model) and compared it with growth rate estimates derived from EVOFLUx.

Statistical tests performed throughout the study were performed as two-sided. Appropriate multiple test correction, such as the Holm–Sidak correction, is noted when applied.

T.A.G. and J.I.M.-S. conceived, funded and supervised the study. C.G. and T.A.G. conceived and designed the modelling scheme and the Bayesian inference framework, with support from C.P.B.; C.G. implemented and ran this. M.D.-F. processed and curated DNA methylation and patient metadata, and performed the survival analysis. M.D.-F. and C.G. conceived the phylogenetic analysis; C.G., H.E.G. and D.M. designed and ran them. C.G., M.D.-F., H.E.G., J.H. and F.N. performed the bioinformatic analysis. M.M., S.H., E.R. and I.G.G. performed the experiments and primary analyses of the long-read nanopore sequencing data.

a: fCpGs were selected by combining three filters: (1) CpGs with low intra-disease heterogeneity were removed as sites that were likely not fluctuating, (2) CpGs with a mean methylation far from 0.5 were removed as likely belonging to CpG sites with skewed methylation/demethylation rates, and (3i) CpGs which preserved the nearest-neighbour graph (quantified using the Laplacian Score) were removed as sites that were likely under selection/strict regulation. b-d: Heatmaps of b: Horvath's CpGs72, c: epiCMIT CpGs14, and d: random subset of 1,000 CpGs from the candidate CpGs on the bead array. e-i: Heatmaps of our set of 978 pan-lymphoid fCpGs with disease-specific subtypes annotated in: e chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), f B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), g mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), h diffuse large B-cell lymphoma - not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS), and i multiple myeloma (MM).

Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events1,2,3,4. Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events5,6. Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8.

Human-induced global warming not only causes long-term changes of state variables, energy and water fluxes in the Earth system but also manifests through climate extremes9. Every region of the world exhibits changes in intensity and frequency of extreme weather and climate events10,11, and events that were near impossible in the past are now occurring10,12. To assess the extent of contribution of climate change to these events, the field of extreme event attribution (EEA) has developed over the past years, through approaches promoted by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative1 and other methods2,3,4.

These approaches have been used to study many individual extreme events13, often showing an important contribution of climate change. However, to our knowledge, there is no framework to systematically and collectively conduct attribution exercises on a set of events identified in past records14, implying that impactful extreme events may still not be assessed.

Moreover, EEA studies typically attribute events to climate change, but rarely to its causes5,6. Extending EEA to source attribution provides the quantification of the causal chain from emitters to climate extremes. It has been proven unambiguously that anthropogenic activities are largely responsible for climate change, and that combustion of fossil fuels is the main contributor15. Three categories of emitters may be used: countries5, individuals6 or businesses. In the first case, the source allocation of emissions can be based on the territorial origin of emissions produced within country borders16,17. Consumption-based allocations can be pursued, as well as approaches based on individual emission profiles6,18. Finally, emissions can also be allocated to businesses that directly profit from fossil fuel production or other high-emitting activities19,20,21,22,23,24. Businesses with particularly high emission profiles are referred as carbon majors, encompassing not only investor-owned companies (for example, ExxonMobil) but also state-owned companies (for example, Saudi Aramco) or nation-state producers (for example, the former Soviet Union)19.

Here, we address both issues: the lack of systematic attribution of extreme events and the absence of quantitative analysis establishing a causal chain from individual emitters to these events. We build on an existing and widely used EEA framework1, systematizing the approach. We assess how much climate change has contributed to 213 heatwaves reported in the international disaster database EM-DAT over 2000–2023, owing to their particularly significant impact, most of which were previously unattributed. Then, we build on existing approaches to assess contributions to climate change5,6, extending the attribution upstream to the emitters. We assess how much the emissions of the 180 biggest carbon majors19 contributed to global mean surface temperature and to the likelihood and severity of historical heatwaves.

In the EM-DAT database (www.emdat.be), 226 heatwaves are reported over 2000–2023, across 63 countries (Fig. 1a). These events were reported because of significant economic losses or casualties, a declaration of state of emergency or a call for international assistance. These societal impacts warrant their relevance for event attribution. Despite EM-DAT being the most widely used disaster database, the reporting of heatwaves across countries is highly uneven, with only nine heatwaves out of 226 reported over Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, although these regions are also prone to heatwaves10. This known reporting bias in the EM-DAT database25 calls for more complete reporting to enable a more exhaustive analysis.

a, The number of heatwaves reported per country in EM-DAT (www.emdat.be) over 2000–2023. An EEA is performed for each of them, as shown for four examples with ERA5 (ref. 28) data. b, The 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome. c, The 2003 heatwave in France. d, The 2022 Indian heatwave. e, The 2013 eastern China heatwave. For each example, the average temperatures during the event are mapped, with the outlines of the reported region (lime green contours). Moreover, the intensity (average temperature T (°C) during the period and the region of the event) and change in GMST (°C) are represented over 1950–2023 (black dots), with their conditional distribution represented through the median (red line) and ranges of the distribution (red shading). Finally, the change in intensity and change in return period (year) compared with the preindustrial reference period are shown for each example. Uncertainties inferred using bootstrapping are not shown here for the sake of clarity. Further details are provided in the Methods.

Each of these heatwaves is systematically characterized and analysed in a consistent framework, following the method promoted by the WWA initiative1. This method is shown with the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021 as reported for the United States (Fig. 1b), thus without British Columbia in Canada. This event was reported in Oregon, Washington, Northern California, Idaho and Western Nevada over 26–30 June 2021 (www.emdat.be). Usually, EEA defines the heatwave with a box surrounding the region1. Here the heatwave is defined using the exact spatial characterization in the EM-DAT database, as it represents how the disaster was experienced by the local populations1 (Fig. 1b). Daily temperatures are averaged over this period and region for every year of available observations. Although many indicators could be used to characterize the heatwave26, the choice of the average over the period is motivated by its relevance for the reported impact rather than its meteorological rarity (Methods). Following the method by WWA1 and justified by the extreme value theory27, a statistical relationship can be inferred that links the probability distribution of the event to the change in global mean surface temperature1 (GMST) (Fig. 1b). This relationship allows us to calculate the probability and the intensity of the heatwave, both under observed conditions with climate change and under the preindustrial climate of 1850–1900 without such perturbations (Fig. 1b). Using both observation-derived estimates (ERA5 (ref. 28) and BEST (ref. 29)) and Earth system models30, these results synthesize how climate change has affected the heatwave through a change in intensity and how many times more likely the event has become, which is called the probability ratio1. More details on the systematization of the WWA approach are provided in the Methods. Using only ERA528, the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021 over the United States had climate change increasing its intensity by 4.4 °C compared with that in 1850–1900, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2–6.8 °C. Adding all other datasets29,30 relevant for the region decreases the influence of climate change to a change in intensity of the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021 over the United States of 3.1 °C (1.4–5.1 °C). The median estimate indicates that climate change has also increased the probability of heatwaves by more than 10,000, and at least seven times according to the lower bound of the confidence interval. This attribution is consistent with existing works on this heatwave: a previous work31 found a probability ratio of at least 150 and a change in intensity of 2.0 °C (1.2– 2.8 °C), whereas another analysis32 suggested a change in intensity of more than 2.9 °C. Although consistent, the results differ because of the characterization of the event and its very unlikely nature. The region and period are here determined through the reporting of the disaster for relevance to the impact rather than choices motivated by its meteorological rarity. Choosing the maximum temperature as an indicator over the period amplifies the extremeness of the event32,33. Very unlikely events such as the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021 are more difficult to investigate, increasing the dispersion across several analysis34. However, this increased dispersion does not lower the confidence in the conclusion, which is the strong influence of climate change on these unlikely events. The method described for this event is applied to the 226 heatwaves, with three other cases shown in Fig. 1c–e, with the results also consistent with available attribution studies.

Additional tests are conducted to assess the adequacy of the method for each event. The goodness of fit is assessed, validating 217 out of the 226 heatwaves, whereas the remaining nine are removed from the ensuing analysis. Furthermore, although there are strong physical justifications that GMST has a causal link to the heatwave1,10, this statistical model does not necessarily imply statistical causation. Thus, we also infer the non-linear Granger causality4. For 214 out of the 217 heatwaves, we prove with more than 95% certainty that GMST is a Granger-causing indicator of the heatwave. The three other events are removed from the ensuing analysis. Finally, another heatwave is removed because of the ensuing analysis related to the carbon majors. All details on these tests are provided in the Methods.

Our analysis shows that human-induced climate change has contributed to increasing the intensity of all 213 heatwaves analysed here (Fig. 2). With reference to 1850–1900, the median estimates for the changes in intensity range across events from +0.3 °C to +2.9 °C. The latter is the heatwave introduced in Fig. 1b, the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021 over the United States, whereas the heatwave with the mildest change in intensity occurred in Pakistan in June 2000. Over the study period, attributed heatwaves have become more and more intense (Fig. 2a–c). The median of the events shows that climate change has increased the intensity by 1.4 °C over 2000–2009, 1.7 °C over 2010–2019 and 2.2 °C over 2020–2023. This is consistent with GMST increasing by more than 0.2 °C per decade over the study period, and land warming faster35.

Each heatwave is allocated a category depending on its change in intensity (colour) and its probability ratio (vertical bars in per cent) with reference to 1850–1900. a–c, Events are categorized based on the year of the event: 78 heatwaves attributed over 2000–2009 (a), 54 heatwaves attributed over 2010–2019 (b) and 81 heatwaves attributed over 2020–2023 (c). Median results are shown here. Further details on the attribution of each heatwave event are provided in the Methods, and all results are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Apart from increasing the intensity, climate change has also increased the probability of all 213 heatwaves. The lowest probability ratio is observed for the heatwave of May 2006 in India, in which the event became only 22% more likely. However, the median estimates show that climate change has made 55 heatwaves out of 213 (26%) at least 10,000 times more likely, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 7 to 158. This probability ratio is equivalent to saying that these heatwaves would have been virtually impossible without anthropogenic influence. Over the study period, the contribution of climate change to the likelihood of these events is also increasing (Fig. 2a–c). Figure 2 shows that the probability ratios of the heatwaves are shifting from low values to higher values, although this trend is highly affected by natural variability. The median probability ratios show that, with reference to 1850–1900, climate change made heatwaves about 20 times more likely over 2000–2009, and about 200 times more likely over 2010–2019. Overall, this systematic attribution of 213 heatwaves enhances the capacity of EEA for analyses across events, proving that climate change made all events more intense and more likely, and that this influence is increasing over time with increased global warming.

EEA has been extensively used to quantify how human-induced climate change influences extreme events13. A growing literature has also investigated the contributions of anthropogenic actors to climate change16,18,21. However, the quantification of the causal chain from individual emitters to the extreme events has only been pursued in selected cases5,6. Here we build on established approaches while also introducing key methodological advancements in the decomposition (Methods) and developing the framework for simultaneous investigation over a large set of events. Unlike previous works that focus on emissions by countries5 or individuals6, we here investigate the attribution of emissions from businesses and specifically the carbon majors. Following established approaches20,21,22,23, we assign to each carbon major the emissions associated with the full value chain of their products, including all emissions in line with established accounting and reporting standards for corporates. This modelling choice aims at filling a gap in the scientific literature and does not preclude broader reflections on emission allocations and business responsibilities20.

The emissions from carbon majors are estimated from company production records and associated emission factors19, leading to a dataset that provides CO2 and CH4 emissions for 180 carbon majors over 1854–2023 (Fig. 3a). Altogether, the emissions from these carbon majors represent 57% of the total cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions, including land use over the 1850–2023 period36. When considering only the emissions from fossil fuels and cement, the emissions from these carbon majors represent 75% of the cumulative CO2 emissions over 1850–2023 (ref. 36). The carbon majors have heterogeneous contributions to the CO2 emissions. The 14 top carbon majors (the former Soviet Union, People's Republic of China for coal, Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, ExxonMobil, Chevron, National Iranian Oil Company, BP, Shell, India for coal, Pemex, CHN Energy, People's Republic of China for cement) represent 30% of the total cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions, including land use, about as much as the 166 other carbon majors combined (27%). From a national perspective, 33 carbon majors are headquartered in the United States, accounting for 10% of the total CO2 emissions, and 33 carbon majors are headquartered in China (12% of the total CO2 emissions).

a,b, Contributions of the carbon majors to the cumulative CO2 emission since 1850 (all sectors) (a) as reported in the Carbon Majors database (https://carbonmajors.org/) and compared with the Global Carbon Budget36 and the ensuing GMST as simulated by the OSCAR model (b). The GMST of ERA528 and BEST29 have been rebased to 1850–1900 (ref. 9). c–q, Attribution of historical heatwaves to the emissions of carbon majors for 15 selected carbon majors. In each of these panels, the 213 heatwaves are allocated into categories of contributions of the carbon majors to the change in intensity (colours) and how many times the carbon major increased the likelihood of the heatwave compared to 1850–1900 (x-axis). The results are shown through the median, but all results are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Based on the CO2 and CH4 emissions of the carbon majors, we compute the contributions of these carbon majors to GMST. Climate models may be used to calculate climate change over the historical period, but also counterfactual worlds, such as a world in which a given carbon major would not have emitted. The difference informs how much this single actor has warmed the Earth over time. This method has already been applied to a former version of this database using a simple impulse-response model for CO2 (ref. 21). Here we use the reduced-complexity Earth system model OSCAR, for its non-linear representation of both the carbon cycle and the atmospheric chemistry of methane, as well as its capacity to integrate observational constraints to improve the robustness of the assessment37 (Methods).

Closely aligned with the estimates based on IPCC methodologies35, we estimate an increase in GMST of about 1.30 °C in 2023 with respect to 1850–1900 (ref. 28), of which 0.67 °C is due to the emissions of all carbon majors and 0.33 °C is due to the emissions of the 14 biggest carbon majors (Fig. 3b). The unattributed 0.63 °C is due to other actors responsible for unaccounted fossil fuel burning, agricultural and land-use activities, other industrial processes, as well as to non-attributed greenhouse gases (N2O and halogenated species) and short-lived climate forcers. For comparison, a former assessment associates 0.40 °C in 2010 with 90 carbon majors21, whereas we find 0.48 °C with 180 carbon majors in 2010.

Knowing the contributions of the carbon majors to GMST and knowing the relationship between GMST and the heatwaves from the event attribution, we subsequently compute how each carbon major has affected each heatwave (for details, see the Methods). For each heatwave, the total effect of climate change on the intensity and probability of the event is decomposed into the contributions from individual carbon majors and the combined effect of other unidentified contributors, anthropogenic and natural.

Contributions from carbon majors to the intensities of all heatwaves range from 0 °C to 0.18 °C (Fig. 3c–k). As expected, the higher the emissions from a carbon major, the higher its contributions to the intensities of the heatwaves. The median contributions to heatwaves from the 14 top carbon majors range from 0.01 °C to 0.09 °C. The other carbon majors have lower contributions, although the 166 of them combined have about the same importance as the biggest carbon majors. We calculate the influence of carbon majors on heatwaves reported over each decade of our dataset. With reference to 1850–1900, climate change has increased the median intensity of heatwaves by 1.36 °C over 2000–2009, of which 0.44 °C is traced back to the 14 top carbon majors and 0.22 °C to the 166 others. These contributions correspond, respectively, to 32% and 16% of the overall effect of climate change. Over 2010–2019, the influence of climate change increased to 1.68 °C, with 0.47 °C (28%) from the 14 top carbon majors and 0.38 °C (22%) from the 166 others. These results show that the emissions of carbon major contributed to about half of the increase in intensity of heatwaves since preindustrial times, and that this contribution is rising.

Apart from intensities, all the carbon majors have also increased the probability of all the heatwaves. For heatwaves that climate change made only slightly more likely, or for carbon majors with much lower emissions, the contributions are limited to an increase by 10% of the preindustrial probability. However, there are heatwaves that the carbon majors have made at least 10,000 times more likely compared with preindustrial levels, and which would have otherwise been virtually impossible without anthropogenic influence. Even relatively minor shares in total emissions lead to very substantial increases in the frequency of these events. Specifically, emissions associated with the biggest emitter, the former Soviet Union, have made 53 heatwaves (25%) at least 10,000 times more likely. For the smallest carbon major by emissions, Elgaugol, this is still the case for 16 heatwaves (8%). It means that the sole emissions of these carbon majors would have rendered possible these heatwaves otherwise virtually impossible.

We have systematized the process of EEA, based on the widely used method promoted by the WWA initiative1. We achieve the analysis of 213 heatwaves, thus extending the coverage of existing event attribution studies. We validate the goodness of fit and the causality for each of these events. We show that climate change has increased the probability and intensity of all these heatwaves. Owing to the consistent protocol across all events, their meta-analysis over time shows that the extremeness of the heatwaves is rising more and more rapidly because of climate change, both in intensity and probability.

We also extend the attribution analysis upstream along the causal chain, providing a coherent attribution to individual emissions on the company level for 180 carbon majors. The contributions of the carbon majors are very heterogeneous, with 14 carbon majors (the former Soviet Union, People's Republic of China for coal, Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, ExxonMobil, Chevron, National Iranian Oil Company, BP, Shell, India for coal, Pemex, CHN Energy, People's Republic of China for cement) contributing as much as the 166 others. Considering all reporting heatwaves, we show that carbon majors represent about half of the change in intensity since 1850–1900 and that their contributions are rising, in particular the ones of the smaller carbon majors. The analysis of their contributions to the probabilities of the heatwaves shows that although the contributions scale well with their cumulative emissions, smaller carbon majors cannot be neglected. Depending on the carbon major, between 16 and 53 of these heatwaves are made possible with the sole contribution of the smaller carbon majors.

Although this assessment builds on well-established methods, there are still two limitations in this work. Although the EM-DAT is the most complete existing database for disasters, many heatwaves are still not reported, calling for a more exhaustive coverage of the events. Moreover, the contributions of the carbon majors remain incomplete. On the one hand, not all CO2 and CH4 emissions are covered in this database because of underreporting19. For instance, this database represents only 75% of the fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions reported over 1850–2023 (ref. 36). The actual contributions of the carbon majors are thus expected to be higher if all the emissions from fossil fuel and cement producers are included. On the other hand, the burning of fossil fuels can release aerosols that would have a local effect on the climate. As a whole, the aerosols emitted by the fossil fuel sector reduce their contribution by approximately 10% (ref. 38). However, attributing aerosol climate effects to individual companies would be highly challenging. The effects of aerosols on climate are local to regional, yet fossil fuels are globally traded. Furthermore, aerosol emissions from fossil fuel combustion strongly depend on the use of filter technology, which differs between regions, sectors and combustion techniques. If these challenges are overcome, it would pave the way for attributing the aerosol health effects to individual emitters. Aerosols are also harmful air pollutants, with the emissions by the use of fossil fuel causing about 5 million excess deaths per year (ref. 39). Accounting for these effects remains beyond the scope of our analysis.

Our framework could be adapted to other physical hazards, such as ocean acidity22, sea-level rise40, fires41 or droughts42. Extending the attribution from physical hazards to societal impacts remains a challenge. We may use directly the fraction of attributable risk to deduce the fraction of the impact imputed to the actor6, but it neglects complex and non-linear aspects related to the vulnerability and the exposure to the hazard43. Nevertheless, this attribution framework may be extended to heat-related mortality44 or economic damages24. Finally, other top-down approaches can complement our findings45.

These results are relevant not only in the scientific community but also for climate policy, litigation and wider efforts concerning corporate accountability8. Climate-related legal proceedings are proliferating, with defendants seeking compensation for losses and damages or requiring more ambitious climate actions from corporations and nations8. However, the scientific evidence backing the claims is often lagging behind the state of the art in climate science, thus failing to adequately draw causality links7. Although this work aims at filling in scientific gaps, the results also fill in evidentiary gaps. This systematic attribution improves the coverage in extreme events, thus reinforcing the potential of attribution science for climate litigation7,43. Furthermore, if the fact that fossil fuels are the main driver of climate change has been unambiguously established15,36, as acknowledged by the carbon majors themselves46,47,48, proving and quantifying the causality from the emitters to the events provides important new resources to assess legal responsibilities. Further strengthening of the links between climate scientists, legal scholars and practitioners is beneficial to ensure that the overwhelming scientific literature is correctly accounted for49.

From the EM-DAT database, we select the events only after 2000, because the reporting is more complete after this date25,50, and since climate change has been shown to exert increasing influence on extremes over this period51.

The locations reported for the events in the EM-DAT database are names of cities, provinces, states or whole countries (for example, France). Geographical boundaries are necessary for the analysis, so the locations of EM-DAT are matched to spatial elements from GADM52 using the following algorithm.

The reported ISO code is used to pre-select the spatial elements of GADM for the country and any attached disputed territories.

The reported location is prepared: replacing spatial characters (accents, numbers and punctuation); removing extra spaces; lowercase letters for all characters; synthesizing specific sentences (for example, ‘Kadamjay district in Batken oblast' becoming ‘Kadamjay'); correcting for any change in regional aggregation (for example, ‘Haute & Basse Normandie' becoming ‘Normandie'); translating any region without its variant in GADM (for example, ‘Voreio Aigaio' becoming ‘North Aegean').

Each preselected spatial element is compared with each element of the prepared reported location by applying a character matcher53 on its names and variants.

Each retained spatial element is filtered using a prepared list of false positives. For instance, the location for the state of ‘Ohio' triggers the identification of the county ‘Ohio' in the states of Kentucky and West Virginia, which have not been reported.

The list of spatial elements is compared with the initial reported location, checking whether it matches correctly. If not, the issue is implemented through the prepared lists of known issues in steps 2 and 4.

Another work, the dataset GDIS, is also used to match EM-DAT locations to geographical boundaries54. Both approaches have been developed independently. GDIS differs in that the locations of all categories of hazards are analysed, but only up to 2018. Here, only the hazards for heatwaves were analysed, but up to 2023. Moreover, GDIS uses GADM v.3.6, whereas our work uses GADM v.4.1.

In the EM-DAT database, the dates of the heatwaves are often reported with the starting and ending days. When both days are provided, we use the average of the daily average temperature over this exact period. Other indicators may be possible26, but the average aggregates the essential features of these heatwaves55. In particular, this choice is motivated by its relevance for the reported impact rather than its meteorological rarity. Heatwaves affect local populations not only through daily maximum temperatures but also through lack of cooling at night, which can be estimated using daily average temperatures. Sustaining high temperatures over time modifies the impact of a heatwave as well, justifying the use of averages over the period of the heatwave rather than its peak. The annual indicator is calculated first on each grid point, then averaged over the defined region to maximize the relevance of the indicator1,56. Furthermore, some events were reported without the starting and/or ending day(s). We observe that heatwaves reporting both days and lasting less than a month last on average for 8 days. Therefore, we use as an indicator for events with missing days the maximum of the 8 days running average over the reported month. In the case that several months were reported with missing starting and/or ending days, we lengthen the duration of the running average by 1 month for each supplementary month reported.

The statistical model of attribution studies is carefully chosen to model the frequencies and intensities of extreme events1,56. To capture possible trends and non-stationarities, the distribution depends on the parameters driven by explanatory variables. In this study, we opt for the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with a linear evolution of its location as outlined in equation (1). For every year y in the sample, the average temperature over the period and region of the event Ty is assumed to follow a GEV distribution of location μ, scale σ and shape ξ, whereas the location varies with the change in global mean surface temperature smoothed over the 3 previous years (GMST).

Although the statistical model in equation (1) is common for the EEA of heatwaves1,56, we have compared its performance with other potential models. Apart from this GEV model, we have tested three other distributions with linear and non-linear evolutions of the parameters: Gaussian, skew normal and generalized Pareto. Overall, our comparisons assessed through quantile–quantile plots indicate that the GEV performs the best among the four distributions, especially in terms of upper tail behaviours. We calculate the classical Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to compare their performances while reducing the risk of over-fitting57. We observe that for all heatwaves, a stationary GEV has the lowest BIC. We note that the linear model of equation (1) is not always the best distribution according to the BIC, although the gain in BIC from the linear model to the best solution is always marginal. More quantitatively, the improvement in BIC from the stationary GEV to the linear model represents between 88% and 100% of the improvement from the stationary model to the best solution over all heatwaves analysed, with an average of 98%. In other words, sophisticating further the statistical model would, on average, improve the performance by only 2%. This result confirms that this expression is the most appropriate for most heatwaves.

These fits are obtained by minimization of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of the training sample58. The first guess has its robustness improved using initial regression to approximate the coefficients42,59. The shape parameter is bounded between −0.4 and 0.4 (ref. 1). Moreover, the sample is weighted during minimization of the NLL, with weights equal to the inverse of the density of the GMST. This approach helps in providing equal performance over the full interval of GMST.

The choice of whether to include the event or not when estimating the statistical model has been extensively discussed, although no final consensus has been reached1,31,60. The results presented in this paper have been obtained by estimating the event, to prevent removing points from the observational record. To ensure numerical convergence, a minimum probability of 10−9 was set for each point of the full sample. It implies that the attributed events under factual conditions will not have return periods higher than a thousand million years, which we consider long enough.

Estimating return periods for unlikely events with relatively short observational records remains difficult34; thus, we append additional lines of evidence1,56. Conditional distributions are trained for ERA5, used as reference, but also with BEST29 (Extended Data Fig. 1) and simulations from Climate Model Intercomparison Phase 6 (CMIP6)30,61. The following Earth system models (ESMs) from CMIP6 are used: ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, AWI-CM-1-1-MR, BCC-CSM2-MR, CESM2, CESM2-WACCM, CMCC-CM2-SR5, CMCC-ESM2, CanESM5, EC-Earth3, EC-Earth3-CC, EC-Earth3-Veg, EC-Earth3-Veg-LR, FGOALS-g3, GFDL-CM4, GFDL-ESM4, INM-CM4-8, INM-CM5-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR, KACE-1-0-G, KIOST-ESM, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MRI-ESM2-0, NESM3, NorESM2-LM, NorESM2-MM and TaiESM1. For every heatwave, only the ESMs with sufficient performance are used, as described in the next section. For ERA5 and BEST, we start the time series in 1950 for adequate spatial coverage over all regions62, and these time series finish in 2022 for BEST and 2023 for ERA5. For CMIP6, the time series is calculated over the historical (1850–2014) (ref. 63) and the SSP2-4.5 (2015–2100) (ref. 64). This scenario is chosen because its emissions are the closest to those observed over 2015-202 (ref. 36). Only runs with the initial conditions termed r1i1p1f1 are used, as it was run by most ESMs. Only one ensemble member is used to facilitate the comparison of the parameters and probabilities from ESMs to those based on observations.

During the extreme event analysis, two sources of uncertainties are handled—namely, on the conditional distributions and on the handling of observations and simulations.

During the training of conditional distributions, the uncertainties on the parameters are obtained using an ensemble of 1,000 bootstrapped members, with replacements allowed during the resampling. The conditional distributions are then used to assess the probabilities and intensities of the event, under a factual climate and a counterfactual climate. The factual climate is defined as the GMST observed at the time of the event. The counterfactual climate is defined as the average of the GMST over 1850–1900.

ESMs exhibit different performance in reproducing local climates; thus, not all models may be useful for event attribution1. We calculate the seasonalities of ERA5 and each ESM over 1950–2020 in each grid point over the region. We then average their correlation. The most appropriate ESMs are the 10 most representative ESMs that maximize this average correlation.

Following the WWA approach, not all models are retained for further analysis1,65. The factual distributions at the time of the event are compared with those of ERA5. Both the scale and the shape parameters of ERA5 and the model must have their 95% confidence intervals overlapping. Otherwise, the model will be discarded. Thus, the overall selection process is to sort the ESMs by correlation with ERA5 seasonality, remove those with parameters inconsistent with ERA5 and select the 10 best ESMs in this list.

At this point, probability ratios and change in intensities are obtained for an ensemble of datasets, each with uncertainties. To synthesize over this large ensemble, equal weights are given to each bootstrap member of ERA5 and BEST, summarized into one distribution for observations. All kept ESMs are also given equal weights and summarized into one distribution for models. Finally, these distributions are averaged to deduce the median and 95% confidence intervals. We point out that synthesizing these lines of evidence could be conducted with other approaches1, although without affecting the main messages of this work.

Although using a non-stationary GEV with its location varying linearly with GMST is a well-established approach for EEA to statistically model extremes under global warming, this setup may not be well-suited in isolated cases66. To ensure that the GEV model represents the data adequately, the goodness of fit is verified for each conditional distribution used in this analysis with the method used in ref. 67.

For every heatwave, several datasets are used for analysis, from which conditional distributions are fitted. The location and scale of each of these fitted conditional distributions are used to transform the respective training sample onto a stationary GEV(0, 1, ξ) with the same shape as the fitted conditional distribution. This transformed sample has observed quantiles, which are compared with the theoretical quantiles of a GEV(0, 1, ξ) in a quantile–quantile plot. This quantile–quantile plot describes how well the GEV model describes the sample. The uncertainty in the GEV parameters determines a confidence band in the quantiles around the identity line, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2.

The fraction of the sample out of the confidence band is deduced, estimated as a 95% confidence interval on the ensemble obtained from bootstrapping of the training of the conditional distribution. For each heatwave, the ensemble of conditional distributions is compared with an out-of-sample threshold at 5%. The results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. If the median out-of-sample fraction across the conditional distributions is below the threshold, the goodness of fit is confirmed, and the heatwave is kept for the ensuing analysis. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 3, 217 heatwaves are retained, and nine are removed from the ensuing analysis. These nine events removed from analysis are summarized in Extended Data Table 1.

Out of the nine events, eight occurred in India, and the last one occurred in Japan. In the 217 heatwaves kept for analysis, eight events occurred in India. Besides this apparent regional clustering, no discernible traits emerge with regard to the season or length of the heatwave. More research is required to investigate why these fits do not perform as well as elsewhere for these specific events, which lies beyond the scope of this study.

The well-established approach1 for EEA combines observations and simulations by using non-stationary distributions. These distributions correlate the evolution of the climate indicator T for the heatwave to GMST. Deducing causality, that climate change caused the event, using this correlation relies on the strong physics-based understanding5,6,31,41,65,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97 that increasing GMST tends to also increase regional temperatures, not only through its mean but also through the whole distribution inferred from natural variability, thus shifting the regional extremes as well. Yet, although there is a strong physical basis for this causality, we can also investigate the validity of this causality from a statistical perspective. Using Granger causal inference98, we may assess the predictive relationship between GMST and T, the climate indicator of the event4.

The common approach for Granger causality4,98 requires that the input variables are stationary to train vector auto-regressive models99. This is usually verified by differentiating the variables, in other words, taking the interannual variability. This method would then assess whether the interannual variability of GMST can predict the interannual variability of T, thus focusing on the predictability of short-term shocks. However, the trend contains a stronger signal compared with the interannual variability. To account for long-term trends in GMST and T, Granger causality can be generalized using the vector error correction model (VECM)100. It requires the search for an adequate VECM model based on the Akaike information criterion101 and a co-integration test, for instance, using a Johansen test99. Nevertheless, this method still fails to account for non-linear effects. An alternative is to use machine learning, such as Random Forest models trained to predict T with GMST through their lagged effects102. Permutation tests are conducted to assess the performance of Random Forest models trained on permuted lagged GMST, compared with the non-permuted version103. Applying this method accounts for the evolution of GMST and T, while also accounting for non-linear effects.

By using the latter method, only three events have a median value for the test above 0.05. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 4, for 214 events out of 217, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the evolution of GMST is Granger-causing the evolution of T. The three other events are listed in Extended Data Table 2. We notice that the median value for the Granger causality remains relatively low. Using IPCC terms, it is likely (>66%) that GMST Granger-caused the evolution of T for the event in the United States in 2011, whereas it is very likely (>90%) for all the others. These three events are removed from this analysis.

The contributions of emissions of the carbon majors to global mean surface temperature are assessed with the reduced-complexity Earth system model OSCARv3.3 (refs. 104,105). The model embeds an ensemble of modules that replicate the behaviour of models of higher complexity105. OSCAR features the ocean and land carbon cycles with a bookkeeping module for CO2 emissions from land use and land cover change, wetlands, permafrost, tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and global and regional climate responses to these forcers. It accounts for the effects of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O and 37 halogenated compounds), short-lived climate forcers (stratospheric water vapour, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, primary and secondary organic aerosols, nitrates, sulfates and black carbon), surface albedo change, volcanic activity, solar radiation and contrails37,105.

OSCAR is run over the historical period (1750–2023), following three sets of simulations: (1) The first set of simulations is driven by concentrations of greenhouse gases to ensure a match with the latest observations. (2) The second set is driven by emissions, using the compatible emissions from the first set obtained through mass balance106,107. This is a control run that confirms that the estimated compatible emissions lead to the observed atmospheric concentrations and is used as a reference for the following attribution runs. (3) In the third set of simulations, for each carbon major, the control run is repeated, but the CO2 and CH4 emissions of the major are subtracted from the compatible emissions. The difference in outcome (for example, global temperature) between the control and this simulation gives the contribution of the major. This approach is called a residual attribution method108.

In all simulations, the radiative forcings from species or forcers that are neither CO2 nor CH4 (that is, forcers that are not attributed in this study) are prescribed as global time series based on the latest version of the Indicators of Global Climate Change35. Global time series of atmospheric concentrations for the first set of simulations come from the same source. Emissions of short-lived species (that affect the atmospheric sink of CH4) are taken from the latest version of the CEDS dataset109,110 and the updated GFED4s dataset111 that extends the original CMIP6 emissions from biomass burning112. Land use and land cover change data are the same as in the latest Global Carbon Budget36, in which we use both an updated LUH2 dataset113 and the FAO-based dataset114.

OSCAR runs in a probabilistic framework to represent the uncertainty in the modelling of the Earth system. This uncertainty is sampled through a Monte Carlo approach with n = 2,400 elements. The uncertainty in the natural processes governing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and CH4 comes from the available parametrizations of OSCAR105,115,116. The uncertainty in the input radiative forcing follows that of the IPCC AR6 (ref. 117) and is applied uniformly to the whole time series. The uncertainty in the input land use and land cover change is sampled by running one-half of the simulations with one dataset and the other half with the other dataset. There is no uncertainty in the input emissions. Finally, the raw uncertainty range from the Monte Carlo is constrained with observational data by weighting the elements of the ensemble based on their distance to the observations in the control simulations37,116. As constraining values, we use decadal CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry over 2012–2021 from the GCB36, decadal anthropogenic CH4 emissions over 2008–2017 from the AR6 (ref. 118) offset with their preindustrial value from PRIMAP third-party-based estimates119,120, and decadal global mean surface temperature change over 2011–2020 from the AR6 (ref. 9).

We assess whether the probability can be written as a sum of terms, with each term associated with contributions from anthropogenic actors or natural drivers.

We define a region in space S. Every year y, the temperature field over the region is averaged over a period p of the year, then over the region S, resulting in the temperature Ty. The heatwave is characterized by the exceedance of the heatwave level u by Ty, with u a real-valued scalar. Ty represents a real-valued continuous random variable (Borel σ-algebra on the reals). Given the heatwave level u, the target probability is a survival function P(Ty > u).

We assume that the probability of the heatwave is conditional on GMTy and that it follows the statistical model introduced in equation (1) and represented in equation (2). Every year, the temperature over the region and the period Ty is sampled from a non-stationary GEV distribution27. The parameters of this GEV distribution are the location μ, the scale σ and the shape ξ. The location varies linearly with a covariate, the change in GMSTy at the corresponding year.

With the analytical expression for the cumulative distribution function of the GEV that follows equation (3):

This well-established statistical model is widely used for EEA1,56 and has already been used extensively for heatwaves. We acknowledge that a more sophisticated model with additional covariates may further improve the performance121,122. However, this statistical model has been shown to have good performance for heatwaves in general13, and additional covariates can prevent the use of climate models as additional lines of evidence. The former section provides additional grounds for the choice of this model.

The causal theory applied to climate change justifies the decomposition of probabilities in a Gaussian case123,124. Given a statistical model built on a non-stationary Gaussian distribution linearly driven by GMST, if GMST can be split into a sum of contributions, then the probabilities can be approximated as a sum of their associated contributions123,124. However, the statistical model presented in equation (2) uses a GEV instead of a Gaussian. Even by attempting to write the decomposition using Bayes's theorem and the inclusion–exclusion principle, the exact analytical form of each term remains challenging. This is mostly because the differences in probability when removing a contribution to GMST depend on the initial value of GMST. In other words, the non-linearity and the high number of terms lead to a solution that cannot be computed exactly.

Instead, we propose to approximate the solution and to investigate the quality of this approximation. The usual approach to calculate contributions to climate change is to run the statistical model with all contributors, then to run it again without one contributor, the difference corresponding to the contributor. This approach is thereafter called All-But-One (ABO). Thus, an emitter e with a contribution to global warming GMSTy,e would contribute to the probability of the event using this approach.

To account for non-linear effects in the decomposition of probabilities, this approach is complemented with a second approach that calculates the difference in GMSTy introduced by adding only the emitter (Add-One-to-None, AON). According to this approach, the emitter e would contribute to the probability of the heatwave as follows:

The approach based on the removal of a single entity (ABO) estimates the contribution of a state perturbed by all the other contributors. The approach based on the addition of a single entity (AON) evaluates the contribution in an unperturbed state, without the other contributors interfering. Given the non-linearity of the system, we expect the physical contribution to be between the two values. We choose to calculate both approaches and average them. This approach, calculated using equation (6), is called the combined ABU & AON (Extended Data Fig. 5).

For each event, the probability is calculated for all datasets for the region and averaged over the datasets. Its 95% confidence interval is calculated using bootstrapping. The total probability of the event is decomposed into contributions of each carbon major, other climate forcers and preindustrial probability. After decomposition, these terms are summed up for comparison with the total probability. The 95% confidence interval is shown for all events, and only one event (Cyprus, May–September 2022) does not reproduce the total probability. This event has been removed from the analysis of extreme events. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 5, the average of ABO and AON provides the best estimate, because it accounts for non-linear effects.

In EEA, probabilities are often communicated using probability ratios, quantifying how many times climate change has made the event more likely. It is calculated using the probability of the event in a preindustrial climate, thus with a GMST averaged over 1850–1900:

Because the contribution of the emitter e to the probability of the heatwave Py,e is a perturbation, the emitter multiplies the probability of the heatwave as in equation (8):

Alternatively to the approach based on GMST, a basic approach would be to assess the contributions directly with the emissions. The fraction in the cumulative emissions at the time of the event would represent the share of responsibility of the carbon major in the causes of the event. This fraction can be used for the change in intensity and the change in probability of the event. This approach can be compared with the principle applied for the attributional life cycle assessments, taking the Earth system as a whole and using the shares in its inputs to trace the perturbation125,126, whereas the approach based on GMST traces the effects of the carbon majors through the Earth system. Therefore, GMST is more similar to the principle of the consequential life cycle assessment. However, the approach based on cumulative emissions has several drawbacks.

First, the carbon majors fuel climate change with CO2 and other compounds, such as CH4. As an approximation, it would still be possible to aggregate these compounds using a global warming potential for fossil CH4.

Then, the carbon cycle partially absorbs the emitted carbon over time. Thus, two companies with the same cumulated emissions may not share the same responsibility, if one has older emissions, thus with a lower contribution to the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Still, these old emissions contributed to warming up the Earth system and saturating the carbon sinks.

Finally, the attribution analysis may not respond linearly to changes in GMST. For our study, heatwaves are represented with a GEV with the location varying linearly with GMST. According to the Transient Climate Response to Emissions (TCRE), the GMST varies almost linearly with cumulative emissions. Thus, the approach based on cumulative emissions would lead to similar results to ours. However, for events for which the distributions do not vary linearly with GMST, as it may for extreme precipitations1,56, non-linearities would be introduced.

To conclude, the approach based on cumulative emissions is an approximation that relies on the linearity of the Earth system. However, this system is not entirely linear, and the TCRE is known as an approximation with its limits127. Under the assumptions that the linearity of the system would be respected, this simple approach would then lead to similar results as those based on the approach used in this work.

a, Number of heatwaves reported per country in EM-DAT over 2000–2023. An extreme event attribution is performed for each of them, as illustrated for four examples with BEST29 data: b, the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, c, the 2003 heatwave in France, d, the 2022 Indian heatwave, and e, the 2013 eastern China heatwave. For each example, the average temperatures during the event are mapped, with the outlines of the reported region (lime green contours). In addition, the intensity (average temperature T (°C) during the period and region of the event) and change in Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST, °C) are represented over 1950–2023 (black dots), with their conditional distribution represented through the median (red line) and ranges of the distribution (red shading). Finally, the change in intensity and change in return period (year) compared to the pre-industrial reference period are shown for each example. Uncertainties inferred using bootstrapping are not shown here for the sake of clarity.

For a perfect fit, the quantiles of the sample (red dots) would be distributed over the identity line (black line). The uncertainties on the shape parameter provide a confidence band for the theoretical quantiles (grey shaded area), while the uncertainties on the location and scale provide a confidence band for the quantiles of the sample (red lines).

For each of the heatwaves and datasets used for analysis, the fraction of sample outside confidence band is calculated (black circles). An event is rejected if the sample has a fraction higher than 5% out of the confidence band (red dashed line). For each heatwave, results are summarized over datasets in boxplots (black box) and the median (purple dot).

For each of the heatwaves and datasets used for analysis, the non-linear Granger causal inference is tested through comparisons of performance of Random Forest models (black circles). The hypothesis of non-causality is rejected if the p-value is lower than 0.05 (red dashed line). For each heatwave, results are summarized over datasets in boxplots (black box) and the median (purple dot).

Each heatwave attributed in this analysis is shown here (coloured dots). The total probability of each event is the result from the attribution analysis. The reconstructed probability results from the decomposition of the probabilities using the three approaches (ABU in yellow, AON in blue, combined in green), then all contributions are summed up to facilitate the comparison. The event in the red box in the upper right corner is the only event for which the decomposition fails.

Monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME)1 and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations2. Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.

In 2020, NASA dispatched the Perseverance rover to Jezero Crater on Mars to investigate and cache surface material. Writing in Nature, Hurowitz et al.1 report Perseverance's observations of small nodules of unusual minerals (Fig. 1) in the clay-rich ‘mudstone' rocks of Neretva Vallis — a valley on the western edge of Jezero Crater, characterized by sedimentary rocks that were deposited by ancient water systems. The findings shed light on the remarkable complexity of the oxidation–reduction (redox) chemistry that took place on ancient Mars, and might provide a fresh perspective on prebiotic chemical processes — reactions that could form a basis for the emergence of life.

The Perseverance rover has explored and sampled igneous and sedimentary rocks within Jezero Crater to characterize early Martian geological processes and habitability and search for potential biosignatures1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Upon entering Neretva Vallis, on Jezero Crater's western edge8, Perseverance investigated distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation. Here we report a detailed geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of these rocks and show that organic-carbon-bearing mudstones in the Bright Angel formation contain submillimetre-scale nodules and millimetre-scale reaction fronts enriched in ferrous iron phosphate and sulfide minerals, likely vivianite and greigite, respectively. This organic carbon appears to have participated in post-depositional redox reactions that produced the observed iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide minerals. Geological context and petrography indicate that these reactions occurred at low temperatures. Within this context, we review the various pathways by which redox reactions that involve organic matter can produce the observed suite of iron-, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing minerals in laboratory and natural environments on Earth. Ultimately, we conclude that analysis of the core sample collected from this unit using high-sensitivity instrumentation on Earth will enable the measurements required to determine the origin of the minerals, organics and textures it contains.

NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is the first in a sequence of missions designed to return a scientifically selected suite of Martian rock, regolith and atmosphere samples to Earth for laboratory investigation. The goals of the mission are to explore the Jezero Crater landing site and its surroundings, constrain the geologic history and habitability of the site, seek signs of past life, and prepare a cache of samples for potential return to Earth1. The Perseverance rover carries an instrument payload designed to fulfil these goals, with the capability to characterize rock targets, their submillimetre-scale textural attributes, and potential organic and inorganic biosignatures, placing these features into an outcrop-scale context1.

Perseverance has explored three geologic terrains in Jezero Crater (Supplementary Fig. 1): (1) the crater floor, which includes lava flows and igneous cumulates that have experienced aqueous alteration under a variety of conditions2,3; (2) the Western Fan, a sequence of sedimentary rocks derived from mafic to ultramafic sources and deposited in a fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine setting4,5,6; (3) the Margin Unit, a layered-to-massive sequence of rocks with strong orbital spectroscopic signatures of olivine and carbonate that is exposed between the crater rim and the Western Fan7. This study focuses on a suite of rocks exposed in Neretva Vallis, a valley incised through the Jezero Crater rim and Margin Unit, which was the feeder channel for the Western Fan8 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Perseverance initially explored a distinct, bright-toned outcrop exposed on the northern margin of Neretva Vallis. This outcrop area is informally named ‘Bright Angel' (Fig. 1a). In High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images of this deposit, albedo variations appeared to indicate layering at the metre scale. Subsequently, Perseverance explored strata exposed along the southern margin of Neretva Vallis, in an area informally named ‘Masonic Temple' (Fig. 1a), where rocks with similar characteristics crop out. As described below, the outcrops in these areas share many characteristics and are referred to collectively as the Bright Angel formation. Subsurface structures detected by the Radar Imager for Mars' subsurface experiment (RIMFAX) ground-penetrating radar (GPR; Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2) can be interpreted to indicate that the Bright Angel formation lies stratigraphically above the Margin Unit, but at the present time, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Bright Angel formation represents a part of an older unit.

This mosaic was collected on sol 1178 from the location of the Walhalla Glades target before abrasion. Upslope, about 110 m distant, the approximate location of the Beaver Falls workspace (containing the targets Cheyava Falls, Apollo Temple and Steamboat Mountain and the Sapphire Canyon sample) is shown. Downslope, about 50 m distant, the approximate location of the target Grapevine Canyon is also shown.

The Bright Angel formation consists of approximately metre-scale blocks formed by fracturing and physical weathering of the exposed outcrop (Fig. 1b). In RIMFAX GPR profiles, radar-reflective layers express a range of apparent dip angles, from horizontal up to about 30° at the northern contact with the Margin Unit (Supplementary Fig. 2). The Bright Angel formation appears to be subdivided into concave-upwards to flat-lying bodies of layered rock lying within the Neretva Vallis channel (Supplementary Fig. 2). Assuming that the observed layer orientations formed during deposition of the Bright Angel formation, the topographically highest-standing outcrops near the contact with the Margin Unit are stratigraphically lower than outcrops farther from the contact.

A representative example of Bright Angel formation outcrop is visible in the ‘Beaver Falls' workspace (Fig. 2). Here, the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) and Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and Engineering (WATSON), SuperCam, and Mastcam-Z instruments (Methods) analysed a rock containing the targets ‘Cheyava Falls' and ‘Apollo Temple' and a core sample, named ‘Sapphire Canyon', was subsequently collected. In this rock, centimetre-scale, reddish-to-tan-coloured, recessive layers are separated by thinner, relatively resistant, light-toned layers (Figs. 2 and 3a). The layers in this rock dip more steeply and strike at an angle to layers in the nearby outcrop, implying that it may have been displaced from its original orientation. Topographically above but stratigraphically below this rock is a darker-toned rock with a coarsely granular texture, the site of the target ‘Steamboat Mountain' (Fig. 2). This darker-toned rock was investigated as a possible transitional lithology between the Bright Angel formation and the Margin Unit.

In general, macroscopic rock textures in the Bright Angel outcrop area are diverse and complex. Intervals of rock are wind-fluted and massive in appearance (Supplementary Fig. 3a), show large (centimetre scale) nodular features (Supplementary Fig. 3b), and are layered and cross-cut by light-toned erosionally resistant and mineralized fractures and veins (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Primary textures include layered and structureless intervals with limited evidence for transport and deposition by currents, such as cross bedding or plane bed laminations. Across Neretva Vallis, in the Masonic Temple area (Fig. 1a), outcrops express wind-fluted, massive, layered and granular surface textures such as those seen in the Bright Angel area (Supplementary Figs. 4–6). However, the Masonic Temple area also includes poorly sorted conglomerates composed of rounded to subangular millimetre- to centimetre-scale clasts embedded in a fine-grained matrix, as seen in the targets ‘Bass Camp‘ (Supplementary Fig. 7) and ‘Wallace Butte' (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b).

Despite the textural diversity of rocks in the Bright Angel formation, they all contain a fine-grained component, or facies, that comprises much of the rock volume. Individual grains in this facies are not visible in WATSON images (17.9–36.3 μm per pixel) or in SHERLOC Autofocus and Context Imager (ACI) images (10.1 μm per pixel) of the Cheyava Falls target (Fig. 3b,c), indicating grains approximately ≤30–110 μm in diameter, that is, finer than coarse silt or very fine sand. The image resolution is insufficient to determine the relative proportions of clay and silt; accordingly, we classify this facies as mudstone. The Masonic Temple conglomerates contain a matrix made of the same mudstone, as well as abundant millimetre- to centimetre-scale clasts, also composed of mudstone (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8a,b). These clasts formed by mud deposition, partial consolidation, and later erosion and transport as intraclasts.

The mud facies is red, tan or whitish-grey coloured in different rocks. These colour differences are apparent in visible-light reflectance spectra collected by Mastcam-Z (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b and Supplementary Table 1) and SuperCam (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 1). Masonic Temple targets are characterized by long-wavelength spectral features that indicate high abundances of ferric iron. This Fe3+ imparts strong red colouration. Targets in Bright Angel show spectral features that indicate less Fe3+, resulting in tan to whitish-grey colouration. Near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectra collected by SuperCam (Supplementary Fig. 11a–c) are characterized by shallow, approximately 1.92-μm band depths, indicating that Bright Angel formation rocks are weakly hydrated, especially when compared with sedimentary rocks from the Western Fan (Supplementary Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 1). Other NIR spectral features are also relatively weak and cannot be uniquely attributed to specific minerals; however, candidate phases include phyllosilicate clays and opaline silica, consistent with expectations for a mudstone. Calcium sulfate with spectral features consistent with bassanite, CaSO4·0.5H2O, is also identified in NIR spectra (Supplementary Fig. 11e,f).

Organic matter was detected in the Bright Angel area mudstone targets Cheyava Falls, Walhalla Glades and Apollo Temple by the SHERLOC instrument based on the presence of an approximately 1,600-cm−1 G band in the Raman spectra9,10,11,12 (Fig. 3d and Methods). The G band is most intense in Apollo Temple and less intense in Walhalla Glades and Cheyava Falls (Methods). In contrast, no G band was detected at Masonic Temple in the abrasion target ‘Malgosa Crest'. SuperCam Raman spectra collected from Apollo Temple show a strong continuum fluorescence signature (Supplementary Fig. 12) consistent with, but not uniquely attributable to, organic matter; this signature is weak to absent in Malgosa Crest.

PIXL micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental analyses indicate that Bright Angel formation mudstone is rich in SiO2, Al2O3 and FeO, and poor in MgO and MnO (Supplementary Information). On ternary diagrams used to infer mineralogy (Fig. 4a,b), the mudstone plots in locations consistent with abundant silica and aluminosilicate clays. PIXL analysis of the X-ray diffraction properties of the mudstone in abraded patches (Supplementary Fig. 13a–d) shows that it contains only randomly distributed, low-intensity diffraction peaks with no large domains that exhibit coherent monocrystalline diffraction13,14,15. These properties indicate crystalline domain sizes at or near the PIXL diffraction detection limit of 40–60 μm (ref. 15), in accord with image-based grain size estimates. There is no variation in the crystallinity or textural properties of the mudstone with stratigraphic position or elevation (Supplementary Fig. 13a–d), and thus no evidence for contact metamorphic recrystallization in proximity to adjacent geologic units. Analysis of diffraction peaks detected in calcium-sulfate veins and nodules in three abrasion targets indicates that Ca-sulfate is predominantly non-diffracting as well (Supplementary Figs. 14a–j and 15a–c). Where diffraction was detected and peaks could be indexed13 (Methods and Supplementary Table 2), gypsum and anhydrite were identified in isolated small domains. A possible explanation for the high proportion of non-diffracting Ca-sulfate is that it represents fine-grained bassanite, consistent with SuperCam spectra (Supplementary Fig. 11e,f). On Mars, bassanite is known to form by dehydration of gypsum16, with gypsum precipitation implying low temperature and salinity for Ca-sulfate-precipitating fluids17.

Green points are all XRF analyses from the Bright Angel area and black points are from the Masonic Temple area. a,b, Complementary diagrams that plot SiO2 (a) and Al2O3 (b) at their apices. Expected trajectories for oxidative chemical weathering of igneous rocks shown as black arrows; most data points cluster in locations on the diagrams expected for sediments rich in SiO2, Al2O3 and FeOT, formed by weathering of their sources. In a, the cluster of green points near olivine (Ol) represents olivine grains in Steamboat Mountain and Cheyava Falls. Additional linear trends shown with dashed arrowheaded lines indicate mixing with Ca-sulfate (CaSO4) and Fe-rich phases that include Fe-phosphates, Fe-oxides, Fe-sulfides, (Mg, Fe)SO4 and (Mg, Fe)CO3. Kln, kaolinite; Opx, orthopyroxene; Cpx, clinopyroxene; An, anorthite; Ab, albite; Fld, all feldspars. c, Compositional arrays in Bright Angel indicate that an iron-phosphate with a molar 3FeO:2P ratio (stoichiometrically like vivianite, Fe3(PO4)2∙8H2O and its oxidation products) is the primary P-bearing phase. The location of 1FeO:1P ferric phosphate (typically strengite, FePO4·2H2O) is also shown. Ap, apatite; Mer, merrillite. d, Compositional arrays in Bright Angel and Masonic Temple indicate the presence of CaSO4. In Bright Angel, an endmember with a molar 3Fe:4S ratio (stoichiometrically like greigite, Fe3S4) is also present. Pyrite (FeS2), troilite (FeS) and jarosite (Jar; KFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6) are also plotted. The location of the Fe-sulfide minerals on d is based on calculations described in Methods.

Finally, olivine sand grains and particulate and intragranular Fe–Mg carbonate were observed in Cheyava Falls and Steamboat Mountain. In Cheyava Falls, PIXL analysed an approximately 0.5–1-mm-diameter olivine grain in an approximately centimetre-thick, light-toned Ca-sulfate layer (Fig. 3a,b). In Steamboat Mountain, coarse to very coarse sand-sized grains (0.5–2 mm) of olivine and Fe–Mg carbonate are locally surrounded by Ca-sulfate and set within mudstone (Supplementary Fig. 13a–h). Mixing relationships between mudstone, olivine, carbonate and Ca-sulfate are illustrated on Fig. 4a,b. Where coarse-crystalline olivine grains and mudstone are in contact with each other (Supplementary Fig. 13b,f), there is no indication that the mudstone has been recrystallized by interaction with this igneous mineral, indicating that olivine is a detrital phase. In Steamboat Mountain, SHERLOC targeted an area containing olivine, carbonate and Ca-sulfate, rather than mudstone. No organic matter was detected, indicating that these phases are not important carriers of organic matter. SuperCam Raman spectra from the Steamboat Mountain mudstone, however, do show the same continuum fluorescence seen in the organic-matter-bearing Apollo Temple target (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Observations of the Bright Angel outcrop area are consistent with their interpretation as mudstones deposited from suspension as layered and massive beds. Major element systematics and spectroscopic properties indicate that the mudstone provenance was chemically weathered and oxidized, resulting in Si, Al and Fe3+ enrichment and Mg and Mn depletion18. These characteristics are unlike those observed in Western Fan sedimentary rocks, which show little to no fractionation of Fe from Mg or Mn (Supplementary Fig. 16), indicating that they were formed under anoxic conditions18. At the contact with the Margin Unit (Fig. 2), we observe interstratified bedsets containing both fine-grained mudstone and coarse-grained olivine-bearing layers (for example, Cheyava Falls). We also observe poorly sorted, mud-rich olivine- and carbonate-bearing lithologies (for example, Steamboat Mountain). These coarser-grained lithologies appear to have provided a higher permeability medium through which later Ca-sulfate-precipitating fluids could migrate. Given the olivine- and carbonate-rich nature of the Margin Unit7, reworking of grains derived from the Margin Unit into the Bright Angel formation seems plausible. Across Neretva Vallis, at Masonic Temple, the poorly sorted, coarse conglomeratic nature of some outcrops (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8a,b), and the fine-grained, mud-rich nature of others (Supplementary Fig. 6), indicate significant local or temporal variation in current velocities. Accordingly, we interpret the Bright Angel formation to have formed from sedimentary processes that included weathering, erosion, transport and deposition from water by fallout from suspension and energetic currents or debris flows, forming mudstone and coarser-grained and conglomeratic lithologies, respectively.

Dispersed throughout the fine-grained mudstone in the Bright Angel outcrop area, we observe approximately 100–200 μm circular to irregularly shaped masses (informally referred to as ‘poppy seeds' by the Mars 2020 Science Team) that are black to dark blue to dark green coloured in daytime and nighttime white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Figs. 17a,b–19a,b). WATSON (Supplementary Figs. 17c–19c) and PIXL Micro Context Camera (MCC; Supplementary Fig. 20) decorrelation stretch images enhance the blue to green colour of these features relative to the mudstone they occur in. PIXL XRF data indicate that the masses are enriched in Fe, P and Zn relative to their host mudstone (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 21a–g). On a ternary diagram of FeO–P–CaO (Fig. 4c), they extrapolate towards a molar FeO:P ratio of about 3:2 (see also Supplementary Fig. 21f). The X-ray diffraction properties of these masses are indistinguishable from the surrounding mudstone, indicating crystallites smaller than 40–60 μm (Supplementary Fig. 13a–d). In the Apollo Temple abrasion, PIXL analyses also reveal abundant Fe-phosphate masses. The colour properties of some of the Fe-phosphate masses in this target are distinctive: colourless in daytime WATSON images, tan/orange-toned under nighttime white-light LED illumination, and red in decorrelation stretch images relative to the surrounding white–grey mud (Supplementary Fig. 22a–c). Combined, these properties are consistent with accumulations of microcrystalline vivianite (Fe2+3(PO4)2·8H2O) or lower-hydration-state ferrous phosphates (for example, phosphoferrite: Fe2+3(PO4)2·3H2O) and their oxidation products, for example, metavivianite (Fe2+2.5Fe3+0.5(PO4)2·7.5H2O), ferrostrunzite (Fe2+Fe3+2(PO4)2(OH)2·6H2O) and santabarbaraite (Fe3+3(PO4)2(OH)3·5H2O), all of which have molar FeO:P ratios of 3:2 and colour properties that match our observations in Bright Angel.

The Fe-phosphate masses do not appear to have been sorted into laminations or lenses of relative enrichment, as might be expected for 100–200 μm accumulations of vivianite co-deposited with finer-grained aluminosilicates and silica. They are thus unlikely to have been transported and deposited as grains along with the surrounding muddy sediment. Instead, the distribution of the Fe-phosphate masses indicates they formed as the result of chemical processes after mudstone deposition and accordingly can be considered authigenic nodules. In the proximity targets ‘Grapevine Canyon' and Walhalla Glades, Fe-phosphate nodules are encased in larger, centimetre-scale Ca-sulfate nodules (Supplementary Figs. 13h and 20), which are themselves cross-cut by a later generation of light-toned, mineralized fractures (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Fe-phosphate nodule abundances and sizes seem unrelated to their proximity to either generation of Ca-sulfate, indicating that Ca-sulfate nodule and vein emplacement occurred after Fe-phosphate nodule formation. Fe-phosphate is rare in Masonic Temple area targets. A few isolated spots that might contain Fe-phosphate masses were detected by PIXL in the Malgosa Crest abrasion target and WATSON images showed a few large (about 1–5 mm) blue–green masses (Supplementary Fig. 23a–c), but they were not analysed. These could be authigenic nodules of a different scale or transported Fe-phosphate-enriched clasts.

A striking feature observed in the Cheyava Falls target (and the corresponding Sapphire Canyon core sample), is distinct spots (informally referred to as ‘leopard spots' by the Mars 2020 Science Team) that have circular to crenulated dark-toned rims and lighter-toned cores (Fig. 3a–c). The spots range in size from about 200 μm to 1 mm in diameter and their cores are less red than their surrounding mudstone. Like the previously described authigenic nodules they co-occur with, the spots are not concentrated in layers or laminae; together with their irregular shapes, this indicates that they were not deposited as grains. Instead, these multi-coloured features appear to represent in situ reaction fronts.

PIXL XRF analyses of reaction front rims reveal they are enriched in Fe, P and Zn relative to the mudstone they occur in (Fig. 5a,b); we interpret the rims to be made of the same Fe-phosphate minerals found in authigenic nodules. In the reaction front cores, a phase enriched in S-, Fe-, Ni- and Zn was detected (Fig. 5a,b). Insight into the identity of this phase comes from comparison with PIXL analyses of the Apollo Temple target in the same outcrop block as Cheyava Falls (Fig. 2). A ternary diagram of the molar proportions of Fe, S and Ca (Fig. 4d) shows that several spot analyses trend towards a composition on the Fe–S join with an Fe:S ratio of about 3:4. Most of these points are associated with a non-diffracting, millimetre-scale region in the sol 1213 Apollo Temple XRF map shown in Supplementary Fig. 13c,g. This region, like the reaction front cores, is also enriched in Zn and Ni, approaching values as high as 2,300 ± 670 ppm and 2,000 ± 570 ppm, respectively (Supplementary Information), We also detect copper in this region at a concentration of 419 ± 355 ppm (Supplementary Information). X-ray scattering properties indicate that both this region and the reaction front cores are light-element-deficient relative to FeO and SO3 (Supplementary Fig. 24). In LED-illuminated colour images, the high Fe–S region of Apollo Temple contains small dull brown-to-black-coloured masses (Supplementary Fig. 25). Taken together, these chemical and colour properties are consistent with the Fe-sulfide mineral greigite (Fe3+2Fe2+S4; also see Supplementary Fig. 26). The sulfide-bearing region is adjacent to other submillimetre-scale mineral accumulations having properties consistent with Fe and S in a range of oxidation states, including jarosite [KFe3+2(SO4)3(OH)6], which is an oxidation product of Fe-sulfide19, and a red–brown Fe-rich phase with low SO3, SiO2, Al2O3 and analytical totals, consistent with siderite (Supplementary Figs. 13g and 25).

A higher NIR/blue ratio is associated with higher Fe3+ concentration, consistent with a more oxidized substrate (and vice versa). d, Maximum percentage of the total iron in each of the indicated targets that could be present as vivianite (bars with stippled fill), greigite (bars with diagonal line fill) and their sum (grey bars); calculations described in Methods. The Apollo Temple target has the highest calculated vivianite + greigite abundance, the strongest Raman G band (Fig. 3d) and is the least-red target of the group (Fig. 5c). Malgosa Crest has the lowest calculated vivianite + greigite abundance, organic matter is not detected in this target and it is the reddest target of the group (Fig. 5c). Walhalla Glades and Cheyava Falls fall between these two extremes. Steamboat Mountain is separated from the group owing to the lack of constraints on the presence of organic matter in the mudstone in this target. Error bars in b and d represent propagated standard errors.

Finally, in the Bright Angel formation mudstone facies, there is an inverse relationship between the inferred abundances of vivianite and greigite (Methods and Supplementary Information) versus mudstone oxidation state, inferred from the NIR/blue reflectance ratio in PIXL MCC images20. The NIR/blue ratio is sensitive to the relative abundance of Fe3+, like observations from Mastcam-Z (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b) and SuperCam (Supplementary Fig. 10). This inverse relationship is shown in Fig. 5c,d. Mudstone oxidation state also appears to be inversely related to the strength of the SHERLOC Raman G band. As shown in Fig. 5c,d, the Apollo Temple mudstone has the strongest G band, the highest inferred vivianite + greigite abundance, and the least-oxidized colour properties. In contrast, Malgosa Crest has no detectable organic matter, the lowest inferred vivianite + greigite abundance, and is the most-oxidized target analysed in the Bright Angel formation. Walhalla Glades and Cheyava Falls are intermediate between these two extremes.

Chemical and sedimentological data indicate that reduced iron and sulfur were generated, mobilized and precipitated following the deposition of fine-grained oxidized iron- and phosphorous-bearing sediment. Except when found in authigenic nodules and reaction front rims, phosphate is not associated with a mineral phase (for example, there is no indication that apatite or merrillite are present; Fig. 4c). Accordingly, we suggest that during deposition, phosphate was adsorbed on Fe3+-, Al- and Si-rich sediment grains21. In the Bright Angel area, iron and phosphate have been redistributed into authigenic nodules and reaction front rims; mass balance calculations suggest closed-system reorganization of these chemical components into vivianite (Supplementary Text). Fe-phosphate-enriched masses are not associated with Al2O3 (Supplementary Fig. 21h), which might otherwise suggest the co-existence of Al-phosphate minerals typical of transport of Al3+ and Fe3+ under oxidizing, low-pH conditions, such as variscite (AlPO4·2H2O) and strengite (FePO4·2H2O)22,23 (Fig. 4c). Instead, transport of Fe2+, Zn2+ and PO43− probably occurred under non-oxidizing conditions, which, combined with moderate pH, prevented mobilization of Al3+. Such conditions favour the precipitation of vivianite23. The apparent absence of Fe-phosphate nodules and reaction fronts in most of the conglomerate-bearing Masonic Temple area suggests a depositional facies control on the development of these specific features.

In the Bright Angel area, Fe-phosphate minerals are associated with organic matter (Fig. 3d). A pathway to the formation of vivianite is via the oxidation of this organic matter, which would have been coupled to the reductive dissolution of Fe3+ in sediment grains. This process would have liberated Fe2+ and PO43− to solution and precipitated Fe2+-phosphate. Similar precipitation and redox reactions have been considered for an occurrence of Mn–P-rich nodules in Gale Crater24, and for submillimetre-scale mixed valence Fe-phosphate grains in a conglomerate outcrop in the Jezero Western Fan25,26. Sulfate reduction coupled to organic matter oxidation could also be responsible for precipitation of Fe-sulfide in the Apollo Temple target and in the cores of reaction fronts in Cheyava Falls. As reduced Fe- and S-bearing phases formed, the mudstone colour properties were modified by iron reduction, bleaching it of its red colour in proportion to the abundance of available organic matter (Fig. 5c,d).

Here we consider the null hypothesis: that within the low-temperature sedimentary-diagenetic setting we have proposed for the Bright Angel formation, abiotic reactions produced ferrous Fe and reduced S and concentrated them in authigenic nodules and reaction fronts. The null hypothesis predicts that abiotic reactions can reduce sedimentary Fe3+ to aqueous Fe2+, which is then incorporated in the Fe-phosphate and Fe-sulfide minerals we have identified. A wide variety of organic carbon compounds are known to promote the abiotic reductive dissolution of ferric iron oxide minerals at temperatures between 10 °C and 80 °C (refs. 27,28,29). The presence of organic matter in Bright Angel formation mudstone (Fig. 3d), which could have been produced on Mars through abiotic synthesis30,31 or delivered from non-biological exogenic sources30,32, suggests that such reactions could have occurred. Further analysis is required to determine whether the specific organic compounds present in the Bright Angel formation can drive the reduction of mineral-hosted sedimentary Fe3+ at low temperature. Another possible pathway to the production of Fe2+ is through the abiotic oxidation of pyrite by Fe3+ (aq)33. This process would require both the presence of detrital pyrite and low solution pH, which would permit Fe3+ (aq) to be present. As previously discussed, neither condition appears to be met in the Bright Angel formation.

The null hypothesis also predicts that an abiotic source of dissolved sulfide was available to be incorporated in authigenic Fe-sulfide. Dissolved sulfide facilitates the reductive dissolution of ferric iron oxides, with half-lives ranging from years to hours depending on Fe-oxide mineralogy, crystallinity and pH34,35, providing another potential pathway to the production of Fe2+ (aq). Magmatic degassing of reduced sulfur-bearing gases (for example, ref. 36) to local groundwater could provide a potential source of dissolved sulfide during diagenesis. However, geological constraints demand that this sulfide migrate in from a distal, high-temperature sulfide-gas-producing system, to the low-temperature depositional-diagenetic environment of the Bright Angel formation. No evidence for sulfide-producing hydrothermal or magmatic systems was observed in the Crater Floor, Western Fan or Margin Unit before investigation of the Bright Angel formation. Abiotic reduction of sulfate to sulfide by organic matter is another possible source of dissolved sulfide that could both reduce Fe3+-bearing sediment and provide the reduced sulfur required to form Fe-sulfide minerals37. However, sulfate reduction by reduced carbon compounds is energetically demanding and kinetically inhibited by the symmetry of the SO42− ion38, so abiotic reaction rates are exceedingly slow at temperatures <150–200 °C (refs. 37,38). As discussed previously, the Bright Angel formation shows no unambiguous evidence that it was heated in contact with adjacent geologic units, and burial to depths in excess of about 5 km would be required to achieve temperatures >150 °C during the Noachian39.

Given the potential challenges to the null hypothesis, we consider here an alternative biological pathway for the formation of authigenic nodules and reaction fronts. On Earth, vivianite nodules are known to form in fresh water23,40,41 and marine42,43 settings as a by-product of low-temperature microbially mediated Fe-reduction reactions. Fe-sulfide minerals, such as greigite, pyrite and mackinawite, can also be formed as products of microbial sulfate reduction44,45, and have been observed in close spatial association with vivianite42. Greigite precipitation, from precursor mackinawite, is favoured by a high dissolved Fe2+/SO42− ratio, typical of diagenetic fluids in freshwater and ferruginous marine environments44. Repeated sulfidation of Fe2+ in vivianite followed by sulfide oxidation promotes stable incorporation of Zn and other heavy metals into vivianite46. Thus, Zn enrichment in nodules is consistent with a hybrid iron- and sulfate-reducing mechanism. Minerals like these, produced by Fe- and S-based metabolisms, provide some of the earliest chemical evidence for life on Earth47,48, and are thought to represent potential biosignatures in the search for life on Mars49. The fact that the reaction fronts observed in the Cheyava Falls target are defined by small, spot-shaped, bleached zones in an overall Fe-oxide-bearing, red-coloured rock invites comparison to terrestrial ‘reduction halos' in modern marine sediments50 and ‘reduction spots', which are concentrically zoned features found in rocks of Precambrian and younger age on Earth51. A biologically influenced origin has been proposed by some for reduction spots51, although this is not a universally held perspective52.

Under a biological scenario, the mixture of reactants available in the Bright Angel formation at the time of deposition could have provided raw ingredients for a set of biological redox reactions that drove Fe and S reduction, organic matter oxidation, and precipitation of Fe2+-phosphate and Fe-sulfide minerals. In this scenario, oxidized iron and sulfate would be used as terminal electron acceptors for organic matter consumption, promoting the formation of minerals through the release of chemical by-products: Fe-phosphate minerals in the case of iron reduction and Fe-sulfide minerals in the case of sulfate reduction. Where authigenic nodules were formed, the reaction would have shut off before additional reductive processes occurred. In the places where larger reaction fronts formed, the presence of sulfide-bearing cores suggests that sulfate-reducing metabolisms with lower energy yields could have taken hold once those regions of the rock had been depleted of available Fe3+, but had not yet exhausted organic carbon in the reaction front core.

In summary, our analysis leads us to conclude that the Bright Angel formation contains textures, chemical and mineral characteristics, and organic signatures that warrant consideration as ‘potential biosignatures'53,54,55, that is, “a feature that is consistent with biological processes and that, when encountered, challenges the researcher to attribute it either to inanimate or to biological processes, compelling them to gather more data before reaching a conclusion as to the presence or absence of life53”. This assessment is further supported by the geological context of the Bright Angel formation, which indicates that it is sedimentary in origin and deposited from water under habitable conditions. Many significant questions remain about the origin of the nodules and reaction fronts encountered by Perseverance. We suggest that further in situ, laboratory, modelling and field analogue research into both abiotic and biological processes that give rise to the suite of mineral and organic phases observed in the Bright Angel formation will improve our understanding of the conditions under which they formed. Ultimately, the return of samples from Mars for study on Earth, including the Sapphire Canyon sample collected from the Bright Angel formation, would provide the best opportunity to understand the processes that gave rise to the unique features described here.

The data used in this contribution were produced by: (1) the RIMFAX ground-penetrating radar56; (2) PIXL and its associated MCC57; (3) the SHERLOC instrument and its associated WATSON and ACI camera systems11; (4) the SuperCam instrument58,59; and (5) the Mastcam-Z instrument60.

Naturally exposed rock surfaces were prepared by removing surface dust with the gas dust removal tool61. To observe less weathered or flatter surfaces, several rocks were abraded using the rover's abrading bit61 to produce circular approximately 5-cm-diameter-wide by approximately 5–10-mm-deep ‘abrasion patches'. Target names, surface preparation techniques, unit and outcrop associations, and the images that each target appears in are tabulated in Supplementary Table 3.

An overview of SHERLOC image and spectral map acquisition and standard processing methods are described in refs. 11,62. Colourized ACI images were produced using methods described in ref. 62. A focus mechanism motor failure on sol 1024 required SHERLOC measurements reported here to rely entirely on positioning by Perseverence's robotic arm, without the capability to refine focus internally. Bright Angel measurements were therefore made at a systematic offset from best focus: sol 1180 Walhalla Glades was collected at approximately 1.2-mm offset, sol 1201 Cheyava Falls was collected at approximately 1.8-mm offset, and sol 1217 Apollo Temple was collected at approximately 1.1-mm offset. Sol 1242 Malgosa Crest was collected at <0.3-mm offset from best focus; the absence of a G-band signal at Malgosa Crest, despite its better placement, provides further confidence in the G-band peak classification of the other Bright Angel spectra. The spectral intensity is attenuated for measurements collected out of focus, with approximately 35% signal loss expected for 1.5-mm focus offsets. No other spectral artefacts are expected for out of focus measurements. The Raman D band, normally associated in visible Raman spectra with disordered carbonaceous matter such as kerogen, is not present in SHERLOC spectra from the Bright Angel targets. The D band is generally less prominent in deep-ultraviolet (for SHERLOC, 248.6 nm) Raman spectra than Raman spectra that rely on visible-light-wavelength excitation sources63. Furthermore, the focus offset associated with measurements collected at Bright Angel is expected to reduce the observed Raman signal of a potential D-band peak to the instrument noise level, as confirmed with focus offset tests on the organic-rich SaU 008 SHERLOC calibration target and with SHERLOC analogue laboratory instruments. The SHERLOC fused-silica window generates a minor optical background contribution that must be accounted for in SHERLOC spectra, as described by ref. 64. The Si–O-stretching overtone feature in the 1,600 cm−1 region is shown in Fig. 3d (grey traces) for comparison with target spectra, demonstrating the significantly larger contribution of the G-band signal to this spectral region for Bright Angel measurements.

In the Supplementary Data Tables, the bulk chemical composition determined from the sum of all XRF spectra collected by PIXL from each target is provided along with a black-and-white PIXL MCC image showing the footprint of the PIXL XRF scan area on the target. The sol number that the XRF and MCC data were collected on is shown, along with the number of XRF spectra (‘# XRF points') that were collected from each target. The bulk element oxide and element abundances provided were calculated using the PIQUANT software package57,65 and have been corrected to remove the effects of diffraction and topographic roughness using the methods described in refs. 15,66.

Where needed to support discussion in the paper or Supplementary Text, the bulk chemical composition of regions of interest (ROIs) within PIXL XRF scans are also shown. These are accompanied by PIXL MCC images that show the locations of the individual PIXL XRF points that are included in the ROI. For all ROIs included in the Supplementary Data Tables, we have also included a list of the PIXL Motion Counter (PMC #s) positions57 for each XRF point in the ROI. These PMC locations describe which individual points are included in the ROI.

The element mobility index (τi,TiO2), shown in Fig. 5b, was calculated using the methods described in ref. 67. The calculation of %Fe in vivianite and %Fe in greigite, shown in Fig. 5d, was performed using chemical abundance data for individual PMCs in the ‘mudstone' ROIs shown in the Supplementary Data Tables for the targets Apollo Temple, Cheyava Falls, Walhalla Glades, Steamboat Mountain and Malgosa Crest. For each PMC in each mudstone ROI, the Fe and P abundances (in mmol g−1) were combined in a molar Fe:P ratio of 3:2 until all P had been combined with Fe to form vivianite. The individual PMC results for the number of mmol g−1 of Fe in vivianite were then summed and compared with the total abundance of Fe in the mudstone ROI to determine the %Fe in vivianite parameter. In the next step, the remaining Fe in each PMC (after calculation of vivianite abundance) was combined with S in the appropriate molar Fe:S ratio until either all the Fe or all the S had been combined to form greigite. The individual PMC results for the number of mmol g−1 of Fe in greigite were then summed and compared with the total abundance of Fe in the mudstone ROI to determine the %Fe in greigite parameter.

Because PIQUANT assumes that elements are paired with oxygen atoms for the purposes of determining element abundances from the fitting of X-ray spectra, the Fe:S stoichiometry used for estimation of greigite abundance was modified to a value 3:4.42, which differs slightly from idealized griegite stoichiometry (Fe:S = 3:4). The oxide assumption in PIQUANT causes it to overestimate the abundance of S in greigite because it expects the S fluorescence signal to be attenuated by matrix oxygen. To account for this effect, we modelled idealized spectra in PIQUANT for Fe3S4 and FeOSO3 and then determined the ratio of Fe/S Kα1 fluorescence from each calculated spectrum. PIQUANT correctly reports a 1:1 molar ratio for FeOSO3. The adjusted greigite stoichiometric ratio was calculated from the Fe/S Kα1 ratio from Fe3S4 divided by the Fe/S Kα1 ratio from FeOSO3. The same calculation for the Fe-sulfide minerals troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe0.875S) and pyrite (FeS2) yields Fe:S ratios of 1:1.15, 1:1.29 and 1:2.11, respectively.

PIXL has two detectors and so can detect X-ray diffraction from crystalline materials when energies of PIXL's incident radiation happen to be in a diffracting condition with d-spacings and orientations of crystal lattices in the target materials14,15. When detected, X-ray diffraction can also be used to assess crystallinity, grain size and grain texture of a target14,15,66,68 and to distinguish among minerals with similar elemental compositions13,26. Here diffraction from the Ca-sulfate-rich areas in PIXL scans in Apollo Temple, Walhalla Glades and Steamboat Mountain abrasion patches were compared with modelled diffraction patterns for gypsum, anhydrite and bassanite to identify the most likely mineral phase that matches the observed diffraction as described in detail in ref. 13. A mineral was selected as indexed when the P value from the Fisher-transformed cross-correlation results13,69 was ≤0.01. Where P > 0.01, no mineral was selected as indexed. Owing to the difficulty phasing bassanite16, beam locations that indexed as bassanite were also treated as not indexed. A summary of the PIXL diffraction results is presented in Supplementary Table 2.

Neural activity is increasingly recognized as a crucial regulator of cancer growth. In the brain, neuronal activity robustly influences glioma growth through paracrine mechanisms1 and by electrochemical integration of malignant cells into neural circuitry via neuron-to-glioma synapses2,3. Outside of the central nervous system, innervation of tumours such as prostate, head and neck, breast, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancers by peripheral nerves similarly regulates cancer progression4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. However, the extent to which the nervous system regulates small cell lung cancer (SCLC) progression, either in the lung or when growing within the brain, is less well understood. SCLC is a lethal high-grade neuroendocrine tumour that exhibits a strong propensity to metastasize to the brain. Here we demonstrate that in the lung, vagus nerve transection markedly inhibits primary lung tumour development and progression, highlighting a critical role for innervation in SCLC growth. In the brain, SCLC cells co-opt neuronal activity-regulated mechanisms to stimulate growth and progression. Glutamatergic and GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) cortical neuronal activity each drive proliferation of SCLC in the brain through paracrine and synaptic neuron–cancer interactions. SCLC cells form bona fide neuron-to-SCLC synapses and exhibit depolarizing currents with consequent calcium transients in response to neuronal activity; such SCLC cell membrane depolarization is sufficient to promote the growth of intracranial tumours. Together, these findings illustrate that neuronal activity has a crucial role in dictating SCLC pathogenesis.

The nervous system is emerging as a critical component of the tumour microenvironment that regulates cancer pathobiology. Primary brain cancers such as gliomas exhibit a profound dependency on these neuronal mechanisms through activity-dependent paracrine signalling pathways1,13,14,15 and direct functional integration of malignant glioma cells into electrically active neural circuits2,3,16. Although less is known about the role of neurons in brain metastases, breast cancer cells that are metastatic to brain were recently found to occupy the perisynaptic space to usurp glutamate for their growth17. Increasing evidence also implicates the nervous system in the regulation of many cancers outside of the central nervous system, including prostate, gastric, colon, head and neck, pancreatic, breast and skin cancers4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. These studies support the emerging principle that the nervous system can profoundly influence cancer pathobiology and highlight the large number of cancers that remain to be examined from this perspective.

SCLC is a lethal high-grade neuroendocrine tumour that accounts for around 15% of all lung cancers, causes more than 200,000 deaths worldwide annually18, and has a 60% chance of metastasis by the time of diagnosis, with a particular propensity to metastasize to the brain19,20. Experimental mouse models indicate that SCLC can originate from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells21,22,23, a lung epithelial cell type that resides in close proximity to nerve fibres and expresses neurotransmitter receptors24,25,26. SCLC cells exhibit gene expression programmes that resemble those in neurons27,28,29. Higher levels of these neuronal markers correlate with shorter survival and more metastatic disease30,31,32. Recent studies have found that cell-intrinsic neurotransmitter-mediated signalling within the lung promotes SCLC progression33,34,35. Further, neuronal gene expression programmes in SCLC are implicated in driving metastatic progression by facilitating interactions with astrocytes in the brain microenvironment36. However, whether neuronal activity is a regulator of SCLC growth within the lung or the brain is not yet understood. We hypothesized that innervation—particularly by the vagus nerve—may influence disease growth in the lung and that nervous system–SCLC interactions may drive tumour progression. Here we investigate the role of neurons and neuronal activity in the progression of primary SCLC in the lung and SCLC in the brain.

We began by testing whether innervation supports SCLC growth in the lung. Recent studies have illustrated a role for neurotransmitter-mediated growth mechanisms in SCLC33,37, yet the role of vagal innervation in primary SCLC pathophysiology within the lung remains to be elucidated. Analysis of human primary SCLC samples38 revealed the expression of several neurotransmitter receptor genes, consistent with the idea that SCLC cells at the primary site possess the ability to respond to neuronal cues (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To further investigate the influence of neural input on SCLC pathobiology, we utilized the Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;p130fl/fl (RPR2; p130 is also known as Rbl2), luciferase-expressing SCLC genetic mouse model39 (RPR2-luc). Tumours were induced in 8-week-old RPR2-luc mice by intratracheal administration of adenovirus expressing Cre under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Adeno-CMV-Cre). These mice form spontaneous SCLC tumours that recapitulate the genetics, histology, therapeutic response, time course of progression and metastatic nature of the human disease40,41. Examination of SCLC tumours taken from the mouse lung revealed innervation of malignant tissue by various nerve types, including parasympathetic (labelled by vesicular acetylcholine transporter protein), sympathetic (labelled by tyrosine hydroxylase protein) and sensory (a subpopulation of which is labelled by myelin basic protein) nerve fibres (Extended Data Fig. 1b). An abundance of nerve fibres was also evident in the vicinity of tumours metastatic to the liver in these mice (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

To modulate innervation to the lung, we performed a unilateral cervical vagotomy in the RPR2 mouse model (Fig. 1a). Vagotomies or sham surgeries were performed approximately 2 months after the intratracheal administration of the Adeno-CMV-Cre vector but before the development of visible lesions39. Sham-manipulated and denervated mice tolerated the procedure well, displaying no postoperative weight loss or sickness behaviours (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

By 10 weeks post-denervation, a marked difference was evident in the overall tumour burden between the sham-manipulated (control) and denervated (vagotomy) groups (Fig. 1b,c). Longitudinal in vivo bioluminescent imaging revealed that the initiation of primary lung tumours and the appearance of liver metastasis were significantly delayed or not detected in the vagotomy cohort, a difference that continued throughout the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). At the endpoint (around 6 months post-vagotomy), these differences in overall tumour burden were histologically validated. Whereas sham-manipulated mice demonstrated an abundance of tumour sites throughout all lobes of the lung, the denervated mice illustrated minimal to no tumour burden (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Livers, the first site of metastasis, were found to be free of tumour in all denervated mice as assessed by both histological and gross analysis of the surface of the organ (Fig. 1f,h and Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). These results were independently evaluated by a board-certified pathologist. A caveat to note is that the lack of metastatic spread to the liver is influenced, at least in part, by the marked reduction in lung tumour burden in vagotomized mice. Finally, as the overall tumour burden was greatly reduced by vagotomy, we observed a substantial survival benefit for the mice that had been denervated, with all denervated mice surviving the full duration of the experiment compared with a median survival of 16 weeks for sham-manipulated mice (Fig. 1i).

To then assess whether innervation was important to late-stage disease progression, we histologically evaluated innervation in early lesions compared with late-stage tumours. Compared with early in disease progression, more advanced tumours exhibited a significant reduction in nerve infiltration in regions of the tumour (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Concordantly, in contrast to early denervation, when vagotomy was performed 5–6 months after Cre administration in an independent cohort of mice, such reduction of tumour burden and survival benefit were not observed (Extended Data Fig. 1k–m). Similarly, tumour development was not inhibited by denervation in an aggressive form of SCLC driven by oncogenic MYC (Trp53fl/fl;Rb1fl/fl;MycLSL/LSL (RPM)42) where mice succumb to the tumour within 2 months (Extended Data Fig. 2). Together these findings comparing the role of innervation at early stages of tumour development to later stages and in more aggressive models suggest that vagal innervation of the primary tumour site (lung) has a critical role in SCLC initiation and development, and less of a role in tumour maintenance of advanced disease.

Given the substantial role of innervation in primary SCLC as demonstrated above and the high propensity of SCLC to form intracranial metastases, we next evaluated the interactions between neurons and SCLC cells in the brain. We first analysed metastatic SCLC brain tissue samples from nine human patients. Immunohistochemical neurofilament staining revealed that regions of the tumour mass demonstrated extensive axons intermingled with malignant cells (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a), whereas other regions exhibited little to no axonal infiltration. Quantifying the proliferation index (fraction of Ki67+ cells) of SCLC, we found that malignant cells that were closer to axons (within 100 µm) exhibited increased rates of proliferation and higher nuclear density (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3b), suggesting a possible functional role of neuron–SCLC interactions within the brain.

As there is no reliable model of spontaneous brain metastasis in any of the existing intracardiac or intravenous SCLC cell line administration models or genetic mouse models of SCLC36,43, we used mouse intracranial allografts, developed from isolation of metastases from the genetic models44 or patient samples, to test potential functional influences of neuronal activity on the growth of intracranial SCLC. This enabled placement of the malignant cells into specific regions of interest, allowing direct manipulation of distinct neural circuits involving the tumour. It is important to note that this is not a model of metastatic initiation, but rather one of established intracranial tumour growth. These brain allografts exhibited neurons present within the tumour mass, similar to the human samples described above, especially in areas of the tumour periphery (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistent with the human patient samples, we found the proliferation index of cells in neuron-rich peripheral tumour regions to be significantly higher than in neuron-poor areas within the periphery of the mass (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e).

To probe the interactions between SCLC and neuronal activity, we utilized co-culture systems in which cortically derived mouse neurons, representing a mixture of glutamatergic and GABAergic subpopulations (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), were cultured together with either mouse 16T SCLC cells or human H446 SCLC cells. In both cases, the presence of active neurons significantly increased the proliferation rate of SCLC cells in co-culture (Fig. 2c–e). This effect was abrogated with the addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker that inhibits neuronal action potentials (Fig. 2d,e).

We next examined the transcriptional phenotypic changes in SCLC cells following exposure to neurons. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the SCLC cells (16T-GFP) isolated from neuronal co-culture using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Extended Data Fig. 4c). When compared to cells from SCLC monoculture, the co-cultured cells clustered separately with distinct subpopulations primarily composed of either mono-cultured or co-cultured SCLC cells (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data Fig. 4d). In line with the proliferative effect seen in areas of neuronal infiltration, we found that upregulation of a cell proliferation signature was a prominent effect of neuronal co-culture (Fig. 2h).

In addition to the upregulation of the proliferative signature, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified a distinct cluster of cells isolated from neuronal co-culture that are defined by GO terms linked to synapse formation and neurotransmitter receptors and enriched for a synapse-related gene signature (cluster 14; Fig. 2i,j, Extended Data Fig. 4e and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). To determine whether this synapse-related gene expression enrichment after exposure to neurons was mediated by neuronal activity, we performed a separate experiment comparing mono-cultured and co-cultured cells in the presence of TTX (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 4f–h). In the absence of neuronal activity, no malignant subpopulations were found to be enriched for the synapse-associated gene signature, indicating an activity-dependent mechanism of malignant cellular plasticity (Fig. 2l).

To determine whether this malignant signature could be detected in human biopsies, we collected SCLC brain metastases from 12 patients and analysed them using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 5a). As patients with SCLC do not routinely undergo tumour resection, there are no matched primary and brain-metastatic tissue datasets. We therefore compared the single-nucleus data from our SCLC brain metastasis tissue to a publicly available single-cell dataset45 incorporating cells from primary SCLC tumours and various unmatched metastatic disease sites including lung, pleura, lymph nodes, liver and kidney (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We found that compared with all other disease sites, SCLC cells in the brain were enriched for the synaptic signature (Fig. 2m). Further, unbiased clustering of human brain-metastatic cells revealed that SCLC cells within the brain could be grouped into six distinct metaprogrammes (Extended Data Fig. 5c). In line with the results from our co-culture dataset (Fig. 2i,j), we found that one specific metaprogramme (MP3) was defined by genes comprising neural-like transcriptional programmes (Fig. 2n and Extended Data Fig. 5e). When further assessed against previously defined pan-cancer metaprogrammes46, MP3 correlated with programmes associated with neural and glial precursor-like signatures (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Conversely, we did not find any enrichment of these programmes in SCLC cells from extracranial disease sites (Extended Data Fig. 5d,g,h), suggesting that compared with elsewhere in the body, intracranial SCLC is specifically enriched for neural gene expression programmes.

We next assessed whether neurotransmitter-mediated signalling occurred through the formation of direct synapses between SCLC cells and neurons in the tumour microenvironment. Examination of ultrastructural interactions in allografted or xenografted brain tissue using electron microscopy revealed clear synaptic structures (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Immunogold labelling of GFP-tagged 16T or H446 SCLC cells unambiguously identified the malignant cells at post-synaptic sites, confirming that these cancer cells structurally participate in neuron–SCLC synapses (approximately 3–5 synapses per 10 SCLC cells; Extended Data Fig. 6d). Although less frequent, immuno-electron microscopy also identified malignant cells in a perisynaptic position juxtaposed to normal neuron–neuron synapses (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d) consistent with the ‘pseudo-tripartite' synapses previously described in breast cancer brain metastases17.

Having established the presence of structural neuron-to-SCLC synaptic interactions, we next evaluated synaptic responses of SCLC to neuronal activity electrophysiologically. GFP-labelled SCLC 16T cells were allografted into the CA1 region of the hippocampal circuit, an experimentally tractable circuit that is amenable to electrophysiological interrogation of neuron-to-cancer synapses2,16 (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). After a period of engraftment, we prepared acute hippocampal slices for whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of GFP+ SCLC cells. Electrophysiological recordings in voltage clamp at −70 mV of individual SCLC cells revealed the presence of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in a subpopulation of cancer cells (approximately 22% of SCLC cells; Fig. 3b). In the presence of NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl benzo[f]quinoxaline), a glutamatergic (AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)) receptor blocker, these sEPSCs were no longer detected and variance in membrane current was significantly decreased (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), indicating that these are spontaneous currents arising from glutamatergic input and consistent with functional synapses between glutamatergic neurons and SCLC cells mediated by an AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors.

To assess for action potential evoked responses, we stimulated CA3 Schaffer collateral and commissural axons, inputs to CA1, while simultaneously recording from SCLC cells in CA1 using a low-chloride internal solution. At voltage clamp of −70 mV to minimize GABA currents, evoked responses were very rarely seen (less than 5%). When held at 0 mV to minimize glutamatergic currents, a high proportion of SCLC cells (approximately 55%) exhibited currents evoked by neuronal stimulation. These currents were blocked with the addition of TTX to prevent action potentials (Fig. 3d). To determine whether these currents occurred in response to GABAergic input, recordings were performed in the presence of NBQX and CPP (3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid) to inhibit AMPAR and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents, respectively. In the absence of glutamatergic activity, electrical stimulation consistently resulted in currents that were blocked by addition of the GABAA receptor inhibitor gabazine (Fig. 3e), indicating GABAergic synaptic currents in SCLC cells. Given that GABA can act as either a depolarizing or hyperpolarizing neurotransmitter depending on intracellular chloride concentration, we assessed its role in the context of malignant SCLC cells without altering intracellular chloride concentration. To determine the physiological reversal potential of GABA currents in SCLC cells, we recorded responses to stimulation of GABAergic synapses (via local stimulation in the presence of glutamatergic inhibitors) with perforated-patch recordings from SCLC cells using gramicidin D. GABAergic synaptic currents in SCLC cells reversed at −27.3 ± 5.5 mV (Fig. 3f,g), which corresponds to an intracellular chloride concentration of 46.8 mM. This is consistent with expression of K+/Cl− co-transporters in SCLCs, with the NKCC1 gene overexpressed in relation to KCC2 (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j), driving the high intracellular concentration of chloride47. Separate cell-attached measurements revealed SCLC baseline resting membrane potential to be approximately −72 mV (Fig. 3h), more negative than the −27.3 mV chloride equilibrium potential; thus, opening of GABA-gated chloride channels causes SCLC depolarization rather than hyperpolarization. Together, these electrophysiological studies reveal activity-induced membrane depolarization and neurotransmitter-mediated signalling from neurons to SCLC cells in the brain.

Given the distinct synaptic input from glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal populations, we then examined whether direct neurotransmitter-mediated signalling contributes to activity-mediated increases in SCLC proliferation. We utilized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived neurons to establish isolated glutamatergic or GABAergic neuronal populations. These neurons were cultured with a panel of human cell lines that represent clinically and molecularly distinct subtypes of SCLC, conventionally defined by high expression of specific transcriptional regulators ASCL1 (SCLC-A), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N) or POU2F3 (SCLC-P)41. Notably, our scRNA-seq analysis revealed downregulation of ASCL1 expression and upregulation of NEUROD1 expression in response to neuronal activity (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Co-cultures of these distinct SCLC subtypes and neuronal populations revealed that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons elicited a proliferative effect across SCLC, independent of transcriptional phenotype (Fig. 3i–k and Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). We added either TTX (a broad neuronal activity blocker) or the specific neurotransmitter receptor inhibitors MK801 (NMDA receptor inhibitor), CNQX (AMPA/kainate receptor inhibitor) or gabazine (GABA receptor inhibitor) to neuron–SCLC co-cultures and quantified SCLC proliferation. The addition of each of these inhibitors reduced the neuronal activity-induced proliferation of the SCLC cells (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8), indicating involvement of both glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling in the SCLC proliferative response to neuronal activity.

To determine whether these effects of neurons on SCLC were due to direct contact-mediated or paracrine signalling mechanisms, we applied conditioned medium from either glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons in the presence or absence of TTX to mouse or human SCLC cells in culture. Conditioned medium from neurons elicited either no increase or a partial increase in SCLC proliferation that was significantly less than the larger effect elicited by direct neuronal co-culture (Extended Data Fig. 9a–d). Conditioned medium taken from lung-derived epithelial cells had no proliferative effect (Extended Data Fig. 9e). These results suggest that paracrine factors secreted by neurons may contribute, but alone are insufficient to wholly explain the full proliferative effect of direct co-culture. Thus, contact-mediated interactions—such as synaptic communication—account for an important component of the growth-promoting effects of neurons on SCLC cells. We then assessed whether the known activity-dependent paracrine factors NLGN3 and BDNF, which we have shown promote glioma growth1,13,14,16, similarly induce proliferation in SCLC. Neither of these paracrine factors were found to affect the proliferation of the lung cancer cells (either 16T or H446) in vitro, in contrast to a clear growth-promoting effect in patient-derived glioma cultures (Extended Data Fig. 9f–i). These results are in line with previous studies indicating that NLGN3 is not critical for the growth of breast cancer brain metastases in vivo15, and highlight the need to disentangle the distinct activity-dependent mechanisms that influence growth across cancers arising from various tissue origins.

To examine the effects of neuronal activity on intracranial SCLC tumour proliferation, we employed in vivo optogenetic techniques in freely behaving mice. Here, mouse SCLC cells (16T) were allografted intracranially into the premotor cortex of mice expressing the blue light-sensitive opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in Thy1+ deep layer cortical projection neurons or wild-type (non-ChR2-expressing) littermate controls (Fig. 4a). After a period of engraftment, optogenetic ferrules were placed over the premotor cortex and neurons were stimulated with blue light. Successful stimulation of the cortical circuit in ChR2-expressing mice was verified by the observance of a complex motor behavioural output, circular ambulation. Assessed histologically 24 h after optogenetic stimulation of cortical neuronal activity, 16T SCLC cells exhibited a robust increase in proliferation rate (approximately 40% Ki67+ SCLC cells in mock-stimulated wild-type mice, approximately 60% Ki67+ SCLC cells in optogenetically stimulated ChR2-expressing mice; Fig. 4b,c). Further, there was a clear increase in the spread of SCLC cells into the brain, with more cells migrating outside of the edge of the tumour mass into the normal brain parenchyma in mice with optogenetically stimulated neuronal activity (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). Together, these results indicate that cortical neuronal activity can promote the progression of intracranial SCLC growth.

GABAergic synaptic neurotransmission comprised the majority of the signalling detected in electrophysiological studies, and was in fact depolarizing in nature. Thus, after observing that cortical circuit stimulation drives SCLC proliferation, we sought to determine the distinct contribution of GABAergic interneurons. We grafted mice with GFP-expressing SCLC (16T or H446) cells, together with an adeno-associated viral vector to genetically express ChRmine, a red-shifted channelrhodopsin48, in Dlx-expressing GABAergic interneurons in the mouse cortex (Fig. 4e). The mouse cortex was then optogenetically stimulated in awake, behaving mice to induce GABAergic interneuron activity. Control mice were identically manipulated with mock stimulation. After 24 h, SCLC proliferation was assessed histologically using Ki67 to measure proliferation index. We found that in vivo optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic interneurons promoted proliferation of both 16T and H446 allografted SCLC cells (Fig. 4f–h) recapitulating the increased proliferation as a result of increased motor circuit activity and demonstrating a stark tumour-promoting role of GABAergic neuronal signalling in intracranial SCLC growth.

To define the role of SCLC membrane depolarization occurring as a result of synaptic neurotransmission, we visualized the neurotransmitter-mediated currents in SCLC cells using calcium imaging. After applying either glutamate or GABA individually to 16T SCLC cells engineered to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s, both neurotransmitters elicited clear calcium transients in these malignant cells (Extended Data Fig. 11a–c), further evidence that these neurotransmitters induce depolarization. We then performed in situ two-photon calcium imaging of GCaMP6s-expressing 16T SCLC cells allografted into the hippocampus. Similar to observations using electrophysiology, both spontaneous and axonal stimulation-evoked calcium transients in the SCLC cells were observed (Fig. 4i,j). These transients were blocked by the addition of TTX, indicating their dependence on neuronal activity (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 11d).

Given the depolarizing SCLC currents and consequent calcium transients described above, we hypothesized that membrane depolarization itself provides a functional benefit to SCLC tumours in the brain. We used optogenetics to directly depolarize 16T SCLC cells engineered to express ChR2. We confirmed functionality of the ChR2 construct in SCLC cells with patch clamp electrophysiology (Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). These cells were allografted into the mouse cortex (Fig. 4l). After a period of engraftment, blue light was delivered via a fibre optic placed at the surface of the brain to directly depolarize these ChR2-expressing SCLC tumour cells in vivo. Control mice were identically manipulated with mock stimulation. Membrane depolarization resulted in a robust growth effect in SCLC, with an increased SCLC proliferation index (Extended Data Fig. 11g) and the overall size of the tumour approximately doubling after three optogenetic depolarization sessions compared with identically manipulated, mock-stimulated control mice (Fig. 4m,n). Together, these studies illustrate that SCLC cells in the brain utilize neuronal activity and consequent neurotransmitter-mediated membrane depolarization to fuel progression of the tumour.

As cancers metastatic to brain are often associated with seizures49,50, we next assessed whether SCLC cells in the brain could reciprocally affect neurons in the microenvironment. We first quantified the colocalization of pre-synaptic puncta (synapsin) with post-synaptic puncta (HOMER1) on neurons in our SCLC-neuron co-cultures. We found a marked increase in the number of synapses between glutamatergic neurons co-cultured with 16T SCLC cells compared with neurons in monoculture (Fig. 5a,b). No change in gephyrin-labelled synaptic puncta between GABAergic interneurons was detected (Extended Data Fig. 12a). Similarly, in our in vivo electron micrographs of allografted or xenografted tissue, we found an increased number of neuron-to-neuron synapses in regions of the tumour compared with the non-tumour-bearing contralateral controls (Extended Data Fig. 12b,c). Testing the functional contribution of SCLC cells to neuronal hyperexcitability using multielectrode array (MEA) electrophysiology, we found that neurons exhibited increased activity in the presence of SCLC cells (either 16T or H446), measured by increased spike number, amplitude and frequency (Fig. 5c–f and Extended Data Fig. 12d,e). Minimal increase in spike amplitude was observed when conditioned medium from SCLC cells was applied instead of direct co-culture (Extended Data Fig. 12f). We recorded no spikes in SCLC monoculture (Extended Data Fig. 12g).

We then assessed these findings in vivo by performing local field recordings of allografted hippocampal tissue (Fig. 5g). Compared with the contralateral non-tumour-infiltrated hippocampus, we found increased field potentials in regions of the tumour (Fig. 5h,i). We next sought to determine whether this effect was due to any cell-intrinsic changes in pyramidal neurons associated with SCLC and performed in situ whole-cell recordings of pyramidal neurons either integrated in regions of the tumour or in the contralateral (control, non-tumour-infiltrated) hippocampus. Between the tumour-infiltrated and control hippocampi, no distinct differences in neuronal properties were noted (Extended Data Fig. 12h–l).

Astrocytes are known to have a central role in the form and function of neuronal circuits and astrocyte-like glioma cells have been known to create a hyperexcitable neuronal microenvironment51,52,53. As described above, ultrastructural examination of allografted tissue revealed not only post-synaptic positioning of SCLC cells, but also perisynaptic associations of SCLC cells with neighbouring neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d), reminiscent of a normal astrocyte position in tripartite synapses54. Querying our scRNA-seq data of SCLC cells in response to neuronal exposure, we found that neuronal co-culture increased the expression of a gene signature associated with an astrocytic phenotype55,56,57 in a distinct subpopulation of cells (cluster 5; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), not overlapping with the population defined by an upregulated synaptic signature (Fig. 5j,k). In our single-cell dataset comparing human SCLC brain metastases to extracranial sites, we saw no enrichment in the astrocytic signature in the brain (Extended Data Fig. 12m). These findings may in part be driven by an already existing astroglial-like SCLC population that has previously been described within the lung58. We therefore evaluated a synaptogenesis-promoting astrocytic gene signature and found an upregulation within separate metaprogrammes of patient brain-metastatic SCLC cells (Fig. 5l). Together, these observations suggest that SCLC can remodel and reinforce neuron–SCLC interactions in the brain.

Given the increased neuronal activity in the region of the tumour and the idea that glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic signalling to the tumour drives SCLC growth within the brain, we sought to harness neuron–SCLC interactions for treatment using existing clinically available drugs. We utilized levetiracetam, a commonly used anti-seizure drug that acts by interfering with synaptic vesicle release, to determine the therapeutic potential of reducing activity-mediated signalling in SCLC. After a 2-week treatment regimen of daily levetiracetam treatment (20 mg kg−1), both 16T and H446 SCLC-bearing mice demonstrated a significant reduction in malignant cell proliferation (Fig. 5m–o) and tumour burden (Extended Data Fig. 12n–p) in the brain compared with vehicle treated controls. These findings suggest that disrupting neuron–SCLC interactions will be a central component of effectively treating SCLC.

The influence of neuronal activity on SCLC pathophysiology demonstrated here adds to the growing evidence highlighting the importance of neurobiology in cancer. These findings indicate that SCLC cells that have colonized the brain take advantage of neuronal activity through both paracrine and synaptic mechanisms to enhance growth and invasion, while reciprocally increasing neuronal excitability and activity. Developing a longitudinal understanding of the roles of these neural pathways across tumour initiation, growth and metastases will be critical to developing novel therapies that target nervous system interactions with SCLC. Further, emerging evidence demonstrates that melanoma and breast cancer cells that have colonized the brain rely on glutamatergic synaptic input for growth59, extending these findings to other types of brain metastases and emphasizing the need to target mechanisms of activity-dependent growth in other non-glial cancers.

In the future, further investigation of the specific molecular signalling cascades that mediate this activity-driven progression of SCLC may reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities. Other mechanisms of activity-mediated growth, including the identity of the paracrine factors that promote SCLC proliferation remain to be defined. This study identifies glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic signalling in SCLC tumours growing in the brain, but dose-dependent effects and potential roles of other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides have not yet been explored. The growth-promoting effect of SCLC membrane depolarization—also evident in glioma2,16—warrants further investigation of the voltage-sensitive mechanisms of cancer cell proliferation. The stark effect of denervation on pulmonary SCLC pathobiology raises questions about the distinct involvement and relative contributions of the different axonal subpopulations within the vagus nerve, the answers to which would provide potential therapeutic targets such as specific neurotransmitter receptors and inform potential translation of these findings to the bedside. Further, evaluating the possible effects of neuronal activity on other cells in the lung tumour microenvironment, including immune, vascular and other stromal cells may reveal additional indirect effects of nervous system activity on SCLC pathogenesis. SCLC is a disease with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Thus, disrupting the functional interactions between neurons and SCLC in lung and in brain represents a promising therapeutic strategy for this lethal cancer.

All in vivo experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and Stanford University IACUC. Mice were housed according to the standard guidelines with free access to food and water in a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle.

For brain tumour allograft experiments, NSG mice (NOD-SCID-IL2R gamma chain-deficient, the Jackson Laboratory) were used. Male and female mice were used equally. According to the IACUC guidelines, signs of morbidity rather than maximal tumour volume was used as indication for termination of brain allograft mouse experiments. Mice were euthanized if they exhibited signs of neurological disease or if they lost 15% or more of their body weight. For in vivo optogenetic stimulation of the premotor circuit (M2), Thy1-ChR2; NSG or WT; NSG mice were used.

For lung tumour experiments, mice were euthanized when they exhibited signs of sickness behaviour (such as dyspnea, abnormal gait or posturing, or ill-groomed fur) or lost >15% of body weight in accordance with IACUC guidelines. No limits were exceeded in any mouse experiments. In these experiments, Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;p130fl/fl, luciferase-expressing (RPR2-luc) genetic mouse models were used as described previously39,44. In these mice, lung tumours and later distant metastases form spontaneously after intratracheal administration of Adeno-CMV-Cre (University of Iowa Vector Core) at 2 months of age as described44 and following a published protocol60. To study MYC-driven lung tumour models, we used RPM mice42. These mice were infected intratracheally as above with Adeno-CMV-Cre or Adeno-CGRP-Cre at 3 to 4 months of age.

All SCLC brain allografts were performed as described2. In brief, a single-cell suspension from cells cultured from either 16T-mGFP or NCI-H446-GFP SCLC neurospheres was prepared in sterile HBSS immediately before surgery. Mice at postnatal day (P)21–35 were anaesthetized with 1–4% isoflurane and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. The cranium was exposed via midline incision under aseptic conditions. 70,000 cells in 3 µl sterile HBSS were stereotactically injected into the M2 region of the cortex through a 31-gauge burr hole using a digital pump at an infusion rate of 0.4 µl min−1 and a 31-gauge Hamilton syringe. Stereotactic coordinates for Thy1-ChR2 mouse allografts used were as follows: 0.5 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.5 mm deep to cortical surface. At the completion of infusion, the syringe needle was allowed to remain in place for a minimum of 2 min, then withdrawn at a rate of 0.875 mm min−1 to minimize backflow of the injected cell suspension. To generate mice with interneuron-specific expression of light-sensitive ion channels, 1 µl of AAV8-Dlx-ChRmine-p2A-mCherry61 (virus titre = 6.9 × 1012) (a gift from K. Deisseroth) was unilaterally injected using a Hamilton Neurosyringe and 450 Stoelting stereotaxic injector over 5 min. These mice then received allografts of 16T-mGFP or xenografts of NCI-H446-GFP SCLC cells as described above at 0.8 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.2 mm deep relative to the cortical surface. Allografts of 16T-mGFP-ChR2 SCLC cells were performed following the procedure as above with exception for the following alterations: 15,000 cells were injected in 1 µl sterile HBSS 0.8 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.2 mm deep relative to cortical surface. For electrophysiology experiments and electron microscopy tissue analysis, 16T-mGFP cells were allografted into the CA1 region of the hippocampus at the following coordinates: 1.5 mm lateral to midline, 1.8 mm posterior to bregma, −1.35 mm deep to the cortical surface.

For in vivo optogenetic stimulation of M2 region of Thy1-ChR2; NSG or WT; NSG mice, a single stimulation paradigm was employed as previously described1. In brief, a fibre optic ferule was placed 1 week following or simultaneously with and ipsilateral to the SCLC allografts. After 1–2 weeks to allow for recovery from the procedure, the mice were connected to a 100-mW 473-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser system with a mono fibre patch cord, which freely permits wakeful behaviour of the mice. Pulses of light with approximately 4 mW measured output at tip of the patch cord were administered at a frequency of 20 Hz for periods of 30 s, followed by 90 s recovery periods, for a total session duration of 30 min. The mice were euthanized after 24 h post stimulation, and brains were collected for histological analysis. For stimulation of cortical interneurons in Dlx-ChRmine mice, 595-nm light was used at 40 Hz frequency and 10 ms width. Pulses of light with approximately 10 mW measured output at tip of the patch cord were administered.

For in vivo optogenetic depolarization of SCLC cells, ChR2–YFP (pLV-ef1-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP WPRE) construct (generated by the laboratory of K. Deisseroth and placed in the piggyback transposon system by M. Su in the laboratory of M.M.) was lentivirally transduced into 16T SCLC cells, which were then allografted into premotor cortex (M2) following the procedure described above. A fibre optic ferule was implanted during the same surgery ipsilateral to the cell injection site at following coordinates: 0.8 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −0.9 mm deep relative to cortical surface. At 1 week post-allograft and for three consecutive days, all mice were connected to the laser system to receive blue light or mock stimulations at a frequency of 10 Hz for periods of 30 s, followed by 90 s recovery periods for a total session duration of 30 min. Mice were euthanized 24 h after the final (3rd) stimulation session.

Patient tissue samples were obtained with informed consent and analysed in accordance with institutional review board-approved protocols. Immunohistochemistry of patient SCLC brain metastases tissue samples was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections per standard protocols including deparaffinization, antigen retrieval, incubation with primary antibody and detection per the manufacturers' instructions. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Ki67 (Dako/Agilent), mouse anti-neurofilament (Ventana Roche; prediluted). Staining for Ki67 was performed on a Leica Bond III automated stainer. Staining for neurofilament was performed on a Ventana Ultra automated stainer. Proliferation index was determined by quantifying the fraction of Ki67+ cells out of the total number of cells in the region.

16T SCLC cells were cultured alone or in neuron co-cultures with or without 1 µM TTX for 24 h per protocol below and collected in PBS 0.5% BSA, 1 mM EDTA (Invitrogen), 1x DNAse (Worthington Biochemical). GFP-negative cells were collected in parallel to serve as negative control during FACS. Calcein violet (Thermo Fisher) was used to label live cells. GFP+calcein+ cells were sorted and collected then lysed and combined into droplets with barcoded beads which captured the mRNA then used for reverse transcription with the The Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression platform (10X Genomics) per the manufacturer's instructions. We then followed the rest of the 10X standard or high-throughput protocols and used the Dual Index Kit TT Set A for library production. The experiment was repeated for a total of three biological replicates.

Processing of fastq files from monoculture and co-culture samples was performed individually using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger 7.1.0 based on the mm10 mouse genome reference, with the incorporation of the eGFP sequence. Seurat62 (v.5.0.1) was employed for data loading at the individual sample level. Subsequently, the scCB263 (v.1.12.0) package was utilized to filter out empty droplets, employing an FDR threshold of 0.01 to identify real cells, while potential doublets were removed using the scDblFinder64 (v.1.16.0) package. Cells with no GFP expression, exhibiting a high fraction of mitochondrial molecules (>5%) and those expressing a low number of unique genes (indicating low library complexity) were excluded.

Samples from the same replicate were merged, and highly variable genes were selected using the Seurat package. The relative expression values of these highly variable genes were used for principal component analysis (PCA). The number of PCA components for each replicate was determined based on achieving a cumulative proportion greater than 80% in the PCA plot. Subsequently, UMAP embeddings were generated and cells were clustered using Seurat's Louvain algorithm-based FindClusters function.

Differentially expressed genes were identified using the SeuratWrapper's (v.0.3.19) RunPrestoAll function. Genes detected in a minimum of 30% of the cells within each cluster, with at least a 0.25-fold mean log difference, were subjected to statistical testing using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Genes with adjusted P value  <  0.05 were retained.

GSEA was conducted using the fgsea65 (v.1.28.0) and genekitr66 (v.1.2.5) packages, exploring GO, KEGG, REACTOME, Hallmarks, Biocarta and WikiPathways databases. Finally, the GSVA67 (v.1.50.0) package was used to calculate the ssGSEA scores for synaptome, astrocytes, and cell proliferation signatures.

Frozen tissues were processed as described68,69. Tissue blocks were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (Tissue-Tek, Sankura 4583), and then sectioned on a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Leica) into 20-µm-thick curls (generating up to 20 curls for each sample). These were then placed in 5-ml tubes (Eppendorf), washed with ice-cold PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10010023), centrifuged at 400g for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The tissue was resuspended in 1 ml Salt Tris (ST) buffer (146 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2 and 21 mM MgCl2 in ultrapure water) with 0.03% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, P7949; TST buffer), supplemented with 0.1% BSA (New England Biolabs, B9000S) and optionally 40 U ml−1 RNAse inhibitor (RNAse OUT, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The suspension was mechanically dissociated by pipetting 15 times with a 1-ml pipette and incubated on ice for 5 min. Afterward, the pipetting step was repeated, and the reaction was quenched with 4 ml ST buffer, with or without RNAse inhibitor. The mixture was filtered through pre-wetted 70-µm nylon mesh filters (Thermo Fisher Scientific) into 50-ml conical tubes, washed with 5 ml ST buffer, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min to isolate the nuclei. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 100–400 µl ST buffer, filtered through a 40-µm mesh (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and counted using a Neubauer counting chamber (Bulldog Bio) after staining nuclear DNA with 50 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, H3570). Approximately 0.9 to 1.5 × 10³ nuclei were loaded into a Chromium Controller using ST buffer without RNAse inhibitor and processed with Chromium reagents and 5′V2 capture kits (1000006 and 1000263) from 10X Genomics. Following reverse transcription and cleanup, cDNA libraries were prepared per manufacturer protocols, including one additional cycle of amplification to account for the lower RNA content in nuclei compared with whole cells. Final sequencing libraries were created using the library construction kit (1000190) and Dual Index Kit TT Set A (1000215) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq S4 platform with 2× 150 bp paired-end reads, achieving a minimum of 25,000 reads per cell.

Demultiplex FASTQ files from raw RNA-sequencing reads were aligned using CellRanger v.6.1.1 (10X Genomics) to the GRCh38 genome70. Gene counts were quantified with CellRanger's ‘count' function, including intronic reads. The feature_bc_matrix.h5 files generated by CellRanger were used as inputs for the ‘remove-background' function in CellBender v.0.2.0, which removed ambient RNA gene counts and empty droplets71. The CellRanger metric ‘expected-cells' defined the ‘Expected Number of Cells' parameter, and the total-droplets-included parameter was set to a value between 10,000 and 40,000, chosen from the plateau region of the barcode-rank plot generated by CellRanger.

Each generated matrix for was processed with R v.4.1.1 and Seurat v.4.1.0 on a per-sample basis72. Filters were applied based on the Seurat pipeline to retain only cells with 500–10,000 detected genes, 1,000–60,000 unique molecular identifiers and less than 10% mitochondrial gene content. Scrublet v.0.2.1 was used to identify and remove doublets, with the expected doublet rate set between 2.5% and 7.5%, depending on the initial loading rate73. Following Seurat's pipeline, the data were log-normalized using the NormalizeData function. The top 2,000 variable genes from each sample were identified with the FindVariableFeatures function, and the resulting matrix was centred and scaled with the ScaleData function. All signatures were computed through entered the gene list and a merged Seurat object of all samples on a per-cohort basis using the AddModuleScore function provided by Seurat.

Individual Seurat samples were integrated using Seurat canonical correlation analysis (CCA) pipeline to remove batch effects from individual samples. Samples from the labelled Chan cohort from and CUIMC cohort were integrated separately72. Per the CCA pipeline, SelectIntegrationFeatures and FindIntegrationAnchors was then run to select 2,000 anchors between each sample with the top 50 dimensions from CCA to define search space for integration, using the raw RNA counts assay for each sample. IntegrateData was then run using the previously defined anchors to generate the integrated dataset. The integrated data were then scaled, and clustered using ‘FindNeighbors' with 10 dimensions and FindClusters using a resolution of 0.5. UMAPs were calculated with the top 30 PCA dimensions, using Seurat's RunUMAP.

Cell types were initially labelled using SingleR v.1.8.0 using the built in BlueprintEncodeData reference74. Immune cells identified through this process were used as a diploid reference for inferCNV v.1.10.1 to infer chromosomal copy number alteration (CNA) profiles for each cell. A minimum average read count threshold of 0.1 per gene was applied for reference nuclei. The ‘subcluster' setting was used for clustering, and results were denoised with the default ‘sd_amplifier' value of 1.5. InferCNV used a hidden Markov model to predict CNA levels, and the proportion of scaled CNAs was averaged across all chromosomes for each cell74. Malignant cells were identified using sample-specific thresholds based on these average values, which distinguished immune and non-immune CNA levels.

Non-malignant cell types were further analysed following CCA-based integration. Clustering of non-malignant cells was performed with the FindClusters function at varying resolutions, followed by differential gene expression analysis with FindAllMarkers72. Broad cell-type annotations were assigned manually based on established marker genes identified as differentially expressed in each cluster.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was employed for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction on non-negative gene expression data75. The NMF function implemented in RcppML v.0.3.7, was selected for its computational efficiency by minimizing reconstruction error and optimizations matrix factorization76. RcppML operates directly on raw count matrices and incorporates L1 regularization with reproducible factor scaling, enabling robust handling of ambiguous zeroes in single-cell data. NMF iteratively decomposing the data matrix into two lower-dimensional non-negative matrices, a basis matrix representing gene programmes and a coefficient matrix capturing the effect of each gene programmes on each cell. To incorporate prior biological knowledge, the supervised framework from Tagore et. al was adapted77. NMF was run on each sample to identify latent gene programmes, followed by rank-factor. Genes were pre-filtered to retain the top 7,000 genes based on total counts from the filtered RNA assay, serving as input.

Metaprogrammes (also referred to as consensus factors) were identified through co-correlation analysis using Spearman's correlation applied to sample-specific factors generated by NMF. The optimal number of consensus factors was determined using silhouette and distortion scores. Ward's clustering was then performed on individual factors, with the optimal number of consensus factors setting the clustering thresholds to define metaprogrammes77. This analysis was conducted on a per-cohort basis.

To annotate the biological functions underlying each metaprogramme, gene signatures were defined based on the top genes with the highest normalized contributions to each metaprogramme. Functional characterization of these gene signatures was performed through GSEA using recently described transcriptional hallmarks of tumour heterogeneity46. To assess the similarity between gene signatures, the Jaccard similarity index and a derived correlation metric were calculated. The Jaccard similarity index quantifies overlap between two sets as the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union. To facilitate interpretation in a heatmap, pairwise Jaccard similarity scores were scaled linearly to a correlation-like metric ranging from 0 to 1. The resulting heatmap highlights pairwise relationships between gene signatures, with metaprogrammes exhibiting the highest correlation with a given metaprogramme annotated as representing biologically related functions.

For each metaprogramme, genes were ranked based on a weighted Stouffer-integrated expression value. The top 50 genes per metaprogramme, determined by this ranking, were selected for downstream analyses. Within each sample, cell barcodes from the H matrix generated by NMF were assigned to a specific metaprogramme based on their highest association with a corresponding factor. These assignments linked individual barcodes to metaprogrammes according to their factor membership. To evaluate the gene contributions to each metaprogramme, an expectation-maximization Gaussian mixture model (EM-GMM) was applied to the normalized gene expression matrices77. This model assessed the modality of gene expression distributions, enabling the identification of peaks that correspond to the ‘normalized gene contribution' for each metaprogramme. These contributions were subsequently scaled between 0 and 1 across all metaprogrammes to ensure comparability.

The top 50 ranked genes for each metaprogramme, based on the weighted Stouffer-integrated expression values, were used for functional enrichment analysis. GSEA was performed using EnrichR v.3.1, leveraging the Hallmarks of MSigDB v.7.4.1 and GO Biological Process 2021 databases78. Enrichment results were aggregated across cohorts, with the top-ranked gene sets identified for each metaprogramme. The P values and q scores returned by EnrichR were scaled and visualized to highlight significant functional associations for each metaprogramme.

NSG mice were engrafted with either 16T-mGFP or NCI-H446-GFP cells into mouse hippocampi. Three weeks after engraftment, mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with Karnovsky's fixative: 2% glutaraldehyde (EMS 16000) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (EMS 15700) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (EMS 12300), pH 7.4. The samples were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (EMS 19100) for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times with ultrafiltered water, then en bloc stained for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol (50%, 75% and 95%) for 15 min each at 4 °C; the samples were then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and were rinsed in 100% ethanol 2 times, followed by acetonitrile for 15 min. Samples were infiltrated with EMbed-812 resin (EMS 14120) mixed 1:1 with acetonitrile for 2 h followed by 2:1 EMbed-812:acetonitrile for 2 h. The samples were then placed into EMbed-812 for 2 h, then placed into TAAB capsules filled with fresh resin, which were then placed into a 65 °C oven overnight. Sections were taken between 40 and 60 nm on a Leica Ultracut S (Leica) and mounted on 100-mesh Ni grids (EMS FCF100-Ni). For immunohistochemistry, microetching was done with 10% periodic acid and eluting of osmium with 10% sodium metaperiodate for 15 min at room temperature on parafilm. Grids were rinsed with water three times in between and followed by 0.5 M Glycine quench. Grids were incubated in blocking solution (0.5% BSA, 0.5% Ovalbumin in PBST) at room temperature for 20 min. Primary rabbit anti-GFP (1:300; MBL International) was diluted in the same blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, grids were rinsed in PBS three times, and incubated in secondary antibody (1:10 10 nm Gold conjugated IgG TED Pella 15732) for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed with PBST followed by water. For each staining set, samples that did not contain any GFP-expressing cells were stained simultaneously to control for any non-specific binding. Grids were contrast stained for 30 s in 3.5% uranyl acetate in 50% acetone followed by staining in 0.2% lead citrate for 90 s. Samples were imaged in the tumour mass within the CA1 region of the hippocampus or within the contralateral normal hippocampus using a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV and images were collected using a Gatan Orius digital camera.

Sections from the allografted hippocampi of mice were imaged as above using transmission electron microscopy. Here, 36 sections of 16T-mGFP across 6 mice were analysed. Electron microscopy images were taken at 6,000× with a field of view of 15.75 μm2. Synapses were inspected by two individual investigators. SCLC cells were counted and analysed after unequivocal identification of immunogold particle labelling with four or more particles. For identification of synaptic structures, all three of the following criteria had to be clearly met: (1) visually apparent synaptic cleft; (2) presence of synaptic vesicle clusters in a cell on one side of the cleft; and (3) identification of clear post-synaptic density on the cell on opposite side of cleft. For identification of neuron-to-tumour synapses, the post-synaptic cell had to exhibit clear immunogold particle labelling. Tumour cells in perisynaptic positions were identified when an immunogold-particle-positive SCLC cell was seen apposed to or surrounding the synaptic structures between two other immunogold-particle-negative cells. Density of both types of synaptic relationships (neuron-to-tumour synapses, neuron-to-tumour perisynaptic connections) were quantified as the number of connections per number of SCLC cells identified within the region.

Mice with intracranial tumour allografts were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal avertin (tribromoethanol), then transcardially perfused with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura) and sectioned in the coronal plane at 40 μm using a sliding microtome. Lung tumour mice were perfused as above but also with 10 ml ice-cold 4% PFA. The lungs were inflated with 1–3 ml 2% UltraPure Low Melting Point Agarose (Invitrogen). Lungs and livers were fixed overnight at 4 °C on a shaker, then transferred to 70% ethanol and sectioned at 15 μm for H&E and immunohistochemistry, or cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and sectioned at 150 μm on a cryotome for visualizing tumour innervation.

For immunofluorescence staining, the coronal sections were incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at room temperature for 45 min, followed by an overnight incubation with primary antibodies in antibody diluent solution (1% normal donkey serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at 4 °C. On the next day, after a 5-min rinse in TBS, sections were incubated with DAPI (1 μg ml−1 in TBS, Thermo Fisher) for 5 min, and rinsed again with TBS for 5 min. Afterwards, slices were incubated in secondary antibody solution at 4 °C overnight, then washed thrice in TBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Mounting medium (Life Technologies). All images were acquired with Zen 3.4 and analysed using Fiji ImageJ 2.1.0. For quantifying SCLC proliferation, average number of Ki67+ SCLC cells divided by total number of SCLC cells labelled by GFP was calculated within regions of interest either in axon-rich/axon-poor areas of the tumour or in response to various optogenetic manipulations. For quantification of SCLC spread, average distance from the core was measured as longest distance from the initial site of injection to outer core of the tumour. For quantification of tumour invasion, average number of SCLC cells that migrated out of the circumscribed tumour edge over ~500 μm was calculated.

For visualizing lung and liver tumour innervation with immunofluorescence, 150-μm-thick sections were processed as above, except primary antibody incubation time was extended to 72 h. Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Invitrogen) was used to visualized airway epithelium79. To quantify lung and liver tumour burden, five equidistant H&E sections from each organ were evaluated by a pathologist blinded to the experimental conditions to estimate percent of section area occupied by the tumour. Any section with <5% of tissue estimated to be occupied by tumour was given a score of 0, 5–25% was given a score of 1, 25–50% was given a score of 2, 50–75% was given a score of 3, and >75% was given a score of 4. The score for each mouse was then generated as an average across the five sections.

The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs, 1:500), rabbit anti-MAP2 (EMD Millipore, 1:500), mouse anti-NeuN (EMD Millipore, 1:500), rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam, 1:500), guinea pig anti-synapsin (Synaptic Systems, 1:500), rabbit anti-HOMER1 (Synaptic Systems, 1:500), mouse anti-neurofilament (Abcam, 1:500), mouse anti-nestin (Abcam, 1:1,000), guinea pig anti-VChAT (Synaptic Systems, 1:200), mouse anti-TH (Abcam, 1:200), and rat anti-MBP (Abcam, 1:200). The following secondary antibodies were used (all Jackson Immuno Research, 1:500): DyLight 405 Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-Chicken IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-Guinea Pig IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 Donkey Anti-Rat IgG.

The mouse 16T SCLC line was derived from a primary tumour from the lungs of an Rb/p53 mutant mouse44. 16T-GFP cells were generated by transducing 16T cells with pLV-CMV-GFP followed by FACS selection28. These cells are grown as neurospheres (unless otherwise stated) in 10% FBS medium consisting of DMEM (Invitrogen) and 1× liquid antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). The spheres were dissociated using TrypLE (Gibco) for seeding of in vitro experiments. For human cell lines, SCLC22H, H69, CORL47, and H526 were generously provided by M. Oser. SCLC22H was cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS (Cytiva) and 1× Glutamax. H69, CORL47, H446 and H526 were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and 1× Glutamax. H1048 was cultured in RPMI plus 10% FBS, 1× Glutamax, and 1× Insulin transferrin selenium (Fisher Scientific). Primary small airway epithelial cells (HSAECs) were purchased from ATCC and grown in airway epithelial cell basal media supplemented with bronchial epithelial cell growth components (ATCC). All cultures were monitored by short tandem repeat fingerprinting for authenticity throughout the culture period and mycoplasma testing was routinely performed.

Neurons were isolated from the brains of CD1 mice using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit - Postnatal Neurons (Miltenyi), followed by the Neuron Isolation Kit, Mouse (Miltenyi) per the manufacturer's instructions. After isolation, 300,000 neurons were plated onto circular glass coverslips (Electron Microscopy Services) pre-treated for 20 min at 37 °C with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and then 3 h at 37 °C with 5 μg ml−1 mouse laminin (Thermo Fisher). Neurons were cultured in BrainPhys neuronal medium (Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with 1× Glutamax (Invitrogen), pen/strep (Invitrogen), B27 supplement (Invitrogen), BDNF (10 ng ml−1; Shenandoah), and GDNF (5 ng ml−1; Shenandoah), TRO19622 (5 μM; Tocris), β-mercaptoethanol (1×, Gibco) and 2% fetal bovine serum. Half of the medium was replenished on day in vitro (DIV) 1 and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (UFDU) was added at 1 μM. This was repeated at DIV 3. On DIV 5, half of the medium was replaced with serum-free medium in the morning. In the afternoon, the medium was again replaced with half serum-free medium containing 75,000 SCLC cells dissociated from neurospheres or attached cultures with TrypLE. Tumour cells were cultured with neurons for 24 h and then fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature and stained for immunofluorescence analysis as described below.

iPS cell lines were obtained from the Brigham and Women's Hospital NeuroHub Core Facility and all permissions were received for use (from BWH NeuroHub Core and Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center's Biospecimen Distribution Committee). Induced neurons were generated from BR33 iPS cells as described80. In brief, iPS cells were plated in mTeSR1 medium at a density of 95,000 cells per cm2 on Matrigel-coated plates for viral transduction.

On day 2, medium was changed to 1:1 KSR: N2B medium with puromycin (5 µg ml−1, GIBCO). Puromycin was maintained in the medium throughout the differentiation. On day 3, medium was changed to N2B medium + 1:100 B27 supplement (Life Technologies). From day 4 on, cells were cultured in NBM medium + 1:50 B27 + puromycin (5 µg ml−1) + BDNF, GDNF, CNTF (10 ng ml−1, Peprotech). Half medium changes were performed every 2–3 days. Around D10, puromycin was removed from medium. Around D12-D-15, SCLC cells were added at a ratio of 1:3 (cancer cells:neurons). Cultures were monitored over the next ten days in the case of MEA recordings. For histological analyses, SCLC cells were added in the presence of 1 μM TTX (Tocris), 50 μM MK801 (Selleck Chemicals), 50 μM CNQX (Tocris), or vehicle.

On day 1, medium was changed to N2B medium with doxycycline (2 µg ml−1) and forskolin (10 µM, Sigma). Doxycycline and forskolin were maintained in the medium for the remainder of the differentiation. On day 2, medium was replaced with fresh N2B medium. On day 3, medium was changed to N2B medium + puromycin (10 µg ml−1, GIBCO). On day 4 onwards, cells were cultured in N2B medium + puromycin (8 µg ml−1). From day 5 onwards, cells were cultured with NBM medium + 1:50 B27 + puromycin (5 µg ml−1) + BDNF, GDNF, CNTF (10 ng ml−1) + doxycycline (2 µg ml−1) + forskolin (10 µM) + AraC (2 µM, Sigma).

KSR medium: Knockout DMEM, 15% KOSR, 1× MEM-NEAA, 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 1× Glutamax (Life Technologies). N2B medium: DMEM/F12, 1× GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 1× N2 supplement B (StemCell Technologies), 0.3% dextrose (d-(+)-glucose, Sigma). NBM medium: neurobasal medium, 0.5× MEM-NEAA, 1× GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 0.3% dextrose (d-(+)-glucose, Sigma).

For conditioned media assays, either glutamatergic or GABAergic iPS cell-derived neurons were cultured as above. On day 17–18, neurons were replenished with a full medium change with or without the presence of 1 μM TTX. Conditioned medium was collected 24 h later for immediate use. Mouse 16T cells were then plated (30,000 cells in a 48 well plate) with 500 μL neuronal conditioned medium (again in the absence or presence of TTX) with the addition of 10 μM EdU to each well. After 24 h, cells were fixed cells with 4% PFA and stained using Click-iT 594 EdU kit and protocol (Invitrogen). All conditioned media assays were performed alongside direct co-culture assays described above.

EdU staining was performed on glass coverslips in 24-well plates which were precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 5 μg ml−1 mouse laminin (Thermo Fisher). Neurosphere cultures were dissociated with TrypLE and plated onto coated slides with 10 μM of EdU. After 24 h the cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min and then stained using the Click-iT 594 EdU kit and protocol (Invitrogen) with or without additional antibody staining and mounted using Prolong Gold mounting medium (Life Technologies). Proliferation index was determined by quantifying the fraction of EdU-labelled cells/GFP-labelled cells using confocal microscopy at 40× magnification.

For immunohistochemistry, fixed coverslips were incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies guinea pig anti-synapsin1/2 (1:500; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-HOMER1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-gephyrin (1:300, Cell Signaling Technologies), or mouse anti-neurofilament (1:500; Abcam) in 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then rinsed 3 times in TBS and incubated in secondary antibody solution (Alexa 488 donkey anti-guinea pig IgG; Alexa 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG, all at 1:500 (Jackson Immuno Research)) in antibody diluent solution at 4 °C overnight. Coverslips were rinsed three times in TBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Mounting medium (Life Technologies). Images were collected using a 63× oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope and processed with Airyscan. Colocalization of puncta was quantified as described2.

All MEA recordings were taken and analysed using the Axion Biosystems platform. Prior to culturing, 6-well Axion plates were coated with poly-l-lysine and laminin. Day 4 iNs (created as described80) were then thawed and plated in neurobasal medium, at 100,000 cells per well. For the initial week prior to co-culture, iNs were subjected to a half medium change every 3–4 days. Doxycycline and puromycin treatment were stopped after day 10 to allow for the addition of tumour cells. On day 14–15, SCLC cells were added at 30,000 cells per well MEA plates. MEA plates were recorded every day for 10 min for up to 2 weeks after co-culture. All spike numbers and amplitude were assessed using proprietary Axion Software.

For all electrophysiology experiments, 35,000 16T-GFP cells were allografted into the CA1 hippocampus of 4–6 week old NSG mice. Three weeks after allograft, brain slices were obtained using standard techniques. Mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and perfused transcardially with ice-cold ACSF containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4 and 25 glucose (295 mOsm kg−1). Brains were blocked and transferred into a slicing chamber containing ice-cold ACSF. Coronal slices of hippocampus were cut at 300-μm thickness with a Leica VT1000s vibratome in ice-cold ACSF, transferred for 10 min to a holding chamber containing choline-based solution consisting of (in mM) 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 11.6 ascorbic acid, and 3.1 pyruvic acid at 34 °C then transferred to a secondary holding chamber containing ACSF at 34 °C for 30 min and subsequently maintained at room temperature (20–22 °C) until use. All recordings were obtained within 5 h of slicing. Both choline solution and ACSF were constantly bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2.

Individual brain slices were transferred into a recording chamber, mounted on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI or Scientifica SliceScope Pro 1000) and continuously superfused (2–3 ml min−1) with ACSF and bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 warmed to 32–34 °C by passing it through a feedback-controlled in-line heater (SH-27B; Warner Instruments). Cells were visualized through 40× or 60× water immersion objectives with either infrared differential interference contrast optics or epifluorescence to identify GFP+ cells. For whole-cell voltage clamp recording, patch pipettes (2–4 MΩ) pulled from borosilicate glass (Sutter Instruments) were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 135 CsMeSO3, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 3.3 QX-314 (Cl− salt), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH; 295 mOsm·kg−1). sEPSCs and spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) of GFP+ cells were recorded for 5 min at –70 or 0 mV holding potential. For membrane current variance, 10 consecutive sweeps, each 10 s long, recorded in voltage clamp at −70 mV holding potential were analysed by calculating the s.d. of the current after applying a 3-point median filter. To record evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) and evoked inhibitory post-synaptic currents (eIPSCs), the membrane voltages were clamped at –70 mV or 0 mV. For perforated-patch recording eIPSCs (gramicidin D, 40–60 μg ml−1) with access resistance 40–60 MΩ, variable holding membrane voltages were applied to generate an I–V curve and identify chloride's equilibrium potential. Extracellular stimulation was performed with a stimulus isolation unit (MicroProbes, ISO-Flex), bipolar electrodes (75 μm apart, PlasticOne or MicroProbes) which were placed away 100–400 μm along the CA1–CA2 axis from the recorded cells. Stimuli were delivered at 10 s intervals with 0.1 ms duration and 100–200 μA amplitude. In some recordings, to confirm whether sEPSCs or eIPSCs were glutamatergic or GABAergic, 10 μM NBQX and CPP (Sigma) or 10 μM gabazine (Tocris) were added to bath ACSF. For perforated patched recordings, 10 μM NBQX and CPP were in bath continuously. Pyramidal cells in allografted and contralateral sites of hippocampus were recorded in whole-cell current clamp to study intrinsic properties. Patch pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 135 potassium methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 8 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH; 295 mOsm kg−1). From a resting potential of −70 mV, currents were injected for 1,000 ms at 50 pA steps from −100 to 1,000 pA. Intrinsic properties of hippocampus pyramidal cells were analysed with software in Matlab.

Extracellular local field potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from hippocampal allograft and contralateral sites under current clamp (I = 0 mode). A bipolar electrode (75 μm spacing, MicroProbes) was placed in stratum radiatum near the allograft or in the correspondent contralateral site. Recording glass electrodes (2–3 MΩ) filled ACSF were place 100–200 μm perpendicularly away from the stimulating bipolar electrode at a depth of 50 100 μm. The stimulation currents were delivered at 20 s intervals with 0.1 ms duration and variable intensities from 20 μA to 140 μA using 20 μA steps and repeated 10 times. The average slopes of fEPSPs for each current intensity were measured.

The resting membrane potential of SCLC was assessed through cell-attached configuration (Rseal > 1 GΩ) using the procedure previously described in Antel et al.81. Glass pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mM) 145 KCL, 2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). A voltage protocol consisting of hold at 0 mV, stepping to 100 mV and ramping back to −120 mV over 137.5 ms was applied to GFP+ cells. Five to ten consecutive traces were recorded and averaged. All data were acquired with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized at 3 kHz with a National Instruments data acquisition device (NI USB- 6343).

For calcium imaging, the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s was lentivirally transduced into mouse SCLC 16T (pLV-ef1-GCaMP6s-P2A-nls-tdTomato). In this case, SCLC cells containing the GCaMP6s reporter can be identified using the tdTomato nuclear tag. These cells were isolated and grafted into the CA1 region of the hippocampus as described above. Two-photon calcium imaging experiments were performed using Prairie Ultima XY upright two-photon microscope for tissue slices equipped with an Olympus LUM Plan FI W/IR-2 40× water immersion objective. The temperature of the perfusion medium, ACSF as described above, was kept at 30 °C, and perfused through the system at rate of 2 ml min−1. Excitation light was provided at a wavelength of 920 nm through a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics Mai Tai DeepSee) to allow for excitation of both tdTomato and GCaMP6s. The actual laser power reaching the scanhead for each scope is dynamically controlled by Pockels cells via software interface. Pockels cell were set at 10 for all experiments, and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) were set at 800 for each channel. For these settings, power at back aperture of the objective was approximately 30 mW at 920 nm. The wavelength ranges for the emission filters were PMT1: 607 nm centre wavelength with 45 nm bandpass (full-width at half-maximum) and PMT2: 525-nm centre wavelength with 70-nm bandpass (full-width at half-maximum). Recordings were made at 0.65 frames per second (~1.5 Hz) for about 30 min in the case of spontaneous activity and 10 min in the case of response to periodic electrical stimulation. Cells were identified via the expression for the nuclear tdTomato tag and were only imaged in the area of interest, specifically in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Similar to the electrophysiology paradigm, for neuronal stimulation experiments, the electrode was placed in the hippocampus to stimulate the neuronal inputs originating in CA3. For electrical stimulation, approximately 20 µA over 200 µs was delivered to local axons using a stimulating bipolar microelectrode. For inhibitor experiments, TTX was directly diluted into the ACSF perfusion medium at 500 nM, oxygenated, and delivered to the slices through the perfusion system.

Quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis was done on calcium transients that were reliably evoked by axonal stimulation. To determine the effect of TTX on the calcium transients in response to electrical stimulation of the CA3 Schaffer collaterals, the field of cells were stimulated three times in 1-min intervals to ensure synaptic connectivity. TTX (500 nM) was then perfused into the slices and the stim was repeated on the same field of cells to gauge direct effect of TTX on stimulation response. For analysis, regions of interest of each responding nucleus were set and ΔFmax/F0 (maximum difference in fluorescence intensity normalized to background fluorescence) measurements were determined before and after TTX treatment.

Expression data from 81 patients with SCLC primary tumours38 as FPKM values was accessed and plotted for genes of interest.

Adult RPR2-luc mice (4–7 months old, 2–5 months from virus administration) weighing more than 17 g were anaesthetized with 1–4% isoflurane through a nose cone in a supine position. Skin of the ventral surface of the neck was shaved and aseptically prepared according to IACUC guidelines. Under a dissection microscope, a 1 cm midline skin incision was made, and salivary glands revealed were separated with blunt dissection to expose the airways. The right vagal nerve was then carefully dissected from the carotid sheath and cut at the cervical level posterior to the pharyngeal branch. Sham mice underwent the same surgical procedure for blunt dissection of the vagus nerve but the latter was left intact. The mice were monitored until recovery from anaesthesia for changes in heart rate and respiration and after that monitored bi-weekly for changes in weight, eating, drinking, and general activity. RPM mice were handled the same way, except vagotomy was performed within 1 week of virus administration.

For in vivo monitoring of tumour growth, bioluminescence imaging was performed using an IVIS imaging system (Xenogen). Mice were placed under 1–4% isofluorane anaesthesia and injected with luciferin substrate, then imaged in pronated position for intracranial allograft experiments or supine position for lung tumour mice. Baseline bioluminescence was used to randomize mice by a blinded investigator so that experimental groups contained an equivalent range of tumour sizes. For vagotomy experiments, each cohort of mice was imaged weekly for a total of 6 months.

For survival studies, morbidity criteria used were either reduction of weight by 15% of initial weight, sickness behaviour (such as dyspnea, abnormal gait or posturing, or ill-groomed fur), or severe neurological motor deficits consistent with brainstem dysfunction (that is, hemiplegia or an incessant stereotyped circling behaviour seen with ventral midbrain dysfunction). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis using log-rank testing was performed to determine statistical significance.

For all drug studies, NSG mice were xenografted as above with either 16T-GFP or NCI-H446-GFP cells and randomized to treatment group by a blinded investigator. One week post-engraftment, tumour-bearing mice were treated with systemic administration of levetiracetam (20 mg kg−1; Selleck Chemicals; formulated in a sterile saline solution) via intraperitoneal injection daily for 2 weeks. Controls were treated with an identical volume of vehicle.

Statistical tests were conducted using Prism v.9.3.1 (GraphPad) software unless otherwise indicated. Gaussian distribution was confirmed by the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. For parametric data, unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc tests to examine pairwise differences were used as indicated. Paired two-tailed Student's t-tests were used in the case of same-cell or same-animal experiments (as in electrophysiological recordings and vagotomy experiments). For non-parametric data, a two-sided unpaired Mann–Whitney test was used as indicated, or a one-tailed Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was used for same-cell experiments. Two-tailed log-rank analyses were used to analyse statistical significance of Kaplan–Meier survival curves. In all box-and-whiskers plots, whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, the box extends to the 25th and 75th percentile, and the centre line is plotted at the median. In all violin plots, lines are drawn at the median and quartiles.

Smoke from extreme wildfires in Canada adversely affected air quality in many regions in 20231,2. Here we use satellite observations, machine learning and a chemical transport model to quantify global and regional PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter) exposure and human health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. We find that the fires increased annual PM2.5 exposure worldwide by 0.17 μg m–3 (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.26 μg m–3). North America had the largest increase in annual mean exposure (1.08 μg m–3; 0.82–1.34 μg m–3), but there were also increases in Europe (0.41 μg m–3; 0.32–0.50 μg m–3) owing to long-range transport. Annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada increased by 3.82 μg m–3 (3.00–4.64 μg m–3). In the USA, the contribution of the Canadian fires to increased PM2.5 was 1.49 μg m–3 (1.22–1.77 μg m–3), four times as large as the contribution from the 2023 wildfires originating in the USA. We find that 354 million (277–421 million) people in North America and Europe were exposed to daily PM2.5 air pollution caused by Canadian wildfires in 2023. We estimate that 5,400 (3,400–7,400) acute deaths in North America and 64,300 (37,800–90,900) chronic deaths in North America and Europe were attributable to PM2.5 exposure to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Our results highlight the far-reaching PM2.5 pollution and health burden that large wildfires can have in a single year.

Wildfires impact the global carbon cycle3,4, ecosystems5,6, air quality7,8,9,10,11 and human health12,13,14,15. Among these impacts, the contribution of wildfires to global PM2.5 pollution has been steadily increasing in recent years, with the largest increase in North America8,9,10,11. Between May and September of 2023, severe wildfires in Canada burned a total of 15 million ha of forest (about 4% of the total forest area in Canada and more than 7 times the annual mean burned area for 1983–2022) and resulted in vast carbon emissions (647 TgC)16,17. Smoke generated from the Canadian wildfires was not only transported across North America and led to air-quality alerts in many regions of the USA1 but also transported across the North Atlantic to reach Europe and Asia2, which underscored that severe wildfires do not have only local consequences. Although PM2.5 exposure from wildfires has been investigated in different ways8,9,10,11,18,19,20 and transboundary fire pollution episodes have been identified in previous studies21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29, the impacts of such extreme wildfires on global air quality and human health remain underexplored30,31,32. Given the potential continued impact from projected increase in future wildfires33,34,35, quantifying exposure to this air pollution and the level of health impact at a global extent can inform responses, including fire monitoring and forecasting, fire suppression, land management and landscape-scale fuel treatments, and climate mitigation more broadly.

Here we combine several global models and observation datasets to develop a near-real-time framework to estimate global and regional PM2.5 exposure (that is, population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentration) and deaths attributable to the 2023 Canadian wildfires (Extended Data Fig. 1). Details of our analytic approach are in Methods. In summary, we first use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (a global three-dimensional model of atmospheric chemistry driven by meteorological input from the Goddard Earth Observing System)36 and three near-real-time global fire emission inventories (the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED)37, the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED)38 and the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS)39) to derive global daily PM2.5 concentrations and the fractional share of these concentrations related to wildfires. We then use a machine-learning approach to retrieve the global daily PM2.5 concentration from a range of data, including ground-monitoring measurements, satellite retrievals, reanalysis data and GEOS-Chem model simulations (Supplementary Fig. 1), and attribute the share of retrieved total PM2.5 concentration to wildfires using the previously simulated fractional contribution. By performing a series of evaluation and sensitivity tests to the three inventories (Supplementary Table 1), the results presented hereafter correspond to estimates with the GFED as a priori input and the impacts of using different inventories on our conclusions are discussed (‘Discussion'). We further attribute fire-related PM2.5 concentrations to wildfires in different source regions (that is, Eastern Canada, Western Canada, Western USA, Eastern USA and other global regions) by using a zero-out approach with the GFED inventory (Supplementary Table 2). Finally, we use previously established exposure–response functions15,40 to estimate acute and chronic deaths attributable to PM2.5 exposure from Canadian wildfires. It should be noted that various exposure–response functions are available and that the mortality estimates are highly dependent on the function used (‘Discussion'). Unless otherwise specified, ranges of results reported reflect the 95% confidence interval (CI) and numbers of deaths reported reflect the median rounded to the nearest hundred.

Primary emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutants from the 2023 Canadian wildfires are substaintially different in three bottom-up fire emission inventories (that is, GFED, QFED and GFAS), ranging from 139 TgC to 658 TgC, from 0.55 Tg to 0.76 Tg black carbon, and from 8.9 Tg to 15.0 Tg organic carbon (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Despite differences in the magnitude of emissions, there is consensus among the three bottom-up inventories that the 2023 Canadian fire emissions were the highest in at least 20 years. Emissions of CO2 and primary aerosols in 2023 were 4.9–10.7-times higher than the annual average for 2003–2022 and 2.9–5.1-times higher than in 2021 (the year with the next highest emissions; Extended Data Fig. 2b).

We estimate that wildfires worldwide accounted for a global annual mean PM2.5 exposure of 1.32 μg m–3 (95% CI, 0.66–1.98 μg m–3) in 2023. Of this total, the Canadian fires account for 0.17 μg PM2.5  m–3 (95% CI, 0.09–0.26 μg PM2.5 m–3), or 13% of the total fire-related PM2.5 exposure. Despite this relatively small global impact, PM2.5 smoke from Canadian fires spread across the North American continent and was transported to Europe (Fig. 1a; global region definition presented in Extended Data Fig. 3a). Indeed, the Canadian fires account for more than half of fire-related PM2.5 exposure along the western coasts of Europe (Fig. 1e,h), and increased annual mean PM2.5 exposure of 1.08 μg m–3 (95% CI, 0.82–1.34 μg m–3) and 0.41 μg m–3 (95% CI, 0.32–0.50 μg m–3) in North America and Europe, respectively (Extended Data Table 1). In Europe, 90% of the total population (620 million) were exposed to more than 0.32 μg m–3 of increased annual mean PM2.5 concentrations owing to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. The contribution of the 2023 Canadian wildfires to the annual mean PM2.5 exposure in other world regions was comparatively small and statistically insignificant when compared with the interannual variability (Methods).

Source Data

Nearer to and directly downwind of the wildfires, impacts were much more substantial. Because wildfires in the USA and elsewhere affected PM2.5 pollution at the same time as the Canadian fires, we separately analyse PM2.5 exposure in Canada and the USA related to fire emissions from five different regions: Eastern Canada, Western Canada, the Eastern USA, the Western USA and fires in all other regions (see source region definitions and the Environmental Protection Agency's delineation of North American ecological regions in Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Extended Data Fig. 4 shows the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Canada and the USA that are related to the fires in each country. Although smoke from US fires affected pollution concentrations along the southern boundary of Western Canada, fire-related PM2.5 across Canada as a whole was dominated by its own fires. Annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada itself increased by 3.82 μg m–3 (95% CI, 3.00–4.64 μg m–3) owing to its own fires (maximum monthly mean exposure of 16.07 μg m–3 in June; Extended Data Fig. 5). PM2.5 hotspots in Canada include the James Bay region of Quebec and large areas of Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories (Extended Data Fig. 4a), which is consistent with the distribution of burned area and sources of primary emissions (Extended Data Fig. 6). Although wildfires in Western Canada and Eastern Canada had comparable impacts on PM2.5 concentrations in Eastern Canada, the wildfires in Eastern Canada had only a small effect on pollution in Western Canada (Fig. 2; see impacted region definitions in Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Each cell in the grid shows population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations in each impacted region of Canada and the USA (indicated by the column) by fire source regions (indicated by the row). The definition of wildfire source regions in Canada and the USA are presented in Extended Data Fig. 3b, and the impacted regions are defined in Extended Data Fig. 3c. ‘Other fires' means fires from other global regions apart from Canada and the USA.

Source Data

In the USA, the 2023 Canadian fires accounted for 1.49 μg m–3 (95% CI, 1.22–1.77 μg m–3) of the annual mean PM2.5 exposure (maximum monthly mean exposure of 8.04 μg m–3 in June; Extended Data Fig. 5), which is four times as large as the 0.35 μg m–3 (95% CI, 0.29–0.42 μg m–3) exposure related to fires in the USA in the same year. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 4c, PM2.5 concentrations in the USA were impacted by smoke plumes from Canada that extended over large areas of the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, Ohio Valley and the Northeast regions. The US Midwest was especially affected: the annual mean PM2.5 exposure in the region increased by 3.13 μg m–3 (95% CI, 2.82–3.44 μg m–3; Fig. 2). In comparison, the annual mean PM2.5 exposures increased by 2.35 μg m–3 (95% CI, 2.11–2.59 μg m–3) in Ohio Valley, 2.52 μg m–3 (95% CI, 2.27–2.78 μg m–3) in the Northeast, and 1.92 μg m–3 (95% CI, 1.69–2.15 μg m–3) in the Rocky Mountains. At the state level, the largest PM2.5 impacts were in North Dakota (3.85 μg m–3; 95% CI, 3.39–4.31 μg m–3). Meanwhile, the impacts of the Canadian fires on the Southwest and West regions of the USA were modest. Nonetheless, in 7 of the 9 regions of the continental USA analysed, the Canadian fires increased the annual PM2.5 exposure by more than 0.5 μg m–3, and increased the annual PM2.5 exposure by more than 1 μg m–3 for 187 million Americans (57% of total; Extended Data Fig. 7). As in Canada, the downwind effects of the 2023 fires in Western Canada affected US air quality more than the fires in Eastern Canada: 60% of the annual exposure in the USA related to Canadian fires was from Western Canada.

Figure 3 shows the daily and cumulative PM2.5 exposure in Canada, the USA and Europe related to different sources of fire emissions. In Canada, there were frequent large spikes of air pollution throughout the spring, summer and autumn of 2023 related in particular to persistent fires in Western Canada (Fig. 3a). The magnitude of pollution episodes was mostly lower in the USA, but fires in Eastern Canada caused two spikes in June that led to the national daily average PM2.5 exposure exceeding 30 μg m–3 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3). During these two episodes, a low-pressure system over the Canadian Maritime Provinces coupled with a high-pressure ridge to the west channelled a plume of pollution into population centres of the Eastern USA (Supplementary Figs. 3–5). In contrast, wildfires in Western Canada had a persistent and overall larger impact on US air quality throughout the fire season (Fig. 3e). Smoke from these western fires was transported eastwards along the northern margin of the Rocky Mountains and then spread first southeastwards into the Great Plains and then back up into the northeast owing to the greatly developed subpolar low pressure (Supplementary Fig. 6).

The definitions of wildfire source regions in Canada and the USA are presented in Extended Data Fig. 3b. ‘Other fires' means fires from other global regions apart from Canada and the USA.

Source Data

As shown in Fig. 1d, the 2023 Canadian fires also had broad impacts on PM2.5 exposure in Western Europe, especially in Mediterranean countries such as Spain, Italy and France (also see Methods and Supplementary Figs. 7–12). The smoke plumes from Canada were transmitted eastwards into Europe by a westerly airflow situated over the mid-latitudes and crossed the North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig. 7). The largest episodes of trans-Atlantic pollution occurred in late June owing to the large polewards pressure gradient between the Azores high and the Icelandic low, leading to widespread air pollution in Europe (Supplementary Fig. 8). As in the USA, though, the Western Canadian fires led to greater cumulative exposure in Europe (Fig. 3f).

We further quantify the extent of the Canadian fires' impacts on global health by the number of ‘Canada smoke days' in which both (1) the daily mean PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 15 μg m−3 (the recommended 24-hour guideline levels of the World Health Organization (WHO)) and (2) the Canadian fires accounted for at least 50% of the total 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration. With these criteria, 354 million (95% CI, 277–421 million) people in North America and Europe were exposed to at least 1 Canada smoke days in 2023, with a total of 4.84 billion person-days of exposure in that year (Extended Data Table 1). In the USA alone, 267 million (95% CI, 222–273 million) people (79% of total) were exposed to at least 1 Canada smoke days—3.69 billion person-days of exposure. In addition, 98% of the Canadian population (38.1 million people; 95% CI, 37.0–38.1 million) experienced such Canada smoke days, with an average of 27.1 days per person. Although the annual mean PM2.5 exposure from Canadian fires was larger in Canada than in the USA, total person-days exposure to Canada smoke days was three-times greater in the USA owing to the much larger population in downwind areas of the USA. Similarly, 47.7 million (95% CI, 17.0–104.7 million) people in Europe were exposed to Canada smoke days (more people than in Canada itself), with an average of 1.0 days per person, mostly during the period between 26 June and 7 July. In turn, we estimate 5,400 (95% CI, 3,400–7,400) acute deaths attributable to exposure on those Canada smoke days, including 4,100 (95% CI, 2,600–5,600) in the USA and 1,300 (95% CI, 800–1,800) in Canada (Fig. 4a).

Source Data

With 5 months of continuous exposure to smoke from the 2023 Canadian wildfires (Fig. 3), the chronic health impacts of the 2023 Canadian wildfires were also substantial and widespread (Fig. 4b). Worldwide, we estimate that 82,100 (95% CI, 47,700–116,500) people died prematurely attributable to chronic smoke exposure from the 2023 Canadian wildfires (or 0.9% of the total PM2.5-related deaths and 0.1% of total all-cause deaths worldwide in 2023), with 64,300 (95% CI, 37,800–90,900) deaths occurring in North America and Europe. Of these deaths, 41,900 (95% CI, 28,400–55,400) occurred in North America, including 33,000 (95% CI, 22,500–43,500) in the USA and 8,300 (95% CI, 5,800–10,800) in Canada (accounting for about 17% and 39% of total PM2.5 attributable deaths or 1.2% and 2.9% of total all-cause deaths in those countries in 2023, respectively). Longer-range health impacts were also substantial. In Europe, we estimate 22,400 (95% CI, 14,900–29,900) attributable chronic deaths in Europe related to the intercontinental transport of smoke from the Canadian fires (Fig. 4b), accounting for 3.8% of total PM2.5 attributable deaths and 0.3% of total all-cause deaths in 2023.

Our results quantify the magnitude and extent of smoke pollution and health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Although our analysis is focused on the year 2023, we also compare the results with 2021 and 2017, which had the second- and third-greatest wildfire emissions from Canada since 2000 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The 2023 Canadian wildfires induced 2.6-times and 5.3-times higher global annual PM2.5 exposure than that of 2021 and 2017, respectively, demonstrating the large impacts on global air pollution. Previous studies have argued that wildfire-related PM2.5 has influenced trends in annual PM2.5 concentration in the USA since 20169. With increasing PM2.5 exposure from Canadian wildfires from 2017 to 2023 (2017, 0.26 μg m–3; 2021, 0.55 μg m–3; 2023, 1.49 μg m–3), our results show that transboundary smoke pollution may have remarkably contributed to the reversed PM2.5 trend in the USA.

Our model can be evaluated in multiple ways. First, the station-based 20-fold cross-validation shows that the global daily PM2.5 concentrations we model agree well with surface observations (R2 = 0.84, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = 8.62 μg m–3; Extended Data Fig. 8) and are comparable to other recent studies10,41. Second, following a similar approach to ref. 10, modelled daily PM2.5 concentrations are compared with surface observations during fire events in Canada and the USA (Methods). During 20 such fire events in Canada and the USA (which together account for >80% of fire-related PM2.5 exposure in 2023), our results agree well with daily PM2.5 observations in both Canada (R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 16.50 μg m–3) and the USA (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 12.50 μg m–3) (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 4).

More importantly, to investigate the impact of different emission estimates in fire inventories42,43, we conduct two additional sensitivity analyses to derive global daily PM2.5 concentrations by using the QFED and the GFAS as the a priori inventory. In general, we found that the performances of the three inventories are comparable. Machine-learning-based global daily PM2.5 concentrations with the three fire inventories (that is, GFED, QFED and GFAS) show similar accuracy when comparing with surface observations in the sample-based cross-validation (R2 = 0.87–0.88, RMSE = 7.46–7.92 μg m–3; Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). During 20 selected fire events, modelled daily PM2.5 concentrations with the different fire inventories show consistent performance against surface observations in the USA (R2 = 0.78–0.80, RMSE = 11.70–12.50 μg m–3) but moderate differences in Canada (R2 = 0.59–0.75, RMSE = 12.83–16.50 μg m–3). Global fire-related annual PM2.5 exposure in 2023 estimated with the GFED and the GFAS are very close (1.32 μg m–3 and 1.30 μg m–3, respectively), whereas the QFED-based estimates (2.36 μg m–3) are 79% higher than the other two. In Canada, fire-related annual PM2.5 exposure estimated with the 3 inventories shows better agreement (3.75–4.49 μg m–3) than the global average. In the USA, GFED- and GFAS-based estimates on fire-related annual PM2.5 exposure in 2023 are close to each other, whereas the QFED-based estimates are 59–70% higher, as does the comparison with other recent studies (Supplementary Fig. 14). To put our results in context with recent analyses using a similar approach9,10,11,44, we present the GFED-based estimates in this work, and we believe that the impacts of fire inventory choice on our conclusions are minor given their similar fire-related PM2.5 exposure estimates in Canada.

Various exposure–response functions have been used in previous studies (Supplementary Tables 7–9) when estimating acute and chronic deaths attributable to wildfire PM2.5 exposure, including functions derived from global15,40,45,46 or regional47,48,49 meta-analysis and derived for all-cause mortality15,40,46,47,48,49,50 or cause-specific mortality45. Here we use widely used global pooled functions derived for all-cause mortality15,40 to estimate acute and chronic deaths given the global nature of this study. The estimated global acute and chronic deaths attributable to the 2023 Canadian wildfires varied by a factor of 4 (1,300–5,400) and 5 (31,000–152,000), respectively, when different exposure–response functions were used (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8; see Methods for details), indicating large variations in wildfire PM2.5 exposure–response functions and the urgent need for well-designed epidemiological studies. Even still, the overall conclusion of this study, that is, the enormous and far-reaching PM2.5 pollution and health burden from a single large wildfire, remain robust.

Our findings are subject to several important uncertainties and limitations. Fire emissions have large uncertainties in general owing to errors in emission factors and estimates of fuel burned37, which are then propagated within chemical transport models such as the GEOS-Chem model we use, leading to uncertainties in both simulated PM2.5 concentrations and estimates of the contribution of fire emissions (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). Smoke-injection height is not considered in the GEOS-Chem simulation, which may lead to overestimates and underestimates of fire-related PM2.5 concentration in the fire source region and the downwind region, respectively51. The all-source estimates of PM2.5 exposure we develop are also subject to uncertainties derived from errors in input data and the machine-learning model itself (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 17). Finally, there are uncertainties in our estimates of attributable mortality owing to statistical methods and the limited epidemiology evidence on which exposure–response functions are based. In each case, we have assessed and quantified uncertainties by comprehensive analysis and sensitivity testing, integrating and aggregating errors in all steps through Monte Carlo, and we report 95% CIs for all of our main results. Further details about the calculation of uncertainties are in Methods.

Beyond these quantified uncertainties, we are cognizant of several limitations in our approach that might be improved by future studies. For example, the relatively coarse resolution of the GEOS-Chem model (2° × 2.5°) may underestimate or overestimate fire-related pollution exposure52,53 (it is noted that the baseline exposures are resolved at 0.1° × 0.1° resolution). Simulating long-range transport of wildfire-related PM2.5 and quantifying its contribution to total PM2.5 exposure are subject to uncertainties. After long-range transport, pollution from local sources may outweigh the contribution of the Canadian wildfires to the annual mean PM2.5 concentration. The contribution of the 2023 Canadian wildfires was statistically significant over North America and Europe when compared with the interannual variability in PM2.5 concentrations but statistically insignificant over other downwind regions (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 18).

The health impacts we estimate assume a uniform toxicity of different PM2.5 species, which may underestimate the health impacts of wildfire emissions that have a higher proportion of carbonaceous aerosols whose toxicity tends to be greater than that of other species54,55. Wildfire-related PM2.5 may also contain more oxidative and proinflammatory components that could increase oxidative potential during long-range transport, and thereby affect health effects in downwind regions56,57. These factors are not accounted for in current PM2.5 exposure–response functions and deserve further investigation. Although increased toxicity of wildfire-related PM2.5 compared with all-source PM2.5 has been observed, evidence of the health effects of wildfire-related PM2.5 is still limited13,58,59,60. In particular, some studies have reported mixed effects on acute health impacts in regions with limited sample size or varying analytic approaches15,59,60,61. Our estimates of chronic mortality are also estimated using an exposure–response function for all-source PM2.5 rather than for wildfire PM2.5 given the lack of epidemiological evidence. Further well-designed epidemiological studies on this topic are urgently needed. In addition, we limit our analysis of fire-related health impacts to attributable mortality; numerous studies have reported non-fatal impacts of acute wildfire smoke exposure13,58. Lastly, although we use ambient outdoor PM2.5 concentrations as the indicator of PM2.5 exposure during fire events, successfully limiting infiltration of PM2.5 into indoor environments can substantially reduce such exposure and related health impacts. Further investigation of the changes in human behaviour and related PM2.5 exposure during fire events will thus help to improve the accuracy of estimated health impacts in the future.

Nonetheless, our results robustly reveal that the 2023 Canadian wildfires led to substantial and extensive long-range PM2.5 pollution and health impacts. Given recent trends in the frequency and severity of boreal and temperate wildfires62 and further projected increases in extreme fires under climate change33,34,35, the global health impacts of the wildfires we assess can be expected to continue and grow in the future. Although many places are investing in efforts to manage wildfire risks via landscape-scale fuels management and early suppression, the vast extent and remoteness of many fire-prone forests presents a daunting and long-term task. In the meantime, accurate air-quality forecasting and pollution alert systems may be quick and cost-effective options for reducing human exposure to wildfire smoke63,64. Given the relatively large differences among current fire emission inventories42,43, such forecast and alert systems could benefit from improved fire emission estimates based on advanced satellite observations. Moreover, the transboundary wildfire impacts we demonstrate suggest the potential value of international cooperation to monitor and prevent extreme wildfires.

This study combines multiple datasets and models, as presented in Extended Data Fig. 1, to estimate the contribution of the 2023 Canadian wildfires to global PM2.5 exposure and health impacts under a near-real-time framework (http://tapdata.org.cn). We also analyse two additional years, 2021 and 2017, which were reported as the years with the second- and third-largest wildfire emissions in Canada since 2000 (Extended Data Fig. 2b), for comparison. We first used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model36 at a spatial resolution of 2° × 2.5° and 3 near-real-time global fire emission inventories, that is, the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 with small fires (GFEDv4.1s)37,65, the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 (QFEDv2.5r1)38 and the Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFASv1.2)39, to simulate the global daily PM2.5 concentrations and the fractional shares in total PM2.5 concentrations contributed by wildfire emissions using a zero-out approach. Second, to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of the global daily PM2.5 estimation, we developed a machine-learning-based PM2.5 retrieval model that combines data from multiple sources, including ground-monitoring measurements, satellite retrievals, reanalysis data and GEOS-Chem simulations, to estimate the global daily PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1°. The PM2.5 retrieval model was trained using GEOS-Chem simulations with the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS as a priori fire emissions, respectively, and three sets of global daily PM2.5 estimates were derived. Then the retrieved total PM2.5 concentrations based on the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS were multiplied by previously simulated fractional contributions with corresponding fire emissions, to obtain the PM2.5 exposure attributable to wildfires. The performance of the three fire emission inventories in estimating fire-related PM2.5 exposures was evaluated, and the GFED-based results were selected for presentation and further analysis to facilitate comparisons with other recent studies that use similar approaches9,10,11,44. To investigate the transboundary impact of Canadian wildfires globally and in North America, we further quantified the contributions of five regions' wildfires (that is, Eastern Canada, Western Canada, Eastern USA, Western USA and other global regions; Extended Data Fig. 3b) to PM2.5 concentrations by conducting additional zero-out scenarios using the GFED emission inventory. Finally, we assessed the acute and chronic deaths attributable to PM2.5 pollution from Canadian wildfires using previously established exposure–response functions15,40. Further details of each analytical step are provided below.

A fire emission inventory is an essential input dataset for our analyses. We separately examined the impacts of fire emissions using three near-real-time fire emission inventories available for the year 2023, the GFED37,65, the QFED38 and the GFAS39. The model results and fire-related PM2.5 estimates using each of the three fire emissions datasets are discussed in ‘Model evaluation'.

The GFED inventory was developed for use in large-scale modelling studies. The latest GFEDv4.1s used in this study is archived at https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/5y7TdE6ufwpkAW1. It is based on 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area maps66 supplemented with MODIS active fires converted to burned area67. After 2016, emissions are derived from MODIS active fires scaled to emissions based on the 2001–2016 period when both datasets overlapped. Emission factors, mostly from ref. 68, are used to convert fire carbon emissions to trace gases and aerosols. The emissions, including carbon, dry matter, CO2, CO, NOx, organic carbon, black carbon, PM2.5, total particulate matter and SO2 among others, are available from 1997 to 2023 at 0.25° × 0.25° globally37,65.

The QFED inventory was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and serves as the standard fire emissions in the GEOS data assimilation system and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data products69. In this study, QFEDv2.5r1 is used, which is available at https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/gmao/qfed/. On the basis of a top-down approach, QFED obtains the fire radiative power (FRP) and location from satellite observations from MODIS Level 2 fire products and MODIS Geolocation products and calculates the open combustion of non-fossilized vegetative or organic fuel38. It provides high spatiotemporal resolution and near-real-time global biomass burning emissions, including the 0.1° × 0.1° daily emissions of black carbon, organic carbon, SO2, CO, CO2, PM2.5, NH3, NOx and so on, from 2001 to present.

The GFASv1.2 data are used for the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global atmospheric composition and regional air-quality forecasts, which can be found at https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-fire-emissions-gfas?tab=overview/. Fire emissions are calculated based on FRP measurements from two MODIS instruments onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellite that are first converted to estimates of the dry matter consumed by fire and then to emissions using biome-specific emission factors. The GFAS provides daily averaged biomass burning and vegetation fire emissions for 40 pyrogenic species (aerosols, reactive gases and greenhouse gases) from 2003 to the present, with a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° (ref. 39).

Using each of the three fire emission inventories (that is, the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS), we estimated the global PM2.5 concentrations using the three-dimensional global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem36. These concentrations are an important input to our PM2.5 retrieval model (‘Retrieval of global PM2.5 based on multi-source data fusion') and are used to quantify the fractional contributions of wildfire emissions to total PM2.5 concentrations (‘Estimation of fire-specific PM2.5 exposure' and ‘Fire source attribution'). GEOS-Chem has been used by numerous previous studies to simulate smoke pollution from wildfires8,43,70,71,72,73,74,75,76.

GEOS-Chem v.14.0.1 (https://zenodo.org/records/7271974/) is used in this study. The near-real-time meteorological data from the Goddard Earth Observation System-Forward Processing (GEOS-FP)77 of the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) was used to drive the GEOS-Chem model. The GEOS-FP data span the time period from 2011 to the present, with a native resolution of 0.25° × 0.3125° and 72 vertical levels. We reduce the vertical levels to 47 and the spatial resolution to 2.0° × 2.5° to support the global chemical transport simulations. GEOS-Chem uses standard full chemistry with detailed oxidant–aerosol chemistry. Sulfate–nitrate–ammonium aerosol thermodynamics are computed with ISORROPIAv2.278.

All emissions in GEOS-Chem are configured by HEMCO (Harmonized Emissions Component) 3.079, to combine and regrid the different emissions. The global anthropogenic emissions (including shipping) of NOx, SO2, CO, NH3, black carbon, organic carbon and volatile organic compounds are provided by the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) v2 inventory (https://data.pnnl.gov/dataset/CEDS-4-21-21/)80. Aircraft emissions are from the Aviation Emissions Inventory Code (AEIC)81 inventory. For global fire emissions, GFEDv4.1s, QFEDv2.5r1 and GFASv1.2 are used respectively. Dust82, sea salt83, lighting NOx (ref. 84), soil NOx (ref. 85) and biogenic volatile organic compounds (MEGAN v2.186) are calculated online in HEMCO. We use the non-local scheme implemented in ref. 87 for the boundary-layer mixing in GEOS-Chem, which emits all emissions into the atmospheric boundary layer, including wildfire emissions.

We estimate the global daily PM2.5 exposures from all sources at a 0.1° × 0.1° horizon resolution using a multilayer machine-learning retrieval model that fuses data from ground-monitoring measurements, satellite retrievals, GEOS-Chem model simulations, meteorological fields, reanalysis data and population distribution. The structure of the PM2.5 retrieval model is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. We separately train our retrieval model with GEOS-Chem simulations based on the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS emissions (but with the same model structure) to derive three sets of global PM2.5 concentration estimates. Further details about the data sources and the model structure are provided below.

We collected PM2.5 surface monitoring data from different global regions as model input. We obtained surface PM2.5 measurements in Canada from Environmental Canada (https://data-donnees.az.ec.gc.ca/data/air/monitor/national-air-pollution-surveillance-naps-program/Data-Donnees/). We obtained PM2.5 measurements in the USA from the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) AirNow (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data) and from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) (https://views.cira.colostate.edu/fed/QueryWizard/Default.aspx). To improve the representation of air pollution, we also collected PM2.5 monitoring data from: the AirFire programme of the US Forest Service (https://info.airfire.org/airmonitor-package) for the USA; the European Air Quality Portal (https://eeadmz1-cws-wp-air02.azurewebsites.net/) for Europe; the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC; http://www.cnemc.cn/) for China; and the OpenAQ (https://openaq.org/) for other regions around the world. Hourly measurements were averaged as daily records and only daily records generated from at least 16 hourly data points were included. In summary, we collected approximately 453,000 valid daily records from about 1,610 monitors in North America, approximately 567,000 valid daily records from about 2,010 stations in Europe, approximately 612,000 valid daily records from about 1,720 stations in China, as well as approximately 68,000 valid daily records from about 850 stations in other regions for the year 2023.

Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals were extracted from the MODIS Level 2 aerosol products (MOD04 and MYD04) at a 0.1° spatial resolution88. To improve the data coverage and better reflect the aerosol loading during the day, we first fused the AOD retrievals from the Dark Target algorithm and the Deep Blue algorithm with daily linear regressions, and then fused the AOD from the Aqua and Terra satellites with daily linear regressions. As considerable gaps in the AOD data still existed after this data fusion, we used the CAMS modelling and reanalysis data (https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu)89 with complete coverage to provide information on the spatial distribution of aerosols. CAMS parameters, including the AOD at 550 nm, black carbon AOD, organic carbon AOD, wildfire combustion rate, FRP and total column carbon monoxide, were adopted in the model. The MODIS AOD and various CAMS AODs were treated as separate predictors in the retrieval model.

The PM2.5 simulations from GEOS-Chem were used in this model. As three fire emission inventories were used in GEOS-Chem to simulate surface PM2.5 concentrations, we constructed three model training datasets with different GEOS-Chem simulations using the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS, respectively.

Smoke plume information in North America was collected from the Hazard Mapping System (HMS; https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html#about)90, provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS). The density-assigned and time-marked plumes polygons were manually generated from GOES-16 and GOES-17 ABI true-colour imagery. We assigned the time-specific plume data to daily plume density and included it in the model to provide valuable information on smoke plume distributions in North America. Meteorological fields, including daily average air temperature at 2 m, specific humidity at 2 m, relative humidity, surface pressure, boundary-layer height, total latent energy flux, evaporation from turbulence, U and V wind components at 10 m, and total precipitation, were extracted from GEOS-FP reanalysis data at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.3125° and downscaled to the 0.1° modelling grid by the inverse distance weighting algorithm. The gridded population distribution data for 2020 were obtained from WorldPop (https://www.worldpop.org/) at a resolution of 30 arcseconds91,92 and we assumed a constant population distribution in 2017, 2021 and 2023. We constrained the gridded WorldPop population data with national total population for each year from the United Nations (https://population.un.org/wpp/)93, US Census Bureau, Population Division (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html)94 and Statistics Canada (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/)16.

The total PM2.5 retrieval model was designed with a three-layer random forest structure following our previous work95 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The first-layer model predicts the high-pollution index, which is a binary variable indicating whether the station-day concentration is higher than the mean plus two standard deviations of PM2.5 concentrations of the corresponding station and month. In our previous work96, we found that a two-layer model including the high-pollution indicator and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) resampling algorithm can correct the low- bias from the unbalanced training sample of high-pollution events. Following the approach, we applied the SMOTE resampling algorithm to increase the representation of high-pollution events in the model training samples. The second-layer model uses the prediction of high-pollution index as a predictor to predict the total PM2.5 concentrations. Previous studies have shown that the model trained with the residual can correct the systematic bias and improve the model prediction accuracy97,98. The third-layer model then predicts the residual between PM2.5 predictions and measurements and was trained by with-fire samples and no-fire samples separately, to highlight the potential differences in PM2.5 characteristics during fire events. Here the with-fire samples were defined as samples with CAMS combustion rate >0 or the HMS plume density >0 (refs. 8,9). The final PM2.5 concentration estimation is the prediction from the second-layer model plus the prediction from the third-layer model. The model was trained separately with data for 2023, 2021 and 2017 as well as with GEOS-Chem simulations with the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS emissions.

PM2.5 exposure attributable to wildfire emissions was then estimated using three fire emissions, respectively. In detail, the wildfire-related PM2.5 was quantified by multiplying the GEOS-Chem simulated fire contributions to total PM2.5 by the retrieved all-source PM2.5 concentrations. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the GEOS-Chem simulations used in this study. We conducted the GEOS-Chem simulations with the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS inventories separately (that is, ‘base' in Supplementary Table 1) as well as the no-fire GEOS-Chem simulation that turned off global fire emissions (that is, ‘nofire' in Supplementary Table 1). All other emissions mentioned in ‘GEOS-Chem simulation' are the same in the base and nofire simulations. Then the fraction of PM2.5 concentrations attributable to wildfires was calculated by equation (1) on a 2° × 2.5° grid, as determined by the GEOS-Chem model. We constructed three sets of wildfire-fraction data from the GEOS-Chem simulations driven by the three fire emissions. Likewise, the anthropogenic-related PM2.5 was calculated using equation (2) with similar model runs (turning off anthropogenic emissions, that is, ‘noanthro' in Supplementary Table 1). The contributions from sources other than wildfires and anthropogenic activities were then obtained by subtracting their contributions from the total as in equation (3):

where the subscript k represents the three fire emissions, that is, GFED, QFED and GFAS. GCbase,k and GCnoanthro,k represent the GEOS-Chem-simulated PM2.5 concentrations from the base and noanthro scenarios using fire emissions k, respectively. GCnofire represents the simulation with fire emissions turned off. Ffire,k, Fanthro,k and Fother,k represent the fractional contribution of wildfires, anthropogenic and other emissions to PM2.5 estimated from fire emissions k, respectively.

Then we spatially match the PM2.5 fractions from GEOS-Chem simulations (2° × 2.5°) with the 0.1° PM2.5 retrievals through bilinear interpolation. The PM2.5 retrievals were multiplied by the corresponding fractions to get the fire-related, anthropogenic-related and other-source-related PM2.5, as shown in equations (4)–(6):

where CPM,k represents the total PM2.5 concentrations estimated from the machine-learning-based model using fire emissions k (k = GFED, QFED, GFAS) in ‘Retrieval of global PM2.5 based on multi-source data fusion', Cfire,k, Canthro,k and Cother,k represent the fire-, anthropogenic- and other-source-related PM2.5 concentrations based on fire emissions k.

Our models were fully evaluated at each step of the construction of fire-related PM2.5 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 1): the performance of the GEOS-Chem PM2.5 simulations, the performance of the PM2.5 retrieval model and the performance of PM2.5 retrievals during fire events. Models based on the three fire emissions (GFED, QFED and GFAS) were compared in all the evaluations to understand the impacts of fire emissions on model performance. Total and fire-related PM2.5 concentrations estimated using the three fire emissions were compared with each other. We also quantified the wildfire-related PM2.5 estimates in previous years (2017 and 2021) and compared them with other studies as an additional evaluation of our methods.

The annual average GEOS-Chem PM2.5 concentrations driven by three fire emission inventories (GFED, QFED and GFAS) were evaluated against PM2.5 ground observations in Canada and the USA (Supplementary Fig. 15). In Canada, the modelled PM2.5 correlated reasonably well with ground observations, with R ranging between 0.41 and 0.69 and normalized model bias (NMB) between 0.01 and 0.72 for the three fire emissions. We noticed one outlier with unrealistically high PM2.5 simulations in Canada resulted from high fire emission estimates; therefore, we also reported evaluation statistics without this data point to avoid the effects of an outlier (Supplementary Fig. 15). After removing the outlier, R between modelled and observed PM2.5 increased from 0.41–0.69 to 0.66–0.82 and NMB was reduced from 0.01–0.72 to −0.04–0.30 in Canada. In the USA, simulations based on the three fire emissions had comparable performance against ground observations, with R between 0.46 and 0.47. As the only differences in these simulations are the underlying fire emission inventories, the differences in model performance can be solely attributed to the inventories. Compared with the GEOS-Chem simulation with the GFED inventory, using the QFED inventory helps to reduce both the overestimates of PM2.5 concentration in Canada (NMB from 0.30 to 0.16) and the underestimates in the USA (NMB from −0.22 to −0.06), whereas using the GFAS inventory reduces the overestimates of PM2.5 concentration in Canada (NMB from 0.30 to −0.04) but gives similar results to GFED in the USA (NMB from −0.22 to −0.27). By comparing estimates of fire-related PM2.5 exposure from different fire emission inventories in this way, we can evaluate the effects of GEOS-Chem model performance on the results (‘Comparisons of fire-related PM2.5 among three fire emissions and with previous studies').

The PM2.5 retrieval model was evaluated by both station-based and sample-based 20-fold cross-validation. The model training dataset was randomly divided into 20 equal folds according to air-quality monitoring stations and station-day observations, separately. Then the model was trained on 19 of these folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process was repeated 20 times until each fold of the data was used for testing once. The model performance was quantified by the comparisons between cross-validation predictions and ground measurements at the daily, monthly and yearly levels to reflect model uncertainties at different temporal scales (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 13). In addition, to highlight the model's ability in retrieving daily variations in PM2.5 when controlling the seasonal and spatial variations, we included month-intercept (fix-month R2) as well as month and station intercepts (fix-month-and-station R2) when computing R2 (within R2) of the 20-fold cross-validation predictions following a previous study10 (Supplementary Table 5). We also calculated the station-specific R2 to show the variations in model performance in space. Evaluation results of the retrieval models trained with GEOS-Chem simulations using the three fire emissions in 2023 are listed in Extended Data Fig. 8, Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 5. As the HMS data are available for only North America, we assessed the impact of including HMS data on global PM2.5 retrievals. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 17, inclusion of the HMS data in the model led to substantial differences in PM2.5 retrievals over North America whereas it had minor impacts in other regions. Therefore, we incorporated the HMS data as a predictor to improve the accuracy of wildfire-related PM2.5 estimates in North America.

Globally, the retrieval model characterizes variations in PM2.5 well, and models based on the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS performed similarly well under both the station-based and sample-based 20-fold cross-validation. The station-based 20-fold cross-validation R2 ranged between 0.84 and 0.85 (RMSE between 8.55 μg m−3 and 8.62 μg m−3) at the daily scale, all equal to 0.88 (RMSE between 5.80 μg m−3 and 5.95 μg m−3) at the monthly scale, and ranged between 0.87 and 0.88 (RMSE between 4.80 μg m−3 and 5.00 μg m−3), in the year 2023. The sample-based cross-validation results are comparable to the station-based cross-validation results, indicating robust model performance in regions with limited observations. All models trained with the three fire emission inventories showed only a slight decrease in R2 when controlling the seasonal and spatial variations (that is, fix-month R2 between 0.86 and 0.88, and fix-month-and-station R2 between 0.80 and 0.82), indicating the model's ability to capture daily variations in PM2.5 (Supplementary Table 5). Spatially, the global median station-specific R2 was 0.79, 0.79 and 0.79 with 90% of station-specific R2 above 0.37, 0.36 and 0.37 for models based on the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS, respectively. Our model performances are comparable to previous studies developing a global PM2.5 retrieval model, in that the cross-validation R2 of daily retrievals is around 0.91 and the RMSE ranges between 8.4 μg m−3 and 9.2 μg m−3 (refs. 10,41).

Regionally we found a lower R2 in Canada, which is mainly caused by several outliers in Canada resulting from unrealistically high GEOS-Chem simulations mentioned in ‘Evaluation of GEOS-Chem PM2.5 simulations'. To avoid the influence of these occasional outliers on model evaluation, we reported the model performance after removing data points outside 2σ of the Cook's distance of linear regression (Supplementary Table 5). Models based on the three fire emissions performed comparably well after removing the outliers. As these outliers of the retrieved PM2.5 concentration occurred in a few days and in remote regions with sparse population, they do not considerably affect our exposure assessment and health burden quantification.

To assess the model's performance in capturing fire-related PM2.5 variations, we further evaluated the model performance during fire events (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 4)—when the PM2.5 is dominated by wildfires. We first identified several major fire events and then compared the station-day observations during these fire events with the sample-based 20-fold cross-validation predictions. Thus, the station-day observations selected for evaluations were excluded from the model training to reveal the model performance in regions and periods without observations. We identified fire events with a similar protocol reported by an earlier work10, mainly according to the variations in PM2.5 observations. A station-day is labelled as affected by wildfires when (1) it is during one of the manually identified fire events that showed a substantial increase in national daily average PM2.5 monitoring time series data in Canada and the USA, separately. (2) The daily average PM2.5 concentration is higher than the median of all the station-day records during this fire event. Here we used the median as cut-off number rather than selecting one station with the largest increase because one station's data were not sufficient to support the validation. (3) The PM2.5 concentration is higher than twice the background PM2.5 concentration before the fire season (first 2 months in 2023) at the corresponding station. (4) The PM2.5 concentration is higher than 15 μg m−3, the WHO air-quality guidelines level. In total, 11 and 9 fire events were identified in Canada and the USA, respectively. The events lasted between 3 days and 23 days. The national fire-related PM2.5 exposure during these fire events accounted for 83% and 81% of the annual fire-related PM2.5 exposure in Canada and the USA, respectively, indicating that most significant fire events were identified by this method.

In North America, the three retrieval models with different fire emissions correctly reflected PM2.5 variations during the fire events, with similar cross-validation R2 ranging between 0.78 and 0.80 in the USA, but moderately different R2 between 0.59 and 0.75 in Canada (Supplementary Table 4). We also noticed that as previously reported41,99, our model still slightly underestimated PM2.5 levels during extreme fire events with NMB ranging between −0.14 and −0.09 and between −0.13 and −0.10 for Canada and the USA, respectively.

To further understand the impacts of different fire emissions on total and fire-related PM2.5 estimates, we compared the spatial and temporal distributions of our results among the three fire emissions (Supplementary Table 6). The spatial correlation was calculated using 3-year averaged gridded PM2.5 data among models based on the 3 fire emissions, whereas the temporal correlation was calculated using daily population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations for 3 years among models based on the 3 fire emissions. Some previous studies9,10,11,44 have investigated the impact of wildfires on PM2.5 exposure other than the 2023 Canadian extreme wildfires. We also compared our fire-related PM2.5 estimates with those previous studies as additional evaluations.

For spatial comparisons, the all-source PM2.5 estimates based on the three fire emission inventories showed similar spatial distributions to high correlations globally (all pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients r were 0.99). The spatial distributions of fire-related PM2.5 were also highly correlated between different emissions at the global scale, with pairwise r ranging between 0.88 and 0.95. The spatial patterns between the QFED-based and the GFAS-based estimates were more similar in specific regions than the GFED-base results, as fire emissions from the QFED and the GFAS were estimated using a similar approach based on FRP from the MODIS instrument. For temporal comparisons, the population-weighted daily mean all-source PM2.5 estimates showed high correlations at both the global scale (all pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients r were 0.99) and the regional scale. The fire-related PM2.5 estimates had some temporal differences globally among the 3 inventories, but showed even higher correlations in Canada and the USA, with pairwise r of fire-related PM2.5 ranging between 0.94 and 0.99 in Canada and between 0.94 and 0.97 in the USA.

Supplementary Fig. 14 shows the comparisons of estimated population-weighted fire-related PM2.5 in Canada and the USA based on the three inventories, as well as their comparisons with previous studies9,10,11,44. The fire-related PM2.5 in Canada and the USA based on the three inventories showed consistent increasing trends in 2017, 2021 and 2023; however, the magnitudes of the estimated fire-related PM2.5 varied between inventories, with the GFAS showing the lowest and the QFED showing the highest. In Canada, fire-related annual PM2.5 exposure estimated with the 3 inventories showed good agreement (3.75–4.49 μg m−3, relative difference within 20%). Given their similar fire-related PM2.5 exposure estimates in Canada, the choice of fire inventory has a relatively minor effect on our overall conclusions. In the USA, the GFED-based and the GFAS-based estimates on fire-related annual PM2.5 exposure in 2023 are also similar (1.96 μg m−3 and 1.83 μg m−3, respectively), whereas the QFED-based estimates (3.11 μg m−3) are 59–70% higher, consistent with several other recent studies (Supplementary Fig. 14). Because the GEOS-Chem PM2.5 simulations with the QFED inventory show better agreement with surface observations in the USA, our estimates of fire-related contributions to PM2.5 may be underestimated in the USA when using the GFED inventory.

Our population-weighted estimates of fire-related PM2.5 based on GFED emissions in 2017 (1.62 μg m−3 in Canada and 1.16 μg m−3 in the USA) are nearly identical to estimates by a previous study that used GFED emissions from 2000–201910 (1.50 μg m−3 in Canada and 1.21 μg m−3 in the USA). Another study44 estimated the source contribution to ambient PM2.5 in 2017 globally using GFED fire emissions and reported that the population-weighted fire-related PM2.5 in Canada and the USA was 1.35 μg m−3 and 0.90 μg m−3, respectively, again similar to the GFED-based and the GFAS-based estimates. In addition, ref. 11 developed a data fusion model to divide the fire-source and other-source PM2.5 in the USA and estimated that the mean fire-source PM2.5 concentrations inside and outside the vicinity of an EPA air-quality monitoring station (defined by a 5-km radius) in 2017 are 0.97 μg m−3 and 0.92 μg m−3, respectively, also close to our GFED-based and GFAS-based estimates.

In summary, although the GFED, the QFED and the GFAS inventories show varied air-pollutant emissions and led to different fire-related PM2.5 concentrations in GEOS-Chem simulations, the total PM2.5 retrieval models with different fire emission inventories showed generally consistent performance. For the fire-related PM2.5 concentrations, the GFED-based and the GFAS-based estimates are similar and more comparable to previous studies9,10,11,44. We understand that each fire inventory has its own advantages and disadvantages; therefore, we cannot justify which one is the best. Given that the GFED has frequently been used in recent analyses8,10,12,43, to put our results in the context with the literature, we choose to present the GFED-based estimates in the main text.

To further quantify the contributions of fires from different regions in North America, we divided Canada and the USA into four regions, Eastern Canada (CE), Western Canada (CW), Eastern USA (UE) and Western USA (UW) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). According to the EPA's delineation of North American ecological regions (Supplementary Fig. 2; https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america/), the Level I ecoregions divide North America into 15 broads. It can be seen that the majority of Canada is covered by forests, whereas the eastern and western parts of the USA are separated by plains and deserts. Therefore, we defined the above four regions according to administrative divisions in combination with the ecological regions in this study.

We then implemented simulations with regional wildfire emissions turned off using the GFED emissions (Supplementary Table 2). In addition, given that the zero-out approach may lead to additional bias owing to the nonlinear relationship between emissions and modelled PM2.5 concentrations, the case of ‘offNA' is used to evaluate this impact and constrain the results. The regional contributions can be calculated using equations (7)–(11):

where GCoffCE,GFED, GCoffCW,GFED, GCoffUE,GFED, GCoffUW,GFED and GCoffNA,GFED are the GEOS-Chem-simulated PM2.5 concentrations using the GFED emissions under the offCE, offCW, offUE, offUW and offNA scenarios, respectively. FfireCE,GFED, FfireCW,GFED, FfireUE,GFED and FfireUW,GFED are the fractional contributions to the PM2.5 concentrations from fire emissions in CE, CW, UE and UW, respectively.

The zero-out approach used here may introduce additional bias due to the nonlinear relationship between emissions and modelled PM2.5 concentrations. The bias can be calculated as equation (12):

The absolute and relative biases due to nonlinearity are presented in Supplementary Fig. 16. Over the four regions, the absolute biases range from −0.009 μg m−3 to 0.012 μg m−3, and the relative biases range from −1.35% to −0.09%, indicating that the biases related to nonlinear effects are relatively small.

To investigate the significance of the Canadian wildfire impact on the interannual variability in PM2.5 concentrations in downwind regions, we compared the estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentrations from the 2023 Canadian wildfires with 2000–2023 satellite-derived annual PM2.5 concentrations (https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/#V6.GL.02.03/)100 and 2014–2023 annual mean PM2.5 observations over the USA and Europe (Supplementary Fig. 18). When comparing with the interannual variability in PM2.5 concentrations, the contribution of the 2023 Canadian wildfires was statistically significant in North America and Europe whereas it was statistically insignificant over other downwind regions. In the USA, the 2023 Canadian wildfires contributed to an average of 1.50 μg m−3 annual mean PM2.5 over the locations of the EPA sites, larger than the differences in observed the PM2.5 concentration between 2022 and 2023 (0.99 μg m−3) as well as the mean interannual variabilities in the observed PM2.5 concentration during 2014–2023 (0.59 μg m−3, P < 0.01). In Europe, the 2023 Canadian wildfires contributed to an average of 0.43 μg m−3 annual mean PM2.5 over the locations of European Environment Agency (EEA) sites, accounting for 20% of the differences in observed PM2.5 concentration between 2022 and 2023 (2.10 μg m−3) and 14% of the mean interannual variabilities in observed PM2.5 concentration during 2014–2023 (3.02 μg m−3, P < 0.05).

The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model has been widely used to track the back trajectories for air parcels arriving at the receptor101,102,103,104. To track the transports and sources of PM2.5 pollution in Europe related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires, we used the HYSPLIT model to calculate the 7-day back trajectories for the entire European region (excluding Russia) on a 0.1° × 0.1° grid basis from May to September in 2023 at an hourly resolution. The HYSPLIT model version 5.3.0 (https://www.ready.noaa.gov/ready2-bin/getlinuxtrial.pl/) was used for the analysis. Each backward trajectory was run for 7 days with 1-hour time steps, initialized at 0:00, 6:00, 12:00 and 18:00 coordinated universal time (UTC) daily. The arrival height was 500 m above ground, approximately within the planetary boundary layer. The HYSPLIT model was driven by three-dimensional meteorological fields from the Global Data Assimilation System of National Centers for Environmental Prediction (GDAS NCEP), with a time resolution of 3 hours, a horizontal resolution of 1° × 1° and a vertical resolution of 23 levels.

We then defined the transport trajectory density (TTD) to represent the capability of pollutant transport from source regions to the receptor region (Europe), which is the total number of trajectories passing through the 0.1° × 0.1° grid box of source regions during the study period. The TTD of each grid box during the study period can be calculated by equation (13):

where i is the index of each grid box and m is the total number of trajectories that passed through all receptor grid boxes (81,052 in this study). For each trajectory j (ranging from 1 to m), Fi,j is defined as 1 if trajectory j passes through grid box i; otherwise, Fi,j is defined as 0. Therefore, TTDi is the total number of trajectories that passed through the grid box i during the study period. Supplementary Fig. 9 shows the spatial distribution of TTD sums from May to September in 2023. High TTD values were observed over the majority of Canada between May and September 2023, indicating the frequent trans-Atlantic plumes that prompt pollution transported from the wildfire source regions to downwind regions, and finally reached Europe.

Supplementary Fig. 10 further illustrates the vertical transport process that brought the Canadian wildfire plumes to the surface of Europe during the late-June trans-Atlantic episode. High PM2.5 concentrations are observed on 29 June and 2 July over the large areas in Northern France and Belgium (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 10a). During the pollution episode, the GEOS-Chem simulation shows that the enhancement of surface PM2.5 concentration from Canadian wildfires was accompanied by a high PM2.5 concentration at high altitude (Supplementary Fig. 10b). The modelled PM2.5 enhancement from Canadian wildfires corresponds well with the observed peak of PM2.5 concentration, demonstrating the vertical transport process during the episode. Meanwhile, 7-day back trajectories with 500-m arrival height indicate that the airflows originating from the Canadian wildfire source regions were transported into the boundary layer above the site location on 29 June and 2 July (Supplementary Fig. 10c), providing compelling evidence of long-range transport of wildfire-related PM2.5 from Canada to Europe.

The acute and chronic mortality attributable to 2023-Canadian-wildfires-related PM2.5 exposure were estimated separately. The acute mortality was estimated for all grids ‘Canada smoke days' in which both (1) grid daily mean PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 15 μg m−3 (the recommended 24-hour average guideline levels of the WHO) and (2) Canadian-wildfires-related PM2.5 accounted for at least half of the total daily PM2.5 (ref. 10). Details on the estimation of fire-specific PM2.5 concentrations are described above. Following previous studies50, the acute mortality attributable to Canadian wildfires PM2.5 exposure was assessed using equation (14):

where Di,j represents the all-cause acute premature mortality attributable to Canadian-wildfires-related PM2.5 exposure in grid i on day j. RR(Ci,j) represents the relative risk at exposure level C in grid i on day j and the exposure level was assessed as the daily average Canadian-wildfires-related PM2.5 concentrations. A global RR estimates of 1.021 (95% CI, 1.018, 1.024)15 per 10 μg m−3 increase of wildfire PM2.5 exposure was used for all regions. Pi represents the population in grid i that was constructed as described in ‘Estimation of fire-specific PM2.5 exposure'. Ii represents the baseline all-cause death rate in grid i that belong to Country a, which was collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019)45.

Compelling evidence for the increased toxicity of wildfire-related PM2.5 relative to all-source PM2.5 have been reported13,58, and various exposure–response functions for acute exposure to wildfire PM2.5 have been developed by recent studies15,46,48,49. Here we use a widely used global pooled relative risk of wildfire PM2.5 exposure15 to estimate the acute premature mortality considering the global nature of this study and the comparability across different regions. To investigate the impacts of the choice of relative risks on the acute premature mortality estimates, we further assess the acute premature mortality attributable to the 2023 Canadian wildfires by using the relative risks for wildfire PM2.5 from newly developed global meta-analysis46, two studies in North America48,49 and relative risk from a meta-analysis on all-source PM2.5 (ref. 50). The results of comparison are presented in Supplementary Table 7. The estimated global acute premature mortality attributable to Canada smoke day exposure varied by a factor of four when different RR estimates were used. Among the different functions derived for wildfire PM2.5, mortality estimates using global pooled relative risks15,46 (ranging from 2,800 to 5,400) were higher than those using regional relative risks48,49 (1,300–2,600). Estimates using relative risks derived for wildfire PM2.5 exposure15,46,48,49 generally yield higher mortality estimates (1,300–5,400) than those using all-source relative risk50 (1,800), implying increased toxicity of wildfire-related PM2.5 compared with all-source PM2.5.

All-cause premature mortality attributable to chronic smoke exposure from the 2023 Canadian wildfires was estimated with a meta-analysis relative risk estimate of 1.08 (95% CI, 1.06, 1.09) per 10 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 exposure40.

The health burden attributable to chronic PM2.5 exposure was assessed using equation (15):

where Dy,i,n represents the chronic premature mortality attributable to Canadian-wildfires-related PM2.5 exposure in grid i. RR(Ci) represents the relative risk at exposure level C in grid i. Ci represents the annual average PM2.5 concentration in grid i. Pi represents the population in grid i, and Ii represented the baseline all-cause death rate in grid i in Country a of year 2019, which was collected from the GBD 2019 study (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019)45. The theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) for the chronic health effects attributable to PM2.5 ranged between 2.4 μg m−3 and 5.9 μg m−3, as reported in the GBD 2019 study.

The chronic exposure mortality attributable to Canadian wildfires was assessed with the direct proportion approach105,106, which assumes that the increase in mortality is in proportion to the increases in PM2.5 exposure. Thus, the chronic exposure mortality attributable to all-source ambient PM2.5 exposure was assessed first and the Canadian-wildfires-associated chronic mortality was quantified by calculating the proportion of Canadian-wildfire-derived PM2.5 within all-source ambient PM2.5.

It should be noted that the RR used here is derived for all-source PM2.5 rather than wildfire PM2.5, owing to the limited epidemiological evidence of chronic health effects from wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure. We use the exposure–response function for all-cause mortality rather than the cause-specific exposure–response function (that is, the widely used GBD approach45) as this study aims to estimate the total mortality burden whereas the cause-specific may underestimate the total chronic mortality of ambient PM2.5 (ref. 107). Relative risk derived from regional meta-analysis47,49 may differ from those derived from global pooled analysis40. Given the global nature of this study, we choose the all-cause global pooled relative risk in our analysis40. We further conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of exposure–response functions on the chronic premature mortality45,47,49, as shown in Supplementary Table 8. Using cause-specific exposure–response function45 yields 31,000 global chronic premature mortality, lower than estimates using all-cause functions40,47,49 (ranging from 82,100 to 152,000). For all-cause premature mortality estimates with 3 different relative risks, mortalities estimated by global relative risk40 (82,100) are remarkably lower than those estimated by regional relative risks47,49 (that is, the USA, 117,500–152,000), indicating large variation of relative risks across different global regions.

We also reviewed the approaches of estimating chronic health burden from wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure used in different global and regional studies12,31,44,46,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123, as shown in Supplementary Table 9. Although annual average exposure is widely used in those studies, it may not reflect the population experience of sporadic wildfire PM2.5 exposure owing to the different nature of wildfire smoke exposure and the urban and background pollution exposure. Substantial differences in chronic health burden assessment approaches were observed, which varied in mortality endpoints (cause-specific versus all-cause), the relative risk and the definition of exposed population. Many of those studies quantified PM2.5-related health impacts of landscape fires on populations that are annually impacted by fire-related air pollution from local or nearby fires, whereas our study investigated the transboundary air pollution and the health burden of a single extreme wildfire event. Specifically, ref. 31 quantified the transboundary PM2.5 health impact of wildfires in the Arctic Council, which is most comparable to the purpose of our study. In their analysis, areas where the increase in carbonaceous PM2.5 from wildfires was statistically insignificant were excluded from the health impact assessment. A previous study46 estimated global, regional, and national mortality burden attributable to fire-related PM2.5 exposure, which is estimated for all population with the same exposure–response function used in our study40. We then followed the widely accepted approach in our analysis and conducted significance tests for the estimated contribution of the annual mean PM2.5 concentration from the 2023 Canadian wildfires.

Our results are subject to a number of uncertainties and limitations. The uncertainty ranges (95% CI) in different steps of our analysis are discussed below.

First, the emission inventories used in this study bear large uncertainties. For example, the uncertainties in the GFED emissions mainly come from the inadequate representation of the natural variation of the emission factors during fire events, and the high uncertainties in the amount of fuel burned estimated from burned area. It is reported that a best-guess uncertainty assessment for GFEDv4.1s at regional scales could be a 1σ of about 50% in general but higher in areas where small fires burned area is important or where there is notable fuel consumption in organic soils37.

Second, the PM2.5 concentrations simulated by the global chemical transport model are affected by errors in emission inventories and the model's representation of physical and chemical processes such as vertical transport51 and secondary organic aerosols124. Specifically, the smoke-injection height is not considered in the GEOS-Chem simulation, which may lead to overestimates and underestimates of fire-related PM2.5 concentrations in fire source regions and downwind regions, respectively51. Given the huge computational cost for model sensitivity simulations considering the uncertainties in emissions, we use the normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD) between the modelled and the observed PM2.5 concentrations to represent the overall model errors in total PM2.5, and use the NRMSD between the modelled and the observed PM2.5 concentrations over fire events to represent the model errors in fire-related PM2.5. The NRMSD for GEOS-Chem-based total PM2.5 and fire-related PM2.5 ranged between 42.8% and 62.0% and between 44.3% and 53.0%, respectively, among Canada, the USA and Europe, but a bit higher in other regions globally (for example, close to 100.0%). Although the absolute errors in GEOS-Chem-based simulations are large, some errors are common between the total and fire-related PM2.5 and have limited impacts on their ratios.

Third, the multi-source fused PM2.5 data obtained from our retrieval model are influenced by errors in all the input data and the multilayer machine-learning model itself. We have fully evaluated the model's performance using a cross-validation approach and the performance was comparable to previous studies10,41. We use the NRMSD between PM2.5 retrieval and observed PM2.5 concentrations to represent its uncertainties (2.0–7.1% among different regions).

As presented in equation (4), the overall uncertainties involved in fire-related PM2.5 exposures are determined by uncertainties in GEOS-Chem simulated fractional contributions of fire emissions (GCfire/GCbase) and in total PM2.5 exposures based on the retrieval model (CPM). The errors in GCbase, GCfire and CPM are defined above. The errors in the ratio (GCfire/GCbase) were then quantified by 10,000 trials of Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the overall uncertainties of fire-related PM2.5 (Cfire) were derived from the aggregations of errors above.

The overall uncertainties (presented as 95% CI) of acute and chronic mortality attributable to Canadian wildfires were then assessed by Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations45. Uncertainties embedded in all input parameters of the risk assessment model were considered. The uncertainties in exposure levels are described above. The uncertainties in baseline mortality, exposure–response functions and TMREL were collected from the GBD 2019 study. The uncertainty in national total population was provided by United Nations data (high-fertility and low-fertility scenarios). All the parameters, except TMREL, which was simulated by a uniform distribution, were simulated by normal distributions.

The impacts of the 2023 Canadian wildfires on surface PM2.5 air quality have been reported in a few recent studies. By proposing a multidimensional air pollution correlation network framework, ref. 28 argued that the 2023 Canadian wildfires significantly impact the air pollution behaviour in the Northeastern USA region. Reference 29 estimated the PM2.5 concentration in the Northeastern USA in June 2023 by combining chemical transport model results and surface PM2.5 measurements. They identified two ‘smoke wake' events in June 2023 (6–8 June and 28–30 June) with significant PM2.5 enhancement caused by the transport of Canadian wildfire plumes. Our results also capture these two events in the same region, although our estimates of PM2.5 concentrations are lower than those of ref. 29 during the first ‘smoke wave' event (6–8 June), which might be attributed to the coarse model resolution in our analysis (Supplementary Table 3). By using a global chemical transport model, ref. 2 found that the Canadian wildfires significantly impacted air quality in the Northern Hemisphere, which was consistent with our findings. They identified six widespread air pollution episodes due to the Canadian wildfires from May to August, which are also captured in our GESO-Chem simulation (Supplementary Fig. 11) and retrieved PM2.5 concentration (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Canadian wildfire-related chronic PM2.5 exposure is associated with approximately 22, 10 and 3 deaths per 100,000 people in 2023 in Canada, the USA and Europe, respectively. For comparison, chronic mortalities from all-source PM2.5 exposure are 55, 57 and 80 per 100,000 people in 2023 in the three regions, respectively, underscoring the non-negligible contribution of wildfire smoke to public health burdens. Our estimates on Canadian wildfire-related per capita mortality rates in the USA and Canada are notably higher than wildfire-related per capita mortality rates reported in refs. 46,125, owing to high PM2.5 exposure levels attributable to the record-breaking Canadian wildfires in 2023 as well as the all-cause exposure–response function used in our analysis.

We estimated that the 2023 Canadian fires accounted for 3.82 μg m−3 (3.00–4.64 μg m−3) of annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada in 2023, which is lower than 2000–2019 annual mean fire-related PM2.5 exposure in typical wildfire hotspot regions10 such as sub-Saharan Africa (6.99 μg m−3), mainland Southeast Asia (5.77 μg m−3), Indonesia (6.28 μg m−3) and Brazil (5.68 μg m−3). In another study44, annual mean fire-related PM2.5 exposure in typical wildfire hotspot regions were estimated to be 0.72 μg m−3 in Indonesia, 1.26 μg m−3 in Brazil and 1.26 μg m−3 in Southeast Asia in 2017, indicating the large interannual variabilities in wildfire activities. Reference 109 estimated that global landscape fires alone result in 44 million and 4 million people annually being exposed to air quality considered ‘unhealthy' and ‘hazardous', respectively. In comparison, we estimated that the 2023 Canadian wildfires caused 139.3 million and 0.25 million people to be exposed to ‘unhealthy' (PM2.5 > 55 μg m−3) and ‘hazardous' (PM2.5 > 250.5 μg m−3) air quality. Large health impacts from wildfire-related air pollution have been reported in these hotspot regions46,109,110,111,112,114,115,116,118. For instance, wildfires-induced chronic mortality was estimated to be 160,200 in Africa in 2017110, 59,000 in Southeast Asia in 2014118, 13,700–44,000 in equatorial Asia during 2004–2015116, and 16,800 in South America in 2012111. In recent study46, it was estimated that 384,600, 144,300 and 79,300 people died annually in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin American and the Caribbean, respectively, owing to chronic wildfire smoke exposure during 2000–2019. In contrast, we estimated that the 2023 Canadian fires resulted in 8,300 (95% CI, 5,800–10,800) PM2.5-attributable chronic premature deaths in Canada given the low population density close to fire regions. Globally, we estimated 82,100 (95% CI, 47,700–116,500) PM2.5-attributable chronic premature deaths owing to smoke exposure from the 2023 Canadian wildfires, indicating the large health impacts from long-range transported PM2.5 pollution.

Although notable impacts of the 2023 Canadian wildfires on surface PM2.5 concentration in Europe are observed, those impacts are remarkably low compared with the impact of smoke from local fires that are not diluted by long-range transport. For instance, ref. 126 estimated that 2.1 million people were exposed to concentrations above 36 μg m−3 for at least 1 day between 23 and 30 June owing to the Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill fires in northern England. In comparison, our estimates shows that 0.81 million people in Europe were exposed to the same level of PM2.5 pollution for at least 1 day between 26 June and 7 July 2023 owing to the trans-Atlantic pollution of Canadian wildfires.

Dust has been recognized as another important natural source of air pollution44,127. A study127 estimated that Sahara dust contributed 5–20 μg m−3 of surface PM10 concentration in South Europe and 0.5–1.0 μg m−3 in North Europe during 2016–2017. Another study44 estimated that windblown dust increased the annual mean PM2.5 exposure in 2017 by 1.72 μg m−3, 1.50 μg m−3, 1.18 μg m−3, 0.07 μg m−3 and 0.19 μg m−3 in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Canada and the USA, respectively. PM2.5 exposure was lower than dust-related PM2.5 exposure in Europe but higher than that in Canada and the USA. In turn, windblown dust contributed to 34,972, 33 and 1,126 annual chronic premature deaths in Europe, Canada and the USA, respectively44. Our estimates for Canadian-wildfire-related deaths are substantially lower than dust-related deaths in Europe, but much higher than that in Canada and the USA. It should be noted that both dust and fire activities have large interannual variabilities so the comparison could be different for other years.

This Rock May Hold Proof of Life on Mars

The Perseverance rover's new findings set the stage for bringing Martian samples back to Earth to test whether microbes once inhabited the Red Planet

By Humberto Basilio edited by Lee Billings

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover took this selfie, made up of 62 individual images, on July 23, 2024. A rock nicknamed “Cheyava Falls,” which bears tantalizing features suggesting it may contain ancient microbial fossils, is to the left of the rover near the center of the image.

NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS

The most enthralling rock yet found on Mars—a speckled hunk of mudstone that just may contain evidence of ancient alien life—is still worth getting excited about.

Teased last year in a preliminary announcement from NASA, that's the official conclusion of a peer-reviewed paper, published today in Nature, that reports a deeper analysis of the curious outcrop. Were it found on Earth instead of Mars, the rock's speckles would likely be interpreted as evidence for a microbial feeding frenzy that occurred long ago. But getting certainty about what this rock truly contains likely requires hauling it off the Red Planet and delivering it back to Earth—an ambitious multiphase mission that NASA calls Mars Sample Return.

The rock in question is packed with organic carbon—another promising prerequisite for life—and lies within a lithic formation called Bright Angel, which is exposed along a channel called Neretva Vallis. Eons ago, that now dry channel was a river valley, formed by water rushing into and feeding a lake-and-delta system in what's now known as Jezero Crater. Those apparently warm, wet origins led to NASA targeting Jezero as the landing spot for the space agency's Perseverance rover, which has been exploring the site for any past or present signs of life since it touched down in 2021.

“This result gives us reason to consider the possibility that Mars was host to microbial life,” says the new study's co-author Joel Hurowitz, a geoscientist at Stony Brook University. Although this is nowhere close to direct, clinching evidence of Martian life, Hurowitz and his team hope that the findings help scientists “make progress in our quest to understand whether there's life on other planets in the solar system and beyond.”

After NASA's initial teaser, scientists who were eager for more information paid close attention to a presentation by Hurowitz in mid-March of this year at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in the Woodlands, Tex. During his talk, Hurowitz recounted how he and his colleagues on the Perseverance team had found a carbon-rich rock with small patches ranging from black to dark blue to dark green, which they called “poppy seeds,” as well as larger patches with dark-toned rims and lighter-toned centers, which they referred to as “leopard spots.” They called the rock itself “Cheyava Falls.”

Using multiple instruments on Perseverance, an early analysis showed that the poppy seeds and rims of the leopard spots were enriched with iron and phosphorus, while the centers of the leopard spots had abundant iron and sulfur. That distribution of elements hints at both types of patches forming from organic carbon reacting with iron and sulfate minerals—a process that, on Earth, is typically kick-started by certain types of microbes to fuel their metabolism. But it can also occur abiotically via chemical reactions that happen at high temperatures.

In their Nature study, Hurowitz and his co-authors elaborate on the likely mineralogical composition of Cheyava Falls and its speckles, as well as on the conditions in which it probably formed. Perseverance's measurements suggested the speckles contained the minerals vivianite, an iron phosphate, and greigite, an iron sulfide—and that both formed in close association with organic carbon. On Earth, vivianite frequently forms in lakes and coastal sediments where microbes use iron in their metabolism. Greigite tends to form when microbes break down sulfate. When found together on Earth, these minerals and organic molecules are usually considered a sort of biosignature, a physical sign of past or present life—at least if they can be shown to have formed at low temperatures rather than via hotter, less life-friendly conditions.

This image from July 23, 2024 shows the “Cheyava Falls” rock (left) with a dark hole where NASA's Perseverance Mars rover took the “Sapphire Canyon” core sample; the white patch is where the rover abraded the rock to investigate its composition. A rock nicknamed “Steamboat Mountain” (right) also shows an abrasion patch.

NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS

The Nature study correspondingly details further analyses that suggest a low-temperature origin for the speckles—that is, they seem to have arisen in relatively clement conditions near the surface, where life could possibly thrive, rather than the inhospitably hot depths of the Martian subsurface. “We believe that these features happened early in the life of the sediment, shortly after it was deposited and likely before it had been ‘lithified' to form hard rock,” Hurowitz says.

The team stops short of calling the speckles a sign of life, however, preferring the more prudent label of “potential biosignature.” Further evidence for or against a possibly biological origin, they say, is unlikely to arrive unless and until NASA brings a sample of the rock back to Earth for more thorough studies. In July 2024 Perseverance gathered just such a specimen from the rock—a core sample dubbed “Sapphire Canyon”—but NASA's beleaguered, multibillion-dollar plan to bring this and other samples back to Earth is far from a sure thing, given that it was targeted for cancellation in the White House's proposed budget earlier this year.

“These results are super exciting,” says Janice Bishop, a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute, who has tested chemical reactions using analogue Martian rocks and co-authored a commentary that accompanies the new Nature paper. For life to form, she explains, reactions involving organic material are necessary to build amino acids and other simple-but-crucial molecules. These reactions between substances also demonstrate energy sources that could have been used by early microorganisms. “There is no evidence of microbes or other life forms on Mars yet, but our search is just beginning,” Bishop says.

Yet because these Mars rocks are billions of years old, Bishop says, that offers abundant time in which the speckles could conceivably have emerged from abiotic processes: the small pockets of reduced vivianite and sulfides in the ancient mudstones at Jezero Crater could have been formed long ago by run-of-the-mill chemical reactions from organic compounds or other sources rather than by hungry microbes.

More than once, scientists have declared they've found life on Mars based on piecemeal evidence—and each time so far, those claims have been ultimately dismissed as misinterpretations of entirely abiotic phenomena. Time will tell whether this latest case proves to be part of that same trend—or a genuine new discovery.

First theorized in 2012, researchers are beginning to find new ways to implement this mind-bending technology.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A “time crystal” might feel like a plot point in a fantasy novel, but this phase of matter is very real. You might think of normal crystals as “space crystals,” meaning their structural lattice repeats in 3D space. However, time crystals (as the name suggests) is similarly well-organized but across time, moving and transforming in a repeating cycle. 

Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek first proposed the idea of time crystals back in 2012, and since then, scientists and quantum computers alike have constructed various types of time crystals in order to understand their mind-bending properties. Now, researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder (UC Boulder) have achieved a new milestone: They've created a time crystal you can actually see with the naked eye… at least, under certain circumstances.

In a new study published in the journal Nature Materials, co-authors Hanqing Zhao and Ivan  Smalyukh filled glass cells with liquid crystals (a similar material to what's found in a television's LCD panels), which consisted of rod-shaped molecules that behave like a solid and also a little bit like a liquid. These liquid crystals are sandwiched between two plates of glass coated with a photoresponsive dye, and light polarizes the dye, exerting pressure on the crystal and creating a complex series of interactions that repeat over time. 

According to a press statement from UC Boulder, the effect is a bit like a big ballroom dance in a Jane Austen novel, with partners splitting off and dancing around the room before eventually rejoining. But in this case, the Pride & Prejudice dance display usually plays out on the microscopic level.

“Everything is born out of nothing. All you do is shine a light, and this whole world of time crystals emerges,” Smalyukh said in a press statement. “That's the beauty of this time crystal. You just create some conditions that aren't that special. You shine a light, and the whole thing happens.”

The resulting effect was a repeating wave—stripes repeating one after the other—that lasted for hours even when subjected to different temperature and light conditions. 

All of this comes with a big “so what?” question attached. It's great that we've discovered a phase of matter that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry, but what exactly does that mean for future breakthroughs? Well, UC Boulder notes that future technologies could create more elaborate patterns by stacking time crystals, creating a novel method of storing data. More practically, time crystals could be used as an anti-counterfeiting technology. Imagine a $100 bill with a “time watermark,” where light reveals the tell-tale temporal patterns of time crystals—no microscope required.

“We don't want to put a limit on the applications right now,” Smalyukh said in a press statement. “I think there are opportunities to push this technology in all sorts of directions.”

The environmentally-conscious composite flax fiber can very nearly match the strength-to-weight properties of carbon fiber.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Carbon fiber has become ubiquitous in performance automobiles (and many other industries), primarily for its superior strength-to-weight properties. However, the manufacturing process for the magic material is energy-intensive and produces low yield. That's why many engineers hope that more natural materials could be a way forward, and have started to use flax fibers as an alternative to carbon fibers.

By themselves, these fibers have considerably high tensile (pulling) strength. However, to create a rigid object, the fibers need to be woven together into sheets, laminated, and embedded into a resin. Once that's been done, the object is heat-treated for additional strength, and voila! You have your finished flax fiber object.

One Swiss company, Bcomp, is currently leading the charge in developing these natural composite materials. Its product, called ampliTex, can be created using existing methods used to make carbon fiber and fiberglass components—Bcomp claims that manufacturers will even be able to using the same molds.

Flax fibers are naturally occurring and inherently renewable, but those aren't the only advantages of using flax over carbon. Bcomp, a leader in environmentally friendly composite materials, has outlined some others.

Bcomp claims that manufacturing parts using its ampliTex materials produces 80 percent less carbon dioxide than producing the same parts with carbon fiber. They add that using a bio-based resin can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 96 percent.

Carbon fiber production creates a considerable amount of waste, and while it's true that these fibers can be recycled, that process can be energy and labor-intensive. However, Bcomp can easily recycle its production scrap into pellets for use in other applications, or to be fed back into a different step of the production process.

Conveniently, flax plants (and any plants, for that matter) absorb solar energy and CO2 during photosynthesis. While they still release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere after being incinerated, Bcomp claims that the same process happens naturally when plant matter decomposes. Effectively, they're saying their product is following the natural carbon cycle.

BMW recently announced it would be using Bcomp's flax-based materials for many of its exterior parts, interior parts, and pieces that were previously made from carbon fiber. This includes components such as the roof, mirrors, diffusers, and even interior trim pieces. We weren't able to find any performance claims about these new components directly from BMW, but we can confirm that they've already been tested at the racetrack. 

Before its recent announcement, BMW and Bcomp worked together to prove these flax composites in the crucible of motorsport. Racing is much more mechanically demanding than your daily commute, so if your material, part, or piece can survive the race track, there's a good chance it'll fare just fine on the road.

Back in 2020, McLaren's Formula 1 team trialled the idea of a flax fiber seat for its drivers. Unsurprisingly, safety is top priority when it comes to building the drivers' seats, but there are other things to consider. For instance, the team's engineers discovered that Bcomp's natural ampliTex material provided better vibration absorption and impact resistance than conventional carbon fiber.

One of the highest priorities in any form of motorsport is making sure your driver is comfortable in the car. While the new special seat won't isolate all of the vibrations that make it to the driver, marginal gains are everything in Formula 1. It's not rocket science either: getting shaken around zaps your energy, and that can add up over the course of a two hour grand prix.

It's unclear if the team has implemented the technology into its cars, but we do know that McLaren briefly evaluated the seats during pre-season testing in 2020.

You're probably not surprised to hear that many of the components inside your own car are made from plastic—it's been the go-to option for many years, as it's cheap to make. But Polestar, a Swedish automaker, believes there's a better way. It's using flax composites for several interior trim pieces to reduce the use of petroleum-based products in the manufacturing process. Not only is producing these components much kinder to the environment, but Polestar claims that they're lighter and reduce vibrations by up to 250 percent.

If you ask us, they also look much better than the sea of piano-black plastic that you'll find used in most modern automobiles.

Conveniently, flax fiber composites can be utilized for many applications beyond the automotive industry. The new environmentally conscious material is also being optimized for use in mass transportation, sports, marine, lifestyle, and infrastructure. While the performance advantages of flax fiber materials are not to be sniffed at, it might have even bigger implications. There's plenty to be learned, even if we focus on just Municipal Solid Waste—single-use plastics and cardboard are two of the most common and plentiful materials that many of us see every day. 

Looking at the Environmental Protection Agency's graphic above, you'll notice that even though we've implemented recycling, landfill usage has actually increased in recent years. With our continued reliance on landfills, the EPA lists source reduction as the best solution we have. That's fancy speak for eliminating materials that can't be recycled and optimizing their recyclability. Material science a critical tool that can steer us into the future with composites like flax fiber, which minimize environmental impact while optimizing performance. Pretty cool.

Analytical chemists from Stellenbosch University (SU) have provided the first evidence of a rare class of phenolics, called flavoalkaloids, in Cannabis leaves.

Phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, are well-known and sought after in the pharmaceutical industry because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties.

The researchers identified 79 phenolic compounds in three strains of Cannabis grown commercially in South Africa, of which 25 were reported for the first time in Cannabis. Sixteen of these compounds were tentatively identified as flavoalkaloids. Interestingly, the flavoalkaloids were mainly found in the leaves of only one of the strains. The results were published in the Journal of Chromatography A recently.

Dr Magriet Muller, an analytical chemist in the LC-MS laboratory of the Central Analytical Facility (CAF) at Stellenbosch University and first author on the paper, says the analysis of plant phenolics is challenging due to their low concentration and extreme structural diversity.

"Most plants contain highly complex mixtures of phenolic compounds, and while flavonoids occur widely in the plant kingdom, the flavoalkaloids are very rare in nature," she explains.

"We know that Cannabis is extremely complex - it contains more than 750 metabolites - but we did not expect such high variation in phenolic profiles between only three strains, nor to detect so many compounds for the first time in the species. Especially the first evidence of flavoalkaloids in Cannabis was very exciting."

For her postgraduate studies in SU's Department of Chemistry and Polymer Science, she developed powerful analytical methods combining comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry for the detailed characterisation of phenolic compounds.

"We were looking for a new application for the methods that I developed, after successfully testing them on rooibos tea, grapes and wine. I then decided to apply the methods to Cannabis because I knew it was a complex sample, and that Cannabis phenolics have not been well characterised," she explains.

According to Prof. André de Villiers, her study leader and main author on the paper, he was blown away by the chromatographic results that Muller obtained: "The excellent performance of two-dimensional liquid chromatography allowed separation of the flavoalkaloids from the much more abundant flavonoids, which is why we were able to detect these rare compounds for the first time in Cannabis." He leads the analytical chemistry research group in SU's Department of Chemistry and Polymer Science.

Prof. De Villiers says it is obvious there is still much to gain from studying Cannabis, as the bulk of research in this field to date has been focused on the pharmacological properties of the mood-effecting cannabinoids.

"Our analysis again highlights the medicinal potential of Cannabis plant material, currently regarded as waste. Cannabis exhibits a rich and unique non-cannabinoid phenolic profile, which could be relevant from a biomedical research perspective," he concludes.

At the Peak of Hurricane Season, the Atlantic Is Quiet. Here's Why

Hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin is historically at its peak on September 10—but not this year

By Meghan Bartels edited by Andrea Thompson

NOAA/NWS

In May, as Atlantic hurricane season loomed, meteorologists worried that above-average tropical activity, combined with cuts to the federal government's weather agency, could result in disaster. But so far, the season's effects have been mild. And although September 10 has historically marked the peak of Atlantic hurricane activity, the basin has gone nearly two weeks with nary a tropical storm in sight—and none expected during the coming week either.

Still, experts caution that the current lull in tropical activity doesn't mean that this year's threat of hurricanes has passed or that forecasters' predictions about this season were wrong. Here's what you should know about hurricane activity right now and this year in general.

The most recent tropical storm, Fernand, dissipated on August 28, nearly two weeks ago. Earlier this month, meteorologists were closely monitoring a system that they thought had the potential to turn into a serious storm, but it hit a patch of dry air and fell apart—not a particularly unusual scenario for a would-be storm at such an early stage.

And today the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center displays that most optimistic of Atlantic basin forecasts: an empty map labeled “no disturbances”—an indication that meteorologists don't expect any tropical activity of note within the next seven days.

Such a stretch of tropical quiet isn't particularly strange, says Matthew Rosencrans, a meteorologist and lead hurricane season forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Prediction, but it's rarer to see such a lull right over the traditional peak of hurricane season. Rosencrans says that the last September 10 with no tropical storm activity at all was in 2016.

Rosencrans and Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, agree that the lull is primarily linked to a global atmospheric phenomenon called the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which moves high-pressure air masses eastward around the planet every month or two. High-pressure air tends to be drier—hardly conducive to moisture-fueled hurricanes—and to sink, making it harder for a storm system to develop convection, the upward movement of warmth that feeds tropical storms.

The state of the MJO last month was such that low-pressure air, which can foster tropical activity, was positioned over the Atlantic Ocean. And sure enough, Hurricane Erin formed and then exploded into a Category 5 storm, albeit one that predominantly stayed over the ocean. By late August, the cycle had brought high-pressure air over the Atlantic, leading to the current lull.

Meteorologists forecast that within the next 10 to 14 days, the global cycle will bring low-pressure conditions back over the Atlantic Ocean, making the atmosphere more prone to tropical activity again.

And besides atmospheric pressure, many of the key factors for hurricane formation are present. Any tropical storm must begin as a seed storm, and seeds storms are still forming at their usual rate. Further, hurricanes feed off hot ocean water, which has been plentiful this year. “The ocean conditions are absolutely ready for anything,” McNoldy says. Wind shear—in which winds at different heights point in different directions, a phenomenon that can tear apart a brewing storm—has been a little high but not enough to prevent serious tropical activity if other factors align.

That means it's far too early to write off this hurricane season, Rosencrans and McNoldy agree.

In May meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their outlook for this season: a total of 13 to 19 tropical storms and hurricanes combined, including between six and 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. So far a total of six tropical storms have formed. Of those six, only Erin became a hurricane, although it did reach a peak intensity of Category 5.

That means the season overall—which officially runs from June 1 to November 30—is unfolding to be about as strong as predicted—and has plenty potential risk remaining.

Even just last year offers a cautionary tale, Rosencrans says: after a similar lull in late August and early September, tropical activity spiked to the highest on record for late September and onward, including the deadly hurricanes Helene and Milton.

“It's still hurricane season,” McNoldy says. “We have half the season left, so I have no doubt at all we'll be watching storms sooner than we want to be.”

The size of microbial sequence databases continues to grow beyond the abilities of existing alignment tools. We introduce LexicMap, a nucleotide sequence alignment tool for efficiently querying moderate-length sequences (>250 bp) such as a gene, plasmid or long read against up to millions of prokaryotic genomes. We construct a small set of probe k-mers, which are selected to efficiently sample the entire database to be indexed such that every 250-bp window of each database genome contains multiple seed k-mers, each with a shared prefix with one of the probes. Storing these seeds in a hierarchical index enables fast and low-memory alignment. We benchmark both accuracy and potential to scale to databases of millions of bacterial genomes, showing that LexicMap achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods but with greater speed and lower memory use. Our method supports querying at scale and within minutes, which will be useful for many biological applications across epidemiology, ecology and evolution.

Alignment of sequences to a single reference genome is a well-studied problem1,2,3,4. For specified gap and mismatch costs, dynamic programming is guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution5,6,7 but processing time scales as a product of the reference genome size and the query size. This is too slow in practice; thus, the challenge is to find faster shortcuts that ideally are still guaranteed to give the optimal solution. Rapid progress has recently been made on this front8,9,10,11,12.

The problem we set out to address is that of aligning to a database of genomes from across the bacterial phylogeny, as popularized by the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST)1. As the amount of publicly available bacterial sequencing data has grown over recent years, the proportion of bacterial genomes that web BLAST is able to search has dropped exponentially13. The primary use cases of alignment to either all bacterial genomes or a representative set are determining where a specific sequence has been seen before, finding the host range of a mobile element or gene or locating probable orthologs for further analysis. More broadly, the power to perform this alignment against all prior prokaryotic sequences would enable a wide range of specific analyses, just as BLAST has achieved with smaller datasets. Some concrete examples were seen in how approximate (k-mer-based) matching to the 661k dataset14 was used to search for plasmids15,16,17,18, adhesins19, diversity of vaccine targets20, mutations of interest21 and phages15.

This use case differs from mapping to one reference in two regards. Firstly, the scale of the intended database is larger in terms of number and diversity. For example, the GTDB r214 representative set22, one genome for each of ~85,000 bacterial species, contains 242 billion unique 31-mers—about 65,000 times more than in one genome. The diversity of gene content of bacteria is very large because many have ‘open' pangenomes23,24; hence, so every new genome adds novel sequence content. Other natural databases to query are larger but heavily oversample pathogen species; in combination, GenBank25 and RefSeq26 contain 2.3 million genomes and AllTheBacteria27 contains 1.8 million high-quality genomes. Thus, there is a computational challenge to index these large databases. Secondly, if mapping to one reference, one tries to find the single most likely source of a query but rarely reports all alignments; by contrast, in the BLAST search use case, a sequence could truly come from multiple genomes and all alignments would potentially be wanted by the user.

There are a number of high-performance tools that are good options for large-scale alignment. MMseqs2 (ref. 28) supports sensitive and scalable search of nucleotide sequences by searching translated nucleotide databases using a translated nucleotide query. Minimap2 (ref. 4), a long-read alignment tool mainly designed for a single, large reference genome, can also be used for alignment against the large scale of microbial genomes, as it can partition input sequences and sequentially index and search each partition. Two tools have demonstrated the ability to scale to huge databases, albeit each with a caveat. First, Phylign13 compresses genomes by leveraging phylogenetic information and then, given a query, uses a k-mer-based method COBS29 to prefilter genomes before performing base-level alignment with Minimap2. However, prefiltering on the basis of matching 31-mers is only effective for highly similar sequences. As the divergence of the query increases beyond 10%, it becomes very likely to fail the prefilter30. It is essential for most useful searches to avoid this limitation. Second, it was shown that, by restricting to the 179/11,264 species in AllTheBacteria27 that have >200 genomes (which is 94% of the data), a new BWT implementation, Ropebwt3 (ref. 31), can leverage the within-species redundancy and compress the data from ~2.8 TB (gzip-compressed) to just 27.6 GB. However, it is also important to be able to align to all the species in the dataset.

We need to be able to find anchoring matches shared between a query and a genome, with which we can do straightforward alignment. We create a relatively small set of probes (20,000 k-mers, much smaller than the 59 billion k-mers in AllTheBacteria or 292 billion k-mers in the GTDB complete dataset) that ‘cover' the genomes in the database such that every 250-bp window contains several (median 5) k-mers, each with a 7-bp prefix match with one of our probes. Combining this core idea with a range of computational innovations, we develop a standalone alignment tool, LexicMap, which is able to align a gene to millions of genomes in minutes.

In LexicMap, we first reimplement the sequence sketching method LexicHash32, which supports variable-length substring matches (prefix matching) rather than fixed-length k-mers, and use this to compute alignment seeds. We outline the approach here and give full details in Methods. First, 20,000 31-mers (called ‘probes') are generated (Fig. 1a), which can ‘capture' any DNA sequence by prefix matching, as the probes contain all possible 7-bp prefixes. Then, for every reference genome, each probe captures one k-mer across the genome as a seed; this is conducted using the LexicHash, which chooses the k-mer that shares the longest prefix with the probe (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). The number 20,000 above was chosen as a tradeoff among index size, alignment accuracy and performance, as detailed below (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).

a, A fixed set of 20,000 31-mers (called probes) are generated, ensuring that their prefixes include every possible 7-mer. Seeds, each prefix matching one of these, will be found distributed across all database genomes and chosen in such a way as to have a window guarantee. b, LexicHash creates one hash function per probe and, when applied to a genome, it finds the k-mer with the longest prefix match, which is then stored as a seed. c, Each genome is scanned to find seed deserts (regions longer than 100 bp with no seed); every k-mer within this region has a 7-mer prefix match with at least one probe (because the probes cover all possible 7-mers); hence, seeds can be chosen with spacing of x bp (50 by default). d, Seeds are stored in a hierarchical index. In fact, although not shown here for simplicity, the number of seeds is doubled to support both prefix and suffix matching (details in Methods).

However, because the captured k-mers (seeds) are randomly distributed across a genome, the distances between seeds vary and there is initially no distance guarantee for successive seeds (Supplementary Fig. 3a). As a result, some genome regions might not be covered with any seed, creating ‘seed deserts' or ‘sketching deserts' (ref. 33), where sequences homologous to these regions could fail to align. Generally, seed desert sizes and numbers increase with larger genome sizes (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To address this issue, a second round of seed capture was performed for each seed desert region longer than 100 bp. New seeds spaced about 50 bp apart are added to the seed list of the corresponding probe (Fig. 1c,d). After filling these seed deserts, a seed distance of 100 bp is guaranteed (Supplementary Fig. 3b) for non-low-complexity regions, ensuring that all 250-bp sliding windows contain a minimum of two seeds, with a median of five in practice (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Additionally, the seed number of a genome may in practice be lower or higher than the number of probes; the seed number is generally linearly correlated with genome size (Supplementary Fig. 4). Lastly, by allowing variable-length prefix matches, we greatly increase sensitivity compared with a k-mer exact-matching approach but the method remains vulnerable to variation within the prefix region; therefore, we extended LexicMap to additionally support suffix matching (Methods).

To scale to millions of prokaryotic genomes, input genomes are indexed in batches to limit memory consumption, with all batches merged at the end (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Within each batch, multiple sequences (contigs or scaffolds) of a genome are concatenated with 1-kb intervals of Ns to reduce the sequence scale for indexing. Original coordinates and sequence identifiers are restored after sequence alignment. The complete genome or the concatenated contigs are then used to compute seeds using the generated probes as described above, with intervals and gap regions skipped. Genome sequences are saved in a bit-packed format along with genome information for fast random subsequence extraction. After indexing all reference genomes, each probe captures up to millions of k-mers, including position information (genome ID, coordinate and strand). A scalable hierarchical index compresses and stores seed data for all probes (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5a) and supports fast, low-memory variable-length seed matching, including both prefix and suffix matching (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5b).

In the searching step, probes from the LexicMap index are used to capture k-mers from the query sequence (Fig. 2a). Each captured k-mer is then searched in the seed data of the corresponding probe to identify seeds that share prefixes or suffixes of at least 15 bp (chosen as a tradeoff between alignment accuracy and efficiency; Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6), using a fast and low-memory approach (Methods, Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5b). The common prefix or suffix of the query and target seed, along with the position information, constitutes an anchor. These anchors are grouped by genome ID before chaining. The minimum anchor length of 15 bp ensures search sensitivity, while longer anchors (up to 31 bp) provide higher specificity. Unlike minimizer-based methods such as Minimap2, which use fixed-length anchors with a small window guarantee between anchors, LexicMap uses variable-length anchors and does not guarantee a fixed window size between anchors. Consequently, the chaining function (function 1 in Methods) assigns more weight to longer anchors and does not consider anchor distance (Methods). Next, a pseudoalignment is performed to identify similar regions from the extended chained regions (Fig. 2d). Finally, the wavefront alignment algorithm is used for base-level alignment (Fig. 2e). LexicMap's default output is a tab-delimited table providing alignment details (Supplementary Table 4) for filtration or further analysis and also supports an intuitive BLAST-style pairwise alignment format (Supplementary Fig. 7).

a, The same LexicHash hash functions (one per probe) used in the indexing step are used here, applied to the query to capture one prefix-matching k-mer per probe. b, For each probe, the seed data are scanned to find prefix or suffix matches ≥ 15 bp. The common prefix or suffix constitutes an anchor. c, The variable-length anchors are chained using a modified version of the Minimap2 algorithm. d,e, Fast pseudoalignment (d) is followed by base-level alignment (e) using the wavefront alignment algorithm. Note that, in b, only prefix matching is illustrated, whereas suffix matching is not shown for simplicity.

LexicMap supports variable-length seed matches through prefix and suffix matching, allowing greater tolerance to mutations compared with fixed-length seeding methods. To evaluate LexicMap's robustness to sequence divergence, ten bacterial genomes from common species with sizes ranging from 2.1 to 6.3 Mb (Supplementary Table 5) were used to simulate queries of varying lengths and similarities by introducing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels with Badread34 (Methods). BLASTn (with word sizes of both the default 28 and 15), MMseqs2, Minimap2 and Ropebwt3 were compared with LexicMap. Additionally, COBS was compared with a high-sensitivity setting (minimum fraction of aligned k-mers: 0.33), as it is used in the prefilter step of Phylign.

Generally, as query identity increased, alignment rates of all tools improved, reaching nearly 100% for query identities ≥ 95% when query length was ≥500 bp (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6). For queries of 1,000 bp and 2,000 bp, BLASTn with a word size of 15 bp consistently achieved the highest alignment rates at lower query identities, followed by MMseqs2, Ropebwt3, Minimap2, LexicMap and BLASTn with the default word size of 28 bp. COBS showed a steeper dropoff in alignment rates at query identities below 95%, which is expected given that it relies on comparing fractions of matched k-mers (k = 31). For 250-bp and 500-bp queries, LexicMap outperformed default BLASTn at query identities below 93% and 92% and surpassed Minimap2 at query identities below 88 and 83%, respectively. The performance for mutation-free queries is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.

This is measured by simulating 250-bp, 500-bp, 1,000-bp and 2,000-bp reads with coverage of 30× from ten bacterial genomes, adding mutations to achieve sequence divergence between 0% and 20% and then aligning back to the source genome. COBS is a k-mer index; thus, we show what proportion of the reads were detected as being present in the source genome (rather than being aligned). This falls off very rapidly as similarity drops because each base disagreement loses an entire 31-mer. For the other tools, we measure the proportion of reads that are correctly aligned back to the source genome. BLASTn (ws = 15) represents BLASTn with a word size of 15. BLASTn (with no brackets) refers to the default setting of BLASTn, with word size of 28. All data are available in Supplementary Table 6.

To evaluate the scalability of the above sequence alignment and search tools to increasing prokaryotic genomes, we created seven genome sets at varying scales (ranging from 1 to 1 million genomes) by randomly selecting nonoverlapping prokaryotic genomes from GenBank and RefSeq databases. Next, we built an index per set with each tool and then performed searches using a query set containing a rare gene (secY from Enterococcus faecalis) and a 16S rRNA gene (rrsB from Escherichia coli) (Methods).

For index building, generally, the index sizes of all tools were linearly correlated with the number of genomes (Fig. 4a). In terms of memory requirements to index 1 million genomes, Ropebwt3 required the most memory (1,013 GB), followed by COBS (382 GB), Minimap2 (85 GB), LexicMap (75 GB), MMseqs2 (20 GB) and BLASTn (2 GB). The indexing time of all tools varied (Supplementary Table 7), ranging from 2.6 h (MMseqs2) to 23.3 days (Ropebwt3). For databases larger than 10,000 genomes, LexicMap outperformed all other alignment tools in terms of alignment time and memory usage (Fig. 4b; note the log scale on y axis). For databases of 1 million genomes, LexicMap was three times faster than the second fastest alignment tool (Ropebwt3) while using only 1/115 of the memory (6.2 GB versus 717 GB); it was 89 times faster than MMseqs2 and 39 times faster than Minimap2.

Benchmarking BLASTn, COBS, LexicMap, MMseqs2, Minimap2 and Ropebwt3 for both index construction and subsequent querying, using datasets ranging from 1 to 1 million genomes. a, Index size and memory requirements for index construction. b, Search (alignment for BLASTn, LexicMap, MMseqs2, Minimap2 and Ropebwt3 and search for COBS) time and memory use. The query set consists of a rare gene (secY) and a 16S rRNA gene (rrsB) sequence. All tools return all possible matches. Performance data are in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8.

We further evaluated the performance and accuracy of LexicMap in the three largest and most diverse datasets (Methods): the GTDB r214 complete dataset with 402,538 prokaryotic assemblies, the AllTheBacteria version 0.2 high-quality dataset with 1,858,610 bacterial assemblies and GenBank + RefSeq with 2,340,672 prokaryotic assemblies (downloaded on February 15, 2024). We benchmarked against BLASTn, Minimap2, MMseqs2 and Phylign. Ropebwt3 was excluded from this benchmark because it did not scale to this dataset (as outlined above) or return all alignments.

In terms of index sizes for AllTheBacteria, Phylign had the smallest size (Table 1), followed by BLASTn. LexicMap, MMseqs2 and Minimap2 had index sizes approximately 2.5, 4 and 8 times larger than BLASTn, respectively. For indexing time, MMseqs2 was the fastest, followed by BLASTn, Minimap2 and LexicMap. For indexing memory, BLASTn used the least memory, followed by MMseqs2, Minimap2 and LexicMap. LexicMap used almost twice as much memory for the GenBank + RefSeq dataset compared with the AllTheBacteria dataset, as the genomes in the former are more diverse.

Four different types of queries were used to evaluate alignment performance (Methods): (1) a comparatively rare gene (BLASTn returns 7,000 genome hits in the GTDB r214 complete dataset with 402,538 genomes)—secY from E. faecalis; (2) a 16S rRNA gene rrsB from E. coli; (3) a 53-kb plasmid; and (4) 1,033 different AMR genes (batch queries).

First, we aligned the queries with LexicMap, BLASTn, MMseqs2 and Minimap2 against the GTDB complete index. For clearer comparison, we divided all alignment results into three groups (high, medium and low similarity; Table 2). High-similarity alignments were long with high identity, low-similarity alignments were either short or highly diverged and medium-similarity alignments constituted the remainder (precise definitions in Methods).

In short, all tools found very similar numbers of high-similarity alignments but LexicMap reported fewer low-similarity alignments; that is, it had lower sensitivity to highly diverged (identity<80%) or short fragmentary alignments. For the rare gene, all tools returned almost identical numbers of high-similarity alignments but MMseqs2 and BLASTn reported about ten times more low-similarity alignments than other tools. For the 16S rRNA gene, where we expected to find many alignments, LexicMap, BLASTn (both settings) and MMseqs2 reported ~61,000 high-similarity alignments, whereas Minimap2 only reported ~16,000. Counting all (high-similarity, medium-similarity and low-similarity) alignments, all tools except Minimap2 found around 300,000 alignments (MMseqs2 found the most at 324,000), whereas Minimap2 reported ~18,000. In contrast, the 53-kb plasmid, which is likely to present a different type of challenge, with many small fragmentary hits and some long hits with large deletions, revealed other differences between the tools. LexicMap and BLASTn (both settings) found 21 high-similarity matches and Minimap2 finds 35 but MMseqs2 founds only 7. However, BLASTn (ws = 15) and MMseqs2 found many more low-similarity alignments than other tools. Lastly, for the AMR genes, LexicMap, BLASTn (both settings) and MMseqs2 found around 1.1 million alignments, whereas Minimap2 found 943,000. However, BLASTn (ws = 15) and MMseqs2 again reported four times more low-similarity alignments.

In terms of speed, LexicMap was much faster than other tools for single queries, being 72, 9 and 4 times faster than the second fastest tool BLASTn, on the rare gene, 16S rRNA gene and plasmid respectively. Compared with MMseqs2, LexicMap was 872, 103 and 83 times faster for the same queries. For batch queries, LexicMap was 1.8 times slower than BLASTn. Regarding memory usage, LexicMap required less than 7 GB for single queries and 11 GB for the 1,033 AMR genes, whereas Minimap2 used 20.2 GB and BLASTn and MMseqs2 used more than 300 GB across all queries.

Next, we compared LexicMap to Phylign on the AllTheBacteria dataset, which contains 1,858,610 bacterial genomes, including some species that are highly oversampled. Here, BLASTn could not be run because of its requirement of more than 2,000 GB of memory. MMseqs2 was not included for its slow speed and Minimap2 was not included for its slow speed and lower sensitivity for medium-similarity and low-similarity matches. Across all queries, if including all (high-similarity, medium-similarity and low-similarity) hits, LexicMap returned more genome hits than Phylign; however, for high-similarity matches, the number of alignments was very similar (Extended Data Table 1). These observations are as expected given the effect of Phylign using a k-mer filter on diverged hits (Fig. 3). In terms of computation efficiency, for single queries, LexicMap took much less time than Phylign in both local and cluster mode (using up to 100 nodes) while also using much less memory. However, for batch querying, LexicMap was much slower than Phylign in local and cluster modes; however, in both cases, LexicMap returned more alignments.

Lastly, we tested LexicMap on the GenBank + Refseq dataset (234 million prokaryotic genomes), where it achieved similar performance to that on the AllTheBacteria dataset (Extended Data Table 2).

BLAST was not the first tool to enable DNA alignment against a database but its speed and accessibility revolutionized bioinformatics. However, since then, the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST has been querying an exponentially smaller fraction of public data13. The vast majority of the cellular tree of life consists of bacteria and archaea and we continue to expand the tree through metagenomic sequencing. Although the rate of discovery of new phyla has dropped, this is not the case for lower taxa24. Taken together with the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes and a high number of mobile genetic elements and their cargo, the levels of diversity are extremely high and continue to grow. Furthermore, the amount of clinical sequencing and deposition in archives continues to grow our collection of pathogen sequence data, providing a year-by-year perspective on real-time evolution and horizontal gene transfer. Thus, now more than ever, the ability to align a query against a database of representative genomes or all genomes is vital to modern biology and public health. Developers of new antibiotics who find specific mutations that confer resistance should be able to find out whether those SNPs have been seen before, representing preexisting resistance35. Genomic epidemiologists should be able to query a drug-resistant plasmid from a hospital outbreak against recently sequenced genomes from across the world15 or track down any global samples containing outbreak informative SNPs36. Just as BLAST enabled hundreds of different studies that could not have been predicted at the time, re-enabling alignment against all bacteria will surely potentiate a wide range of new applications.

We introduced our solution to this problem here. LexicMap constructs a fixed set of 20,000 probes (k-mers) that are guaranteed to have multiple (around five in this study) prefix matches in every 250-bp window of every genome in the database. The k-mer with the best prefix match for each probe in each genome (called a seed) is stored in a hierarchical index, which can be used for alignment. This use of variable-length prefix and suffix matching enables sensitive nucleotide alignment for queries above 250 bp long (although this is a user-tunable threshold). Our results showed (Fig. 4) that LexicMap achieves a superior scalability to the other benchmarked alignment tools, with the fastest speed and the lowest memory usage, while maintaining a moderate index size and indexing efficiency. While achieving this scalability, LexicMap maintains a comparable sensitivity (meaning robustness to divergence of the query from the target) to state-of-the-art aligners.

LexicMap provides direct alignment without a lossy prefilter step. Additionally, all possible matches, including multiple copies of genes in a genome, are returned. The alignment is fast and memory efficient; moreover, unlike minimizer-based methods, seeds in LexicMap are interpretable and several utility commands are available to interpret probe (probe k-mers) and seed (seed sequences and positions) data. LexicMap is easy to install on multiple operating systems and can be used as a standalone tool without needing a workflow manager or compute cluster. LexicMap mainly supports small genomes including complete or partially assembled prokaryotic, viral and fungal genomes. The maximum supported sequence length is 268,435,456 bp (228); thus, it can in principle also be applied to bigger genomes such as human genomes with a maximum chromosome size of 248 Mb.

In terms of limitations, LexicMap only supports queries longer than 250 bp. It achieves a low memory footprint by storing a very large index on disk (5.46 TB for 2.34 million prokaryotic assemblies in GenBank + RefSeq), although we do note that the corresponding index for MMseqs2 or Minimap2 would be larger. Nevertheless, it would be desirable in future to reduce the size of this index. Lastly, LexicMap is optimized for a small number of queries; improving batch searching speed is planned in the future.

LexicMap marks a step change in scalability, achieving low-memory queries of the global corpus of bacterial data in minutes. Coupled with its ease of installation and use, without the need for workflow managers or a cluster, it has the potential to enable a wide range of analyses from ecology, evolution and epidemiology.

Probes, also referred to as ‘masks' in the LexicHash paper, consist of a fixed number (m = 20,000 by default) of k-mers (k ≤ 32, k = 31 by default), which capture DNA sequences by prefix matching. A probe consists of two parts—the p-bp prefix and the remaining bases. To enable probes to match all possible reference and query sequences by prefix matching, all permutations of p-mers are generated as the base prefix set. The length of the prefix (p) is calculated to ensure that the total number of possible prefixes (4p) does not exceed the total number of probes (m). For instance, when m = 20,000, p = 7. Then, the base prefixes are duplicated to reach the number of probes m. Next, the suffixes of probes are randomly generated. The p′-bp (p′ = p + 1) prefixes are required to be distinct to enable fast locating of the probe by the prefix of a k-mer through an array data structure. Lastly, these m k-mers serve as probes that can match all potential sequence regions in both reference genomes and query sequences.

The k-mers are encoded as 64-bit unsigned integers, with a binary coding scheme of A = 00, C = 01, G = 10 and T = 11. Following the original implementation of LexicHash, the hash value between a probe and a k-mer is computed using a bitwise XOR operation. The value of this hash is that smaller hash values indicate longer common prefixes between the probe and the k-mer, whereas a hash value of zero means the probe and the k-mer are identical.

For each reference genome or query sequence, all k-mers from both forward and backward strands are compared with probes that share the same p-bp prefix. Each probe retains only the k-mer with the minimum hash value, which might in principle be located at more than one position. The k-mers of low-complexity are discarded by DUST algorithm37 with a loose score threshold of 50. A 64-bit integer encodes each position's information, including the genome batch index (17 bits, as described below), genome index (17 bits), position (28 bits), strand (1 bit) and seed direction flag (1 bit, as described below). Ultimately, each probe captures one k-mer (as a seed) across the entire reference genome or query sequence, which shares the longest prefix with the probe.

However, because of the random distribution of captured k-mers (seeds), the distances between these seeds vary and there is no guarantee of consistent distance between successive seeds. Consequently, some regions of the sequence might remain uncovered by seeds, leading to what are known as ‘seed deserts'. These deserts are problematic because they can cause sequences homologous to the regions to fail to align. To address this issue, regions identified as seed deserts, which are longer than a certain threshold (100 bp by default), are extended by 1 kb both upstream and downstream. A second round of seed capture is then performed in these extended regions and new seeds are spaced about x bp (50 by default) apart within the region are added to the index of the corresponding probes. After filling these seed deserts, the total number of seeds may exceed the initial value of m.

The input of LexicMap is a list of microbial genomes, with the sequences of each genome stored in separate FASTA files. These files can be in plain or compressed formats such as gzip, xz, zstd or bzip2. Each file must have a distinct genome identifier in the file name. To limit memory consumption, genomes are indexed in batches and all batches are merged at the end (Supplementary Fig. 5a).

In each batch, genomes with any sequence larger than a genome size threshold (15 Mb by default), such as nonisolate assemblies, are skipped. On the other hand, if only the total length of sequences exceeds the threshold, the genomes are split into multiple chunks and alignments from these chunks will be merged in the searching step. Additionally, unwanted sequences within genomes, such as plasmids, can be optionally discarded using regular expressions to match sequence names. Multiple sequences (contigs or scaffolds) of a genome are concatenated with 1-kb intervals of Ns to reduce the scale of sequences to be indexed. The original coordinates will be restored after sequence alignment. The complete genome or the concatenated contigs are then used to compute seeds with generated probes, as described above. Before this, any degenerated bases are converted to their corresponding alphabet-first bases (for example, N is converted to A). The genome sequence is then saved in a bit-packed format (2 bits per base), along with associated genome information (genome ID, size and sequence IDs and lengths of all contigs) to enable fast random subsequence extraction. Simultaneously, seeds and their positional information are appended to their corresponding probes and saved as seed files. After processing all genomes in the batch, these seed files are merged using an external sorting method once all batches have been indexed.

After indexing with all n reference genomes, each probe captures n or more seeds (k-mers, encoded as 64-bit integers), with each seed potentially having one or more positions (also represented as 64-bit integers), and there are m probes in total (20,000 by default). To scale to millions of prokaryotic genomes, the storage of seed data needs to be both compact and efficient for querying. Because the seeds of different probes are independent, the seed data are saved into c chunk files to enable parallel querying (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In each chunk file, the seed data of approximately m/c probes are simply concatenated. For each probe, all seeds are sorted in alphabetical order and the varint-GB38 algorithm is used to compress every two seeds along with their associated position counts. Because seeds captured by the same probe share common prefixes, the differences between two successive seeds are small, as are the position counts. As a result, two values can be stored using as little as 3 bytes instead of 16.

Unlike the approach in the LexicHash paper, where captured k-mers from each probe are stored in a prefix tree in main memory, here, they are alphabetically sorted and saved in a list-like structure within files. To enable efficient variable-length prefix matching of seeds, an index is created for each seed data file (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). This index functions similarly to a table of contents in a dictionary, storing a list of marker k-mers along with their offsets (pages) in the seed data file. Each marker k-mer is the first one with a specific p″-bp subsequence (p″ = 6 by default) following the p-bp prefix (all seeds of a probe share the same p-bp prefix). For a query sequence, one k-mer is captured by each probe and searched within the corresponding probe's seed data to return seeds that share a minimum length of prefix with the query k-mer. For example, searching with CATGCT for seeds (with p = 2, p″ = 1) that have at least 4 bp of common prefixes is equivalent to finding seeds in the range of CATGAA to CATGTT. The process starts by extracting the p″-bp subsequence from CATGAA (in this case, T) to locate the marker k-mer (for example, CATCAC) with the same p″-bp subsequence in the same region. The offset information (page) of this marker k-mer is then used as the starting point for scanning seeds within the k-mer range.

The index structure described above is extended to support the suffix matching of seeds. During the indexing phase, after a seed k-mer is saved into the seed data of its corresponding probe, the k-mer is reversed and added to the seed data of the probe that shares the longest prefix with the reversed k-mer. Additionally, the last bit of each position data is used as a seed direction flag, indicating that the seed k-mer is reversed. As a result, all seeds are doubled; there are ‘forward seeds' for prefix matching and ‘reversed seeds' for suffix matching, which is achieved through prefix matching of the reversed seeds. In the seed matching process, two rounds of matching are performed. The first round involves prefix matching (as described above) in the forward seed data. In the second round, the query k-mer is reversed and searched in the reversed seed data of the probe that shares the longest prefix with the reversed k-mer.

After searching all captured k-mers from a query in the seed data of all probes, seed pairs (anchors) with different matched prefix and suffix lengths l are returned. These anchors indicate matched regions between the query sequences [y, y + l − 1] on the strand \({s}_{y}\) and reference genome [x, x + l − 1] on strand \({s}_{x}\). First, the anchors are grouped by the genome IDs. Within each group, the anchors are sorted by the following criteria: (1) ascending order of start positions in the query sequence; (2) descending order of end positions in the query sequence; and (3) ascending order of start positions in the target genome. Only one anchor is kept for duplicated anchors and any inner anchors that are nested within other anchors are removed. Then, overlapped anchors with no gaps are merged to a longer one, whereas, for these with gaps, only the nonoverlapped part of the second anchor is used to compute the weight, as described below. Next, a chaining function modified from Minimap2 is applied to chain all possible colinear anchors:

Here, \(f\left(i\right)\) and \(f\left(j\right)\) are scores for anchors \({a}_{i}\) and \({a}_{j}\), respectively. The anchor weight \({w}_{i}=0.1\times {l}_{i}^{2}\), where \({l}_{i}\) is the length of the anchor \({a}_{i}\) and \(P\le {l}_{i}\le k\), with P being the minimum anchor length (15 by default). The seed distance \({d}_{{ji}}=\max \left\{\left|{y}_{i}-{y}_{j}\right|,\,\left|{x}_{i}-{x}_{j}\right|\right\}\) and D is the maximum seed distance (1,000 by default). The seed gap \({g}_{{ji}}=\left|\left|{\;y}_{i}-{y}_{j}\right|-\left|{x}_{i}-{x}_{j}\right|\right|\) and G is the maximum gap (50 by default). The gap penalty is calculated as \(\gamma \left(g\right)=0.1\times g+0.5\,{\log }_{2}(g)\). Additionally, a filter is applied to avoid a nonmonotonic increase or decrease in coordinates. For cases where there is only one anchor, the length of the anchor must be no less than a threshold P′ (17 by default).

In contrast to the case of minimizers or closed syncmers39, seeds in LexicMap do not have a small window guarantee. Hence, a pseudoalignment algorithm is further used to find similar regions from the chained region, extended by 1 kb in the upstream and downstream directions. The k-mers (k = 31) on both strands of the query sequence are stored in a prefix tree and k-mers of a target region are queried in the prefix tree to return matches of \({{l}_{i}}^{{\prime} }\,\) (\({11\le {l}_{i}}^{{\prime} }\le 31\)) in the extended chained region. After removing duplicated anchors as above, the anchors are chained with the score function:

where \(G{\prime}\) is the maximum gap (20 by default) and seed distance \({g{\prime} }_{{ji}}=\left|\left|{y}_{i}-{y}_{j}\right|-\left|{x}_{i}-{x}_{j}\right|\right|\). The chaining is banded (100 bp or 50 anchors by default). Furthermore, chained regions across the interval regions between contigs are split. Next, regions are further extended in both ends, using a similar pseudoalignment algorithm based on 2-mer matches.

Similar regions between the reference and query sequences are further aligned with a reimplemented wavefront alignment algorithm (https://github.com/shenwei356/wfa; version 0.4.0), with a gap-affine penalty (match: 0, mismatch: 4, gap opening: 6 and gap extension: 2) and the adaptive reduction heuristic (minimum wavefront length: 10 and maximum distance: 50). Each alignment's bit score and expect value (e value) are computed with Karlin–Altschul parameter40 values for substitution scores of 2 and −3 (gap opening cost: 5, gap extension cost: 2, lambda: 0.625 and K: 0.41) from BLASTn's source code.

LexicMap version 0.7.0, BLAST++ version 2.15.0, MMseqs2 version 16.747c6, Minimap2 version 2.28-r1209, Ropebwt3 version 3.9-r259, COBS (iqbal-lab-org fork version 0.3.0; https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/cobs) and Phylign (AllTheBacteria fork https://github.com/AllTheBacteria/Phylign; commit 9fc65e6) were used for testing. The GTDB r214 complete dataset with 402,538 prokaryotic assemblies was downloaded with genome_updater (https://github.com/pirovc/genome_updater; version 0.6.3). The GenBank + RefSeq dataset with 2,340,672 prokaryotic assemblies was downloaded with genome_updater on February 15, 2024. The AllTheBacteria version 0.2 high-quality genome dataset with 1,858,610 bacteria genomes and the Phylign index were downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/AllTheBacteria/AllTheBacteria; archived at https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/AllTheBacteria/Releases/0.2/indexes/phylign/). Four query datasets were used for evaluating alignment accuracy and performance: a preprotein translocase subunit secY gene CDS sequence from an E. faecalis strain (NZ_CP064374.1_cds_WP_002359350.1_906), a 16S rRNA gene rrsB from E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (NC_000913.3: 4166659–4168200), a plasmid from a Serratia nevei strain (CP115019.1) and 1,033 AMR genes from the Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database (PRJNA313047). All files were stored on a network-attached storage server equipped with HDD disks.

Ten bacterial genomes of common species (more details in Supplementary Table 5) with genome sizes ranging from 2.1 to 6.3 Mb were used for simulating queries with Badread version 0.4.1 and SeqKit41 version 2.8.2. The command ‘badread simulate --seed 1 --reference $ref --quantity 30x --length $qlen,0 --identity $ident,$ident,0 --error_model random --qscore_model ideal --glitches 0,0,0 --junk_reads 0 --random_reads 0 --chimeras 0 --start_adapter_seq ‘' --end_adapter_seq ‘' | seqkit seq -g -m $qlen | seqkit grep -i -s -v -p NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN -o $ref.i$ident.q$qlen.fastq.gz' simulated reads with a genome coverage of 30×, a mean length of 250, 500, 1,000 or 2,000 bp and mean percentage identities ranging from 80% to 100% with SNPs and indels. LexicMap, BLASTn, MMseqs2, Minimap2, Ropebwt3 and COBS were used to search simulated reads against the reference genomes. Each tool built an index for each genome and searched or aligned reads with the corresponding index. LexicMap built indices and aligned with default parameters (m = 20,000, k = 31, P = 15, P′ = 17). BLASTn built indices with default parameters and aligned reads with the default task mode ‘megablast' using a word size of 28 (default) or 15 and the out format 6 was set to output tabular results. MMseqs2 built indices and aligned reads with the nucleotide mode and the format mode 4 was set to output tabular results. Minimap2 aligned reads with the ‘map-ont' mode. Ropebwt3 built indices (including .fmd, .ssa and .fmd.len.gz files) with default parameters and aligned with the local alignment mode (‘ropebwt3 sw'). COBS built compact indices with k = 31 and a false-positive rate of 0.3 and searched reads with a k-mer coverage threshold of 0.33. For all reads, the source location was tracked. Alignment rate was determined by counting the proportion of reads that had an alignment position overlapping the source location (except for COBS, where it was defined as the proportion of reads detected as being present in the genome). Unless otherwise specified, all tests were performed in cluster nodes running with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6336Y CPU @ 2.40 GHz with RAM of 500 or 2,000 GB.

Seven genome sets with 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000 nonoverlapping prokaryotic genomes randomly chosen from the GenBank + RefSeq dataset were used for the scalability test. The queries consisted of the secY and a 16S rRNA rrsB gene sequences mentioned above. LexicMap, BLASTn, MMseqs2, Minimap2, Ropebwt3 and COBS built an index for each genome set and searched or aligned the queries against the corresponding index, using the options in the previous tests. LexicMap returned all possible matches by default, while other tools were explicitly set to return all matches. All tools used 48 threads. A Python script (https://github.com/shenwei356/memusg) was used to record the time and peak memory usage. Sequence alignment and searching were repeated four times on different cluster nodes over separate weeks and the average time and memory consumption were used for plotting.

For indexing, LexicMap built indices with the genome batch size 5,000 (default) for GTDB and 25,000 for the AllTheBacteria dataset. BLASTn, MMseqs2 and Minimap2 build indices with parameters as mentioned above. The Phylign index was built with default parameters, including k = 31 and a false-positive rate of 0.3 for the COBS index; because the index building involved three workflows with multiple steps in multiple cluster nodes, the memory and time could not be measured accurately.

The four query datasets were used for sequence alignment. LexicMap returned all possible matches by default and other tools were set to return all possible matches according to the sequence number in a database. All tools used 48 threads. The main parameters of Phylign included threads = 48, cobs_kmer_thres = 0.33, minimap_preset = ‘asm20', nb_best_hits = 5,000,000 and max_ram_gb = 100. For the cluster mode, the maximum number of Slurm jobs was set to 100.

The sequence alignment results from the four tools were divided into three categories according to query coverage and percentage identity and the genome numbers of each category were counted for comparison. The metrics of Minimap2 and Phylign were computed by sam2tsv.py (https://gist.github.com/apcamargo/2b7ca3032c1e80333adc1e54f47a0966). Alignments of high similarity were those with a query coverage of ≥90% (genes) or 70% (plasmids) and percentage identity of ≥90%. Alignments of low similarity are those with a query coverage of <50% (genes) or 30% (plasmid) or percentage identity of <80%. The remaining alignments were marked as medium similarity.

Alpha-Gal Syndrome Explained: The Tick-Borne Allergy Affecting Diets Worldwide

A single tick bite can trigger a bizarre meat allergy—here's how alpha-gal syndrome is reshaping people's diets.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Imagine suddenly becoming allergic to a hamburger—or a steak or bacon or even certain cosmetics and medications. It's happening to a growing number of people across the U.S. and around the world. And the culprit is a tiny tick bite.

Alpha-gal syndrome is one of the strangest allergies we know of: it's a tick-bite-triggered sensitivity to a sugar molecule found in the meat and fat of almost all nonhuman mammals. And as our winters get warmer and tick populations expand more people are finding themselves unable to enjoy their favorite foods—sometimes permanently.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Here to explain how a tick bite can completely change your dietary requirements and what you can do to protect yourself is Lee Haines, an associate research professor at the University of Notre Dame.

Thanks so much for coming on to talk with us today.

Lee Haines: I am chuffed to be here. This is amazing!

Feltman: So let's start with a basic question: What is alpha-gal syndrome, and what causes it?

Haines: So alpha-gal syndrome is a bizarre thing. I mean, it's taken many years to resolve what causes it. But it is a tick-borne allergy to a sugar, which is very, very strange. The molecule, the sugar molecule, is called alpha-gal—that's why it's called alpha-gal syndrome. And this sugar is found primarily in red meats, so people sometimes call it a red meat allergy, which isn't quite true because it's in [almost all] meat products that are not human. And people have to really change their lifestyle when they are diagnosed with this allergy.

Feltman: And why did we start hearing about it in the U.S. a few years ago?

Haines: It took a while to be discovered in the U.S. There were people talking about becoming allergic to their hamburgers, and it took a while for collective data to get on the radar of the medical system to say, “Hey, something is going on here. We need to figure out what's happening.”

And at the same time this is not just a U.S. problem; it's global. So a doctor in Australia was noticing the same thing in her patients, and it just took time for the science to catch up to figure out why people were getting sick and to link it to the bite of a tick, which is an unusual thing to think about triggering an allergy.

Feltman: Is it becoming more common?

Haines: Yes, it is becoming more common. More people know about it, but I think there's several factors that cause it to seem like it's more common.

So first of all, it's a funky story, no [laughs]?

Feltman: Yeah.

Haines: So the media liked to pick up on it, which means that more people hear about it. That's the first thing: the availability of the news to cover it. And then the second is—maybe not in this order—but our winters are getting warmer, so there are a lot more ticks surviving, which means [there's] more of an opportunity to be bitten. We have changed the way we behave, especially post-pandemic, so we spend more time outside as humans, so we are more exposed to possible tick bites. And I think the combination of these factors all make it sound like—that it is increasing. But now we also have diagnostics to make sure that we know if you do have alpha-gal or not, so we can give some hard evidence that this is here, whereas, say, 25 years ago we didn't even have a diagnostic.

So all of these things working together makes it [so] that we can more accurately predict who has it, how often does it happen in certain states or globally, and I think those are the four main reasons why it appears that it is increasing and it is increasing as well [laughs]. So they agree with each other.

Feltman: And so what are the signs that someone might have alpha-gal syndrome?

Haines: Oh, you know, the range is incredibly diverse. So some people report that they eat something that they shouldn't have and they have gastrointestinal upset. It's quite often mistaken as [irritable bowel syndrome] ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Haines: Because of this. So you kind of get stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and then it progressively gets worse. You might break out in hives. You could be intensely itchy. Worst-case scenario you're gonna have anaphylactic shock to that steak you ate.

So it depends on how big of a dose of sugar you got, or you ate, 'cause some meat has a lot more of this sugar than others, like pork kidney—whoa. Steak and kidney pie [laughs], that will trigger an allergy even if you're just slightly sensitized. And if it gets really bad, you can find that you're reacting even through your skin ...

Feltman: Oh, wow.

Haines: So if you run—rub something like lanolin into your skin, or you use this new cosmetic trend of beef tallow and you have beef-tallow lipstick and you end up chewing some of your lipstick, you're ingesting this sugar 'cause it's a meat product, so you can have [laughs] swollen lips or, or—without the Botox, or you could end up becoming really sick. So some people have to carry an EpiPen.

Feltman: Wow, so what should someone do if they suspect they might have it?

Haines: First of all, be smart and take a journal of what you eat and how you feel after you eat so you've collected some evidence. Be your own scientist—citizen scientist. And then arrange to either talk with your doctor or get a referral to an allergist, and take your journal with you and say, “Look, this is what I've noticed.” And they should, right away, ask you if you want to get tested for alpha-gal syndrome, which is just a simple blood test.

And once that comes in and you get your diagnosis, you have to change the way you eat and you have to avoid tick bites ...

Feltman: Mm.

Haines: You might have to carry an EpiPen if you really are allergic to everything 'cause you can become allergic to any type of product coming from an animal, so dairy, cheese [laughs], cosmetics, medications, gelatin—like, many things could trigger your allergy.

Feltman: Mm, and is there any treatment or cure?

Haines: That's an excellent question. It hasn't been around long enough for us to, as scientists, to work on that and have definitive answers. But certainly, people are thinking about it as a peanut allergy—you know, you can go through desensitization—and I think there's a movement to try and develop something for sensitization against a meat allergy.

But I would say the cure, in some cases, is to cut out anything that will activate your immune system ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Haines: Like, give you an allergy. And if you can do that, say, for five years [laughs]—not eat any meat products or become exposed to tick bites—oftentimes the person, their antibody levels will drop ...

Feltman: Mm.

Haines: It's an IgE response, so it's, like, releasing histamines; that's why you usually get itchy. So if you can get those levels in your blood to drop lower, we are finding that people can go back to eating meat products. So it's about a long period of abstinence, and then maybe you can enjoy your bacon again.

Feltman: Well, at least there's some hope [laughs] for bacon lovers who are suffering.

Haines: Yes, there is some hope for some people. Other people, their antibody levels are so high [laughs] that they probably won't be able to eat meat again.

Feltman: So how can folks avoid this and, of course, other tick-borne illnesses?

Haines: Oh, well, I have some bad news: ticks like surviving, and they are incredibly difficult to control and kill. So that's the first thing. We can't just spray and hope to get rid of all the ticks. So it really depends on our own ability to protect ourselves from tick bites, which means using 30 percent DEET or 20 percent picaridin.

Doing the tick check, I would say, is the most important thing. So if you're outside wandering around, when you come in at night check your body to make sure you have no bloodthirsty hitchhikers, and throw your clothing into the dryer for 10 minutes. Ticks hate to be dried out. They can't handle it. They have an Achilles tendon that you can exploit.

So other than wearing repellents and doing the tick check, you can also buy permethrin-treated clothing, and ticks, they'll crawl on you, but they'll die while they're crawling on you [laughs]. So it's quite satisfying to see ticks all over your lower legs, and they're just kind of clinging on there [laughs], they're dying [laughs], so they won't feast on you.

But those are the main ways that you can prevent tick bites from happening in the first place. And once you're bitten, it's really important to pull them off correctly because you don't want them to vomit into you or to drool into you any more than they need to.

So when a tick first lands on your skin, it has to drill through your skin to access your blood, and it takes time to do that; it's not instant like a mosquito. So in that time period, usually 12 to 24 hours, it starts to embed its head into your skin, and you grab it with tweezers, really tight, pinch around the head and pull straight up.

And the reason you do this and you don't try to squeeze his body or light a match to it or put petroleum jelly or anything like this: you don't wanna stress the tick. You just wanna grab it and pull out so that it can't regurgitate or drool into you, because when it drools, that's when it delivers the sugar, the alpha-gal sugar. It also can deliver things like bacteria, borrelia that causes Lyme disease, or other nasty diseases like a parasite disease called [babesiosis], which is like the malaria of the tick world—very dangerous, quite rare but very dangerous. But there's many different pathogens—like, intruders, invaders—that a tick can transmit. And unfortunately, in North America there are [laughs] many things that they carry.

So what's unique is that the alpha-gal allergy is usually linked to the lone star tick. So it's a big, fat, juicy tick that's got a white spot on its back that looks a bit like a star—that's why it's called the lone star. It's only on females, this star. And the thought was that they were the only tick that could spread this allergy, but now, if you look globally, many different species of ticks spread this allergy, including the tick that spreads Lyme disease.

So there was a case just recently in Maine where the woman developed alpha-gal syndrome, and she was never bitten by a lone star tick, just [a] black-legged [tick], which is really scary ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Haines: Because they are so abundant. And the lone star ticks are moving north, which is also scary because [laughs] they're very aggressive ticks that lay thousands of eggs, so they quite quickly can take over a system.

Feltman: So very important to be vigilant with the tick checks is the takeaway [laughs].

Haines: Absolutely, that is the biggest takeaway—which is tricky, you know, because the baby ticks, the larvae that hatch from the eggs, they're the size of your freckle or smaller, right? So you're like, “Is that freckle moving?” [Laughs.] And you're [like], “Hmm.” [Laughs.] Investigate quickly.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat with us about this.

Haines: You're welcome. It was a joy, even though it was about ticks.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday with a mind-bending conversation about the very nature of reality.

Maintaining safe and potent drug levels in vivo is challenging. Multidomain peptides assemble into supramolecular hydrogels with a well-defined, highly porous nanostructure that makes them attractive for drug delivery. However, their ability to extend release is typically limited by rapid drug diffusion. Here, to overcome this challenge, we present self-assembling boronate ester release (SABER) multidomain peptides capable of engaging in dynamic covalent bonding with payloads containing boronic acids. As examples, we demonstrate that SABER hydrogels can prolong the release of boronic acid-containing small-molecule drugs and boronic acid-modified biologics such as insulin and antibodies. Pharmacokinetic studies reveal that SABER hydrogels extend the therapeutic effect of ganfeborole from days to weeks, preventing Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth compared with oral administration in an infection model. Similarly, SABER hydrogels extended insulin activity, maintaining normoglycemia for 6 days in diabetic mice after a single injection. These results suggest that SABER hydrogels present broad potential for clinical translation.

a) Catechol oxidation and degradation occurred rapidly, appearing as changes in the UV-Vis spectrum of dopamine (DOPA) over time in pH 7.4 PBS. The increase in the baseline absorbance indicates increased turbidity of the sample as insoluble oxidation products form black precipitates in solution. b) The UV-Vis spectrum of the nitrocatechol 4-nitrodopamine (nDOPA) shows that the molecule is stable over the course of 15 d. c) Longitudinal analysis of the UV-Vis spectrum salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA) demonstrates that the molecule is largely stable with minor changes observed after 11 d. d) Boronate ester equilibrium constants between chemically distinct boronic acids (BAs) and the dynamic covalent association motifs alizarin red S (ARS), nDOPA, SHA, and DOPA. For all BAs, SHA forms the strongest boronate ester interactions. Equilibrium constants are presented as the mean value of three replicates ± SD (see Supplementary Fig. S1). e-f) Chemical structures, mass spectra, and UPLC chromatograms of e) Cat-K2, f) nitroCat-K2, g) SHA-K2, and h) K2.

Source data

a) Cumulative release of bortezomib from SHA-K2 is not significantly altered within physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose. b) The total amount of bortezomib released after 24 h was not statistically different between glucose concentrations. Data are presented as the mean value of three replicates ± SD. c) Gels loaded with drug were dissolved in water and run on UPLC to ensure that all of the drug could be recovered. Bars with ‘#' reached 100% release in the release experiments shown in Fig. 2 and cumulative release from those experiments after 24 h is shown here. These data demonstrate that all the drug loaded into the gels can be released. Data are presented as the mean value of three replicates ± SD. d) The change in UPLC retention time of ganfeborole and ganfeborole released from Cat-K2 in UPLC suggests that the hydrogel is degrading the drug. The new peak at 3.2 min seen in Cat-K2 + ganfeborole is also observed when the drug is reacted with 280 mM hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that this new peak corresponds to oxidized ganfeborole. e) Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of ganfeborole alone contains the expected mass of the drug at 258.1 m/z. Ganfeborole released from Cat-K2 has a peak at 248.1 m/z, (f) corresponding to a loss of a boron atom due to oxidative deboronation. g) The stability of ganfeborole loaded in K2, Cat-K2, nitroCat-K2, and SHA-K2 quantified by UPLC shows that the majority of the drug remains stable over the course of two weeks in all hydrogels except for Cat-K2, which rapidly degrades the compound. Data are presented as the mean value of three replicates ± SD. h) SHA-K2 without drug and the hydrogel maximally loaded (1:1 drug-to-peptide molar ratio) have the same β-sheet secondary structure as determined by a minimum at 220 nm seen by circular dichroism, suggesting that drug loading does not perturb peptide self-assembly.

Source data

a) Structures of fluorescein and the six fluorescein BA conjugates synthesized. b) In vitro release of the fluorescent BAs from SHA-K2 over the course of 336 h. All BA-modified compounds demonstrate significantly lower release than unmodified fluorescein. c) A rescaled release curve focusing on the six BA-modified compounds. The higher burst release observed in compound 6 may be due to the presence of a small amount of unconjugated fluorescein. The compounds demonstrate zero-order ‘linear' release from 72–336 h. d) The linear release regime for each sample was fit to a line to calculate the release rate. All fits resulted in an R2 > 0.97. Compound 5 demonstrated the fastest release rate, which is over two-fold faster than the slowest releasing compounds (2, 4, and 6). These data demonstrate that minor changes to BA structure can impact the release rate from SABER hydrogels. All data is presented as the mean value of three replicates ± SD.

Source data

a) Pharmacokinetics of decreasing bortezomib doses administered as subcutaneous boluses without hydrogel. Data is presented as the mean value of four replicates ± SEM. b) The maximum circulating concentration (Cmax) of bortezomib decreases linearly with the initial dose. Dotted lines represent the Cmax for 700 ng of bortezomib delivered from nitroCat-K2 (blue) and SHA-K2 (purple), indicating that a bolus bortezomib dose of 175 ng yields the same Cmax as these hydrogel formulations loaded with 5-fold more drug. c) Chemical structure of the bortezomib fragment observed in mass spectrometry imaging. d) K2, nitroCat-K2, and SHA-K2 hydrogels loaded with 700 ng of bortezomib imaged by mass spectrometry imaging in vitro show very little bortezomib signal, suggesting that MDP peptides suppress the ionization of bortezomib within the gels. This ionization suppression results in dark spots in mass spectrometry images at the location of the hydrogels.

Source data

a) Tissue sections from mice that received subcutaneous injections of bortezomib alone or in a hydrogel at 1-, 7-, and 21-days stained with hematoxylin & eosin. Large dark purple sections in K2, nitroCat-K2, and SHA-K2 are the hydrogels in the skin samples. b) Mass spectrometry imaging of the same tissue samples stained with hematoxylin & eosin shows that bortezomib signal does not significantly overlap with that from heme (616.178 m/z), illustrating that the drug observed in the tissue is not in circulation but in the local environment of the injection site.

Longitudinal concentrations of ganfeborole in the blood of mice after a single subcutaneous injection of 75 μg of the drug loaded into 50 μL hydrogels or PBS. Data presented as the mean value of four replicates ± SEM. Injections of ganfeborole without a hydrogel, ganfeborole in K2, and ganfeborole in nitroCat-K2 all led to the rapid release of the drug. SHA-K2 hydrogels were able to retain ganfeborole concentrations over the EC50 for more than 200 h.

Source data

a) Chemical structure of SHA-E2 with the mass spectrum and UPLC chromatogram of the material confirming the identity and purity of the peptide. b) Mass spectrum and UPLC chromatogram of the unmodified E2 peptide. c) Frequency sweep collected by oscillatory rheology shows that SHA-E2 hydrogels are more frequency dependent than unmodified E2 and form slightly weaker gels, as indicated by a reduction in the difference between the storage modulus (G′), indicated by filled circles and solid lines, and the loss modulus (G″), indicated by open circles and dotted lines. d) Representative histological sections of SHA-K2 and SHA-E2 gels excised three days after subcutaneous injection. Sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (left two images) or Masson's trichrome (right four images) stains. Black 750 μm scale bar applies to the left four full sized images. Histological analysis shows that SHA-K2 gels swell significantly and are heavily infiltrated by cells, consistent with an inflammatory response. SHA-E2 remains minimally infiltrated by cells, has less collagen deposition on the border of the gel, and does not swell in size. e) Cumulative release of ganfeborole after 24 h from SHA-K2 and SHA-E2 are statistically similar, suggesting that changing the peptide used in SABER hydrogels does not compromise its ability to control the release of BA-containing small molecules. Data is presented as the mean of three replicates ± SD. f) Pharmacokinetic parameters extracted by performing a non-compartmental analysis on the in vivo release of ganfeborole from SHA-E2 show that using the SABER hydrogel improves drug exposure (AUC), half-life (t1/2) and reduces the maximum circulating concentration (Cmax) of the compound. Pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as the mean of n=4-5 replicates ± SD.

Source data

a) Representative confocal images illustrating fluorescence recovery and photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. Fluorescence recovery was quantified by monitoring the return of fluorescence signal in the bleached region over 10 min using a 640 nm excitation laser. The white scale bar in the bottom left represents 40 μm. b) FRAP data (n=3 for each group) was fit to a first-order exponential equation to extract the FRAP half-time (t1/2) and the mobile fraction (Mf). Loading BA-modified IgG in SABER hydrogels reduced the Mf and increased the t1/2, suggesting that the rate of payload diffusion in these samples is slower. We observed minimal differences between IgG labeled with 11.4 BAs per antibody (IgG high) and 2.4 BAs per antibody (IgG low), demonstrating that the degree of labeling may not play a large role in controlling the rate of diffusion. All data were well-modeled by the first-order exponential equation and had R2 values above 0.95 except for SHA-E2 + IgG high (denoted with an asterisk), which was poorly fit by this model and thus extracted parameters may not accurately describe the data. c) In vivo release data of IgG with low and high degrees of BA modeling was modeled with a first-order exponential equation to determine the half-life (t1/2) and burst release from the site of injection. All SABER hydrogels had a moderate burst release of 20% but significantly extended the t1/2 of the antibody at the injection site. All fits adequately modeled the data (R2 > 0.95). All numerical data in this figure is presented as the mean value of four replicates ± 95% confidence interval.

a) Mass spectrum of BA-modified insulin (insulin-PBA) showing that a single phenylboronic acid was added to insulin. b) The UPLC chromatogram of the synthesized insulin-PBA confirmed the purity of the material. c) In vitro release of unmodified insulin from SHA-E2 and E2 illustrates that the phenylboronic acid modification is necessary for the SABER peptide to achieve the delay in the release of the payload observed in Fig. 6a. Data presented as the mean value of three replicates ± SD. d) First 10 h of the initial treatment of diabetic mice with 6 IU of insulin-PBA in SHA-E2 plotted with a repeat treatment with the same formulation in the same mice 6 weeks later. The repeat dose resulted in statistically similar blood glucose levels to the initial dose at all time points. Data points for blood glucose measurements are the mean value of five replicates ± SEM.

In 2020, haunting images of corroded metal barrels in the deep ocean off Los Angeles leapt into the public consciousness. Initially linked to the toxic pesticide DDT, some barrels were encircled by ghostly halos in the sediment. It was unclear whether the barrels contained DDT waste, leaving the barrels' contents and the eerie halos unexplained.

Now, new research from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography reveals that the barrels with halos contained caustic alkaline waste, which created the halos as it leaked out. Though the study's findings can't identify which specific chemicals were present in the barrels, DDT manufacturing did produce alkaline as well as acidic waste. Other major industries in the region such as oil refining also generated significant alkaline waste.

"One of the main waste streams from DDT production was acid and they didn't put that into barrels," said Johanna Gutleben, a Scripps postdoctoral scholar and the study's first author. "It makes you wonder: What was worse than DDT acid waste to deserve being put into barrels?"

The study also found that the caustic waste from these barrels transformed portions of the seafloor into extreme environments mirroring natural hydrothermal vents -- complete with specialized bacteria that thrive where most life cannot survive. The study authors said the severity and extent of this alkaline waste's impacts on the marine environment depend on how many of these barrels are sitting on the seafloor and the specific chemicals they contained.

Despite these unknowns, Paul Jensen, emeritus marine microbiologist at Scripps and senior author of the study, said that he would have expected the alkaline waste to quickly dissipate in seawater. Instead, it has persisted for more than half a century, suggesting this alkaline waste "can now join the ranks of DDT as a persistent pollutant with long-term environmental impacts."

The study, published on September 9 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Nexus and supported by NOAA and the University of Southern California's Sea Grant program, continues Scripps' leadership role in unspooling the toxic legacy of once-legal ocean dumping off the coast of Southern California. The findings also provide a way of visually identifying barrels that formerly contained this caustic alkaline waste.

"DDT was not the only thing that was dumped in this part of the ocean and we have only a very fragmented idea of what else was dumped there," said Gutleben. "We only find what we are looking for and up to this point we have mostly been looking for DDT. Nobody was thinking about alkaline waste before this and we may have to start looking for other things as well."

From the 1930s until the early 1970s, 14 deep-water dump sites off the coast of Southern California received "refinery wastes, filter cakes and oil drilling wastes, chemical wastes, refuse and garbage, military explosives and radioactive wastes," according to the EPA. A pair of Scripps-led seafloor surveys in 2021 and 2023 identified thousands of objects, including hundreds of discarded military munitions. The number of barrels on the seafloor remains unknown. Sediments in the area are heavily contaminated with the pesticide DDT, a chemical banned in 1972 now known to harm humans and wildlife. Scant records from this time period suggest DDT waste was largely pumped directly into the ocean.

Gutleben said she and her co-authors didn't initially set out to solve the halo mystery. In 2021, aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Research Vessel Falkor, she and other researchers collected sediment samples to better understand the contamination near Catalina. Using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian, the team collected sediment samples at precise distances from five barrels, three of which had white halos.

The barrels featuring white halos presented an unexpected challenge: Inside the white halos the sea floor suddenly became like concrete, preventing the researchers from collecting samples with their coring devices. Using the ROV's robotic arm, the researchers collected a piece of the hardened sediment from one of the halo barrels.

The team analyzed the sediment samples and the hardened piece of halo barrel crust for DDT concentrations, mineral content and microbial DNA. The sediment samples showed that DDT contamination did not increase closer to the barrels, deepening the mystery of what they contained.

During the analysis, Gutleben struggled to extract microbial DNA from the samples taken through the halos. After some unsuccessful troubleshooting in the lab, Gutleben tested one of these samples' pH. She was shocked to find that the sample's pH was extremely high -- around 12. All the samples from near the barrels with halos turned out to be similarly alkaline. (An alkaline mixture is also known as a base, meaning it has a pH higher than 7 -- as opposed to an acid which has a pH less than 7).

This explained the limited amount of microbial DNA she and her colleagues had been able to extract from the halo samples. The samples turned out to have low bacterial diversity compared to other surrounding sediments and the bacteria came from families adapted to alkaline environments, like deep-sea hydrothermal vents and alkaline hot springs.

Analysis of the hard crust showed that it was mostly made of a mineral called brucite. When the alkaline waste leaked from the barrels, it reacted with magnesium in the seawater to create brucite, which cemented the sediment into a concrete-like crust. The brucite is also slowly dissolving, which maintains the high pH in the sediment around the barrels, and creates a place only few extremophilic microbes can survive. Where this high pH meets the surrounding seawater, it forms calcium carbonate that deposits as a white dust, creating the halos.

"This adds to our understanding of the consequences of the dumping of these barrels," said Jensen. "It's shocking that 50-plus years later you're still seeing these effects. We can't quantify the environmental impact without knowing how many of these barrels with white halos are out there, but it's clearly having a localized impact on microbes."

Prior research led by Lisa Levin, study co-author and emeritus biological oceanographer at Scripps, showed that small animal biodiversity around the barrels with halos was also reduced. Jensen said that roughly a third of the barrels that have been visually observed had halos, but it's unclear if this ratio holds true for the entire area and it remains unknown just how many barrels are sitting on the seafloor.

The researchers suggest using white halos as indicators of alkaline waste could help rapidly assess the extent of alkaline waste contamination near Catalina. Next, Gutleben and Jensen said they are experimenting with DDT contaminated sediments collected from the dump site to search for microbes capable of breaking down DDT.

The slow microbial breakdown the researchers are now studying may be the only feasible hope for eliminating the DDT dumped decades ago. Jensen said that trying to physically remove the contaminated sediments would, in addition to being a huge logistical challenge, likely do more harm than good.

"The highest concentrations of DDT are buried around 4 or 5 centimeters below the surface -- so it's kind of contained," said Jensen. "If you tried to suction that up you would create a huge sediment plume and stir that contamination into the water column."

In addition to Gutleben, Jensen and Levin, Sheila Podell, Douglas Sweeney and Carlos Neira of Scripps Oceanography co-authored the study, alongside Kira Mizell of the U.S. Geological Survey.

It's been a long road for the 20-year-old fintech Klarna to make it to an IPO. But on Wednesday, the company successfully landed on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $1.4 billion, largely for its existing investors, rather than itself. 

The fintech giant sold shares at $40, above its announced range of $35 to $37, and came out of the gate with a $15 billion valuation. Shares popped, opening at $52, though quickly settling down to around $46 mid-day.

Of the 34.3 million shares Klarna sold, only 5 million were sold by the company, it said. The rest were sold by existing investors like the company's largest shareholder Sequoia Capital. Entities controlled by Dutch billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, Silver Lake, BlackRock, and many others sold as well. Despite cashing out some shares, all of them are holding onto the majority of their stakes.

Figma's IPO did a similar thing. Yet, often these existing investors don't want to sell at the IPO price, a VC told TechCrunch. They kick in shares to help the company meet IPO demand. Floating more shares helps the company obtain a more accurate, and perhaps higher, valuation out of the gate because it helps the IPO attract the biggest institutional investors who wouldn't bother with an IPO for a small allocation.

In Klarna's case co-founder CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did not sell any shares. His stake was worth $1.02 billion at the IPO selling price of $40 and he controls about 7.5% of the company. 

Victor Jacobsson, the co-founder who left the company in 2012, did sell but was, and still is, a slightly larger shareholder. He cashed out of 1.1 million shares and still retains over 8% of the company. 

Co-founder Niklas Adalberth still owns just under 3 million shares, Klarna disclosed.

Sequoia is by far the biggest investor in Klarna, controlling nearly 23% of the company. Famed VC Michael Moritz wrote Klarna's first check on Sequoia's behalf in 2010, and stayed on as Klarna's chairperson even after he left Sequoia in 2023. Some drama ensued when Sequoia added another member to Klarna's board. But it eventually sorted itself out when Sequoia's Andrew Reed joined its board in 2024.“This moment feels surreal,” Siemiatkowski shared in published remarks. “When we started Klarna back in 2005, it was just a wild idea — me, Niklas, and Victor, fumbling around, trying to make shopping and payments smoother for people. We got rejected left and right, laughed at more times than I can count. But we kept going.”He continued, “Going public in New York is huge. It's not just a milestone; it's a statement. It's proof that a bunch of stubborn dreamers from Stockholm can take on the world — and win.”

Interestingly, though, $1.4 billion is not the record for the biggest IPO of 2025. That's still held by CoreWeave, which raised $1.5 billion in June.

I felt a sense of déjà vu as I picked up the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max—in Cosmic Orange, of course—at the “Awe Dropping” Apple Event and tried to pin down what about these new Apple smartphones felt so familiar. Then it hit me as I left the Steve Jobs Theater in a tired daze last night: the iPhone 17 Pros remind me of the MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.

Like those first “pro” MacBooks, the iPhone 17 Pros are actually built for pros. It's not just “pro” for marketing. The iPhone 17 Pros are slightly thicker and heavier, have the longest-lasting batteries of any iPhones ever, the best cameras, and are a whole lot more powerful than the iPhone 16 Pros. You feel all the pro-ness as soon as the brick slabs are in your hands. Everything, including the large camera bump or plateau, screams “professional,” just like those 2021 MacBook Pros. And they should because Apple finally prioritized function over form, just like those MacBook Pros, which brought back the SD card slot and MagSafe charging charging. Pro users want an uncompromised gadget—or at least the closest to it—and Apple delivers it this year.

Unlike the iPhone Air that I couldn't help but ogle with my jaw on the floor, the iPhone 17 Pros elicited less awe from me. In every way, they are beefed-up versions of the iPhone Pros that came before them. The aluminum unibody design has a Ceramic Shield cutout on the backside for wireless charging, and the camera plateau stretches across the whole top third. It's not the most beautiful iPhone design (that award still goes to the iPhone 4 or iPhone X, in my opinion), but it's functional. I even noticed that the antenna lines that cut into the side of the frames now bleed around the camera plateau. It's very similar to the antenna lines that wrap around the display on the Apple Watch Ultras. Again, functional design first—this supposedly improves cellular and wireless connectivity, according to Apple.

Even with a heftier design, the iPhone 17 Pros don't feel bulky. In fact, the iPhone 17 Pro Max—the Pro Max model has always been too big and heavy for me—felt lighter and thinner than it actually is. For the first time ever, I felt I could use the iPhone 17 Pro Max daily and my hands wouldn't hurt from gripping it like an old Game Boy. The curved metal frame definitely helps to make the iPhone 17 Pros feel thinner than they really are. Its size still isn't great if you care about pocketability, though.

Just like I said in my iPhone Air hands-on, I'll have to test the iPhone 17 Pros to see how well the performance and battery life are, and how good the cameras are. That being said, the thicker designs also meant Apple was able to improve the thermals for sustained performance when the A19 Pro chip is pushed hard for 3D mobile gaming and GPU-intensive tasks like capturing RAW photos and videos (and editing them). If that's not prioritizing function first over form, I don't know what is. Who remembers the dark days when the thermals on Intel-equipped MacBook Pros were so bad? Apple, post-Jony Ive, seems to give a sh*t about this now, and I'm all for it.

The Center Stage camera is easily my new favorite camera feature. The ability to hold the iPhone 17 Pros vertically and take horizontal selfies (works for video, too) is a game-changer if you ask me. No more contorting my hand into a claw to hold my iPhone sideways to shoot a selfie or vlog. I also really liked the “Dual Capture” feature, which lets you record video from both the rear and front cameras. The front camera appears as a picture-in-picture box that you can move to any corner of the screen. It's going to be great for reaction videos.

I also did a table wobble test. Here's how that went:

The iPhone 17 was the least exciting model for me, and I spent the least amount of time playing with it. It's a straightforward update with an A19 chip, a larger 6.3-inch 120Hz display, a new dual-camera system with twin 48-megapixel main and ultrawide lenses, and some new colors. The Sage green colorway is my favorite of the new bunch, but they also lack the vibrancy of the colors from the iPhone 16 series.

There's really not much to say about the iPhone 17… it feels like an iPhone 16 Pro, with the same size screen, but with an aluminum frame. It's lightweight, but not the thinnest or thinnest in the iPhone lineup. It's the everyperson's iPhone, and I don't foresee that changing.

The best part is probably that the iPhone 17 still starts at $799, now with 256GB of storage.

After blocking its service in Mississippi over its new age-assurance law, the social networking startup is taking a different approach to comply with laws in South Dakota and Wyoming. Instead of requiring Bluesky to restrict access to all unverified users, users in South Dakota and Wyoming can verify their ages through the Kids Web Services' (KWS) solution.

The service allows users to choose from multiple methods to verify their ages, which may include payment cards, an identity document, an anonymous face scan for facial age estimation, or other alternatives. Bluesky is using the same service to comply with the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, which has similar requirements. 

“We believe this approach currently strikes the right balance. Bluesky will remain available to users in these states, and we will not need to restrict the app for everyone,” the company explained in a blog post published on Wednesday.

While Bluesky, like others, understands that governments are trying to mitigate the risks for kids using the internet, poorly written and overly broad laws like the one in Mississippi made it difficult to comply. That law would have required Blueksy to verify all users, not just those trying to access age-restricted content, and obtain parental consent for users under 18. Its penalties are also hefty, at up to $10,000 per user.

The startup previously explained that its small team doesn't have the resources to make the substantial technical changes needed to comply with Mississippi's law. This resulted in its unfortunate decision to bow out in the state entirely, leaving larger competitors, like Meta, to continue their dominance.

By comparison, Bluesky said the laws in South Dakota and Wyoming offer a better solution.

Laws requiring age verification are expanding around the globe, not just in the United States. However, given the lack of federal regulations, dozens of U.S. states have taken the matter into their own hands and enacted age-verification laws of their own. But when these laws target social networks, it can make it difficult for smaller players like Bluesky to compete. Privacy advocates also complain that the laws put users at increased risk of identity theft and are generally invasive.

Breathe easy, computer science majors. Everything's going to be just fine.

Leading professors at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering are pushing back against the prevailing narrative that job prospects for graduates are dwindling in the age of AI and tech industry layoffs.

“The alarmist doom and gloom prevalent in the news is not consistent with the experiences of the vast majority of our graduates,” said Magdalena Balazinska, professor and director of the Allen School. “The industry will continue to need smart, creative software engineers who understand how to build and harness the latest tools — including AI.” 

Balazinska said a computer science degree remains “great preparation” for a broad range of fields within and beyond technology, including the natural sciences, finance, medicine and law.

Balazinska joined the school's vice director, professor Dan Grossman, in a Q&A published this week aimed at myth busting recent media reports that paint a scary picture of the tech job landscape. One such report in The New York Times in August detailed just how many jobs some recent grads are applying for with no luck in landing one.

“While the job market is tighter now than it was a few years ago, the sky is not falling,” Grossman said, adding that as one of the top computer science programs in the nation, Allen School graduates are still highly sought after.

That's clear at Seattle-area tech giants. Amazon hired more than 100 engineers — an all-time high — from the most recent Allen School graduating class, and Microsoft hired more than two dozen. But Amazon CEO Andy Jassy did warn this summer that corporate headcount will shrink as generative AI takes hold.

Balazinska said two factors are at play regarding AI's impact on software engineering jobs: how it relates to the worker's skills, and how it relates to the job market. She said it's not so much that AI is taking jobs, but companies are having to “reset” after over-hiring during COVID and now devoting very expensive resources to the infrastructure behind AI.

“Coding, or the translation of a precise design into software instructions, is dead,” Balazinska previously told GeekWire. “AI can do that. We have never graduated coders. We have always graduated software engineers.”

Grossman reiterated comments made by longtime UW computer science professor Ed Lazowska on a recent GeekWire Podcast, who in turn was quoting Oren Etzioni, an AI specialist and former UW professor: “You won't be replaced by an AI system, but you might be replaced by a person who uses AI better than you.”

Elsewhere in the Q&A, Balazinska and Grossman discussed why students should still major in computer science even if AI can write code; how the Allen School is preparing students for a workplace and world being transformed by AI; what awaits a student interested in computing, but not AI; and more.

Whatever is happening in the world after graduation doesn't seem to be dampening enthusiasm for pursuing careers in that world. Interest in the Allen School remains strong, according to Grossman, as the school received roughly 7,000 applications for Fall 2025 first-year admission.

With the launch of Apple's new slate of iPhone 17s, iOS 26 is finally here for real. While we've had developer and beta versions since the summer following WWDC in June, this is the first official version that brings Liquid Glass to an entirely new generation of iPhones. According to Apple, iOS 26 will be available to everyone on Sept. 15, and will bring some new non-visual tweaks in addition to a new look.

Among those new features are Visual Intelligence, which allows AI to both see and interact with your iPhone screen, a live translation feature that's integrated into the Messages, FaceTime, and Phone apps, and a new, streamlined Camera app that should make it easier to switch between video and still photo modes.

While those might be nice to have, I'm most interested to see how people react to Liquid Glass in its final form and whether Apple's big risk on changing the face of iOS 26 pays off. It's worth noting that if you don't want the new, glassy look, you can just turn it off in accessibility settings. I, for one, am going to be giving Liquid Glass a shot, though it's nice to know that if it's not getting the job done, I can just go back to basics.

Either way, this will be a big test for Apple in its effort to steer a new generation of iPhones into the future and pioneer a new look along with them. iOS 26 isn't the only platform getting a makeover, either. The rest of Apple's software is also getting a revamp, and, according to Apple, those “26” versions will also be ready on Sept 15. That includes iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and watchOS 26. It's finally time to get glassy, folks—beta-free.

After years of speculation, Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are finally here, and while we haven't tried them for ourselves, they look like they were worth the wait. This generation brings new hardware, features, and some impressive improvements on paper over the last generation, which was refreshed in 2023 with USB-C and a few other features. If you're in the market for new AirPods, you're probably already wondering whether you should rush out to scoop up Apple's long-awaited third-gen, but before you do that, you should know what you're getting into.

Luckily, we're here to give you a categorical breakdown that shows all of this year's improvements and what's the same as the AirPods Pro 2. Have at it, folks.

When it comes to AirPods Pro, ANC is one of the most important categories, and this year's generation is no different. Apple knows that, which is why it clearly went back to the lab and took a stab at improving noise-canceling gen over gen.

According to Apple, AirPods Pro 3 use “ultra-low noise microphones and advanced computational audio” to help give this generation 2x more ANC than AirPods Pro 2. That equates to 4x more ANC than the original AirPods Pro. It's not all ANC, though. Apple says that this year's earbuds should also improve passive noise cancellation, thanks to new ear tips that are filled with foam, creating a better seal in your ears.

Apple doesn't provide specific numbers for how many dBs are cancelled by its earbuds, but from the sounds of it, AirPods Pro 3 should excel in the ANC department and maybe even give Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (my favorite buds for ANC) a run for their money.

I haven't gotten to listen to AirPods Pro 3 myself yet, but Apple says its new generation boasts some improvements over the AirPods Pro 2. Behind that is a tweak to the AirPods Pro 3 architecture.

According to Apple, the AirPods Pro 3 have a “multiport acoustic architecture” that better controls the airflow and the way the sound carries to the ear. Apple couples that with a new Adaptive EQ, which is designed to give the AirPods Pro 3 a better bass response and widen the soundstage. Again, this all sounds good in theory, but we've yet to hear them for ourselves. On paper, at least, Apple's AirPods 3 should be the best-sounding AirPods you can buy right now.

Battery life is one of the biggest metrics of any good pair of wireless earbuds, and, again, AirPods Pro 3 roll the ball forward here. According to Apple, the AirPods Pro 3 now have 8 hours of playback with ANC on as opposed to the 6-hour average of the AirPods Pro 2. If you want to extend the battery life even longer, you can listen to the AirPods Pro 3 with transparency on (ANC off), and you'll get 10 hours of battery life on a single charge, according to Apple.

There's really no subjectivity here—more battery is just better—but if you're curious, the AirPods Pro 3 improve upon the AirPods Pro 2 battery by 33 percent when it comes to ANC playback. On top of that, I'd say that AirPods Pro 3 also beat a lot of its non-Apple competition, which usually averages around 6 hours of battery with ANC on.

If you're picking up on a trend, it's that AirPods Pro 3 are pretty much better across the board, but this is where they really start to pull away. There are some things in the third-gen AirPods Pro that the AirPods Pro 2 just can't do. One of those things is heart rate monitoring. Thanks to new IR sensors in the AirPods Pro 3, which are combined with the preexisting accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, these earbuds can track fitness goals, calories burned, and heart rate. According to Apple, AirPods Pro 3 will combine with its suite of fitness tools, allowing Apple Fitness+ users to see real-time performance metrics onscreen. And yes, unlike the PowerBeats Pro 2, you can listen to music while you track your health metrics.

One thing that they share, though, is Live Translation, which does exactly what it sounds like—it translates speech in real time. Both the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods Pro 3 use the H2 chip and, as a result, both will be supported. While the feature is still in beta, Apple says you can currently use Live Translation for English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish, and Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are on the way.

That's all to say that you'll be able to do basically everything you can do with AirPods Pro 2 with the AirPods Pro 3—adaptive ANC, hearing test (though the AirPods Pro 3 is allegedly better at that), transparency, and more—but with one big new features in heart rate tracking. Point goes to AirPods Pro 3 once again.

Comfort is another huge metric for earbuds, especially if you plan to wear them for long periods or while you're exercising. Once more, Apple seems to have taken strides here with its new generation of AirPods. While both earbuds have ear tips, Apple says that it used “over 10,000 ear scans with more than 100,000 hours of user research” to tweak the fit of AirPods Pro 3.

Specifically, Apple says the “external geometry of the ear tip” now aligns to the center of the body for more stability. AirPods Pro 3 also come with five ear tip sizes as opposed to four. With more sizes and a redesign, it looks like AirPods Pro 3 are poised to outpace the AirPods Pro 2 in comfort, too.

So, there is one thing that's the same on these two pairs of earbuds, and while that sounds like a point against the AirPods Pro 3, it's actually a big win for Apple's newest pair of AirPods. Both pairs debuted at $250, and while you can currently get the AirPods Pro 2 for $200, AirPods Pro 3 still qualify as a static entry price gen over gen. More for the same amount! Nice!

Amazon is getting into the augmented reality glasses market, according to a report from The Information.

The Seattle-based tech giant is reportedly developing its own smart glasses for both consumers and delivery drivers. 

The consumer glasses, set for launch in late 2026 or early 2027, will have microphones, speakers, a camera, and a full-color display in one eye, The Information reported. The glasses for delivery drivers will help sort packages. Reuters last year reported on specialized eyewear for drivers.

Amazon has dabbled in smart glasses, launching the Echo Frames in 2019.

Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have been a surprise success, leading Wired to deem Meta the winner of the smart glasses race.

Meta is expected to show off its new Hypernova smart glasses with a display at its Connect event next week.

The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek

Why spend more than $300 for an Apple Watch? Apple may have its wearables fans asking that question with the new Apple Watch SE 3. The third-gen update brings a host of upgrades, including a new screen and better performance from a new chip. It may not have all the health tracking features of the mainline wearables, but that may simply make it a better option for most people.

The last SE (2nd-gen) arrived in 2022 alongside the Apple Watch Series 8 and the first Apple Watch Ultra. The revised edition revealed Tuesday at Apple's “Awe Dropping” event may look closer to the regular Apple Watch Series 11 than the older 2020s-era wearables. The new smartwatch sports an aluminum frame, so it's closer to the premium feel of the other models. On the other hand, this new SE also supports the same 5G capabilities as the Apple Watch Series 11. The new SE 3 is even closer to replacing a regular Apple Watch with an on-device Siri voice assistant and an always-on display.

With the upgraded chip, Apple promised the new device would be faster than the one from 2022 thanks to last year's S10 SiP, or system in a package. The device will still have the sleep apnea and sleep score features found on last year's Apple Watch and the Series 11, respectively. Better yet, it will have fast charging, promising 15 minutes of charging to get 8 hours of battery life. It includes temperature sensing and some of the “wrist flick” gestures for shuffling through apps or music.

You don't have to worry about a price bump like we saw from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 16e. The device starts at $250 for the 40mm version with GPS and comes in both a “midnight” and silver “starlight” aluminum case.

The Apple Watch SE 3 starts at $250 for the 40mm and will be available for preorder Tuesday. It should start shipping by Sept 19.

Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison is having a good morning.

Oracle's stock is up more than 42% on Wednesday, thanks to an earnings call on Tuesday that left investors stunned.

The company missed earnings and revenue estimates, but the forward looking guidance alone was apparently good enough to get investors to rally around it. A bulk of that reaction had to do with the revenue that AI computing demand was expected to bring to Oracle's cloud infrastructure service.

The shares skyrocketed in response. Oracle's stock is now on pace to have its largest single session surge since the dot-com boom, according to CNBC.

With the current surge in shares, Ellison has increased his wealth by more than $100 billion, thanks to the roughly 1.16 billion shares he owns. This meteoric rise grabbed him the title of the richest person on Earth from the former title holder, Elon Musk, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

As of Tuesday, Ellison's current total fortune was worth $295 billion, having increased by $100 billion in worth in just the past year. Today's additional increase  has catapulted him to a staggering $389 billion, surpassing Elon Musk's whopping $384 billion fortune.

Musk was first named the richest man in the world in 2021, and has since been up and down on the list. He has held the title consistently since last year and briefly became the first person to surpass $400 billion net worth in December. Although Ellison has overtaken him on the list, Musk might reverse that yet again soon. Musk is facing the potential of becoming the world's first trillionaire, that is if the massive and unprecedented proposed pay package plan by the Tesla board gets approved by shareholders.

Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle in the late 1970s with the CIA as an early customer. Decades down the line, the database software company now specializes in AI-first cloud computing and competes with other giants like Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Amazon's AWS. It's the aggressively positive and AI-driven outlook for its cloud infrastructure business that has led to investor delight and the 81-year-old Ellison is benefiting handsomely from it.

Although the revenue estimates were down, the company said it was expecting to collect more than half a trillion dollars extra thanks to four multi-billion-dollar contracts it signed in the past quarter. At the company's earnings call, CEO Safra Catz mentioned OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD, and Elon Musk's xAI as some of the company it has “significant cloud contracts with.”

Company executives shared that they are expecting to finalize even more multi-billion-dollar deals in the near future.

Oracle, and Ellison, are hell-bent on AI. The company recently made headlines for an alleged plan to spend more than $1 billion a year to run a new data center in Texas on gas generators rather than wait for approval and infrastructure to pull the electricity from the local grid. Oracle is also one of the partners in the Trump administration's ambitious AI project Stargate.

Cloud computing might be one of the clearest early winners of the AI hype. AI companies are scouring for more computing capacity as they try to compete with each other and scale operations, and they are willing to spend a hefty amount of money for it. Enter cloud infrastructure providers, like Oracle and Microsoft, that provide computing power for large AI models. Both the companies showed a meteoric stock increase after their recent earnings report.

In its latest earnings report in July, Microsoft reported that sales were up 18% from last year and that revenue for its cloud computing platform Azure had surpassed $75 billion this year, up 34% from last. Despite these numbers accompanying Microsoft's largest ever quarterly capital expenditure forecast, the market went crazy for it. The shares jumped and the tech giant briefly became the second-ever company to hit $4 trillion market valuation.

Zoox launched its fully autonomous ride-hailing services in Las Vegas on Wednesday, marking a milestone for the Amazon-owned company. 

It's the first official city for Zoox, which joins Waymo and Tesla in the robotaxi race. Alphabet's Waymo offers rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Austin. Tesla recently launched in Austin.

Zoox will offer free rides on and around the Las Vegas Strip as it awaits regulatory approval for paid service. 

In a blog post, Zoox says it is the first company to provide self-driving rides in a “purpose-built robotaxi.” CNBC notes that it's also known as a “toaster on wheels.” Waymo has taken a different route, partnering with carmakers including Jaguar and Hyundai.

Zoox plans to launch in San Francisco next, with other cities on its list. 

Amazon acquired Zoox for $1.3 billion in 2020. The business operates within the tech giant's devices and service business.

Zoox is entering the robotaxi market well behind Waymo, which plans to expand to Miami, Washington, D.C., and Dallas next year. Waymo also last week began rolling out vehicles in the Seattle area — right in Amazon's backyard — as part of new tests.

Last month Zoox won an exemption from federal regulators to demonstrate its robotaxis on public roads.

LIGO's discovery of gravitational waves—ripples in space-time from powerful cosmic events—hit astrophysics more like a tidal wave than a ripple. At the dawn of its tenth anniversary, the multinational collaboration has set another scientific milestone, this time solving not one but two mysteries in black hole physics.

A paper published today in Physical Review Letters describes how the LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration captured the sharpest-ever gravitational wave signal from a black hole merger. Further analysis of GW250114, the signal in question, validates two major predictions made by Stephen Hawking and Roy Kerr in 1971 and 1963, respectively.

First, we're more certain than ever that when black holes merge, the resulting black hole is wider than both parts combined. Second, we only need to know two metrics to describe gravitational disturbances in black holes: mass and spin.

“It's a beautiful, landmark result,” Arthur Kosowsky, a theoretical physicist at the University of Pittsburgh who wasn't involved in the new work, told Gizmodo in an email. The latest results are “a confirmation of both the fundamental nature of a spinning black hole and also a remarkable test of strong-field general relativity,” he added.

The latest results come almost ten years after GW150914, the first gravitational wave signal ever detected, which LIGO observed in 2015. In 2021, physicists used the 2015 signal to test Hawking's theorem. The team assessed a confidence level of 95% for this test, but with the new, cleaner result, that has jumped to an impressive 99.999%—as close as one gets to the “truth” in modern science.

“A decade ago we couldn't be certain that black holes ever collide in our universe,” Steve Fairhurst, LIGO spokesperson and a physicist at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom, told Gizmodo. “Now we observe several black hole mergers per week. With the 300 gravitational-wave candidates observed to date, we're beginning to provide a census of the population of black holes in the universe.”

Black holes lose a lot of mass during a merger. The violent conflagration can also speed up a black hole's spin, decreasing its area. Hawking and Jacob Bernstein's black hole area theorem posits that, despite these factors, the product of a merger will still generate a bigger black hole.

In the merger that produced GW250114, the initial black holes exhibited surface areas around 92,665 square miles (240,000 square kilometers), whereas the final black hole's surface area measured about 154,441 square miles (400,000 square kilometers). To put the final product in perspective, it weighs about 63 times the mass of our Sun and spins at 100 revolutions per second, according to the study.

“Musical” software developed by LIGO members—including Gregorio Carullo, an astrophysicist at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom—enabled the team to make such precise measurements. The tool essentially let them “hear” each black hole as it merged into a larger one, at sensitivity levels four times higher than a decade ago.

“Black holes are black, so it's very difficult to ‘look' into them,” Carullo told Gizmodo in a video call. Gravitational wave experiments offer an easy workaround, since everything controlled by gravity technically produces gravitational waves. Massive, cantankerous black holes are especially loud—and we're getting better at tuning into these signals, he explained.

“A decade ago we couldn't be certain that black holes ever collide in our universe. Now we observe several black hole mergers per week.”

“When black holes collide, they emit these characteristic sounds that are specific and peculiar to that black hole,” Carullo said. “If we can hear these sounds, or notes, [that] depend on just the mass and the spin…you can extract the mass and the spin of the black hole.”

The fact that this is possible at all is what makes black holes so extraordinary, he added. “People think of black holes as something scary, but actually, it's the simplest thing you can imagine.”

Excitingly, gravitational wave astronomy is still “in its infancy,” Fairhurst said. LIGO's Nobel-winning discovery was huge, no doubt, but no end goals exist for this project. If anything, the discovery of GW250114 marked the beginning of a new chapter in astronomy.

“In the coming years, we will continue to see the sensitivity of the detectors improve, providing ever more and higher-fidelity observations,” Fairhurst said. “At some stage, we are likely to observe something unexpected—either a signal that is hard to explain astrophysically, one that doesn't exactly match the predictions of general relativity, or a signal from an unexpected source.”

In a release, Kip Thorne—one of three physicists who fathered LIGO—recalled Hawking asking him, shortly after LIGO's historic gravitational wave detection in 2015, whether the instrument could test his area theorem. Hawking, unfortunately, passed away three years before LIGO finally did just that.

The anecdote, along with the story of how LIGO arrived at GW250114, shows how generations of breakthroughs—both theoretical and experimental—converge to expand our understanding of the universe. And that's something to be very excited about.

The cat, er, iPhone Air, is out of the bag. After months of anticipation, fueled by copious rumors and leaks, Apple announced the ultra-thin and super-light iPhone at its fall Apple Event. At a mere 5.64mm thick—thinner than even the 5.8mm Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge—the titanium iPhone Air is Apple's thinnest smartphone yet and one of the thinnest phones ever made. The downside to such a slim frame is that there's only room for one rear camera, but also that the battery may not be enough to last all day.

While we'll have to wait to test the iPhone Air for ourselves to see how good battery life is compared to other iPhones, the very fact that Apple is selling a new MagSafe Battery Pack suggests that it may need it the most. For most people, the appeal of a thin and light iPhone with reduced battery life is a compromise too far. Not to worry, though, Apple will happily sell them a regular iPhone 17 or either the iPhone 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max, which are thicker, but also have longer-lasting batteries.

See iPhone Air at Apple.com

For what it's worth, Apple says the iPhone Air can last up to 40 hours… for video playback… with the slim MagSafe battery pack. On its own, it can only get up to 27 hours for video playback.

The iPhone Air replaces the iPhone Plus model that Apple has sold over the past three years. Apple has been trying to figure out how to sell a “third” iPhone model alongside the regular and pro iPhones. We'll see if the Air size sticks this time or goes the way of the iPhone mini and iPhone Plus.

Tech-wise, the iPhone Air is, well, an iPhone. It runs iOS 26 with the new Liquid Glass user interface and has regular iPhone features. It's got a 6.5-inch 120Hz “ProMotion” display, an A19 Pro chip, and two cameras (a 48-megapixel image sensor on the back and a 24-megapixel Center Stage selfie lens on the front). Apple is also using its own custom second-gen C1X cellular 5G modem that expands on the C1 introduced in the iPhone 16e. The Apple-designed modem is more efficient than Qualcomm's, so it could also be helping save on power drainage. There's also a new N1 wireless chip for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth, and Thread support.

The front glass uses the new and more durable Ceramic Shield 2. The backside uses the first-gen Ceramic Shield.

Like all iPhones Apple has been selling in the U.S. in recent years, the iPhone Air is eSIM only. This time, there's no physical SIM card tray, even for the global versions.

The iPhone Air will be available in four colors: Space Black, Cloud White, Light Gold, and Sky Blue. Apple is also selling a clear case and new bumpers. The iPhone Air starts at $999 for 256GB of storage. Higher storage is also available in 512GB and 1TB models. Pre-orders start on Sept. 12 and the iPhone Air will be available starting on Sept. 19.

No more iPhone 17 leaks. At its annual fall Apple Event today, Apple announced the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max, running iOS 26 with Liquid Glass. The company also introduced the super-thin iPhone Air (yep, it's not called iPhone 17 Air) alongside new AirPods Pro 3. As part of the bonanza of new products, we also got several new Apple Watches: the Watch Series 11, new Watch SE, and Watch Ultra 3.

The iPhone 17 is on its own this year; there's no “17 Plus” to accompany it. Compared to the iPhone 16, Apple increased the display from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, matching the screen real estate of the iPhone 16 Pro. The screen can reach 3,000 nits of peak brightness. The glass on the display is made of “Ceramic Shield 2,” which Apple says is 3x more scratch-resistant than previous iPhones.

As the regular iPhone 17, there's again only two cameras on the rear instead of three—a 48-megapixel main camera and 48-megapixel ultrawide. The 24-megapixel front-facing camera has a new feature called Center Stage that lets you take horizontal 18-megapixel selfies while holding the phone vertically.

Under the hood, the iPhone 17 is powered by the new A19 chip, which Apple says is… more powerful. Because, of course, it's more powerful. The device starts with 256GB of storage.

It'll be available in several colors, including a new lavender.

Apple says it's increased battery life—up to 8 hours longer than the iPhone 16—thanks to the A19 chip.

The iPhone 17 starts at $799 for 256GB of storage.

As you'd expect, Apple's top-of-the-line smartphones—the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max—are even more “pro” this time around, with an emphasis on beefed-up cameras and battery life.

Apple has ditched the titanium frame of the last two generations of iPhones for an aluminum one. The metal may not sound or feel as premium, but it has several advantages: it's a lighter material, a better thermal conductor, and easier to anodize for more vibrant colors. Although the iPhone 17 Pros are slightly thicker than the iPhone 16 Pros, they should run cooler because of a new vapor chamber cooling system afforded by the aluminum body. Optically, the aluminum frame means we have more fun colors this year, like Cosmic orange and blue.

There's also a new cutout on the back that's made of Ceramic Shield. This is for wireless charging. The front glass uses the more durable Ceramic Shield 2, just like iPhone Air.

The biggest upgrade to the iPhone 17 Pros is to the camera systems on the now considerably larger rectangular island that now occupies the backside's top. All three cameras now sport 48-megapixel resolutions, with the telephoto lens finally going high-res. Apple also bumped up the optical zoom for the telephoto cameras on both models from 5x to 8x, giving you more reach when zooming in from afar.  The Fusion Telephoto system can also zoom up to 40x digitally. Just like the iPhone 16 family of devices, the iPhone 17 Pros all have a touch-sensitive Camera Control button below the power button for controlling the camera. Like the iPhone 17, the 17 Pros also have a higher-resolution 18-megapixel selfie camera.

The screens on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are the same as before: 6.3 and 6.9 inches with 120Hz “ProMotion.” Powering the iPhone 17 Pros is the A19 Pro chip, Apple's most powerful phone chip to date. It's the same chip inside the new iPhone Air.

The iPhone 17 Pros come in three colors and start at $1,099 for 256GB of storage for the 17 Pro; the 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199 for the same storage. Preorders start today with availability starting on Sept. 19.

So then along comes a new demagogue, covers his face in orange makeup to signal he's not part of that elite ingroup, talks like he's mentally handicapped to make it seem like he lacks the capacity to lie, and claims to care about the plights of the common person. All the things that politicians previously wouldn't talk about, rightly or wrongly. "This one is different, and he really hears us!". But then rather than any sort of reform, he merely directs that anger at other powerless scapegoats - a series of revolving spectacles that leave supporters with no time for it to set in just how much they're being had, or the wide trail of societal damage in his wake.I keep waiting for even half these people who claim to care about the Constitution and individual liberty to realize how their country is being mortally wounded. How every day they waffle and continue give this societal arsonist a pass, how much worse off our country will be. But being eternally hopeful that people will come around to seeing the truth is one of my personal flaws. So the cynical part of me is just waiting for Trump to start promoting gun control again.

The article worded the whole thing very carefully, in a way to me is intentionally misleading. The director mandated that the visa holder be labeled as a voluntary departure. That could simply mean the person decided he would return, and was allowed to do so, and the director simply informed whoever filled out the paperwork that this was a voluntary departure. There is nothing in the article that actually indicates the person was forced to leave the country with a valid visa.The fact that they dance around this tells me that this article is bullshit. And knowing what I know about The Guardian, it almost certainly is.

That's to say that a voluntary departure doesn't mean no harm was caused.

I think the shock from Hyundai is that violating these visas have been standard practice for so long that enforcement was not expected.

I'm talking about the larger number of people who supported, and are seemingly still supporting the deranged figureheads. When you examine the details, none of these policies actually benefit America - and doubly so with the incompetent execution. Yet as the results become increasingly undeniable, the supporters are twisting themselves into ever-tighter knots trying to stay in that fictional universe.

When ICE conducts these large scale raids, they do no stand there and check people as they are arresting them. They round up everyone, arrest them, and then sort out everyone's status after the fact.

reply

Did they do that?   Or did they throw out the ones with valid visas too?  (hint: It was the latter.  Details are in the article.)The bigger problem is that they "invalidate" your visa post-facto, on a whim, for whatever they want.  Attend a political protest?  Have a 20 year old bad check on your record despite having lived here for 50 years, since you were a young child?  Embarrass a politician?  I've seen all of those and more result in a legal immigrant having their visas cancelled and then thrown in jail until they can be deported.

Honestly I am not sure the point you are trying to make. In what world is that at all ok?You know damn well that if they raided a largely white work site people would be up in arms (people are already up in arms, but who would be up in arms would be different). But clearly its fine since they are not white, perfectly normal to detain people before making sure they should be detained.

Today, two robotaxi firms operating on opposite sides of the US say they're opening their services to the public.

The Ann Arbor tech developer May Mobility has launched its self-driving car service on the Lyft app in a section of Atlanta, Georgia. Starting today, anyone who orders a Lyft in the area might be paired with an autonomous vehicle. (Initially, the odds of nabbing a robotaxi won't be high—May Mobility CEO Edwin Olson says the company is operating “a few hands' worth of vehicles” in the city.) For now, safety drivers will still be behind the wheels of May Mobility vehicles to monitor the technology.

And in Las Vegas, Amazon subsidiary Zoox is opening up its toaster-like, purpose-built robotaxis to anyone who wants to download the company's app. Riders can choose between five pickup and drop-off destinations—three hotels, a Topgolf, and entertainment venue AREA15—around the Las Vegas Strip. For now, rides will be free.

Self-driving vehicle technology has had a rocky past decade, with venture funding rushing in and then out of the industry, and developers failing to hit ambitious service launch targets in the second half of the 2010s. Now, it appears, the race to drive you around without a driver is back on.

In the US, sector leader Waymo is running its paid self-driving taxi service in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. (In the last two cities, riders can only order Waymos through the Uber app.) Across those cities, 2,000 Waymos complete hundreds of thousands of paid rides per week, the company says. Electric vehicle maker Tesla is trying to keep up with CEO Elon Musk's expansive vision of personally owned self-driving cars, and Tesla launched a small robotaxi fleet with front-passenger-seat safety monitors in Austin in June. (The service is still only open to invited riders.) In China, WeRide, Baidu's Apollo Go, and Pony.ai are all running robotaxis in multiple cities; WeRide has started operations in Abu Dhabi too.

Now comes the hard part. In interviews with WIRED, tech leaders acknowledged that, while the public launch of a robotaxi service is a handy milestone, autonomous ride-hailing—and investors' hopes that it'll transform the global transportation industry, recouping and then banking billions in the process—still has a ways to go.

Zoox and its wheeled toasters will start rolling in Las Vegas.

“How do we break down the journey into bite-sized pieces, so it doesn't feel overwhelming or insurmountable?” says Jesse Levinson, the cofounder and CEO of Zoox. “This moment is a huge one, but the service is still unpaid and fairly limited.” Zoox launched in 2014, and though it's been testing its technology in San Francisco, at its Foster City, California, headquarters, and in Las Vegas for years, this will be the first time it's allowing anyone willing to download an app to ride. The company was acquired by Amazon in 2020 for a reported $1.2 billion.

Olson, the May Mobility CEO, says he is comfortable with the company's slower launch process after watching others rush to put self-driving cars on the road. “One of the things we've seen across the industry is that a vehicle might perform brilliantly some of the time, but then will do wildly inappropriate things in the edge cases,” Olson says. He declines to say exactly when the firm would remove the safety drivers from its vehicles, or when it might expand its Lyft partnership to other areas or cities, but he says any moves the company makes will be tested and validated with real-world and simulated data. The service will scale more quickly as time goes on, he says.

May Mobility offers rides through Lyft.

Climb in, Lyfters.

Two US self-driving vehicle firms shut down this past decade after their robotaxis were involved in serious road accidents. In 2018, a testing self-driving vehicle operated by Uber's Advanced Technologies Group struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona. Uber sold off its self-driving technology to a competitor in 2020. In 2023, General Motors subsidiary Cruise struck a pedestrian in San Francisco after the person was thrown into the empty robotaxi's path by a collision with another car; state regulators later learned that the Cruise dragged the person 20 feet while it attempted to move out of traffic, and revoked the company's permit to operate. General Motors got out of the robotaxi business a year later, citing high development costs and a desire to focus on personal vehicles.

Still, robotaxi companies say they have plenty more public deployments on the horizon. Zoox says it will start picking up public riders in San Francisco later this year, and will then launch in Austin and Miami. May Mobility plans to deploy robotaxis in Arlington, Texas, before the end of the year, this time on the Uber platform. Waymo has announced future service in several US cities, including Miami, Washington, DC, and Dallas. Tesla is running a small, invite-only ride-hail service in the California Bay Area with drivers behind the wheel using its more limited Full Self-Driving (Supervised) tech, which requires the person up front to stay alert at all times. Musk plans to move quickly: He said this spring that the company would have “millions” of vehicles operating autonomously by the second half of next year.

Vegas residents can download Zoox's app.

Rides are free for the time being.

Developers of self-driving vehicles have argued that their tech will increase safety and ride efficiency, bringing down prices in the long term. (Of course, these companies will also no longer have to pay a cut of each ride to human drivers.) But even in Phoenix and San Francisco, where Waymo has been running public robotaxis for years, cities have yet to catch a clear glimpse of how the expensive-to-develop technology might transform residents' lives.

“It's not at the scale yet where it's really dramatically changing anything,” says Adam Millard-Ball, an urban planning professor who directs the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies.

Robotaxi services will likely have to get much bigger, Millard-Ball says, before they can prove out their expansive visions. Waymo has released studies suggesting that its tech is safer than human drivers in many situations, but some experts still argue that it's hard to compare robots' performance to humans' given the still-limited number of miles the cars have driven.

“Can this make the rideshare industry grow the pie?” asks Jeremy Bird, Lyft's executive vice president of driver experience, who collaborated with May Mobility on the Atlanta launch. Bird says Lyft has studied data from where autonomous vehicles have already been deployed, and he thinks the answer is yes. But when robotaxis will become a moneymaking venture is still a big question mark. Clearly, though, plenty of people are still working to find out.

A Puget Systems engineer confirmed this system probably sold for over $8,000 in 2021.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In what has to be the luckiest case of a mislabeled auction item ever, a user in the PCMasterRace subreddit has posted a string of jealousy-inducing images of a full system they won for just $23. Although the original auction listing was for just a case, there was actually a full system inside containing some seriously powerful hardware, including a 24-core Threadripper 3960X, 256GB of memory, and an RTX 3080 Ti.

Capital City Online Auctions is a small auctioneer that requires local pickup, so it's not something that anyone could have taken part in, but the auction winner was very lucky nonetheless. The auctioneer sells a wide range of items, from mattresses to rowing boats, to full-on desktop PCs complete with internal hardware. In what appears to be a case of the seller not knowing what they had, they listed the lot as a Fractal Design Define 7 XL computer case. The images used in the listing were stock case pictures from Fractal Design, so there was no way any of the bidders could have known what they were actually bidding on.

Even if it were just the case, the lucky Reddit user LlamadeusGame would have gotten a great deal on a very good PC case from a few years ago. It still sells for around $250 new all by itself. But what they ended up getting for a mere $23.50 ended up being worth much more than that.

 




Green-eyed Reddit posters spotted the clear-acrylic Puget Systems graphics card support bracket in one of the posted pictures, suggesting it was originally from that workstation and professional desktop builder. Indeed, a purported Puget staffer posted in the thread, claiming this system was probably sold in 2021 for around $8,000, highlighting what a steal the auction winner managed with their comparatively meager bid.

The system in question appears to be a photo editor's personal work computer. The Reddit user reportedly found it with all the previous owner's files on it. They postulate that perhaps it was traded in as part of an upgrade program, or sent in for a service and never picked up.

Regardless, the system Llamadeus won was a good one. None of it is cutting-edge hardware, but it's still seriously powerful. The RTX 3080 Ti is roughly equivalent to an RTX 5070 but with 12GB of VRAM, and though the Threadripper chip is a couple of generations old, it still has more cores than you'll find in any consumer AMD CPUs.

They originally planned to use the case as part of an AI development build, so they will now use the CPU, motherboard, memory, and storage as part of that. They're going to swap out the graphics card, though, as even though a 3080 Ti is still great for gaming, it falls far behind in AI performance compared to more modern Nvidia GPUs.

Nvidia's modding platform for retrofitting classic games with ray tracing has just had a huge overhaul. On September 9, Nvidia announced major updates to RTX Remix, including an “advanced path-traced particle system” that adds real-time particle effects like fire and smoke with full lighting and animation controls, without touching the original game engine.

The new particle system was introduced in a standalone update to RTX Remix available through the Nvidia app. Fundamentally, the GPU particle simulation behaves like a native part of the ray-traced world, with particles casting and receiving shadows, reflecting in surfaces, and responding to both physics and the camera.

With the update, Nvidia is giving modders the kind of visual effects tools that are usually reserved for modern game engines. The company claims that “tens of thousands” of path-traced particles can be rendered “without significantly reducing performance.”

That's a bold claim that's likely to draw scrutiny. In previous RTX Remix projects like Portal RTX, particle-heavy scenes have pushed high-end GPUs to their limits, even with DLSS enabled. While Nvidia explicitly recommends RTX 30-series cards as the baseline for an acceptable experience, some players with 3090-class GPUs reported dips well below 60 fps in particle-heavy scenes.

The updates also introduce a more streamlined authoring workflow. Modders can now tag textures in-game as particle emitters via the Alt+X developer menu and tweak properties like size and color directly within the Remix UI. The more advanced Remix Toolkit adds scripting support for lighting behaviors and collision physics powered by PhysX in the backend, according to Nvidia's documentation.

Nvidia says that over 165 games are compatible with RTX Remix, provided they use DX8 or DX9 with fixed-function pipeline. That still leaves plenty of room for quirks like potential crashes and rendering issues in some titles, but there's no denying that RTX Remix is becoming a more powerful and practical tool by the month for modders committed to rebuilding classic games.

Since its release, the RTX Remix community has breathed new life into classic games like Half-Life 2, Need for Speed Underground, and Deux Ex, with more than 2 million downloads to date.

Big increases in performance when running a range of popular open source models.

Nvidia has broken its own records in MLPerf benchmarks using its latest-generation Blackwell Ultra GB300 NVL72 rack-scale system, delivering what it claims is a 45% increase in inference performance over the Blackwell-based GB200 platform in DeepSeek R1 tests. Combining hardware improvements and software optimizations, Nvidia claims the top spot when running a range of models, and suggests this should be a primary consideration for any developers building out "AI factories," as it could result in major enhancements for revenue generation.

Nvidia's Blackwell architecture is at the heart of its latest-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards, which offer the best performance for gaming, even if AMD's RX 9000-series arguably offers better bang for buck. But it's also what's under the hood of the big AI-powering GPU stacks like its GB200 platform, which is being built into a range of data centers all over the world to power next-generation AI applications. Blackwell Ultra, GB300, is the enhanced version of that with even more performance, and Nvidia has now tested it with some impressive MLPerf records.

The latest version of the MLPerf benchmark includes inference performance testing using the DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.1 405B, Llama 3.1 8B, and Whisper models, and GB300 NVL72 stole the show in all of them. Nvidia claims a 45% increase in performance over GB200 when running the DeepSeek model, and up to five times the performance of older Hopper GPUs - although Nvidia does note those comparative results came from unverified third parties.

Part of these performance enhancements comes from the more capable tensor cores used with Blackwell Ultra, with Nvidia claiming "2X the attention-layer acceleration and 1.5X more AI compute FLOPS." However, it was also made possible by a range of important software improvements and optimizations.

Nvidia utilized its NVFP4 format extensively as part of these benchmarks, which quantized the DeepSeek R1 weights in a way that reduces the overall model size and allows Blackwell Ultra to accelerate the calculations for higher throughput while maintaining accuracy.

For other benchmarks, like the larger Llama 3.1 405B model, Nvidia was able to "shard" the model across multiple GPUs at once, enabling higher throughput while maintaining latency standards. This was only possible because of its 1.8 TBps NVLink fabric between each of its 72 GPUs, for a total bandwidth of 130 TBps.

All of this is part of Nvidia's pitch for Blackwell Ultra as being economically disruptive for "AI factory" development. Greater inference through improved hardware and software optimizations makes GB300 a more potentially profitable platform in Nvidia's idea of the tokenized future of data center workloads. With shipments of GB300 set to start this month, the timing of these new benchmark results seems like no coincidence.

In the predawn hours of August 19, 2024, bolts of lightning began to fork through the purple-black clouds above the Mediterranean. From the rail of a 184-foot vessel, a 22-year-old named Matthew Griffiths took out his phone to record a video. The British deckhand was just a week and a half into his first official yacht job, and he wasn't on just any boat. The yacht, the $40 million Bayesian, was a star of the superyacht world, considered to be a feat of minimal design and precision engineering. As thunder rolled toward the anchored vessel, Griffiths set the video to AC/DC's “Thunderstruck” and posted it to Instagram. It was 3:55 am.

In the video, the Bayesian's aluminum mast, one of the tallest in the world, is briefly visible against the roiling sky.

Below deck, the yacht's owner, Michael Lynch, had every reason to be sleeping soundly. The boat trip had been organized as a celebration. Months earlier, Lynch had walked out of a San Francisco federal courthouse a free man, acquitted of all charges in one of the largest fraud cases in Silicon Valley history.

Lynch had built his fortune on understanding probability, on turning the unlikely into the possible. He had named his yacht Bayesian in honor of the statistical theorem that made him a billionaire, after the sale, in 2011, of his company Autonomy. The British tech giant sold software that could find meaningful signals amid the flood of unstructured data in emails, videos, and phone calls, but it would be better known as the company that allegedly defrauded, and nearly destroyed, Hewlett-Packard.

The cabins aboard the Bayesian contained the people who had stood by Lynch through his 13-year-long legal ordeal. Beside him in the master suite was his wife of 22 years, Angela Bacares, a former vice president in the investment division of Deutsche Bank who had caught his eye while working an Autonomy deal. Other cabins housed the Clifford Chance attorneys who had orchestrated Lynch's legal victory, as well as longtime colleagues, their partners, and a 1-year-old baby, all supported by 10 crew members. Also onboard was Lynch's younger daughter, Hannah, 18, who was about to begin her studies at Oxford. Her older sister, Esme, 22, had remained in London.

The day before, their last of the trip, the group had been subdued. They had spent the afternoon in the laid-back coastal town of Cefalù, wandering the plaza and visiting the church. That night, they had gathered for dinner in the saloon of the Bayesian, followed by dessert and drinks on the upper deck. Everyone was in bed by 12:30 am. Water taxis were due early the next morning to take them to Palermo for their flights home.

Many of them would not make it. Griffiths' video was to be the final earthly record of the Bayesian. Two minutes after he posted it, wind and rain started to buffet the vessel, and the young deckhand hurried to close forward hatches and cockpit windows. At 4 am, he ran down the stairs to wake the captain. This is the first time that details of Griffiths' account, as well as those of many associates of Lynch, are being shared—WIRED interviewed dozens of friends and colleagues of Lynch, reviewed thousands of pages of court documents, and reconstructed events on the Bayesian based on accounts, yacht GPS data, and official investigative reports. The Bayesian and its human cargo were about to face forces that would test every calculation of the yacht's design, the terrifying and tragic culmination of a series of highly improbable events. To this day, mystery surrounds the final night of Lynch's life, making room for conspiracy theories about spies and secret hard drives that can't seem to be quashed.

Today, Bayesian analysis is everywhere—powering spam filters, search engines, medical diagnoses, and artificial intelligence. Silicon Valley engineers casually talk about “updating their priors” as they refine machine-learning models. But in the 1980s, when Mike Lynch was a PhD student at Cambridge, Bayesian inference was still fighting for respectability, dismissed by many statisticians as unscientific because it dared to incorporate earlier beliefs into its calculations.

Lynch had arrived at Cambridge in 1983 to study natural sciences, carrying with him the determination of someone who had started life in the red—minus £4, to be exact, the amount his Irish immigrant parents owed the bank after they got married. His father was a fireman from Cork, his mother a nurse from Tipperary. Growing up in 1970s London as an Irish boy meant learning to navigate prejudice during the height of the IRA bombings. “You had to learn to run fast,” he would later say, “but reading the room is a good thing to have as a skill.”

He had won a scholarship to Bancroft's School—money bequeathed in the 1700s for the education of “poor boys”—and spent three hours a day commuting to Woodford Green, often hitchhiking and listening to drivers talk about their lives. On weekends, he practiced clarinet and saxophone and worked at his mother's hospital, progressing from mopping floors to serving tea to patients. It was there, talking to the dying, that he learned a fundamental lesson: “Get on with it. Do stuff. Whatever it is you want to do, just do it.”

Lynch's path to corporate software began at a distant remove—he wanted to build a digital music synthesizer. (It was the '80s, after all.) Samplers like the Fairlight CMI cost around £18,000 to £30,000. So Lynch, who had been tinkering with electronics since childhood and tried starting bands, created a groundbreaking program for the Atari ST computer that could manipulate sound with “an accuracy of one sample—that's one 50,000th of a second,” according to a 1988 interview with Sound on Sound magazine. The software gave musicians capabilities that were normally out of reach at the time. These technical obsessions led Lynch to Peter Rayner's signal processing group at Cambridge, in the engineering department. Lynch had switched from natural sciences to electrical sciences in his third year. “I initially thought he was a bit lazy,” Rayner told me, recalling how Lynch often hadn't done the assigned work. “But when we worked through problems in supervision, he showed great insight and came up with sometimes incorrect approaches, but often very interesting ones.” Rayner's lab had a distinctly commercial bent, focused on solving real-world problems. Many of his roughly 100 PhD students went on to found companies, becoming, he said, full professors, multimillionaires, and even one billionaire—Lynch.

At Cambridge, Lynch discovered that the same mathematics he was using to clean up audio samples could be applied to any kind of noisy data. At the heart of this approach was Bayesian inference, a way of thinking about probability that had been developed by Thomas Bayes, a Presbyterian minister in the 1700s who died before publishing his findings. They were discovered by a friend who happened upon them when cleaning out Bayes' things.

To the outside world, Mike Lynch appeared to be exactly what Europe needed: a homegrown technology champion who could compete with Silicon Valley.

The power of Bayesian thinking lies in how it handles uncertainty. As Rayner explained to me, using a simple example: “If I gave you a coin and you tossed it and it came down heads, then all you could say based on that one experiment is the probability of tossing a head is 1—certain. But Bayes would say, ‘Come on, we know it's going to be around a half.' It allows you to take account of previous knowledge.”

This idea, of starting with prior assumptions and updating them with new evidence, seems simple, but Bayesian methods proved extremely effective at pattern recognition in the age of computers. Lynch's doctoral thesis, completed in 1990, applied these techniques to neural networks for pattern classification—“a small step along the road” to modern AI, as Rayner put it. But Lynch saw commercial potential where others saw only academic interest. While supposedly working as a postdoc, he was often absent from the lab, secretly raising money for his first company. “Later on, I said to him, ‘Why on earth didn't you come to me, Mike?'” Rayner recalled. “He said, ‘I didn't want you to know!'”

That company was Cambridge Neurodynamics, founded after he completed his PhD, and its flagship product was a fingerprint recognition system that could handle smudged or partial prints. After Cambridge Neurodynamics, Lynch founded Autonomy. The new company would take the same ideas even further, applying them to the explosion of unstructured data that businesses were generating but couldn't effectively search or analyze.

The company's breakthrough was IDOL—Intelligent Data Operating Layer—a pattern-recognition engine that could understand the actual meaning within human-generated information. Unlike keyword searches that might confuse different terminology, IDOL could recognize that a document about “automobiles” was relevant to a search for “cars.” It could identify concepts, find patterns, and extract meaning from chaos. The name Autonomy itself reflected Lynch's vision: software intelligent enough to operate independently, to make its own guesses about meaning and relevance without human intervention. As Lynch would later explain in a 2000 interview with WIRED, “Bayes gave us a key to a secret garden. A lot of people have opened up the gate, looked at the first row of roses, said, ‘That's very nice,' and shut the gate. They don't realize there's a whole new country stretching out behind those roses.”

Lynch had always been more interested in how people thought than what they knew. I talked to one of his employees, Emily Orton, who still remembers her first interview with Lynch back in 2009. While other executives had asked about her qualifications and experience, Lynch wanted to see how she dealt with the unexpected. He asked her a single question: “Tell me what makes you angry?”

By that point, Autonomy was Britain's largest software company. Its software was being used by intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and major corporations worldwide, and its acquisition, in 2005, of Verity—a search company double Autonomy's size in terms of sales—eventually led to a market value north of $6 billion. Lynch earned the nickname “Britain's Bill Gates.”

Andy Kanter, an American lawyer at Autonomy since the late '90s, had watched Lynch evolve from entrepreneur to CEO of a major corporation. He was a perfectionist, says Kanter. When Kanter and a colleague spent weeks crafting the IPO prospectus, Lynch read it, declared it “entirely wrong,” then approved it after they changed perhaps 10 words. “If something wasn't right, he would dismiss it as useless,” Kanter said. “Ninety-five percent good isn't good enough.”

But this harshness—one of his own lawyers told me that “he could be a prick”—came with fierce loyalty. For Christmas parties, Lynch flew the entire UK staff to four-star hotels in European cities—Venice, Prague. And quarter after quarter, the company continued to beat analyst expectations. To the outside world, Autonomy appeared to be exactly what Europe needed: a homegrown technology champion that could compete with Silicon Valley.

But maintaining Autonomy's image of consistent growth required increasingly creative measures. At the center of this effort was Sushovan Hussain, the CFO who had joined in 2001. Lynch and Hussain's relationship went back to their school days—though Lynch would later downplay this, testifying that Hussain was merely a “third-level acquaintance” who had arrived at Bancroft's in his final year. Yet they had both gone on to Cambridge and kept in touch over the years, and Lynch had attended Hussain's wedding. When Hussain returned to England after working in the oil industry abroad, Lynch hired him.

Software companies are judged differently than other businesses. Investors expect them to maintain high profit margins, because software costs almost nothing to reproduce—once you write the code, you can sell it infinitely without manufacturing costs. But, inevitably, some quarters fall short. So Lynch and Hussain developed practices designed to smooth out the randomness.

The Autonomy acquisition, meant to herald HP's transformation, instead became the symbol of a company in chaos.

The most straightforward was hardware reselling. When software sales fell short, Autonomy would purchase servers from manufacturers like EMC, Dell, and Hitachi, then resell them to customers—often at a loss. This wasn't unusual; many software companies bundled hardware with their products. What was distinctive, according to later court findings, was how Autonomy accounted for these transactions. Instead of recording all the hardware costs as “cost of goods sold,” which would have devastated those crucial gross margins, portions were allocated to “sales and marketing expenses.” This preserved the illusion of a pure software company while pumping up revenue. The company also developed complex, opportunistic arrangements with resellers. During analyst calls, when hedge funds would try to trip up Hussain with coordinated questions about the numbers, Lynch would protect, and at times coach, his CFO.

So business stayed booming, and Lynch lived the life of a quirky multimillionaire. He had moved his family to a sprawling 69-acre farm he owned in Suffolk, complete with gardens, parkland, paddocks, and woodland. He restored a water mill and began breeding rare animals—“cows that became defunct in the 1940s and pigs that no one's kept since medieval times,” as he would later describe them. He loved dogs, especially the rare Otter Hound. His dogs were all named after engineering parts: Switch, Tappet, Pinion, Valve, and Cam.

Politicians sought out his advice for Britain's technological future, and he was a popular speaker at events and in the business media. Everything Lynch touched, it seemed, turned to gold.

Leo Apotheker had been CEO of Hewlett-Packard for less than a year when he announced his vision to transform the technology giant: It was time for HP to pivot from its roots in hardware manufacturing to become a software and services company. It was March 2011, and Apotheker needed a flagship acquisition to demonstrate this new direction. By July, Lynch and Apotheker were meeting in Deauville, the French seaside resort.

HP initially proposed acquiring Autonomy for between £24.94 and £26.94 per share in late July 2011. When market volatility drove down Autonomy's stock price in early August, HP attempted to renegotiate lower, but Lynch held firm, refusing to accept anything below £25. Within weeks of that first proposal, the companies settled on £25.50 per share—approximately $11.1 billion total, a 64 percent premium over Autonomy's market value. HP's due diligence was, as Andy Kanter would later describe it, shocking in its brevity: “Having run billions and billions of dollars of acquisitions,” he told me, “I'd never seen anything like it.” The exact duration would become a matter of dispute—Lynch's lawyers would claim it amounted to just six hours in conference calls, while HP described hundreds of people involved and consultations with Deloitte, Autonomy's auditor.

On August 18, 2011, HP put out what Kanter called “some of the five craziest corporate things all at the same time.” In a single press release, the company announced the Autonomy acquisition, revealed it had missed its numbers, lowered guidance, wrote off previous acquisitions, and disclosed plans to potentially split the company and exit the PC business. The stock price plummeted. The Autonomy acquisition, meant to herald HP's transformation, instead became the symbol of a company in chaos.

HP's board, watching their share price crater, seemed to panic. About a month after the announcement—before the deal had even closed—they fired Apotheker and replaced him with Meg Whitman. The acquisition closed in October, but by then Autonomy had already become, in Lynch's words, “the unwanted stepchild.” By May 2012, Whitman fired Lynch and reshuffled most of Autonomy's senior leadership. Six months later, HP was writing down $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value, with $5 billion attributed to what it called “serious accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations” at Autonomy.

From Lynch's perspective, the narrative was clear: HP had thrown a Hail Mary, the market had punished the company for it, and now it needed someone to blame. HP saw it differently. In its telling, it had been systematically deceived, the victim of a sophisticated fraud that had inflated Autonomy's value. The battle lines were drawn. HP sued Lynch in the UK for $5 billion. The US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation. Lynch countersued, claiming HP had destroyed his reputation and mismanaged the acquisition. What had begun as a transformative deal had become one of the most bitter corporate disputes in recent history.

When HP announced its write-down in November 2012, Lynch had a choice. He could remain silent, let lawyers handle negotiations, perhaps reach a settlement. Instead, he went on Channel 4's main business program and blamed HP for running a broken company. “In a year, they destroyed that value that was created over 10 years,” he said.

That drove HP to double down even more. It made a criminal complaint in the US and filed a civil case in the UK. Against the advice of his legal team, Lynch insisted on fighting the UK civil case first. He had his team build new software to analyze the more than 11 million documents in the case. At times, he'd gather his legal team aboard the Bayesian—purchased just a year earlier—for strategy sessions.

Lynch also continued to hobnob with British politicians and founded a new venture capital company, Invoke Capital, in 2012, assembling about 60 former Autonomy employees. Most of the money in the fund came from his personal fortune from the HP sale, about $800 million. Invoke's portfolio spun out multiple highly successful companies, with traces of Bayesian inference in each one. Darktrace became a global force in AI-powered cybersecurity, valued at nearly $5 billion in its 2024 acquisition by Thoma Bravo. Featurespace's fraud-detection technology became standard for major banks, with a proposed £700 million acquisition by Visa. Sophia Genetics went public in 2021 at a $1.14 billion valuation.

Most white-collar defendants stay silent; Lynch insisted on taking the stand.

In this way, his wealth grew, but the legal threats hovered above him, an axe yet to drop. In 2018, Hussain, who had fought his criminal case first in the US, was convicted of conspiracy, wire fraud, and securities fraud. It was a bad omen to have a jury decide criminal liability, a much higher bar than a civil ruling.

Lynch's civil trial ran for 93 days, and what emerged was deeply troubling. The court found that when Autonomy's US finance chief Brent Hogenson raised alarms in 2010 about suspect sales, Lynch's response was not to investigate but to suppress. He forwarded Hogenson's concerns with instructions to use “the usual encryption,” warned that “emails have been known to escape,” and ultimately plotted to fire Hogenson—indicating that Lynch knew the allegations were true.

The court delivered a devastating judgment in January 2022. In a 1,700-page ruling, the judge found that Lynch had been “aware of improprieties in Autonomy's accounting practices” and had been “dishonestly involved in manipulating the accounts.” The systematic accounting practices weren't just aggressive. They were, the judge concluded, a deliberate scheme to mislead. American prosecutors, who had been waiting for the UK proceedings to conclude, now had the ammunition they needed. Extradition proceedings, already in motion, gained momentum.

Lynch's forced travel to the United States in May 2023 marked the beginning of an extraordinary ordeal. Federal prosecutors in San Francisco charged him in a 16-count indictment that included conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy. If convicted on all counts, the 57-year-old faced up to 25 years in prison—effectively a life sentence.

Despite US prosecutors promising the English court that Lynch wouldn't be incarcerated pretrial, Judge Charles Breyer immediately sent him to jail upon arrival, his lead attorney Reid Weingarten recalled. “That was probably the lowest moment.” He ended up in jail for only one day, though, after posting a $100 million bond. The mathematics of his situation became Lynch's obsession. “What are the odds?” he would constantly ask his friends and lawyers, especially Weingarten, who found it maddening. “It was the stupidest question ever,” he would later recall. “There's just too many variables.” At the same time, he respected Lynch's genuine curiosity—“there was nothing he didn't know about or didn't want to know about,” from astrophysics to politics, culture, music, even American baseball.

The trial began in March 2024, with Lynch joined by his former VP of finance Stephen Chamberlain as codefendant. From the start, it was clear that Lynch's team had it easier. Hussain's conviction had taught them the playbook of US prosecutors, and they'd had years to ready a new defense. Each night, Lynch and his legal team would work out who the prosecution was going to bring the next day. They also hired a “shadow jury”—a barman and a clerk paid to sit through all 11 weeks of proceedings and register independent impressions.

Most white-collar defendants stay silent; Lynch insisted on taking the stand. He presented himself as a down-to-earth British entrepreneur who had been victimized by American corporate incompetence. He walked the jury through his working-class background, his academic achievements. When prosecutors pressed him on specific transactions, he deflected skillfully—these were matters for the finance team, he was focused on technology and strategy.

One of the most effective moments came when Lynch described the experience with HP. “I watched them take this beautiful company and just wreck it,” he told the jury, emotion creeping in. “And then they had the audacity to blame me for their incompetence.”

The verdict came on June 6, 2024. As the jury foreman read “not guilty” to all remaining charges, Lynch cried. So did his wife. Chamberlain was also acquitted on all counts. Speaking to journalists later, Lynch reflected on what he'd endured: “It's bizarre, but now you have a second life,” he said. “The question is, what do you want to do with it?”

As part of his recovery process, Lynch planned a long summer aboard the Bayesian, full of friends and celebration. For one particular outing in August, he invited along everyone who stayed close to him during the darkest period of his life. Christopher Morvillo, the Clifford Chance partner who had helped quarterback the US legal strategy, was there with his wife, Neda. Jonathan Bloomer, the Morgan Stanley international executive who had served as a character witness, had accepted the invitation along with his wife, Judy.

The yacht itself was a 56-meter sailing vessel with a dark blue hull and a minimalist ­Japanese-style interior, later referred to by The Times of London as a “masterpiece of engineering and opulence.” The yacht's original name was Salute; Lynch rechristened it the Bayesian. The vessel was magnificent but also an anomaly: It had a single, towering aluminum mast.

When that hot air collided with colder masses higher up, it produced a rotating updraft—a supercell.

The following account is drawn from official investigation reports, videos, photos, and people familiar with the accounts of the crew and survivors. The August sailing was planned as a leisurely tour of Sicily's northern coast and Aeolian Islands. The group started in Milazzo, then spent four days exploring the volcanic archipelago. They anchored off Isola di Vulcano one day for a few hours to watch the active crater glow against the sky, visited Panarea, and enjoyed the crystal clear waters around Dattilo. It was exactly the kind of relaxed, intimate celebration Lynch had envisioned. It was also a sendoff for Hannah, an aspiring poet. The two loved to spar over meals, arguing about politics and world events, with Lynch playing the contrarian.

That weekend, Lynch received two devastating calls from Andy Kanter about Stephen Chamberlain, his Autonomy codefen­dant. The first call, on Saturday, Lynch answered with a happy hello—laughter and cheer audible in the background—before Kanter delivered what he called “the gravest news”: Chamberlain, a middle-aged soccer fan and avid runner, had been struck by a car while jogging and suffered a traumatic head injury. By Sunday's call, the news was worse: The hospital was turning off life support. The group aboard the Bayesian lit a candle for Chamberlain in the church at Cefalù.

Weather forecasts for that night had mentioned possible thunderstorms, but nothing unusual for August in the Mediterranean. The five-day trip had been blessed with perfect conditions—clear skies, warm temperatures, and gentle winds. Lynch and his wife told the captain to move the Bayesian farther west to the village of Porticello to make the commute to the airport the following morning easier, in the event of rain.

The crew settled into their nightly routines. The Bayesian sat at anchor around 300 meters from shore, her distinctive silhouette dark against the night sky.

Even as people turned in for the night, the flashes of lightning had been visible for some time—flaring from the west, far offshore where a dense cloud tower brooded—but nothing hinted it would reach the anchorage. Thunderstorm alerts were in force for Sicily's north coast, yet forecasters expected only scattered cells. In Griffiths' Instagram video, lightning flickers in the clouds, the flashes outlining their depths.

Meteorological analysis later showed a perfect, if unlikely, recipe for disaster: Tyrrhenian surface water near 29 degrees Celsius—2 to  3 degrees above the norm—pumped moisture aloft like fuel into a furnace. When that hot air collided with colder masses higher up, it produced a rotating updraft—a supercell.

As Griffiths ran to shut the forward hatches, the wind was already past 30 knots; 5 miles away, it was recorded at 41 knots. By 3:57 am, the Bayesian began to drift under pressure from the wind, dragging its anchor. The yacht's chief engineer, Timothy Parker Eaton, who had sleeping quarters near the engine, felt the movement. He made sure all three generators were operating and headed to the wheelhouse—the yacht's enclosed main control room.

The vessel was lurching, but boats, of course, are always moving. Only some passengers woke up in the dark night. Key crew members—chief officer Tijs Koopmans and chief steward Sasha Murray among them—dressed hurriedly and made their way out of the crew's quarters. Bacares pulled on her dressing gown and went to the saloon to check what was going on. Charlotte Golunski and her husband brought their baby there, too, to avoid waking the other guests. On deck, the crew worked to secure the vessel against the building storm, closing windows and securing cabinets. Above, on the fly deck, the chief steward met a wall of rain that she'd later describe as unlike anything she'd ever seen.

Meanwhile, the chief officer climbed to the flying bridge, where Captain James Cutfield, just roused, ordered him to wake the rest of the crew. Below, a crew member passed the galley: Chef Recaldo Thomas was stowing pans. “Good morning!” he called, as if greeting just another squall.

By now the yacht was sliding south‑southeast at 1.8  knots. The yacht's 72-meter aluminum mast—taller than a 20‑story building—caught the wind like a lever, and the boat started to heel. The chief officer confirmed with the chief engineer that engines and pumps were ready to reposition the boat.

At 4:04 am the onboard CCTV caught the flying‑bridge awning shredding in an instant, obliterated by the force of the gale. Just moments later, as Captain Cutfield grabbed the helm to swing the bow into the wind, the downburst struck. A shaft of cold air dropped from 30,000 feet and hit the sea like an invisible fist. Wind leapt from 30 knots to more than 70 knots, a hurricane-force gust that struck the Bayesian with devastating power. The weather service's review of satellite data would later suggest bursts over 87 knots, or nearly 100 miles per hour. The yacht began to tip hard to starboard. Within 15 seconds it capsized, generators cutting out as the side hit the water. It was 4:06.

People, furniture, and glass hurled sideways as battery lights flickered on, and then off. Bacares, the Golunski family, and a steward slammed into a wall—now the floor—and were cut by shattering glass. Griffiths, thrown from the flying bridge into the sea, clawed back aboard. Records indicate that the alarm was never pulled; no one had time.

Below, guests Matthew Fletcher and Ayla Ronald escaped their forward cabin by pulling out drawers as steps. Their cabin was farthest from the stairwell—the stairwell being a pivotal location, a straight shot to the saloon, which was the best way to exit the ship. Water poured over the rails. The yacht was flooding fast.

In the saloon, a desperate human chain formed to pass people up toward the open air. The chief officer shoved Bacares up toward the central stairway, where water was now cascading down in a torrent, and another crew member pulled her up onto the side of the flybridge above. Together they handed up Charlotte Golunski and the baby, passing them person-to-person through the flooding, tilted interior. But the situation was fast evolving. Three of them were momentarily trapped in an air pocket behind the wheelhouse door—James Emslie tried to force it open from outside but couldn't, due to the pressure of the rushing water. Eventually, one of the crew members got it open when the boat had filled with enough water for the pressure to equalize.

The chief officer, lowest in the chain, was suddenly swept back into the main saloon before he could climb after the others. The ship, at this point, was slanted on an angle and the officer was in a corner on the upper part of the slant. He surfaced in a small air bubble there: The ceiling was on his side, the wall above him. His first escape attempt failed in the black water, which was clogged with cushions and broken bits of the once-lovely interior. Finding another small air pocket, he was able on the second attempt to feel his way along the debris-filled space to the heavy glass doors at the back of the saloon, braced his feet against the tilted door frame and hauled them open wide enough to squeeze through into the open sea. He later told Italian investigators he was sure he was going to die.

The remaining passengers and crew clung desperately to whatever they could find. At this point it was clear that there would be no saving the boat, only surviving its sinking. The storm, though, was over. The wind, on the surface of the water, was quiet. Outside in the water, Captain Cutfield tried to organize the abandonment of the superyacht, telling survivors to swim clear of the mast and the boom, which could drag someone down with it. Murray counted heads and Griffiths improvised a tourniquet on Emslie's arm. The baby balanced on a cushion, absurdly, precariously. Then the group finally caught a break: Koopmans, the chief officer, surfaced and cut one life raft free right as other crew members were trying, and failing, to get to another one. He ferried it to the bobbing group and inflated it.

From the raft, the group watched the Bayesian's bow rise up and then plunge down. By 4:24, the boat was gone, drifting 50 meters down to the seabed. From the time the full storm struck the yacht, only 18 minutes had passed.

Ten minutes later, the chief engineer fired a red parachute flare, but higher-altitude wind carried it sideways. He fired a second, and a crew member aboard the 42‑meter steel-hulled schooner Sir Robert Baden Powell, anchored nearby, spotted it and alerted the skipper. The downburst had struck like a scalpel; the other vessel, barely 100 meters away, lost nothing more than an awning frame.

Its tender reached the raft and recovered 15 survivors. Bacares was among them, injured but alive. Her husband, daughter, and five others—Jonathan Bloomer, Judy Bloomer, Christopher Morvillo, Neda Morvillo, and Recaldo Thomas—remained inside the sunken yacht. Thomas—the chef who had called “Good morning!”—was found dead later that day.

Lynch, as a baby. He grew up in a modest household, the son of Irish parents.

Rescue boats eventually arrived, too late to do anything about those stuck inside the sunken boat. By 6 am, as the survivors reached the dock at Porticello, villagers began throwing clothing out of their windows for the barely clad group.

Andy Kanter, who was due to join Lynch with another set of lawyers on the Bayesian the following week, flew to Sicily immediately upon hearing the news. As Lynch's close friend and business associate, he found himself coordinating with authorities and helping Bacares navigate the bureaucratic maze that follows disasters. The man who had called Lynch just hours before the tragedy to tell him about Chamberlain's life support now faced the impossible task of managing the aftermath of both men's deaths. In an unforgettable coincidence, Chamberlain passed the following day—meaning both men had died from freak accidents, thousands of miles apart, roughly within 24 hours of each other. This would fuel wild conspiracy theories online for months.

The scene that greeted Kanter was surreal in its intensity. The media had descended on the small Sicilian port with overwhelming force. The hotel where survivors were staying shut down reservations for five days to accommodate the press invasion, says Kanter. Reporters were climbing into ambulances, desperate for any scrap of information. Italian media speculated wildly about encrypted hard drives in the yacht's safe, with tabloids suggesting connections to Western intelligence services. The lack of verifiable information didn't stop the stories: One newspaper made up an interview with Charlotte Golunski, where she'd said she momentarily lost her baby for “two seconds.” In truth, she hadn't spoken to any journalist. In one particularly bizarre moment, while survivors were ensconced at a resort hotel, a 12-foot-tall minion walked by—a jarring reminder that normal life continued even as families dealt with unimaginable loss.

What has emerged through the various investigations, and through press accounts, is a critical flaw in the Bayesian's design.

Even before the bodies were recovered, the blame game began. The yacht's manufacturer initially filed a €222 million claim against Lynch's wife and crew members, though it was quietly withdrawn. Insurance companies began their own investigations, with potentially $150 million in claims at stake. Quickly, Italian prosecutors opened an inquiry, initially focusing on potential charges of negligent shipwreck and manslaughter. Captain Cutfield faced particular scrutiny—questions about the keel position, open hatches, and whether adequate warnings were given. The prosecutors moved swiftly, interviewing everybody during those first five days. Since the boat's party were all witnesses, not subjects, they were required to sit for their interviews, even though they were literally still shaking from their trauma.

The recovery operation took days. Divers worked in dangerous conditions, navigating the yacht's flooded interior to reach the victims. Mike Lynch, the Bloomers, and the Morvillos—Christopher and Neda—were found clustered together in one cabin on the port side, suggesting they had sought shelter together as the yacht went down. Hannah was discovered in another cabin on the same side, by herself.

The following Sunday, townspeople organized a memorial service that culminated in a candlelight vigil where people released wreaths into the water. Still, the boat sat at the bottom of the sea. In May 2025, a Dutch diver working for a company trying to recover the yacht died, adding another life to the toll. Finally, in June, the yacht and mast were recovered and brought to a terminal nearby for further investigation. By this point, the crew had dispersed across the world and have mostly stayed quiet about the event. Griffiths, for his part, still plans on working in the yachting industry.

In July, UK High Court judge Robert Hildyard ruled that Lynch's estate and former Autonomy CFO Sushovan Hussain owed Hewlett-Packard more than £700 million ($940 million) in damages from the Autonomy acquisition. In a postscript to his judgment, Hildyard expressed his “sorrow at this devastating turn of events, and my sympathy and deepest condolences, having come to know and admire Dr Lynch (notwithstanding my findings against him) over the course of a very long trial.” The ruling, which represented a significant reduction from HP's original $4 billion claim, nonetheless reportedly threatened to bankrupt the estate, estimated to be worth around £500 million. Hussain, now out of prison, has started a company to help former criminals find work.

The final reports on the Bayesian sinking have yet to be released. The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch published an interim report in May 2025 that focused on design and environmental vulnerabilities—though Italian prosecutors are separately investigating the captain and two crew members for manslaughter and negligence. What has emerged through the various investigations, and through press accounts, is a critical flaw in the Bayesian's design. The single-mast configuration that gave the yacht her elegant lines—unique among the boat designer's sought-after series of similar vessels—also dangerously affected her center of gravity. The MAIB analysis, conducted by the Wolfson Unit at Southampton, found that with the keel raised and no sails set, the yacht became vulnerable to capsizing in winds exceeding 60 knots—a threshold crossed in seconds when the downburst struck. The other yachts in the same series as the Bayesian had two masts, not one. This problem might have been noticed earlier except for one other factor: Elite luxury yachts don't have to comply with the same robust safety rules as commercial ones. The International Safety Management Code is voluntary for boats registered for private use.

When the downburst struck at 4:06 am, hurricane-force winds exceeding 70 knots hit the Bayesian's towering mast like a lever, causing the yacht to heel hard to starboard. The vessel capsized within 15 seconds and sank in just 18 minutes, settling 50 meters below on the seabed off Porticello, Sicily.

The $40 million Bayesian featured a 72-meter aluminum mast—one of the world's tallest—that gave the 56-meter vessel her elegant profile but created a critical vulnerability. With the keel raised and no sails set, the yacht became vulnerable to capsizing in winds exceeding 60 knots, a threshold crossed when the downburst struck.

What are the odds of all this happening? As I spoke to people about Lynch, I became obsessed with the probability of all these untethered events. I tried to find some way to quantify this. Consider his trajectory: Perhaps only one in 500 working-class boys win elite scholarships; one in 10 of those reach Oxbridge; one in 12 of those earn PhDs; one in 10,000 of those become centimillionaires—multiply it out and you're already at one in 600 million. White-collar defendants are either acquitted or dismissed about 15 percent of the time, but when the CFO is already convicted? Lynch was one of the few CEOs in the past 25 years to walk free from a criminal conviction after his other subordinates had already been convicted. Then that final night: Severe downbursts strike Sicilian anchorages perhaps once every 14 years, but for one just 75 meters wide to bull's-eye a 56-meter yacht while missing the schooner 100 meters away? Probably on the order of once in 2,300 years. And Stephen Chamberlain—a jogger's daily risk of fatal collision is about one in 9 million; multiply by Lynch's yacht-disaster probability and you get roughly one in 760 billion for both dying the same day.

But if you look at things from a different angle, not everything seems up to chance. Lynch was an unruly thinker from his college days and a perfectionist boss who pushed everyone around him to their limits; was it inevitable that he would end up in court eventually, defending his risky decisions? In the same way, the Bayesian's flaw is the most obvious thing about it. Standing at 72 meters, the aluminum mast was about as tall as the wingspan of a jumbo jet. The physics were baked into the design. Of all the events in Mike Lynch's improbable life, his death turned on something that was, actually, quite knowable.

When treating severe burns and trauma, skin regeneration can be a matter of life or death. Extensive burns are usually treated by transplanting a thin layer of epidermis, the top layer of skin, from elsewhere on the body. However, this method not only leaves large scars, it also does not restore the skin to its original functional state. Unless the dermis, the layer below the epidermis, which contains blood vessels and nerves, is regenerated, it cannot be considered normal living skin.

Now, work by Swedish researchers may have brought medicine closer to being able to regenerate living skin. They have developed two types of 3D bioprinting techniques to artificially generate thick skin that is vascularized, meaning it contains blood vessels. One technique produces skin that is packed with cells, and the other produces arbitrarily shaped blood vessels in the tissue. The two technologies take different approaches to the same challenge. The approaches have been outlined in two studies published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.

“The dermis is so complicated that we can't grow it in a lab. We don't even know what all its components are,” said Johan Junker, an associate professor at Linköping University and specialist in plastic surgery who lead this work, in a statement. “That's why we, and many others, think that we could possibly transplant the building blocks and then let the body make the dermis itself.”

The Linköping team using a 3D bioprinter.

Junker and his team designed a bio-ink called “μInk” in which fibroblasts—cells that produce dermal components such as collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid—are cultured on the surface of small spongy gelatin grains and encased in a hyaluronic acid gel. By building up this ink three-dimensionally using a 3D printer, they were able to create a skin structure filled with high-density cells at will.

In a transplantation experiment using mice, the researchers confirmed that living cells grew inside tissue fragments made from this ink, secreting collagen and rebuilding the components of the dermis. New blood vessels also grew inside the graft, indicating that the conditions for long-term tissue fixation were met.

Blood vessels play an extremely important role in the construction of artificial tissues. No matter how many cells are cultured to create a tissue model, without blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients cannot be carried evenly to all cells. And without blood vessels, as the tissue structure grows, the cells in the center of the tissue die.

The research team has also created a technology called REFRESH (Rerouting of Free-Floating Suspended Hydrogel Filaments), which enables the flexible construction of blood vessels in artificial tissues by printing and arranging threads of hydrogel, a gels that 98 percent water. These threads are much tougher than ordinary gel materials and can maintain their shape even when tied or braided. Moreover, they also have shape-memory properties that allow them to return to their original shape even when crushed.

A hydrogel thread made using the REFRESH technology.

Notably, these threads can be disassembled without leaving any trace by the action of a specific enzyme. When the hydrogel threads placed in the tissue disappear, only a long, thin cavity remains in their original place. By using this as a flow channel equivalent to a blood vessel, a network of blood vessels can be freely formed inside artificially created tissue. By integrating these two technologies, it could be possible to incorporate a freely designed network of blood vessels into the thick, cell-filled artificial skin, allowing oxygen and nutrients to reach every nook and cranny.

The researchers also succeeded in constructing a complex 3D network by forming the hydrogel threads into knots or braids. In the future, they hope to combine this with technology to automate such operations, thereby realizing a method to efficiently stretch a network of blood vessels throughout an artificial organ.

There remain many uncertainties in the wound environment, such as how to avoid inflammation and bacterial infection, and careful verification of these techniques will be needed to bridge the gap between these results obtained in the laboratory and rolling out these techniques in clinical practice. Nevertheless, in the future these technologies may represent a breakthrough in solving long-standing problems in regenerative medicine.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Microsoft President Brad Smith continued his critique of state and local policymakers in Washington, warning that a tax-first agenda risks undermining the region's economic foundation. 

Speaking at the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber's annual meeting Tuesday, Smith echoed comments he has made in other public forums this year, calling out Washington's approach to taxation and lamenting what he described as a disappearance of economic development from the political agenda.

“In the last couple of years, I feel that people — especially in Olympia and to some degree in western Washington — have forgotten you can't have a healthy community if you don't have healthy businesses,” he said in a fireside chat with Teresa Hutson, a corporate vice president at Microsoft and incoming board chair at the Chamber. 

Smith's message on Tuesday was a call to action for business leaders and nonprofits in Microsoft's home state to push back against what he said was a “constant quest to find new taxes.”

“Look behind you. There's no cavalry coming,” Smith said. “If we're going to win this fight, we're going to need to fight it ourselves. We're going to need to rally. We're going to need to marshal resources.”

He pledged that Microsoft would provide financial support “for the kind of education campaign that this state needs to understand what the business community requires in order to be prosperous.”

Smith has previously criticized tax and budget proposals from Washington lawmakers this year, including a payroll tax on large employers that ultimately did not pass. Microsoft spent more than $1 million on political action committees during this year's legislative session.

The state — which does not have an income tax — did approve several new business taxes this year, including the expansion of the retail sales tax to a broader range of digital and professional services, as well as an increase in a computing surcharge paid by major tech companies such as Microsoft and Amazon and an increase to the capital gains tax. A wealth tax proposal was not approved.

Smith cited the state's new estate tax laws, saying that family businesses “will not be able to stay here if the estate tax remains where it is.”

The longtime Microsoft leader pointed to the company's philanthropic efforts and donations as evidence illustrate that businesses contribute to local communities beyond tax payments.

“People who think that the only thing that businesses do for the greater good is pay taxes are missing what's going on here,” he said.

Washington ranked No. 14 overall on on CNBC's latest list of top states for business — coming in 48th for “cost of doing business” but 4th for technology and innovation.

Smith cautioned that the state's success should not be taken for granted, saying progress for communities and cities is not always linear. He argued that Washington is at a “critical moment.”

“We're all in this together,” he said. “If we can't sustain economic development, if we can't sustain a healthy business community, we will not have a strong economy. And if we do not have a strong economy, none of the other aspirations that people have will be realizable.”

 September 10, 2025  

It's a no-brainer that patients are on the internet, and it's not all funny cat videos, restaurant recommendations, and career-related searches. Nearly 6 in 10 use the internet to search for medical and health information , according to the CDC. That includes the majority of your patients.

“Patients often arrive having researched symptoms online or even self-diagnosed. They may cite TikTok, something they read on Facebook, or medical websites,” said Victor Ajluni, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University and emergency psychiatrist at Detroit Receiving Hospital, both in Detroit, Michigan. “It's a shift from passive reception of care to active engagement. That's a good thing — but it requires a lot more skill and nuance on the clinician's end.”

In fact, patients have never been as informed as they are today. But are they well informed? Or misinformed? The preponderance and availability of medical and health information is one reason patients are more vocal and more involved in their care decisions. Patients know more and, in turn, expect more from their care providers — and they're more empowered than ever before.

However, accompanying that autonomy can be patient anxiety and uncertainty.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Female Physician Career Tracks Report 2024 found that

“Patient autonomy is the principle that patients have the right to make informed choices about their own healthcare,” Ajluni told Medscape Medical News. “It's not simply about saying ‘yes' or ‘no' to treatment — it's about understanding their values, goals, and fears and empowering them to participate meaningfully in decisions about their care. True autonomy is informed, supported, and situated in a relationship of trust.”

“The historical way of practicing medicine in the 50s, 60s, and 70s was very authoritarian…but the medical establishment realized that patients do better and are more compliant when they're involved in their medical decision-making,” said Brandon Hirsch, MD , a board-certified, dual fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon at Disc Sports and Spine Center in Newport Beach, California, who started his practice in 2019.

“I've practiced this way the entire time…,” Hirsch said, adding that the psychological aspects of the patient-surgeon relationship is very important.

“My time is really spent educating the patient about what the problem is and what the options are,” said Hirsch. “I want patients to be invested in the decision because I think it leads to more satisfied patients and better outcomes. It's something I've always done.”

There may also be aspects of correcting misinformation, easing anxiety, talking patients down, or convincing them they don't have or need something that their online information has convinced them they do.

Patient autonomy starts with building rapport. Asking open-ended questions and listening to the answers can provide insight into your patient. “For example, if the patient asks, ‘what is recovery like after surgery?' that's kind of vague. I'll say, ‘tell me specifically what you mean by that,'” said Hirsch. “You really want to individualize the concepts and the answers. That goes a long way to developing shared decision-making because people like to get what they're looking for.”

“There is an acquired skill to building rapport and getting them [patients] to trust you,” said Brian T. Garibaldi , MD, MEHP, director, Center for Bedside Medicine, and a professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “There's no substitute to sitting down and saying, ‘tell me what's important to you…' or ‘what are you most concerned with?'”

While medicine has made huge advancements in diagnostic tools and treatment options, “when it comes down to navigating underneath and making decisions and helping someone navigate their health journey, the only way to help them meaningfully is to get to know them, and know where their values, goals, and preferences are,” added Hirsch. “It really does come down to making the most of your time and directing attention to who is this person as an individual, not only what is the disease and what is the disease process.”

There can also be a downside to being well informed. “Many patients feel overwhelmed, not reassured, by what they find online. There is a lot of misinformation,” said Ajluni. “A common theme is catastrophizing — believing the worst-case scenario is the most likely…. Transparency and structure can calm that anxiety. I also name the dynamic — telling patients that anxiety tends to escalate when we try to self-diagnose from fragmented or extreme online content. A little reassurance can go a long way.

“Being dismissive is the worst thing you can do,” agreed Hirsch. “You need to validate their concerns and address them.”

Patient autonomy doesn't mean acquiescing when a patient demands a treatment that you know to be harmful or that is against the standard of care. But in many cases, there is not one “right” option. “Even as far as we've advanced in the last 100 years in terms of diagnostics and treatment, there is a still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to complex medical decision-making,” said Garibaldi.

“We've started to talk openly about that with trainees and with patients…the only way to make a decision is to engage the patient, understand their goals and values, understand how they weigh the risks and benefits....”

“I've been in clinical practice, since 2000, and the more I've done this, the more I've realized there really is no best solution to a particular problem,” Garibaldi said. “There isn't always a right answer. Make sure that when you're making diagnoses and choosing treatment options, you remember that the ‘right' answer depends on who the person is. And the only way to get there is by partnering with the patient.”

More and more doctors are embracing the idea that a partnership that supports patient autonomy leads to better outcomes. “Early in training, I thought clinical authority meant always having the right answer and steering patients firmly. But I've learned that real authority comes from humility and dialogue,” said Ajluni.

“I'd advise younger physicians to practice curiosity as much as clarity. We don't know everything, and we certainly can't without asking questions. Ask patients what they've read, what they're worried about, what outcomes matter most to them,” he added.

“Autonomy isn't about letting patients ‘do whatever they want' — it's about making decisions together in a context of respect. People are more likely to listen to medical advice if they are part of the process.”

In a move that could reshape drug discovery, researchers at Harvard Medical School have designed an artificial intelligence model capable of identifying treatments that reverse disease states in cells.

Unlike traditional approaches that typically test one protein target or drug at a time in hopes of identifying an effective treatment, the new model, called PDGrapher and available for free, focuses on multiple drivers of disease and identifies the genes most likely to revert diseased cells back to healthy function.

The tool also identifies the best single or combined targets for treatments that correct the disease process. The work, described Sept. 9 in Nature Biomedical Engineering, was supported in part by federal funding.

By zeroing in on the targets most likely to reverse disease, the new approach could speed up drug discovery and design and unlock therapies for conditions that have long eluded traditional methods, the researchers noted.

Traditional drug discovery resembles tasting hundreds of prepared dishes to find one that happens to taste perfect. PDGrapher works like a master chef who understands what they want the dish to be and exactly how to combine ingredients to achieve the desired flavor."

Marinka Zitnik, study senior author, associate professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS

The traditional drug-discovery approach - which focuses on activating or inhibiting a single protein - has succeeded with treatments such as kinase inhibitors, drugs that block certain proteins used by cancer cells to grow and divide. However, Zitnik noted, this discovery paradigm can fall short when diseases are fueled by the interplay of multiple signaling pathways and genes. For example, many breakthrough drugs discovered in recent decades - think immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapies - work by targeting disease processes in cells.

The approach enabled by PDGrapher, Zitnik said, looks at the bigger picture to find compounds that can actually reverse signs of disease in cells, even if scientists don't yet know exactly which molecules those compounds may be acting on.

PDGrapher is a type of artificial intelligence tool called a graph neural network. This tool doesn't just look at individual data points but at the connections that exist between these data points and the effects they have on one another. 

In the context of biology and drug discovery, this approach is used to map the relationship between various genes, proteins, and signaling pathways inside cells and predict the best combination of therapies that would correct the underlying dysfunction of a cell to restore healthy cell behavior. Instead of exhaustively testing compounds from large drug databases, the new model focuses on drug combinations that are most likely to reverse disease.

PDGrapher points to parts of the cell that might be driving disease. Next, it simulates what happens if these cellular parts were turned off or dialed down. The AI model then offers an answer as to whether a diseased cell would happen if certain targets were "hit."

"Instead of testing every possible recipe, PDGrapher asks: 'Which mix of ingredients will turn this bland or overly salty dish into a perfectly balanced meal?'" Zitnik said.

The researchers trained the tool on a dataset of diseased cells before and after treatment so that it could figure out which genes to target to shift cells from a diseased state to a healthy one.

Next, they tested it on 19 datasets spanning 11 types of cancer, using both genetic and drug-based experiments, asking the tool to predict various treatment options for cell samples it had not seen before and for cancer types it had not encountered.

The tool accurately predicted drug targets already known to work but that were deliberately excluded during training to ensure the model did not simply recall the right answers. It also identified additional candidates supported by emerging evidence. The model also highlighted KDR (VEGFR2) as a target for non-small cell lung cancer, aligning with clinical evidence. It also identified TOP2A - an enzyme already targeted by approved chemotherapies - as a treatment target in certain tumors, adding to evidence from recent preclinical studies that TOP2A inhibition may be used to curb the spread of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer.

The model showed superior accuracy and efficiency, compared with other similar tools. In previously unseen datasets, it ranked the correct therapeutic targets up to 35 percent higher than other models did and delivered results up to 25 times faster than comparable AI approaches.

The new approach could optimize the way new drugs are designed, the researchers said. This is because instead of trying to predict how every possible change would affect a cell and then looking for a useful drug, PDGrapher right away seeks which specific targets can reverse a disease trait. This makes it faster to test ideas and lets researchers focus on fewer promising targets.

This tool could be especially useful for complex diseases fueled by multiple pathways, such as cancer, in which tumors can outsmart drugs that hit just one target. Because PDGrapher identifies multiple targets involved in a disease, it could help circumvent this problem.

Additionally, the researchers said that after careful testing to validate the model, it could one day be used to analyze a patient's cellular profile and help design individualized treatment combinations.

Finally, because PDGrapher identifies cause-effect biological drivers of disease, it could help researchers understand why certain drug combinations work - offering new biological insights that could propel biomedical discovery even further.

The team is currently using this model to tackle brain diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, looking at how cells behave in disease and spotting genes that could help restore them to health. The researchers are also collaborating with colleagues at the Center for XDP at Massachusetts General Hospital to identify new drug targets and map which genes or pairs of genes could be affected by treatments for X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism, a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder.

"Our ultimate goal is to create a clear road map of possible ways to reverse disease at the cellular level," Zitnik said.

A UK trial shows drones can deliver defibrillators faster than ambulances, but survival depends on better dispatcher guidance and bystander confidence in using the life-saving devices.

Drones can capture breathtaking photos, patrol and monitor sensitive or dangerous areas, and deliver medical equipment or medication. One such use is to provide automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to help resuscitate cardiac arrest patients before they reach the hospital. A recent paper in Resuscitation Plus examines how drones help in this emergency response.

Nine out of ten people who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) die before being discharged from the hospital or within 30 days of the arrest. The chances of survival and of neurological recovery are doubled if bystanders can provide prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use an automated external defibrillator (AED) to get the heart beating again.

The issues with bystander AED defibrillation include not being able to find, access, and retrieve an AED from a public location. In an earlier study, only 5%- 22% of people knew where to find the nearest public AED. Many AEDs are difficult to reach (up to 59%), and only 3%- 25% of OHCAs occur in the vicinity of an AED.

Drones could reduce the time required to get an AED to the OHCA patient compared to an ambulance. Drones are also user-friendly. The authors of the current study have already demonstrated these aspects in their earlier research.

However, that study showed that call handlers needed more support. The present study sought to understand the chief problems reducing the effectiveness of bystander AED use on the OHCA scene.

The researchers simulated an OHCA scene beginning with a call to 999 for emergency help. This was followed by the dispatch of a drone that could perform autonomous flight “Beyond Visual Line of Sight” (BVLOS) to the location of interest.

The drone operator was in touch in real time with the call handler, passing on the drone's progress. Participants were recruited for the capability to perform CPR or use an AED outdoors, but recent training varied, and many struggled with AED use. Only 64% had CPR training in the past five years, and just 36% had AED training. The experience was assessed using video recordings, audio recordings of the emergency call, and post-simulation interviews.



a) drone at remote site with AED loaded, b) emergency call made (study team member shown), c) drone on-scene winching AED to ground, d) drone departs and bystander informed it is safe to retrieve AED on ground. 

Out of 11 single-bystander OHCA simulations, most participants were male with a median age of 62. Only one had used an AED in real life to help an OHCA patient.

An AED was delivered on nine occasions by drones. The median simulation time was 9:13 minutes, from placing the emergency call to resuming CPR after delivering an AED shock.

The call to allocation took a median of 1:28, allocation to take-off 0:49, and call to take-off 2:18. The first shock was delivered after another 4:35 minutes (median) from when the drone arrived at the scene. This was while the AED was being winched down, disconnected from the winch, and the subsequent departure of the drone. This was the “safe to approach AED” point, when the would-be rescuer left the patient to retrieve and bring the AED to the patient.  

This meant a hands-off period (when the patient did not receive CPR) of 2:32 minutes. Of this, 16 seconds went to retrieving and bringing back the device. The rest of this delay was in extracting the AED from the carry case, attaching it to the patient, and delivering the shock.

It was relatively easy to retrieve the AED device, and the sight or sound of the drone did not distract from CPR performance. Participants sometimes found it hard to hear the call handler clearly, especially as the drone approached. Moreover, this loss of clarity increased hands-off CPR time while the bystander tried to listen or clarify instructions about the location of the incident or the CPR procedure, for instance.

The most significant difficulty occurred when removing the AED from the carry case,  which participants felt was unusual and challenging to use. Bystanders felt the AED winch was too slow and unnecessarily prolonged the wait for AED use.

Conflicting AED and call handler instructions created serious problems. The call handlers did not provide instructions specific to the device or monitor correct AED use. The bystanders did not hesitate to retrieve the drone, but were often not confident about using it. In fact, two bystanders did not attach the AED to the patient.

The study showed that autonomous BVLOS flights of an AED-carrying drone to a simulated OHCA scene are feasible. The observations show how the pilot-call handler conversation delivers timely help to the site through the AED. However, bystanders often struggle to manage the call handler's instructions and CPR.

The drone was deployed rapidly, but there was an additional delay at the scene: about 4.35 minutes from arrival to deliver the shock. This led to a total CPR stoppage of 2.32 minutes.

“Bystanders and call-handlers need more support to effectively use drone-delivered AEDs.” This aspect of call-handler training should receive as much or more attention as AED delivery itself. Call-handlers are often unsure how far CPR may be paused and how to help the bystanders use the AED.

The authors focused on a single-bystander scenario; given that only 16 seconds were spent away from the patients to fetch the AED, this use case may be acceptable.

Most importantly, studies must show that such interventions improve patient survival. Further research is needed in multiple fields, including how to integrate drone-delivered medical equipment into local emergency medical services and script responses for a more standardized help protocol, especially considering the need to guide bystanders in AED use.

Key limitations include operational challenges such as weather and technical cancellations, connectivity failures that forced the auto-returns, and the slow AED winch design. Regulatory approval and safety oversight, such as from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, will remain essential.

Neurological diseases affect millions worldwide, and the need for long-term patient-friendly treatments has never been greater. While needle-based injections are the standard for most therapies, regular drug injections can often be painful and inconvenient. Microneedles-which are tiny, micron-sized needle systems- have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional needles and offer a pain free way to deliver medicines. However, most existing microneedles are rigid and can cause discomfort during prolonged use and therefore limits their adoption in long-term use.

To overcome this, researchers from South Korea have designed a new microneedles system inspired by the natural mechanism of a bee sting. Led by Professor Wonku Kang and colleague Dr. Sohee Jeon from the College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University in collaboration with Dr. Jun-Ho Jeong from College of Medicine at Chung-Ang University, the team introduces wearable "Electrospun Web Microneedle (EW-MNs)" based patches which enable long-term and continuous drug delivery through the skin. The study was made available online in Advanced Healthcare Materials on July 31, 2025.

Unlike traditional rigid microneedles, which can cause irritation during prolonged use, our EW-MNs are soft, breathable, and remain anchored to the skin just like a bee stinger."

Professor Wonku Kang, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University

To fabricate the EW-MNs, the researchers used an electrospinning process (a technique that uses an electric field to spin very fine polymer fibers) to create a web of nanoscale fibers on metal microneedles. This resulted in a fibrous layer around the microneedle tips which mimic the barbed structure of a bee sting. As a result, the microneedles anchor securely into the skin and ensure a steady attachment for continuous drug release. The EW-MNs were then attached to an adhesive tape and a backing layer to form a patch.

To test the efficacy of the patch, the team loaded the EW-MNs with rivastigmine (a drug commonly used to treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease). In animal studies using guinea pigs, the microneedle patches significantly improved the absorption of rivastigmine- releasing over twice the drug and covering a five-fold larger area compared to conventional approaches. Importantly, all this was achieved while maintaining minimum discomfort, and even if any mild skin irritation occurred, it disappeared quickly on removing the patch.

Emphasizing on the impact of this technology, Prof. Kang says "With further development, these EW-MNs could revolutionize drug delivery, allowing patients to receive effective long-term treatments without the fear or discomfort of needles!"

In the future, the team aims to extend the applications of EW-MNs beyond neurological diseases, offering medicated patches for a wide range of other chronic diseases. This approach also holds value for elderly patients, children and cases where safety and patient compliant treatments are urgently needed. Overall, the study demonstrates a perfect example of how nature can drive innovations, bringing us one step closer towards safer, more comfortable, and patient-friendly drug delivery.

Using tiny particles shaped like bottlebrushes, MIT chemists have found a way to deliver a large range of chemotherapy drugs directly to tumor cells.

To guide them to the right location, each particle contains an antibody that targets a specific tumor protein. This antibody is tethered to bottlebrush-shaped polymer chains carrying dozens or hundreds of drug molecules - a much larger payload than can be delivered by any existing antibody-drug conjugates.

In mouse models of breast and ovarian cancer, the researchers found that treatment with these conjugated particles could eliminate most tumors. In the future, the particles could be modified to target other types of cancer, by swapping in different antibodies.

We are excited about the potential to open up a new landscape of payloads and payload combinations with this technology, that could ultimately provide more effective therapies for cancer patients."

Jeremiah Johnson, the A. Thomas Geurtin Professor of Chemistry at MIT, member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and senior author of the new study

MIT postdoc Bin Liu is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Biotechnology.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a promising type of cancer treatment that consist of a cancer-targeting antibody attached to a chemotherapy drug. At least 15 ADCs have been approved by the FDA to treat several different types of cancer.

This approach allows specific targeting of a cancer drug to a tumor, which helps to prevent some of the side effects that occur when chemotherapy drugs are given intravenously. However, one drawback to currently approved ADCs is that only a handful of drug molecules can be attached to each antibody. That means they can only be used with very potent drugs - usually DNA-damaging agents or drugs that interfere with cell division.

To try to use a broader range of drugs, which are often less potent, Johnson and his colleagues decided to adapt bottlebrush particles that they had previously invented. These particles consist of a polymer backbone that are attached to tens to hundreds of "prodrug" molecules - inactive drug molecules that are activated upon release within the body. This structure allows the particles to deliver a wide range of drug molecules, and the particles can be designed to carry multiple drugs in specific ratios.

Using a technique called click chemistry, the researchers showed that they could attach one, two, or three of their bottlebrush polymers to a single tumor-targeting antibody, creating an antibody-bottlebrush conjugate (ABC). This means that just one antibody can carry hundreds of prodrug molecules. The currently approved ADCs can carry a maximum of about eight drug molecules.

The huge number of payloads in the ABC particles allows the researchers to incorporate less potent cancer drugs such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel, which enhances the customizability of the particles and the variety of drug combinations that can be used.

"We can use antibody-bottlebrush conjugates to increase the drug loading, and in that case, we can use less potent drugs," Liu says. "In the future, we can very easily copolymerize with multiple drugs together to achieve combination therapy."

The prodrug molecules are attached to the polymer backbone by cleavable linkers. After the particles reach a tumor site, some of these linkers are broken right away, allowing the drugs to kill nearby cancer cells even if they don't express the target antibody. Other particles are absorbed into cells with the target antibody before releasing their toxic payload.

For this study, the researchers created ABC particles carrying a few different types of drugs: microtubule inhibitors called MMAE and paclitaxel, and two DNA-damaging agents, doxorubicin and SN-38. They also designed ABC particles carrying an experimental type of drug known as PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera), which can selectively degrade disease-causing proteins inside cells.

Each bottlebrush was tethered to an antibody targeting either HER2, a protein often overexpressed in breast cancer, or MUC1, which is commonly found in ovarian, lung, and other types of cancer.

The researchers tested each of the ABCs in mouse models of breast or ovarian cancer and found that in most cases, the ABC particles were able to eradicate the tumors. This treatment was significantly more effective than giving the same bottlebrush prodrugs by injection, without being conjugated to a targeting antibody.

"We used a very low dose, almost 100 times lower compared to the traditional small-molecule drug, and the ABC still can achieve much better efficacy compared to the small-molecule drug given on its own," Liu says.

These ABCs also performed better than two FDA-approved ADCs, T-DXd and TDM-1, which both use HER2 to target cells. T-DXd carries deruxtecan, which interferes with DNA replication, and TDM-1 carries emtansine, a microtubule inhibitor.

In future work, the MIT team plans to try delivering combinations of drugs that work by different mechanisms, which could enhance their overall effectiveness. Among these could be immunotherapy drugs such as STING activators.

The researchers are also working on swapping in different antibodies, such as antibodies targeting EGFR, which is widely expressed in many tumors. More than 100 antibodies have been approved to treat cancer and other diseases, and in theory any of those could be conjugated to cancer drugs to create a targeted therapy.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 8 of Aging-US on August 1, 2025, titled "Causal relationships between gut microbiome and hundreds of age-related traits: evidence of a replicable effect on ApoM protein levels."

In this study, Federica Grosso, Daniela Zanetti, and Serena Sanna from the Institute for Genetic and Biomedical Research (IRGB) of the National Research Council (CNR), Italy, uncovered new associations between gut microbiome and the aging process. The researchers found that certain microbial characteristics may causally influence proteins in the blood linked to inflammation and heart health. These findings could help explain how age-related diseases like cardiovascular conditions and macular degeneration are influenced by changes in the gut ecosystem.

The gut microbiome, the collection of microorganisms living in the digestive system, plays a major role in immune function and metabolic health. As people age, this microbial community shifts, often leading to imbalances associated with inflammation and chronic disease. To explore how these changes might affect the body, the researchers used Mendelian Randomization-a method that leverages genetic data-to test over 55,000 possible causal connections between gut microbial characteristics and age-related health indicators.

The study identified 91 significant causal relationships. Among them, the researchers found that higher levels of certain gut bacteria were associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. Another finding was the association between a metabolic pathway in the gut, called "purine nucleotides degradation II," and lower levels of apolipoprotein M (ApoM), a protein that helps protect against heart disease. This result was validated using data from an independent study, strengthening the evidence.

"Unlike previous studies, we performed replication analyses for the significant results using independent GWAS datasets, a fundamental step that has often been overlooked."

The study also revealed how some bacteria may affect protein levels differently depending on a person's blood type. Specifically, in individuals with blood type A, certain gut microbes that can break down a sugar called GalNAc may influence proteins related to inflammation and cardiovascular health. This suggests that personalized approaches to managing age-related diseases could consider both gut microbiota and genetic factors like blood type.

The research team followed strict guidelines to reduce false findings and confirmed its key results in independent datasets. By carefully testing for reverse causality and other biases, the authors provided strong evidence that the gut microbiome can influence critical aspects of aging biology.

Although more research is needed to fully understand the biological pathways involved, these findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiota might help delay or reduce age-related inflammation and disease. The study lays a foundation for future therapeutic strategies that could include diet, probiotics, or other microbiome-based interventions.

Preliminary findings from a new clinical trial show no adverse neurodevelopmental effects after brief inhaled anesthesia and surgery in infants and young children, reports the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the peer-reviewed medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). 

A "balanced" strategy using a lower dose of the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane did not lead to meaningful short-term differences in IQ or child behavior problems, according to the study by Ji-Hyun Lee, M.D., Ph.D., of Seoul National University Hospital, Republic of Korea, and colleagues. "These findings support existing evidence suggesting that brief anesthetic exposure is unlikely to result in clinically significant neurodevelopmental impairment," the researchers wrote. 

Animal studies have raised concerns about possible neurotoxic effects of general anesthetic or sedative drugs in young children. In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings in 2017 that long-lasting or repeated exposure to these drugs "may negatively affect brain development in children younger than 3 years." 

Randomized clinical trials – in which participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups – are the best way to assess these safety concerns. One previous randomized trial (the GAS study) found normal neurodevelopmental outcomes in children receiving sevoflurane. However, that study was published several years ago and evaluated an alternative approach (awake regional anesthesia) that is not widely available. 

To address this research gap, Dr. Lee and colleagues designed a clinical trial including 400 children under two years of age undergoing one-time surgery with general anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to anesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane alone or a balanced strategy using an intravenous sedative (dexmedetomidine) and a short-acting opioid (remifentanil). The balanced strategy was designed to reduce the amount of sevoflurane needed to maintain anesthesia during surgery. In both groups, anesthesia exposure was brief, with surgery lasting less than 90 minutes. 

When the patients were approximately 30 months old, the researchers assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes using a nonverbal intelligence test and a parent-reported child behavior scale. If outcomes were better with the balanced strategy, it could mean that the lower dose of sevoflurane was less neurotoxic. The analysis included complete data on 343 children. 

The results showed little or no difference in outcomes for children receiving sevoflurane alone compared to the balanced strategy. Overall IQ and behavioral scores were similar between the groups. Measures of language development were comparable as well. 

Although the balanced approach "effectively reduced sevoflurane requirements during surgery, it did not provide measurable developmental advantages," Dr. Lee and coauthors wrote. They emphasize that their results are preliminary; final results will include long-term follow-up at five years old, including full-scale IQ assessment. In the meantime, the findings provide reassurance that one-time general anesthesia does not adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and young children who require surgery. 

The new study is "a welcome and important addition" in an area where definitive evidence is difficult to obtain, according to an accompanying editorial by Andrew Davidson, MBBS, M.D., and Caleb Ing, M.D., MS. They discuss the challenges of studying this complex issue – including the fact that children who require surgery may have other health issues affecting neurodevelopmental outcomes. 

As anesthesiologists and parents await the results of long-term follow-up and future clinical trials, the new findings "are incredibly helpful in consolidating knowledge" on the safety of inhaled anesthesia in young children, Drs. Davidson and Ing wrote. They conclude: "The lack of an effect of differing sevoflurane dose on neurodevelopment may argue against sevoflurane being a cause of neurotoxicity."

Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes around 70% of head and neck cancers in the United States, making it the most common cancer caused by the virus, with rates increasing each year. Unlike cervical cancers caused by HPV, there is no screening test for HPV-associated head and neck cancers. This means that patients are usually diagnosed after a tumor has grown to billions of cells in size, causing symptoms and spreading to lymph nodes. Screening methods that can detect these cancers much earlier could mean earlier treatment interventions for patients. 

In a new federally funded study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Mass General Brigham researchers show that a novel liquid biopsy tool they developed, called HPV-DeepSeek, can identify HPV-associated head and neck cancer up to 10 years before symptoms appear. By catching cancers earlier with this novel test, patients may experience higher treatment success and require a less intense regimen, according to the authors. 

Our study shows for the first time that we can accurately detect HPV-associated cancers in asymptomatic individuals many years before they are ever diagnosed with cancer. By the time patients enter our clinics with symptoms from the cancer, they require treatments that cause significant, life-long side effects. We hope tools like HPV-DeepSeek will allow us to catch these cancers at their very earliest stages, which ultimately can improve patient outcomes and quality of life." 

Daniel L. Faden, MD, FACS, lead study author, head and neck surgical oncologist and principal investigator in the Mike Toth Head and Neck Cancer Research Center at Mass Eye and Ear

HPV-DeepSeek uses whole-genome sequencing to detect microscopic fragments of HPV DNA that have broken off from a tumor and entered the bloodstream. Previous research from this team showed the test could achieve 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity for diagnosing cancer at the first time of presentation to a clinic, outperforming current testing methods. 

To determine whether HPV-DeepSeek could detect HPV-associated head and neck cancer long before diagnosis, researchers tested 56 samples from the Mass General Brigham Biobank: 28 from individuals who went on to develop HPV-associated head and neck cancer years later, and 28 from healthy controls. 

HPV-DeepSeek detected HPV tumor DNA in 22 out of 28 blood samples from patients who later developed the cancer, whereas all 28 control samples tested negative, indicating that the test is highly specific. The test was better able to detect HPV DNA in blood samples that were collected closer to the time of the patients' diagnosis, and the earliest positive result was for a blood sample collected 7.8 years prior to diagnosis. 

Using machine learning, the researchers were able to improve the test's power so that it accurately identified 27 out of 28 cancer cases, including samples collected up to 10 years prior to diagnosis. 

The authors are now validating these findings in a second blinded study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) using hundreds of samples collected as part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) at the National Cancer Institute.

Animal studies suggest CoQ10 protects memory and learning, but human evidence remains inconsistent, highlighting the urgent need for rigorous trials to determine its role in preventing cognitive decline.



Coenzyme Q10 and Cognition: A Review. Image Credit: Svetlyachock / Shutterstock

CoQ10 is most concentrated in energy-demanding organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, where up to 95% of the body's energy needs are met through its mitochondrial role.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, Australian researchers reviewed the effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on cognition. Approximately 22% of the world's population is estimated to be 60 years or older by 2050. Accompanying this change will be an increase in people with cognitive decline and the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. The causes of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline are multifactorial, but the major contributors are oxidative stress, inflammation, poor cardiovascular health, decreased cerebral blood flow, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

These multiple processes in the body and brain require various targeted therapeutic approaches. Various approaches to addressing age-related cognitive decline have been employed, including dietary modifications, physical activity, medications, and nutritional supplements. CoQ10 is an antioxidant and metabolic stimulant that positively influences biological mechanisms relevant to cognition, with mixed effects on cognitive test performance in trials. In the present study, researchers reviewed the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on cognition.

The molecule exists in three redox states, ubiquinone, semiquinone, and ubiquinol, which allow it to act both as an electron carrier in energy production and as a free radical scavenger.

CoQ10 plays a major role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by transporting electrons from Complexes I and II to Complex III in the electron transport chain. Its bioavailability differs between formulations such as ubiquinone and ubiquinol, which may influence clinical outcomes. In a clinical trial, preoperative CoQ10 therapy in patients scheduled for an elective heart surgery increased cardiac and myocardial mitochondrial CoQ10 levels, improving the efficiency of energy production.

A meta-analysis of trials of CoQ10 treatment in heart failure indicated that CoQ10 supplementation enhanced ejection fraction by 3.67% and reduced the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class by 0.3. A study reported that long-term CoQ10 therapy was safe, alleviated symptoms, and reduced adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic heart failure.

Dietary sources such as organ meats, fatty fish, and seed oils are rich in CoQ10, while vegetables and fruits generally contain much lower amounts, with avocado being a notable exception.

A study in mice investigated whether CoQ10 supplementation slows age-related cognitive decline compared to a regular diet. Although no significant performance improvements were observed in a test measuring learning and spatial memory, CoQ10 levels were significantly elevated within the cortex. Another study examined the combined effects of CoQ10 and vitamin E, and found benefits of the combination treatment on learning in aged mice.

In a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CoQ10 therapy improved memory, retention, and learning, with substantial decreases in oxidative stress and increases in ATP levels within the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, another study reported improved learning and memory with CoQ10 treatment in rats with cognitive dysfunction.

One study examined the relationship between AD and CoQ10 in genetically modified mice and found that CoQ10 administration altered the expression of 12 proteins in the hippocampus and improved spatial memory in genetically modified mice with AD. Specifically, the overexpression of complexin 1 (CPLX-1) and CPLX-2 following CoQ10 therapy prevented memory impairments.

Furthermore, CoQ10 therapy significantly improved cognitive functions in a double-transgenic mouse model, preventing AD progression through decreased inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as the activation of autophagy. CoQ10 supplementation improved short-term memory impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, and the effect was further enhanced in combination with wheatgrass, sesamol, and thymol.

Although widely sold as a dietary supplement, CoQ10 is not FDA-approved for treating any medical condition, and product quality can vary significantly between brands.

Research on the cognitive effects of CoQ10 supplements in healthy people is limited, with only two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted to date. One trial assessed the impact of a low-dose CoQ10 in combination with mineral and multivitamin supplements in healthy females. Cerebral blood flow was significantly increased during cognitive tasks in the treatment group, albeit task performance showed no changes.

The other trial found no significant differences in the digit symbol substitution test, the trail making test, and the memory performance index (MPI) in people taking ubiquinol (reduced form of CoQ10). Notably, people who were cognitively normal at baseline showed significant improvements in MPI following 34 weeks of ubiquinol supplementation. The review emphasized that these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to dose, formulation, and statistical limitations. In AD, CoQ10 treatment had no detectable effects on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, suggesting no effects on cognition.

In individuals with mild cognitive impairment, a one-year supplementation with ubiquinol improved cerebral vasoreactivity and reduced inflammation in males, with no changes in cognition observed in either sex. Furthermore, RCTs of the combined CoQ10 and vitamin E treatment reported no improvements in cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's disease.

One study reported that CoQ10 supplementation improved cognitive function, reduced fatigue symptoms, enhanced working memory, and improved arithmetic task performance in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. In a study of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, CoQ10 administration improved cognitive tasks involving the frontal lobe.

In summary, while animal studies suggest protective effects of CoQ10 on cognition in healthy aging and neurodegenerative disease models, clinical trials demonstrate some benefits in specific disease contexts but not in healthy aging, with several studies reporting non-significant or null effects. These null effects may be attributed to insufficient statistical power and small sample sizes rather than the absence of an effect. However, the overall mixed findings underscore the need for high-quality clinical trials.

Tiny particles in polluted air trigger lung damage, chronic disease, and early deaths, making cleaner air a critical global health priority.



Air pollution accounts for about 4.7 million premature deaths annually and contributes to nearly 8 percent of global disability-adjusted life years, placing it above smoking, obesity, and high cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor.

Review: Particulate matter air pollution: effects on the respiratory system. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent review article in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers Robert B. Hamanaka and Gökhan M. Mutlu at The University of Chicago, USA, synthesized toxicological studies and epidemiological evidence to explain how particulate matter (PM) causes impaired lung function, inflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby contributing to both chronic and acute respiratory illnesses.

Their conclusions sharpen the main message: particulate air pollution is a major environmental health risk and a significant cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality, with most excess deaths being cardiovascular, highlighting the urgent need for stricter air quality standards and effective public health interventions.

Children's lungs are especially vulnerable, with long-term exposure stunting lung growth and leaving deficits that persist into adulthood.

Air pollution contains both gaseous components and PM. Gases include sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂), ozone (O₃), and carbon monoxide (CO). PM consists of carbon-based particles combined with metals and transition metals (e.g., vanadium, cadmium, nickel), as well as organic compounds such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrates, and sulfates.

PM is classified by size: PM10 (coarse), mainly originating from natural and industrial sources, typically remains in the upper airways; PM2.5 (fine) and PM0.1 (ultrafine or nanoparticles), primarily produced by fossil fuel combustion, penetrate deeply into the lungs, posing greater health risks.

Traffic and industrial emissions are the main contributors to PM and nitrogen dioxide. Sulfur dioxide from coal burning has decreased globally, but indoor biomass burning for cooking and heating remains a concern in developing regions.

Because pollutants are often co-produced, isolating individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, PM2.5 is consistently linked to adverse cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, prompting regulation under frameworks such as the U.S. Clean Air Act.

Air pollution and smoking share overlapping pathways, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury, but pollution's effects extend to nonsmokers and amplify disease risks independently of tobacco.

Historical smog events, such as the 1952 London smog, have highlighted the dangers of air pollution. Extensive studies confirmed associations between PM exposure and mortality, with a biphasic response showing stronger effects at lower concentrations.

Cohort studies confirm no safe threshold exists; even low-level PM exposure increases health risks, with mortality associations persisting below current guideline values and observed down to ~4 µg/m³.

Pollution reductions resulting from policies such as the U.S. Clean Air Act and China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) have significantly improved life expectancy and prevented deaths. Temporary decreases during the 2008 Beijing Olympics reduced biomarkers of inflammation, and lockdowns for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also demonstrated rapid health benefits.

However, wildfire smoke is now increasingly influencing annual PM2.5 averages, and events such as the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster underscore the persistent and emerging threats from acute, high-intensity particulate exposure.

Studies show that vanadium and other transition metals in particulate matter are among the most toxic components, strongly associated with both mortality and lung cancer incidence.

Air pollution is a significant contributor to respiratory illnesses and deaths, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) consistently linked to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Large-scale studies show that even modest increases in PM2.5 are associated with higher risks of respiratory hospitalizations and mortality, with no safe threshold identified. People with asthma are particularly vulnerable, as exposure worsens symptoms, increases emergency visits, and is strongly linked to new-onset asthma in children and has been associated with epigenetic changes such as FOXP3 hypermethylation.

Evidence from long-term cohorts, such as the Southern California Children's Health Study, also shows reduced lung function growth in highly polluted areas. In COPD, air pollution accelerates disease progression, impairs lung function, and heightens the likelihood of hospital admission and death, while also contributing to new cases beyond smoking-related risks through oxidative stress pathways.

Pollutant exposure increases the rates of viral and bacterial infections, including influenza, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, by impairing macrophage function and mucociliary clearance. It is strongly linked to ARDS, with increased mortality observed during the pandemic due to amplified inflammatory responses.

Studies further reveal that PM2.5 worsens outcomes in pulmonary fibrosis, accelerating lung function decline and mortality, and drives lung cancer progression via IL-1β–mediated expansion of mutated cells, including in nonsmokers.

Among lung transplant patients, higher exposure levels are linked with chronic lung allograft dysfunction, reduced survival, and greater mortality, underscoring the pervasive respiratory impact of air pollution.

Policy-driven air quality improvements deliver rapid health benefits, with declines in hospital admissions and mortality observed within months of pollution controls being enacted.

PM damages the lungs through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Experimental studies in animals, humans, and cultured cells show that inhaled PM triggers oxidative stress and inflammation, largely driven by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and NRF2.

This leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines, systemic immune responses, and oxidative injury, contributing to diseases like asthma, COPD, fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer through persistent epithelial injury.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor, as PM accumulates in mitochondria, alters energy metabolism, and amplifies ROS production. These effects impair lung regeneration, promote epithelial injury, and disrupt mucociliary clearance, weakening defenses against pathogens and promoting fibrosis via IL-6–dependent pathways.

Chronic exposure may also induce premature cell aging (senescence) and fibrosis. PM alters immune function by impairing macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine responses, thereby dampening antiviral defenses and skewing T cell balance toward Th2/Th17 phenotypes, which increases vulnerability to infections and allergic diseases.

Additionally, air pollution causes epigenetic changes, such as global DNA hypomethylation and histone modifications, that influence long-term respiratory health. Finally, PM particles may act as carriers for viruses, enhancing deep lung deposition of pathogens.

The central message is clear: air pollution remains a major, modifiable risk factor for respiratory disease, with no level of exposure proven to be safe. Effective emission reductions and health mitigation strategies are vital.

A deeper mechanistic understanding of how pollutants damage tissues is essential, with new single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic tools offering promise for advancing this knowledge. Improved pollutant measurement techniques, such as satellite monitoring, low-cost sensor networks, and land-use regression models, will enhance exposure assessments and improve the accuracy of environmental monitoring.

Identifying the most toxic components of particulate matter, like transition metals (e.g., vanadium), will inform targeted policies. These advances are especially critical for protecting children, older adults, and low-income populations who bear disproportionate burdens.

The U.S. Under-20 Men's National Team played its final two preparation matches for the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup this past week, earning a 4-1 win against Morocco on Sept. 5 before playing to a 0-0 draw with the African side on Sept. 7. Both matches were played at Pinatar Arena in San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain.

On Sept. 5, the USA conceded an early second-minute goal from Morocco's Yassine Gessime, before the team came roaring back with a four-goal onslaught with two on each side of halftime. Zavier Gozo equalized in the 26th minute, before Josh Wynder put the USA up 2-1 in the 29th.

On the other side of the break, Matthew Corcoran tallied in the 68th before Marcos Zambrano put a cap on the match with a goal of his own in the 76th minute.

The two sides met again two days later, playing to a 0-0 draw.

The 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile starts later this month and the U.S. will announce its final roster on Friday, Sept. 19, before taking on New Caledonia (Sept. 29), France (Oct. 2) and South Africa (Oct. 5) in Group E play. All three U.S. matches will take place in Rancagua, Chile.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – The fortress of Columbus stood tall once again for the U.S. Men's National Team as the program recorded another win in the historic soccer city. On Tuesday night, the USMNT defeated 17th-ranked Japan 2-0 at Lower.com Field in front of a crowd of 20,192 fans, behind goals from forward Alex Zendejas and striker Folarin Balogun to close out the September window with a strong result against a World Cup-bound opponent and even the matchup's all-time series.

Tuesday's win is the 11th in Columbus for the U.S. Men's National Team in 15 all-time matches played in the Ohio capital, including eight of its last nine. The program's winning record in Columbus of 73.3 percent is the highest out of any city.

Mauricio Pochettino made five changes from the lineup that faced Korea Republic on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey. Zendejas, Balogun, defenders Alex Freeman, Chris Richards and midfielder Cristian Roldan all earned the start Tuesday in Columbus after entering Saturday's match against Korea as second-half substitutes.

Columbus Crew fullback Max Arfsten started at his home club stadium in his 12th cap for the USMNT. The 2025 MLS All-Star received a boisterous cheer from the Black & Gold faithful in attendance.

Also starting the match were the three most capped players in camp – forward Christian Pulisic, center back Tim Ream and midfielder Tyler Adams. Goalkeeper Matt Freese, in his ninth appearance, and Tristan Blackmon, fresh off his USMNT debut Saturday night, completed Pochettino's starting lineup.

The United States began the game on the front foot, looking comfortable with three in the back, and the attackers worked together to get the ball into the opponent's box just 90 seconds into the match. Freeman sprinted to chase down a beautifully chipped ball from Adams and sent a pacey, low cross into the box that the Japanese defense cleared away. One minute later, Japan progressed with a headed ball into space, which Arfsten shut down with a smart tackle. He knocked the ball out of bounds for the first corner kick of the night.



Another good defensive action from Arfsten, in combination with Ream, led to the first shot of the match for the United States in the seventh minute. High pressure from the defensive duo forced Japan to make a lackadaisical back pass into no man's land. The U.S. pounced on the counterattack, and Balogun's expert backheel traveled into the path of Pulisic. The forward carried the ball centrally to set up a right-footed shot from outside the box, but the strike sailed high.

The U.S. nearly converted in the 19th minute. Balogun and Arfsten worked together nicely on the left side of the 18-yard box, passing the ball in a tight area. Balogun squared his shoulders and took a shot on goal from close range that Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako blocked. Zendejas tried to nod in the high-bouncing rebound for the U.S., but Osako gathered himself for the save.

Zendejas would not be denied a second time, and in the 30th minute, the forward opened the scoring on the night. The U.S. moved the ball up the field with pace and found Arfsten on the wing. The Crew defender showed no fear on his club's home turf and beat his defender 1v1 with a wicked stepover move. Arfsten rocketed a left-footed cross into the box where Zendejas lined up his shot. The clinical volley from the Texas native opened the scoring on the night, and the A-to-Z connection gave the U.S. a 1-0 lead.

Arfsten was credited with the assist, his fourth on the year, to send his fans in Columbus into a frenzy.

Freese made several stops in the first half to keep a clean sheet for the second straight half. The goalkeeper was called into action to stop Japan's first shot of the night in the ninth minute, dropping to block a left-footed cross from midfielder Junya Ito that was curving toward goal. Two more stops from Freese in the 21st minute, on a dangerous header from midfielder Kaishu Sano inside the box, and in the 35th, after a takeaway nearly gifted an opportunity for Japan, brought his save total to four in the first half.

Leading by a goal, the United States continued to attack to start the second half. In the 54th minute, Pulisic weaved in and out of defenders on the dribble to set up a low left-footed strike from just beyond the corner of the six-yard box. Osako made a terrific save with his foot to keep the United States from doubling the lead – for the moment.

Balogun recorded the second goal in the 64th minute. Following a free kick around midfield, Pulisic capitalized on Japan taking time to organize defensively. The forward raced down the sideline on the dribble and played a through ball to Balogun making a strong, well-timed run in behind. Balogun slowed his pace to skillfully deliver a low strike into the far side netting to record his sixth international goal and extend the lead to 2-0.

Pochettino made a group substitution in the 66th minute, sending on Diego Luna, Sergiño Dest, Jack McGlynn, and Luca de la Torre. Zendejas, Adams, Pulisic and Arfsten exited the match.

The substitutes continued to attack and created several chances to bring the USMNT's shot total to 19 on the night. In the 79th minute, McGlynn's deflected shot was headed toward goal, but Osako's leaping save prevented the United States from extending their lead. Again, McGlynn barely missed after he fired an absolute rocket in the 83rd minute that hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced away from the goal line. In the 86th, Downs, who subbed on for Balogun in the 79th minute, nearly scored following a glorious give-and-go inside the box from Luna.

The group returns to action in October for another two-match set against World Cup qualified opponents.

The USA will first host Ecuador, presented by AT&T, on Oct. 10 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. As part of Hispanic Heritage Month, U.S. Soccer will pay tribute to the Hispanic community, honoring both their cultural heritage and their passionate support for the U.S. team.

Four days later, the USMNT faces Australia, presented by American, at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. The match on Oct. 14 marks the first time the USMNT has played in Commerce City, Colorado since 2017.

USA – Alex Zendejas (Max Arfsten), 30th minute: Arfsten beat his defender one-on-one on the left wing with a quick stepover move and created space to fire a left-footed cross. Zendejas lined up his left-footed strike just yards away the penalty spot and blasted a low bouncing volley into the lower left corner of the net to deliver the match's opening goal. USA 1, JPN 0

The striker used his left foot to deliver a low-driven shot from just beyond the corner of the six-yard box into the far side netting. USA 2, JPN 0 FINAL

COLUMBUS, Ohio – The fortress of Columbus stood tall once again for the U.S. Men's National Team as the program recorded another win in the historic soccer city. On Tuesday night, the USMNT defeated 17th-ranked Japan 2-0 at Lower.com Field in front of a crowd of 20,192 fans, behind goals from forward Alex Zendejas and striker Folarin Balogun to close out the September window with a strong result against a World Cup-bound opponent and even the matchup's all-time series.

Tuesday's win is the 11th in Columbus for the U.S. Men's National Team in 15 all-time matches played in the Ohio capital, including eight of its last nine. The program's winning record in Columbus of 73.3 percent is the highest out of any city.

Mauricio Pochettino made five changes from the lineup that faced Korea Republic on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey. Zendejas, Balogun, defenders Alex Freeman, Chris Richards and midfielder Cristian Roldan all earned the start Tuesday in Columbus after entering Saturday's match against Korea as second-half substitutes.

Columbus Crew fullback Max Arfsten started at his home club stadium in his 12th cap for the USMNT. The 2025 MLS All-Star received a boisterous cheer from the Black & Gold faithful in attendance.

Also starting the match were the three most capped players in camp – forward Christian Pulisic, center back Tim Ream and midfielder Tyler Adams. Goalkeeper Matt Freese, in his ninth appearance, and Tristan Blackmon, fresh off his USMNT debut Saturday night, completed Pochettino's starting lineup.

The United States began the game on the front foot, looking comfortable with three in the back, and the attackers worked together to get the ball into the opponent's box just 90 seconds into the match. Freeman sprinted to chase down a beautifully chipped ball from Adams and sent a pacey, low cross into the box that the Japanese defense cleared away. One minute later, Japan progressed with a headed ball into space, which Arfsten shut down with a smart tackle. He knocked the ball out of bounds for the first corner kick of the night.



Another good defensive action from Arfsten, in combination with Ream, led to the first shot of the match for the United States in the seventh minute. High pressure from the defensive duo forced Japan to make a lackadaisical back pass into no man's land. The U.S. pounced on the counterattack, and Balogun's expert backheel traveled into the path of Pulisic. The forward carried the ball centrally to set up a right-footed shot from outside the box, but the strike sailed high.

The U.S. nearly converted in the 19th minute. Balogun and Arfsten worked together nicely on the left side of the 18-yard box, passing the ball in a tight area. Balogun squared his shoulders and took a shot on goal from close range that Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako blocked. Zendejas tried to nod in the high-bouncing rebound for the U.S., but Osako gathered himself for the save.

Zendejas would not be denied a second time, and in the 30th minute, the forward opened the scoring on the night. The U.S. moved the ball up the field with pace and found Arfsten on the wing. The Crew defender showed no fear on his club's home turf and beat his defender 1v1 with a wicked stepover move. Arfsten rocketed a left-footed cross into the box where Zendejas lined up his shot. The clinical volley from the Texas native opened the scoring on the night, and the A-to-Z connection gave the U.S. a 1-0 lead.

Arfsten was credited with the assist, his fourth on the year, to send his fans in Columbus into a frenzy.

Freese made several stops in the first half to keep a clean sheet for the second straight half. The goalkeeper was called into action to stop Japan's first shot of the night in the ninth minute, dropping to block a left-footed cross from midfielder Junya Ito that was curving toward goal. Two more stops from Freese in the 21st minute, on a dangerous header from midfielder Kaishu Sano inside the box, and in the 35th, after a takeaway nearly gifted an opportunity for Japan, brought his save total to four in the first half.

Leading by a goal, the United States continued to attack to start the second half. In the 54th minute, Pulisic weaved in and out of defenders on the dribble to set up a low left-footed strike from just beyond the corner of the six-yard box. Osako made a terrific save with his foot to keep the United States from doubling the lead – for the moment.

Balogun recorded the second goal in the 64th minute. Following a free kick around midfield, Pulisic capitalized on Japan taking time to organize defensively. The forward raced down the sideline on the dribble and played a through ball to Balogun making a strong, well-timed run in behind. Balogun slowed his pace to skillfully deliver a low strike into the far side netting to record his sixth international goal and extend the lead to 2-0.

Pochettino made a group substitution in the 66th minute, sending on Diego Luna, Sergiño Dest, Jack McGlynn, and Luca de la Torre. Zendejas, Adams, Pulisic and Arfsten exited the match.

The substitutes continued to attack and created several chances to bring the USMNT's shot total to 19 on the night. In the 79th minute, McGlynn's deflected shot was headed toward goal, but Osako's leaping save prevented the United States from extending their lead. Again, McGlynn barely missed after he fired an absolute rocket in the 83rd minute that hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced away from the goal line. In the 86th, Downs, who subbed on for Balogun in the 79th minute, nearly scored following a glorious give-and-go inside the box from Luna.

The group returns to action in October for another two-match set against World Cup qualified opponents.

The USA will first host Ecuador, presented by AT&T, on Oct. 10 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. As part of Hispanic Heritage Month, U.S. Soccer will pay tribute to the Hispanic community, honoring both their cultural heritage and their passionate support for the U.S. team.

Four days later, the USMNT faces Australia, presented by American, at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. The match on Oct. 14 marks the first time the USMNT has played in Commerce City, Colorado since 2017.

The first opportunity to secure tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, is underway Wednesday.

The Visa ticket presale signup window opened at 11 a.m., and will run through Friday, Sept. 19 at 11 a.m.. Those Visa cardholders who qualify can then declare their intent to purchase tickets.

"With just ten months to go until the FIFA World Cup 26 kicks off, we are excited to launch the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament," FIFA World Cup 2026 COO Heimo Schirgi said in a statement. "This marks a momentous milestone as we build up to this historic event, and we look forward to millions of fans joining us in North America next June."

Using their FIFA ID, fans can log into the world soccer governing body's website and sign up for the presale lottery.  

Those chosen to buy tickets will be notified by email on Sept. 29. They will then be supplied with a date and time slot to purchase tickets, which will be subject to availability. FIFA has said that being selected as part of the presale lottery doesn't necessarily guarantee that tickets will be available during a specific time slot.

Following the Visa presale, there will be other ticket phases.

A registration window for the early ticket draw is expected to be open from Oct. 27-31, FIFA said. Time slots for purchase will run from mid-November to early December. Signup and selection will be similar to the Visa presale.

Registration will take place shortly after the tournament's final draw for the random selection ticket draw. Fans can submit applications for specific matches.

Tickets to all of the tournament's matches, including those for specific teams and venues, will be made available once sales begin, FIFA said, adding the prices will range from about $60 up to more than $6,700 for the Final at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026.

Tickets will also be made available for purchase on a first-come, first-serve basis when the tournament start date gets closer, FIFA said.

MetLife Stadium will host a total of eight World Cup matches: five in the Group Stage, one in the Round of 32, one in the Round of 16, and the Final.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – “Things were clicking.”

That was the phrase several USMNT players used to describe the performance in the 2-0 win over Japan Tuesday night. The U.S. attack looked sprightly, players moving the ball with pace and precision down the pitch throughout the night, eventually leading to 19 shots and 55 percent of possession for the United States.

The opening goal from forward Alex Zendejas exemplifies the synchronicity elegantly. After knocking on the door and being on the front foot early in the match, the USMNT earned their reward in the 30th minute. With the U.S. driving into their attacking third, center back Tim Ream played the ball out wide to Max Arfsten. The wingback dribbled once with his right foot then flashed a swift stepover move to push the ball down the left side of the pitch. Then, he fired a decent, left-footed cross – right where Zendejas was waiting.

“For some reason, I knew he was going to go one-on-one,” Zendejas said. “Our job as forwards and wingers is to get in the box. Luckily, I was in the right spot at the right time.”

In that very spot inside the box, Zendejas floated between two Japanese defenders. When Arfsten's cross arrived, the forward caught it right on the laces and blasted a left-footed volley into the back of the net.

The finish was the second international goal for Zendejas, who made a statement in his 13th career cap. September camp was the first of 2025 for Zendejas, though he's played for head coach Mauricio Pochettino before. The 27-year-old appeared in each of the first four matches for Pochettino last fall.

For some of his U.S. teammates, the familiarity goes back a lot further.

“I've played with him since we were 14 years old, so I've always known what a great player he is,” said forward Christian Pulisic. “He really showed this camp something different, so I'm really happy for him. He deserves it. He's a really technical player, really clean on the ball, and he gives a little something different. He has a direct style. He's really quick, and he can find final passes. He does a lot for us as well.”

When asked about Zendejas during the post-match press conference, Pochettino said that the Club América attacker gives him doubt – in a good way. If Pochettino already had an idea about who his forwards are going to be for the World Cup next summer, Zendejas gave him reason to keep his name to the mix, which was Pochettino's whole approach to this September camp. He built the roster to provide players the opportunity to compete and shine at the international level.

“Now, with this type of performance, he's in the race for the roster of the World Cup,” Pochettino said.

The set-up man for the Zendejas' goal was none other than the Columbus' own. Arfsten knows Lower.com Field well, playing 62 matches for the Crew since 2023, including a victory in the 2023 MLS Cup. A significant portion of the 20,192 in attendance for USA-Japan recognized No. 18 in red, white and blue. The Crew fans gave Arfsten a warm welcome when his name was announced in the starting lineup, and the volume raised whenever Arfsten got a touch on the ball or took a shot.

And the wingback put on a show in front of a home crowd – showing bravery in 1v1 situations, combining with teammates like Folarin Balogun in dangerous areas and hustling on the defensive end to disrupt Japan's attempts to carry the ball toward goal.

Fans who followed the USMNT this summer know what Arfsten can do. The summer was career-shifting for the 24-year-old fullback. He played significant minutes in the Gold Cup, starting all but one of the tournament games for the U.S., and earned his first selection to the MLS All-Star Team.

“He's a player that we've believed in from Day One,” Pochettino said. “His character, his personality, the characteristics, how he is as a player – it's a combo that we really love.”

Pochettino said the potential for Arfsten is “massive.” And if his fast rise is any indication, that's certainly true. Earlier in 2025, Arfsten earned his first call-up to the National Team. Now, he's setting up teammates for difference-making goals and becoming a consistent contributor, tacking on more to his year-long totals of four assists and one goal in 12 caps.

“He's doing fantastic,” Pochettino said.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – On a bright night for the U.S.Men's National Team, Christian Pulisic was a bright spot.

In the group's big 2-0 win over Japan, the forward contributed to the second goal of the night, the 60th-minute strike from Folarin Balogun. The assist was No. 19 for Pulisic in his nine-year international career, tying the27-year-old with Claudio Reyna and legendary forward Clint Dempsey for fourth all-time in USMNT history.

September camp offered a chance for the longtime veteran to get his first minutes with the National Team since spring.The vibes out of training camp were all positive. Teammates reported that Pulisic integrated seamlessly with the squad. While he admitted the program has “been in a tough spot” at times over the past several months, his affection and passion never wavered.

“I love this team,” he said after Tuesday's match. “It's everything to me."

This camp also gave Pulisic a chance to see some new players and reunite with others. The AC Milan star said he enjoyed bonding with some of the older players like Cristian Roldan, the Seattle Sounders midfielder who was a late addition to Pochettino's September roster and earned the start Tuesday night. 

“For me, personally, I don't feel like a step was lost,” Pulisic said.“I love being around the team, and I had a great time.”

Against Japan, Pulisic found a lot of freedom, starting the match as a winger on the left side. The 3-4-3 formation resulted in more movement, opening more channels and dynamic playmaking, like when Pulisic almost scored in the 54th minute. Up a goal, the United States kept their foot on the pedal. Pulisic carried the ball toward the goal, dribbling in and out of defenders fluidly and bravely. His driven shot forced Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako to drop quickly to keep the strike from squeezing past him from a difficult angle. The goalkeeper made the save, but it was one of the best looks for the U.S. on the night.

It was Pulisic's actions and quick thinking that led to Balogun's goal. Following a dead ball after a foul called on Japan, the United States didn't stall. Pulisic caught Japan on the back foot and took advantage, turning on the jets and moving the ball toward the pitch with urgency. He placed a perfectly timed ball to Balogun making a run in behind, and the striker converted with a clinical finish, not far off from the spot where Pulisic had a go just six minutes earlier.

“I'm pretty comfortable in most of the attacking positions,” Pulisic said. "Today, it was nice playing mostly on the left and being able to turn and coming in on my right foot. It's definitely a good spot for me.”

Like many players called into this camp, these 11 days allowed Pulisic to get more time with Pochettino, who was named head coach of the USMNT one year ago to the day on Sept. 10, 2024. In his post-match press conference, Pochettino called Pulisic “un jugador intelligente,” a smart player, and praised his versatility, being able to play both right and left sides of the field. The two have gotten to know each other better this camp and are on a good page as Pulisic departs Columbus and returns to his club in Italy.

“We had good conversations,” Pulisic told reporters after the match. “Honestly, what you guys experience and what the media sees is not exactly what we experience. Things are good. We spoke. We had a normal camp, and everything is good between us and good between the team. There's not as much drama as you guys think.”

Tuesday's win gives Pulisic and the U.S. a strong result heading into the October window where the USMNT will again face two World Cup-bound opponents in Ecuador and Australia. With nine months to go until the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off in June,Tuesday's result and Pulisic's strong performance puts the U.S. on a confident, positive and winning trajectory heading into fall camps.

The lottery for Visa cardholders opens today, followed by a general onsale

The lottery for Visa cardholders opens today, followed by a general onsale

Soccer's biggest stage is headed to Met Life Stadium. For the first time ever, the world's biggest sporting event will bring FIFA World Cup quarterfinal matches to New Jersey and Philadelphia.


The lottery opens today for Visa cardholders, giving you the chance to score an opportunity to buy tickets. You can apply through September 19. Winners will be chosen at random, and be notified on September 29. Then, you can buy tickets starting October 1.


Next up is an Early Ticket Lottery from October 27 to 31, where anyone with a FIFA ID can enter. Winners will be chosen at random, and then can buy their tickets from mid-November to early December.


If you need round 3, the Post-Draw Sales open in December on a first-come, first-served basis for general matches, again as long as you have a FIFA ID.
To get your ID, create a free account at FIFA.com/tickets. That's where you'll also join the lottery and have access to purchase tickets.


Admission to general matches will be about $60 per ticket, while the finals games could see prices soar to $6,700 per ticket – you read that right! Keep in mind that high-demand games or knockout rounds will see steep price increases. And FIFA is using “dynamic pricing,” meaning that ticket prices will rise and fall based on demand – so it's best to set your alarm and log in as early as possible.


You can purchase up to 4 tickets per match, and a maximum of 40 tickets total. You can also add on hospitality packages that include premium seating, food, drinks and other perks; this is not via the lottery and can be purchased on its own.


Don't worry if you can't get in right away – FIFA will also launch its own resale platform as a safe way to resell or buy tickets. Be aware of scammers from different resale sites.


The 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place across North America from June 11 to July 19, featuring 48 teams in 104 matches across 16 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

If you need round 3, the Post-Draw Sales open in December on a first-come, first-served basis for general matches, again as long as you have a FIFA ID.
To get your ID, create a free account at FIFA.com/tickets. That's where you'll also join the lottery and have access to purchase tickets.


Admission to general matches will be about $60 per ticket, while the finals games could see prices soar to $6,700 per ticket – you read that right! Keep in mind that high-demand games or knockout rounds will see steep price increases. And FIFA is using “dynamic pricing,” meaning that ticket prices will rise and fall based on demand – so it's best to set your alarm and log in as early as possible.


You can purchase up to 4 tickets per match, and a maximum of 40 tickets total. You can also add on hospitality packages that include premium seating, food, drinks and other perks; this is not via the lottery and can be purchased on its own.


Don't worry if you can't get in right away – FIFA will also launch its own resale platform as a safe way to resell or buy tickets. Be aware of scammers from different resale sites.


The 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place across North America from June 11 to July 19, featuring 48 teams in 104 matches across 16 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Look for travel bundle options like “Follow My Team” or “Venue Series” that include multiple matches and sometimes accommodations if you're planning to catch a game outside of New Jersey.

After a 2-0 loss to South Korea on Saturday, the U.S. men's national team hoped to get its mojo back with a win. Tuesday's game had a win-or-go home feel to it, as the U.S. tries to find its footing and keep fans on board — and the USMNT delivered, with a 2-0 win over Japan.

Pregame, midfielder Tyler Adams told the broadcast that the team needed a win, and win the Americans did. The victory over Japan, the No. 17 team in the FIFA rankings, breaks a tough streak of losses against top-25 teams.

From kickoff, Tuesday's game felt like a far cry from the team's tough start Saturday, when the U.S. allowed both South Korean goals in the first half. The USMNT looked more organized and more controlled on the pitch, even against a controlled Japanese side.

The U.S. found its opening in the 30th minute, as Alejandro Zendejas slotted home a beautiful goal to open the scoring.

The team kept up the momentum in the second half as well. Folarin Balogun got another excellent finish in the 64th minute, off a great assist from Christian Pulisic.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese also pitched in significantly for the win, getting six saves and continuing to cement his place as the first-string goalkeeper.

Unlike Saturday, U.S. was much more aggressive on offense, getting 11 shots on target out of 19 in total. Japanese goalkeeper Keisuke Osako, who had a stunning nine saves, held the USMNT to only two goals.

The win also marks a potential turning point for USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino. After months of testing out potential lineup combinations, this game demonstrated more team chemistry than several past editions. And Pochettino, who dismissed some criticism of the team as "bulls***" on Monday, will have a much-needed win under his belt and a sigh of relief heading into the rest of the fall.

“It is important for us to keep pushing and improving," Pochettino said post-match. "We really believe in the process, we believe in the plan. The important thing is we are not talking only about winning games, because that is obvious that we want to win, but the important part is to be focusing on how we need to build our way to approach the games, how we need to attacking in every single period during the game, that we need to be strong together.”

Looking forward, Pochettino will have a broad roster to choose from in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup next summer. Zendejas and Folarin were the 16th and 17 different players to score for the U.S. under Pochettino, across only 18 games, per OptaJack.

After closing out the September window with a win, the USMNT will reconvene in October to play Ecuador and Australia, before facing Paraguay and Uruguay in November.

World Cup

COLUMBUS, Ohio — U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino indicated that fringe players who performed well in Tuesday's 2-0 win over Japan are in contention for World Cup roster spots.

Asked specifically about winger Alex Zendejas, who scored the opening goal in the U.S. victory, Pochettino said: “He's in the race for the roster for the World Cup.”

He then also mentioned Columbus Crew left wingback Max Arfsten, who provided the assist on that goal while playing at his home stadium.

“It's a player that we really believe from day one, because I see in the way that he is, his character, his personality,” Pochettino said. “The characteristics (of) how he is like a player. I think it's a combo that we really love, we really like. He's (a) very intelligent, very smart guy.”

The manager also made mention of Alex Freeman, who started at right wingback; and Cristian Roldan, who played 90 minutes in midfield one week after being on vacation and receiving a late call-up to the squad for his first USMNT opportunity since the 2023 Gold Cup.

Pochettino also explained the decision to start with three center backs in a 3-4-3 formation for the first time as U.S. boss.

“We have players that play in this new formation [with their clubs],” Pochettino said. He mentioned Freeman and Arfsten, but also center back Chris Richards, who has said he is more comfortable playing in a back three, which is what he does at Crystal Palace in the English Premier League.

Pochettino also said, in general: “I think it's good to have different plans, approaches to the games, different formations.”

He said that the 3-4-3, specifically, “is more simple to understand for the players than the formation we used against South Korea.” In that game, a 2-0 loss on Saturday to the Koreans, the U.S. looked disjointed and discombobulated, especially against the ball.

A day earlier, at his pre-match news conference, Pochettino sounded defensive and defiant. He pushed back against criticism of his squad selections, and doubled down on his stance that results in the buildup to the World Cup aren't as relevant as some fans and pundits seem to believe.

His players, though, knew they needed a result soon. On Tuesday, they got one.

“If you go to the past, when things happen like this … this team were very successful,” Pochettino said, indicating the U.S.'s capacity to rebound from defeat. “And that is why I am so relaxed, you know, stick with the plan and keep going.

“The most important is the process. The most important is say today win or lose, you know, it's about the process. It's about the players really believing what we are doing, that they respect us, how we respect them.”

Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu, speaking moments before Pochettino, said through an interpreter that he thought the U.S. staff “did a magnificent job.” The USMNT, he said, “managed to regain their confidence and play well against us.”

When asked which U.S. players impressed him, Moriyasu singled out Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun.

Explaining his decision to rotate his entire lineup and play a “B” or “C” team, Moriyasu gave an explanation similar to the one Pochettino has given in the past. “We are aiming to win at the World Cup,” he said. “I cannot just rely on my experienced players. … I need my young players to step up and gain experience, and heighten the standard.”

Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. men's national soccer team got the bounce-back performance it desperately needed.

The USMNT defeated Japan, 2-0, on Tuesday, Sept. 9 in Columbus, Ohio, on goals from Alex Zendejas and Folarin Balogun. The victory came three days after a humbling 2-0 defeat against South Korea in Harrison, New Jersey.

Zendejas opened the scoring in the 30th minute with a spectacular volley off a long pass from teammate Max Arfsten, who was playing in the home stadium of his club team, the Columbus Crew. Balogun doubled the U.S. lead in the 64th minute with a nifty goal of his own as Pochettino's squad earned a much-needed victory against a Japan side that already has qualified for the 2026 World Cup.

While Tuesday's game was just a friendly, the USMNT needed a positive outcome after some disappointing performances — the team has endured six defeats in 2025. Even with Tuesday night's win, Pochettino's record with the USMNT is a less than stellar 10-1-7 since taking over as coach in September 2024. Pochettino has precious little time to turn around what has been an underperforming national team squad before next summer's World Cup.

The USMNT's next two matches (both friendlies) come in the next FIFA international match window in October. The U.S. will play Ecuador in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 10 before playing Australia in Colorado on Oct. 14.

USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights of Tuesday night's USMNT vs. Japan friendly in Columbus, Ohio:

Folarin Balogun netted his sixth career goal for the U.S. in the 64th minute with a terrific finish that got past Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako.

Balogun's left-footed shot from the left side of the box came after an assist from Christian Pulisic.

The U.S. has been cruising in this one, with Japan unable to mount a significant threat to score.

Alex Zendejas' goal in the 30th minute remains the only tally of Tuesday night's friendly so far.

The USMNT had eight shot attempts with five on target, compared to four shots on goal on seven attempts for Japan.

The U.S. enjoyed a 62%-to-38% advantage in possession as the team aims to end a two-game losing streak.

The USA and Japan went a half hour of play before Alex Zendejas finally tallied the game's first goal in the 30th minute. For Zendejas, it was his second goal for the USMNT and first since March 2023 when he scored in a 7-1 rout of Grenada in Concacaf Nations League play.

Max Arfsten earned the assist with a cross to Zendejas, who slammed home the goal on the long volley from the Columbus Crew player.

The USMNT had enjoyed the possession advantage against Japan through the game's first 30 minutes, and it paid off with a brilliant strike.

USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has tabbed four different starters from his lineup for Saturday's 2-0 loss to South Korea.

Defender Chris Richards, midfielder Cristian Roldan, and forwards Folarin Balogun and Alex Zendejas get the start Tuesday night. All four came on as substitutions on Saturday.

Sebastian Berhalter, Sergiño Dest, Diego Luna and Josh Sargent each started on Saturday, but will open this game on the bench.

For Christian Pulisic, this will be his 80th career USMNT cap. Max Arfsten makes the start in the home stadium of his club team, the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

The Samurai Blue currently are on a 13-match unbeaten streak that dates back to February 2024. 

In the most recent matchup against the U.S., Japan prevailed 2-0 in a 2022 World Cup tune-up match in Düsseldorf. Germany.

Japan was the first team (non-host nation) to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.

Alex Freeman, a 21-year-old defender who plays professionally for Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer, is the son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman.

Antonio Freeman spent eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Green Bay Packers, helping the team win Super Bowl XXXI. In that victory, Freeman had an 81-yard touchdown reception.

Alex Freeman, who was born in Baltimore, Maryland, signed a homegrown deal with Orlando City in 2022. He made his debut with the team on April 29, 2023 during a win over the LA Galaxy. Alex Freeman made his USMNT debut as a starter in the team's 2-1 defeat against Turkey on June 7, and earned his ninth national team cap with a start against Japan.

The U.S. men's national team is set to face Portugal in a March friendly, according to multiple reports.

The Athletic first reported that talks between the two federations were advanced, with the USMNT also targeting Belgium for the March FIFA window.

Fox Sports reported that the USMNT-Portugal match would take place at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The 71,000-seat venue could also potentially host a match against Belgium, though Washington, D.C. and other locations are also being considered. — Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire

Mauricio Pochettino has expressed frustration with the amount of fullback Tim Weah has played early in his time at Marseille.

Weah has alternated between fullback and winger during the past few years of his club career, taking him from Lille to Juventus and now back to France with Marseiile.

But with the U.S. men's national team, the 25-year-old has been used almost exclusively as a winger. Weah started Saturday's friendly against South Korea as a winger, putting in a solid display that would've included a first-half goal if not for a great save from goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo. — Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire

HARRISON, N.J. — Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed the need to win friendlies leading up to the World Cup, saying that results will only matter when the tournament kicks off next summer.

The U.S. men's national team fell 2-0 against South Korea on Saturday, Sept. 6, as goals from Son Heung-min and Lee Dong-gyeon in the first half settled the match at Sports Illustrated Stadium.

Pochettino has now lost seven of 17 games during his tenure as USMNT head coach, particularly struggling against high-quality sides.

In 2025 alone, the USMNT has lost to Panama, Canada, Türkiye, Switzerland, Mexico and South Korea. — Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire

Was this one lost in translation? Holger Rune took to social media to shut down claims that he might be getting too comfortable in some WTA players' direct messages.The Dane has once again (but more on that later) found himself the subject of some girl-gossip as Anna Kalinskaya recently chatted with former Top 5 player-turned broadcaster Anna Chakvetadze in a Russian-language video interview. The WTA world No. 32, who last year was in a relationship with Jannik Sinner before the Italian confirmed their breakup this spring, was asked by Chakvetadze if she often is asked out on dates by fellow tennis players.The 26-year-old, who also once dated Nick Kyrgios, said that though propositions come less frequently now than they once did, one unnamed player was persistent."Some it's just no chance at all; no need to write," she confessed through giggles. "Someone wrote like 10 times and then gave up."Prodded by Chakvetadze's for the player's identity, Kalinskaya named-dropped Rune.Read more: Holger Rune slams “fake news” social media accounts after Cincinnati Open victory

Ha ha ha. We might have cultural differences that make Anna read a comment on a story as an invitation to a date 😜 if I want to go on a date, I ask for a date . Don't worry

"He deserves all this," Kalinskaya continued, adding that the 22-year-old Dane "thinks too much of himself ... but he's not the only one."All this" may refer to a purported pattern by Rune of sliding into Russian players' direct messages. Last month, Veronika Kudermetova alleged in a different Russian-language interview with Elena Vesnina, that the Dane also asked her on a date. Kudermetova, 28, has been married to her coach, Sergey Demekhine, since 2017.“I told him, ‘Boy, I'm probably too old for you. If you looked at my Instagram, you'd see I have a husband,'" Kudermetova said in comments translated from Russian. "He replied, ‘Oh, sorry.' Since then, he doesn't even say hello to me anymore.”But Rune did speak up in response to the now-viral clip of Kalinskaya, which as of this writing as 3.5 million views on X, formerly Twitter.

Don't worry."Though Rune suffered an earlier-than-expected second-round exit at the US Open, he likely won't have much time for off-court frivolity as he hopes to play a key role in Team Europe defending its Laver Cup title next week.“My goal is to give them a lot of fight, great energy, and hopefully a win,” the soon-to-be Laver Cup debutant said. “You don't just play for yourself; you fight a little extra more because you play for something bigger than yourself. It brings pressure for sure, but also a lot of motivation.”The Laver Cup airs live on Tennis Channel from San Francisco from Sept. 19-21.

The Cooldown Room: Fact or fiction with Pietro Fittipaldi

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri

It was a tense end to the Italian Grand Prix for McLaren as they issued team orders to Oscar Piastri following Lando Norris' slow pit stop.

McLaren team boss Andrea Stella has opened up on the team orders situation that made headlines after the Italian Grand Prix, stressing how the outfit's actions backed up their “values and principles”.

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri spent much of Sunday's race running in second and third respectively, before moving into a temporary 1-2 when Red Bull rival Max Verstappen pitted earlier on a different strategy.

McLaren left it until Lap 45 to pit Piastri and Lap 46 to pit Norris, but a slow stop for the latter meant he lost out to his team mate and rejoined the action in third position – potentially costing him more ground in the title race.

However, McLaren acted quickly by asking Piastri to move aside for Norris, reminding the Australian of last year's Hungarian Grand Prix and being told that the pair would be free to race to the chequered flag.

As it transpired, Norris had enough in hand over Piastri during the final laps to secure second and reduce his team mate's championship lead from 34 points to 31, with all parties being asked for their thoughts on the situation post-race.

“Let me start by saying that the decision we made today doesn't have [anything] to do with what happened in the Netherlands – it's completely independent of the DNF that the team caused for Lando,” Stella told F1 TV. “This is a completely separate situation and we take one race at a time.

“Today, when we started the pit stop sequencing, we started the sequencing pitting Oscar first but with the clear intent that we would have not swapped the positions. Unfortunately, this compounded with the fact that we had a slow pit stop [for Norris].

“Because we had the sequence with Oscar first and then the slow pit stop, we thought that the fair thing to do was to go back to the positions that we had before the pit stops. I'm sure Oscar will be very comfortable with this; he already was comfortable during the race.

“We showed again the values and the principles we have at McLaren.”

Asked about the radio call that referenced Norris moving over for Piastri at the Hungaroring last season, and whether it was the best way to ensure the Australian would understand the call, Stella added: “Of course, we had Hungary, but after Hungary we had so many conversations, so much alignment with each other as to how we go racing, so I don't think we need to go so far back.

“I think we just stick and refer to the principles and the approach that we have in the way we go racing. I think it's alright.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri

Kick Sauber driver Gabriel Bortoleto is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Aged 11, Gabriel Bortoleto left Brazil, determined to make it in motorsport. His family's passion, hard work and sacrifice gave him a start.

His talent saw him accelerate towards a racing career. A two-time World Champion saw he was special, and helped guide him to Formula 1.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, Bortoleto looks back at his childhood, how his parents worked hard to fund his racing dream, how he made the difficult decision to leave them behind and go to Europe to further his career, and why Fernando Alonso's support was essential as he climbed the racing ladder.

Winning the Formula 3 and Formula 2 championship titles earned Bortoleto a place in F1. He explains how he is adjusting to the driving and living in the World Championship, the pride he feels representing Brazil, and what racing against experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg is teaching him.

The Kick Sauber driver also reflects on how his manager and on-track rival Alonso continues to help him, and why he spends hours on his home simulator immediately after every race weekend.

			By Ted Johnson, Dominic Patten 


Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA and one of the most influential activists on the right, has died after being shot at a Utah rally today, President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform.


	Kirk was 31.


	Trump wrote, “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!”


	Kirk, one of the most prominent social media influencers and podcasters on the right, also was credited with mobilizing young voters for Trump's reelection bid. He was on a tour of college campuses, the latest being an appearance at Utah Valley University. 

	











	Video of the shooting showed Kirk speaking at a large outdoor event on university grounds. Then, he lurched backward as blood poured from his neck.


	In the two hours before Trump's post, political leaders on both sides of the aisle condemned the shooting, an apparent act of violence against a vocal activist on the right. The messages had a common theme: At a time of deep division in the country, violence has no place.


	Networks have been covering the shooting since the first reports emerged in the 2 p.m. ET hour.

Oracle chairman and co-founder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Global's new owner David Ellison and a major investor in the media company after its merger with Skydance, just saw his wealth soar by over $100 billion.


	The company reported stellar earnings late Tuesday with a massive backlog of contracts for its Cloud business that seeming to ensure its pole position in the AI market and pushed the shares up by more than 40%. That added over $300 billion in market value to the company where Ellison holds a 41% interest and resulted in his becoming the world's richest person for the first time, worth $393 million and passing Elon Musk, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It was the biggest one-day increase ever recorded by the index, Bloomberg said. It has Tesla founder Musk's wealth at $385 billion.

	Musk became the world's richest person in 2021 before losing the title to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and LVMH's Bernard Arnault. He reclaimed it in 2024 and had held it for just over 300 days until today, according to the index.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The holdings of all are largely in stock and wealth stats numbers can fluctuate from hour to hour with share prices. There are also dueling indexes. Bellwether Forbes still had Musk in the lead at $437 billion.


	Oracle shares are up 35% at about $325, off a high today of $346. 


	The Ellison family with RedBird Capital acquired Paramount in an $8.4 billion deal that closed in August. David Ellison has said he and his father are close and speak daily and that the Oracle connection could certainly be tapped to bring more of a tech focus to Paramount Global, which now has some very deep pockets behind it. Ellison, who is close to President Donald Trump, has been floated as suitor for TikTok if it sells its U.S. operations.


	The Forbes real-time billionaires list has, from nos. 3 to 10, Mark Zuckerberg, Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jensen Huang, Steve Ballmer, Arnault and Warren Buffett.

Margaret Josephs is celebrating her beloved mother in style. The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star shared a loving tribute to Marge Sr. on Instagram as her mom turned 79, posting a playful video of the pair dressed in glamorous evening gowns.

A post shared by Margaret Josephs (@therealmargaretjosephs)

In the clip, Josephs held one of her dogs while bantering with her mom, showing off the close and humorous bond they've built over the years. She paired the video with a heartfelt caption that captured her admiration for her mother.

“Happy birthday to this legend, my hilarious, glamorous, unfiltered, loving, generous, mighty fine at 79 mommy,” Josephs wrote. “This video epitomizes our relationship, the best banter with warmth and affection any duo could ever have! Love you so much xoxo.”

The post quickly drew comments from Josephs' fellow Housewives. “Happy birthday [Marge Sr.]!!! Love you so much. You're the best,” Melissa Gorga wrote. Danielle Cabral added, “Happy birthday to THE FABULOUS [Marge Sr.].”

A post shared by Margaret Josephs (@therealmargaretjosephs)

The celebration came just days after Josephs shared another Instagram video highlighting her and her mother's no-nonsense personalities. In that Aug. 18 clip, both were dressed to the nines while Josephs added the text: “Just know if you've ever done me wrong, my mom knows. She'll never forget and she doesn't like you.” In the caption, Josephs joked, “FYI, I got it from my momma.”

Marge Sr. became a fan favorite when she first appeared alongside her daughter in Season 8 of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” Known for her wit and free-spirited nature, she often lightened tense moments on the show with her humor.

During her first season, Josephs explained how unconventional their mother-daughter relationship has always been. “Marge Sr. is an out of control party girl,” Josephs said in a confessional. “I always say I was raised by wolves. We basically raised each other, because we are only 20 years apart. She married my father when she was young, and she left him by the time I was two. But, she always made sure we had a good time, and she showed me a lot of love.”

Their dynamic has also caught the attention of Bravo host Andy Cohen, who ranked Marge Sr. among his “top five housewife moms of all time” during a January 2022 episode of “Watch What Happens Live.” He credited her with introducing him “to the concept of mommy and me facelifts.”

As Josephs continues to share snippets of her bond with her mother on social media, fans are reminded of the warmth, humor, and resilience that define their relationship. Whether through candid confessions on Bravo or stylish Instagram posts, the duo has become one of the franchise's most memorable mother-daughter pairs.

How do you choose between two people you love?

In Prime Video's “The Girlfriend,” the choice is as grueling as possible, pitting Daniel (Laurie Davidson) between his girlfriend Cherry (Olivia Cooke) and mother Laura (Robin Wright). From the outside, Laura could be loving, protective, overbearing, even intrusive — while Cherry sows doubt for hiding pieces of her past despite ostensibly adoring her new beau. 

On paper, it could be any soapy summer read or weekend binge, but the limited series manages to hit the exact tonal sweet spot for this kind of story. Like the source material from author Michelle Frances, Naomi Sheldon and Gabbie Asher's TV adaptation is told from multiple points of view, leaving the audience and remaining characters to make their own choices about who's truthful and who's lying — and why.

The show starts out by depicting everything from both Laura and Cherry's perspective, along with their individual scenes. By the middle episodes, each POV moves the story forward in its own time, either recounting separate events, or picking up chronologically where the other left off. By the end, both women are arguably being honest — about the lies they've told each other, Daniel, other people, and themselves — but the dissonant lenses on their shared reality (a.k.a. Daniel) can no longer coexist.

 










That balancing act wouldn't be possible without the mastery of Cooke and Wright (who also directed the first three episodes), whose tension forms the basis of every relationship and plot point in the six-episode series. Wright hits the exact right note of desperate determination; sometimes the show pulls back or changes perspective to preserve Laura's image, but halfway through the season she lets loose with an unhinged turn that will guarantee viewers stay through the end. 

Cooke is irresistible as always, playing a delicious mix of femme fatale, girl next door, and genuine psychopath — depending on who you believe. As regal as she is in “House of the Dragon,” “The Girlfriend” gives the actor a palpable physical freedom (not to mention a truly stunning modern wardrobe).

With the focus mainly on Cooke, Wright, and Davidson, the ensemble is tight and rounded out by supporting performances from Waleed Zuaiter, Tanya Moodie, Shalom Brune-Franklin, Karen Henthorn, Anna Chancellor, Leo Suter, and Francesca Corney. Niamh Coulter's production design and sleek costuming by Joanna Johnston and Aaron Timperley sells the pocket of British wealth that Daniel and those close to him occupy, and which Cherry won't rest until she acquires. Music supervisor Matt Biffa relishes more than a few needle drops catered to scandalous character beats that only enrich this viewing experience.

 










It's best to leave the story there for spoilers' sake, but “The Girlfriend” is exactly the kind of psychological and soapy binge to kick off the fall TV season, easily devoured in one indulgent sitting with a cheeky drink and lots of yelling at the screen. The twists vary in actual shock value, but the tension provides enough of a hook to follow this warped love story to its conclusion. Maybe you don't choose between people you love; maybe they choose for you.

All six episodes of “The Girlfriend” are now streaming on Prime Video.

Nice to see MJF get some work outside of wrestling.  He made the effort, and is one of the only newish stars that flourished in AEW.

Niall Horan's return to “The Voice” for season 28 — set to premiere on September 22, 2025 — came with a wave of emotions for the pop superstar. 

In a new promo posted to social media on September 9, the hitmaker said he's thrilled to be back after a year away, but that return brought back all the nerves he felt 15 years prior, when he made it onto Britain's “X Factor” in 2010 — a show that changed his life forever. 

“I feel like I'm going to audition,” Horan said nervously when fellow coach Michael Bublé asked him how he was doing. “When you haven't done this for a while, it's weird.”

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Recalling his early days on “X Factor,” where he became part of the global supergroup One Direction, Horan is seen in the new NBC promo telling one contestant, “I don't think anyone really understands how hard it is to audition on a show like this.” 

“I've done it, I've been there,” he continues, and then quips, “Wow, I was terrible.” 

But Horan tells producers in the promo that he loves the format of “The Voice” auditions, with the chance to judge the contestants solely on how they sound before getting to see them or know them. 

“It's all about the voice for me,” he says. “The point of us facing the wall says enough. You know, that's the whole point of the show — to be moved by a voice in the first place, and then the character comes afterwards.” 

The promo then shows Horan turning his chair around for multiple contestants, telling one he loved her confidence and informing another, “I just couldn't wait to get around just see what … you look like, the energy you were giving. You absolutely nailed it.” 

Although coaches Reba McEntire, Snoop Dogg, and Bublé have worked together before on the show, Horan came into the new season not knowing Snoop. Meanwhile, he only knew McEntire from their interactions during season 23, when he was a mentor on “The Voice.” 

“Obviously, I've known Mike for a very long time,” he says in the new promo. “And I'm sandwiched between two GOATs. It's mind-boggling. Every day I come in here to do this show and I'm like, ‘That's Snoop Dogg! That's Reba McEntire!'” 

“But it's an amazing experience just to get to know these people and then become good friends with them,” Horan added. 

On September 9, NBC uploaded a YouTube video featuring the four coaches chatting at a table behind the scenes at “The Voice.” Their discussion began with McEntire asking them when it became clear to them that they were going to be fast friends. 

“I think it was the first moment for me,” Snoop replied. “I'm one of those kind of guys, like, the spirit gotta connect instantly, off the rip. And it was like as soon as I walked in the room, as soon as I sat down next to each other, it was like, you could feel it. It's in the air.” 

Horan agreed, “Pretty much from straight away.” 

“Like, I'd never met Snoop before and I'd obviously worked with Reba before and I've known you for too long,” Horan joked, looking at Bublé. “But I was excited to meet Snoop and work again with you guys.”

	Fans of Bad Bunny were confused about why the musician left the continental United States off his upcoming Debí Tirar Más Fotos world tour. In an interview with i-D published Wednesday, the singer said the decision was tied to the Trump administration's recent mass deportations targeting Latinos.


	When asked by interviewer Suzy Exposito if his decision was “out of concern” for Latino fans, Bad Bunny responded: “Man, honestly, yes.”


	“There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,” Bad Bunny explained. “All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent.”


	Part of the appeal of doing a residency in his native Puerto Rico has been welcoming fans from over the world to his island, including many from the United States who had never visited La Isla del Encanto. The singer is set to conclude his No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency on Sept. 14 after 30 shows since mid-July.

	“I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US, but specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an incorporated territory of the U.S… People from the U.S. could come here to see the show,” Bad Bunny said. “Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world.”


	He added: “But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”

	Bad Bunny has been vocal about his distaste for ICE and the Trump administration. Back in June, he seemed to witness an ICE raid in Puerto Rico, and posted a video on his Instagram of the moment: “They came here… Sons of bitches, instead of letting the people alone and working.”


	Bad Bunny is set to kick off his Debí Tirar Más Fotos tour on Nov. 21 in Santo Domingo before traveling across Latin America through late February. Next spring, the singer will head to several cities in Europe, Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo. In December, he'll perform eight shows at Mexico City's Estadio GNP Seguros, and in June, he'll play 10 shows in Madrid.

Earlier this year, ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' "APT." became the survey's first K-pop leader.

	2025 continues to be a key year for K-pop on top 40 radio, as HUNTR/X's “Golden” reaches the top 10, rising two spots to No. 10, on Billboard's Pop Airplay chart (dated Sept. 13).


	The song from the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters is the sixth Pop Airplay top 10 by an act with ties to Korean pop, and the first since BLACKPINK's ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.,” which became the chart's first such No. 1, for five weeks, in February-March.

	











	As previously reported, “Golden” crowns the multimetric, all-genre Billboard Hot 100 for a fourth week, with HUNTR/X — the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (in the roles of KPop Demon Hunters star characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey) — having become the first female group associated with Korean pop to top the chart. (EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)

	Here are the select six K-pop-associated Pop Airplay top 10s, beginning with PSY's “Gangnam Style” in 2012:


	Pop Airplay chart reporter KMVQ (99.7 Now) San Francisco leads all panelists with nearly 1,000 plays to date for “Golden,” dating to its first spin in late June. SiriusXM's Hits 1 and KIIS (102.7 KIIS-FM) Los Angeles have also given the song prominent exposure.


	The Pop Airplay chart ranks songs by weekly plays on more than 150 mainstream top 40 radio stations monitored by Mediabase, with data provided to Billboard by Luminate.

Dan Stevens also stars in the drama from Rachel Lee Goldenberg ('Unpregnant'), about entrepreneur Whitney Wolfe Herd's path from Tinder exec to Bumble creator and CEO.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	To start, you might mistake Swiped, the new film from Unpregnant director Rachel Lee Goldenberg, for a rom-com. A plucky young woman sneaks her way into an exclusive party where, after a mostly frustrating evening, she finally hits it off with a cutie at the valet stand. They banter about LA techie types and fake-sounding names; unlike all the other guys we've seen hit on her earlier, he actually asks her questions and listens when she answers.


Swiped, however, is no sweet little love story. It is, instead, a biopic centered around an invention that's either facilitated a lot of real-life meet-cutes or brought about the death of them, depending on how much luck you've had on the dating apps. But while the Hulu release ultimately adopts a tone of triumph, its themes of empowerment ring hollow coming from such a thinly written script. It's most persuasive as a portrait of the frequently toxic culture surrounding those apps to begin with.

Airdate: Friday, Sep. 19 (Hulu)Cast: Lily James, Jackson White, Myha'la, Ben Schnetzer, Dan Stevens, Clea DuVall, Ian Colletti, Coral PeñaDirector: Rachel Lee GoldenbergScreenwriters: Bill Parker, Rachel Lee Goldenberg, Kim Caramele

								1 hour 50 minutes			






	Our protagonist, played by Lily James, is Whitney Wolfe, who will eventually go on to become the billionaire founder of Bumble. At the beginning of the film, though, she's just a fresh college graduate looking for a foot in the door. The man she's met is Sean (Ben Schnetzer), the co-founder of a moderately successful incubator. He wants not to date this ambitious would-be entrepreneur but to hire her.

	Initially, the job seems a dream come true. Swiped unfolds in the 2010s, right at the height of the tech boom, and production designer Hillary Gurtler recreates the then-trendy look of offices made to resemble adult-sized playgrounds, decked out with tube slides and ping pong tables and populated by sloppily attired young people. Whitney makes herself instrumental in the launch of Tinder, and is rewarded for her hard work with effusive praise and a flashy title bump. She meets her best friend there (Tisha, played by Industry's Myha'la), and starts dating another co-founder (Justin, played by Tell Me Lies' Jackson White).


	But the good times sour when the romance does. The script, written by Bill Parker and Goldenberg with Kim Carmele, is most effective at the “fall” part of Whitney's rise-fall-rise arc, brought about not by any egregious wrongdoing on her part but by a culture built to insulate certain types of people (i.e., white men) at the expense of everyone else. The tech guys might talk a big game about disruption, but good old-fashioned misogyny is everywhere in their world, from the sales meetings where prospective clients seem more interested in flirting with Whitney than listening to her pitch, to casual office conversations about the relative hotness of women whose photos have been uploaded to the app.


	Eventually, it's also in the way Whitney is treated by Justin, who talks over her to important investors and gossips about their relationship and, post-breakup, escalates to icing her out of meetings and threatening her at work events. It's in the grossness of the app itself, which attracts an increasing number of complaints from female users about abusive messages and unsolicited dick pics. (“I think most of these chicks are just reporting harassment on guys who reject them,” a male exec scoffs when the issue is raised.) Swiped provokes real indignation with the way Whitney is treated by the company she once helped build, which now sets about pushing her out and then tarnishing her reputation for good measure.

	











	It is somewhat less compelling at depicting Whitney's rise back out from the ashes. Swiped is rock-solid in its case that, as Whitney explains, “the rules of online behavior have been written exclusively by men,” and Whitney's aspiration to bring about a genuine sea change is an admirable one. On an abstract level it's easy to cheer for the formation of Bumble, an app explicitly designed to offer a less toxic experience for female users.


	But her path there feels too pat and too linear. It's stuffed with biopic clichés, like the moment when she interrupts her own impassioned rant mid-sentence because she's struck by a eureka moment, and over-reliant on montages that let years fly by in the blink of an eye. The first half, at least, finds some interesting complexity in Whitney's growing disillusionment with both her job and her romantic relationship, as well as her complicity in the very environment that would eventually chew her up and spit her out. The second charts an ascent so relatively frictionless that it feels like a fantasy, turning Whitney from an imperfect protagonist into an untouchable heroine.


	James sells the evolution as best she can, but it's telling that the more compelling performance in the later parts of the movie come from an unrecognizable Dan Stevens in a supporting role as Andrey Andreev, a disarmingly funny and oddly charming Russian investor. It's in his character that Swiped still feels like a story about actual human beings in all their flaws and maddening contradictions. Otherwise, it's hard to shake the feeling that we're only scratching the surface of a story that surely must be more complicated than the straightforwardly uplifting girlboss fable it's being packaged and sold to us as.

“Fear the Walking Dead” actor Frank Dillane becomes a star thanks to Harris Dickinson and his writing/directing debut, “Urchin.” Rising distributor 1-2 Special's flagship release started its journey at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, where Dillane won best actor out of Un Certain Regard for his portrayal of a London rough sleeper circling the drain of his own self-destruction. After Cannes, Dickinson and Dillane brought “Urchin” to the Telluride Film Festival as an Oscar-hopeful bid. “Urchin” opens in theaters October 10 from 1-2 Special. Watch the trailer below.

 










Starring Dillane as an unhoused, drug-chasing drifter in London, and in the vein of Mike Leigh's “Naked” in terms of toxic emotional candor, “Urchin” follows Mike (Dillane) as he stumbles through addiction, and London's correctional and reformatory systems, trying to build his life back up again. In addition to the Un Certain Regard acting prize, the devastating “Urchin” also won the FIPRESCI prize. (IndieWire's Anne Thompson even deemed Dillane a potential Oscar contender.)

From IndieWire's review of Urchin: “Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive… Of course, ‘Urchin' is all the more rewarding for its messy approach to Mike's disarray, which rejects a clear diagnosis in favor of honoring a character who feels like he can't even afford to understand himself. Dickinson's film — shaped by people he knew growing up, and further informed by his work with a variety of social outreach charities — reflects a mature, and frequently harrowing, recognition of how people can be held captive by the centrifugal force of their own behavioral patterns.”

The cast also includes Megan Northam and Dickinson himself, who will soon be shipped off to Beatles land to play John Lennon for Sam Mendes' upcoming Apple quadrilogy. “The Beast” and “Passages” cinematographer Josée Deshaies is the director of photography on “Urchin.”

Started this past February ahead of the Berlinale by Sideshow co-founding executive Jason Hellerstein, 1-2 Special has picked up a handful of festival movies this year. The distributor is firmly in the Radu Jude business, with North American rights to the Romanian director's Silver Bear winner “Kontinental 25” and upcoming Locarno premiere “Dracula.” There's also Christian Petzold's “Miroirs No. 3,” bought for the U.S. from Metrograph Pictures, which paused theatrical releases this year, and Simón Mesa Soto's Un Certain Regard Jury Prize winner “A Poet” coming up.

 










“Urchin” opens in New York and Los Angeles October 10 before a nationwide release October 17.

For now, Laika is still known for its stop-motion animated features such as “Kubo and the Two Strings,” “ParaNorman,” and “Coraline.” But that may soon change. The company has been steadily developing a slate of live-action features to complement its animated movies, and its latest may be among the most high profile it has announced.

Laika has tapped “The Farewell” and “Expats” director Lulu Wang to direct a feature adaptation of “Audition,” the book from author Katie Kitamura released this year that was a finalist on the longlist for the Booker Prize. Already the studio has nabbed two big stars to lead the project, Lucy Liu and Charles Melton, and a producer who is as big of a fan as you can get, Barack Obama on behalf of his Higher Ground banner.

“Audition” is a twisty thriller that follows a celebrated actress enjoying a charmed, bohemian life in Manhattan with her creative husband. That is until a mysterious young man appears, claiming to be her long-lost son. What begins as a misguided reunion spirals into an enthralling mystery about identity, guilt, and the roles we perform. Martyna Majok, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, is co-writing the adaptation with Wang. 

 










Obama included “Audition” in his annual summer reading list for 2025, calling it a “quiet novel about the ways we hide our true selves from others — and ourselves.” High praise.

For Wang, this is just her second feature after “The Farewell,” having created and directed the Amazon Prime Video limited series “Expats.” While “The Farewell” was on original story, with “Expats,” she certainly showed her skill at directing an adaptation — in that case of Janice Y.K. Lee's novel “The Expatriates.”

“Bringing Katie Kitamura's ‘Audition' to the screen is a thrilling challenge,” Wang said in a statement. “What makes it feel possible, and electrifying, is working with Lucy Liu and Charles Melton. They're both such magnetic performers and I can't imagine better collaborators to step into this story with.”

Laika has a number of live-action projects in development, but only a few have been announced so far. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's next film is for Laika and is an adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid's new novel “Atmosphere.” “Dune” writer Jon Spaihts has an original movie that was the first project announced by the studio. There's an adaptation of the action thriller novel “Seventeen” in development that screenwriter John Brownlow is adapting. And Brian Duffield (“Spontaneous”) is writing and directing an original script called “Crumble” that has Phil Lord and Chris Miller attached as producers.

 










Laika is still working on its animated features that are its bread and butter and, as IndieWire reported, is working on re-introducing itself to audiences after a box office misfire with its last project “Missing Link.” The company's sixth animated feature, “Wildwood,” is in the works now and directed by Travis Knight, who himself is also juggling the live-action “Masters of the Universe” film for Amazon MGM.

Higher Ground and LAIKA will produce “Audition” in association with Wang's production company Local Time. Higher Ground's Vinnie Malhotra and Anikah McLaren, LAIKA's Travis Knight and Matt Levin, and Lulu Wang are producers. Lucy Liu, LAIKA's Jeremy Kipp Walker and author Katie Kitamura are executive producers.

	The Obamas' Higher Ground Productions is teaming with LAIKA on a live-action feature adaptation of Audition, the Booker Prize-longlisted novel by Katie Kitamura, with Lucy Liu (Kill Bill) and Charles Melton (May December) on board to star.


Lulu Wang (The Farewell) will direct from her own script written with Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Martyna Majok (Preparation for the Next Life, Cost of Living). Higher Ground and LAIKA will produce the film in association with Wang's Local Time banner.


	Published earlier this year by Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, Audition is described as a twisty thriller that follows a celebrated actress enjoying a charmed, bohemian life in Manhattan with her creative husband. Things take a turn when a mysterious young man appears, claiming to be her long-lost son. What begins as a misguided reunion spirals into an enthralling mystery about identity, guilt, and the roles we perform.

	











	President Barack Obama, who founded Higher Ground with Michelle Obama, comes to the project after highlighting Audition in his 2025 Summer reading list, declaring the book a “quiet novel about the ways we hide our true selves from others – and ourselves.”

	Vinnie Malhotra and Anikah McLaren will produce for Higher Ground, alongside Laika's Travis Knight and Matt Levin, and Wang. Liu, Laika's Jeremy Kipp Walker, and author Kitamura will serve as exec producers.


	Breaking out with her sophomore feature The Farewell, starring Awkwafina, which she wrote and directed for A24, Wang is coming off of work on Expats, the Prime Video series starring Nicole Kidman, which adapted the bestseller by Janice Y.K. Lee. She served as showrunner, writer, and director of all six episodes. Upcoming, she's also set to produce two projects for Searchlight: Again Again Again, from writer Joel Kim Booster, and Greta Lee's directorial debut The Eyes Are the Best Part. 

	











	Seen in films that have grossed over $3.7 billion worldwide, Liu's best known projects include Kill Bill, Charlie's Angels, Chicago, Presence, and Red One. Her recent work includes starring in and producing Rosemead, which premiered at the Tribeca Festival and won Best Narrative at the Bentonville Film Festival, where she was honored with the Rising To The Challenge Award.


	Scoring a Gotham Award and other accolades for his breakout starring role opposite Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore in Todd Haynes' Netflix pic May December, Melton has since been seen in the ensemble of Alex Garland's Warfare for A24. He recently wrapped production on Nicolas Winding Refn's Neon film My Own Private Hell, will next be seen starring in the anticipated second season of Netflix's Beef, and just signed on to star opposite Rachel Brosnahan and Will Poulter in Netflix's Saturn Return.


	Since Higher Ground's debut film American Factory won the 2019 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, the company has produced titles including Sam Esmail's apocalyptic thriller Leave the World Behind, which currently sits at #8 on Netflix's Most Popular Movies List, as well as Rustin, American Symphony, Crip Camp, Fatherhood, Becoming, and Worth.


	Best known for its work in stop-motion animation, Laika has scored Oscar nominations for films including Missing Link, Kubo and the Two Strings, The Boxtrolls, ParaNorman, and Coraline. Currently in production on its next animated film Wildwood, the studio is also developing animated features including The Night Gardener and Piranesi. Projects percolating on the live-action front include action thriller Seventeen, Crumble from filmmaker Brian Duffield and Lord Miller, an original from Oscar-nominated Dune scribe Jon Spaihts, and an adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid's new novel Atmosphere from filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.


	Higher Ground and LAIKA are both represented by CAA, as are Wang and Local Time, Majok, Liu, and Melton. Wang and Local Time are managed by Redefine Entertainment.

Great casting for this novel.  I have NO idea how they're going to adapt it.  It got less interesting as it went for me.  But looking forward to seeing what this talented bunch does with it.

While the voice of God can take many forms, few would probably expect it to come via a vengeful, crass, edgelord Buddha who communicates exclusively through butt-dial. And yet that's exactly how the deity avails itself to Yelena (Jelena Dokic), the protagonist of the vivacious but exhausting “Karmadonna.” Directed by “A Serbian Film” co-writer Aleksandar Radivojevic, the movie is thrilling at its most pulpy, and while it offers intriguing commentary around the futility of divine power in a world that has been shaped to serve the needs of the most powerful, like a long-winded dinner blessing its continued meandering can make you forget about its substance.

We've seen any number of stories about an ordinary civilian pushed to her violent limits, but the added spiritual dimension to Yelena's grueling odyssey is enough to make “Karmadonna” feel novel. When Yelena first gets (literally) called upon by the unholy force, she remains skeptical of who's speaking with her as her mind is preoccupied with caring for her expectant child. It isn't until she witnesses a possessed child run and slam his face into a nearby tree that she realizes the voice at the other end of the line might just be omnipotent. The deity — named Siddharta (Sergej Trifunović), and hilariously self-described as “the creator of content” — conscripts her to kill a list of individuals or else he'll slay Yelena's unborn child in the womb. Yelena begrudgingly agrees, and from the start, this decision is a clever lift on religious iconography, as if Mother Mary took up arms against the Roman forces herself instead of letting her Son be crucified. 

 










To her credit, Jelena never plays Yelena as someone whose fright destabilizes her. She may be new to the whole agent of vengeance gig, but she onboards quickly, and the joy is witnessing her go from begrudging participant to mirthful executioner. At the start, she understandably feels that going on a killing spree may not be what's best for her child's health, but she quickly gets on board with dispensing judgment once she interacts with the unsavory characters she's asked to dispatch, from a brutish cab driver who harasses her to a predatory author who uses his influence to manipulate underage women into service.  

Indeed, what Yelena is such a compelling character because her caution and desperation are forever at war. It's not only that murder is decidedly not her speciality, but unlike your Odenkirks, Reeves, or Patels, her pregnancy ensures she can't afford to take the hits the other cinematic hitmen have readily invited. It's that tactfulness of needing to protect her body and fully commit to her vengeance that makes for exciting viewing, as the stakes only increase with each new antagonist, and the margin of safety dwindles from minuscule to nonexistent. 

Likewise, Trifunović's voice performance as the devil in her ear is worth noting, as the Serbian actor's lines never feel phoned in. He goes on diatribes like a spoiled CEO, but his sardonic tantrums also get at a deeper truth. When Yelena asks why he doesn't murder the names himself, Noah's Ark style, Siddharta quips that the forces of globalization (“corporations, globalists, the one percent”) make it difficult to intervene directly. Indeed, when the most powerful can reshape the world in the ways they see fit and view themselves as deities, that leaves little room for true spirituality or hallowed justice to have a fighting chance against such systems. Even the most well-meaning of people have their good intentions curdle into cruelty when reflected through the prism of corporate life. “You taught me to hate you,” Siddharta says of humanity as a whole; a sobering truth that we're more than capable of justifying our own destruction. In truth, Siddharta requires Yelena's services to dispatch these particular men as their “metaphysical armor” protects them; a type of karmic payback, and you can practically hear the embarrassment at this humiliation laced between his every barking order. 

 










The film is fairly straightforward in that it's about Yelena carving her way through a progressively worse list of people in violently creative ways (dollar bills, shot glasses, and crucifixes are just a few of the items plunged into sweaty bodies). You can feel the film straining to maintain its momentum, and Đorđe Miljenović's score pushes the action along with an urgency that reflects a fear of boredom more than anything; at several points when Yelena is dispatching a victim, the music crescendos to a vociferous pitch, as if to draw attention to itself instead of the epic setpiece that's unfolding. 

In the hands of cinematographer Aleksandar Jakonic, the camera doesn't move so much as it prances. Jakonic likes his dolly shots, and in a way that evokes Sam Raimi's “Evil Dead” films, the camera tromps about with the freedom of a vengeful spirit, unafraid to get up close to its characters' bloodied, burnt, and sliced-up visages. At the same time, the film's lens is always eager to expand perspective for a mordantly humorous effect. Take a sequence where Siddhartha can control two henchmen of an entertainment tycoon and forces them to bash their heads until one of their skulls cracks: While Yelena infiltrates the compound, her skirmishes are interrupted by the two men continually running at each other, and it's hilarious to witness her try to circumnavigate her way into a compound while evading the head-butting men.

 










“Karmadonna” is fairly simple in this way, with occasional detours into the lives of other characters like Siddharta's son Bane (Milos Lolic), but it's mainly about Yelena, the vengeance quest she's been conscripted towards, and the bodies left behind in her wake. It's off-putting and not exactly pleasant viewing, but there's some apt appeal in its refusal for easy agreeability. Sometimes, we dig ourselves into holes that even the devil won't follow us through. 

“Karmadonna” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's friendship is integral in the first teaser for The Rip. On-screen, they play two Miami cops whose relationship starts to fray when they discover a huge pile of money in a derelict stash house. As we see in the tense trailer, the partners soon learn that “trust has a price”—approximately $20 million. The two actors' long-time friendship was a major factor behind-the-scenes as well. “You talk about the meta of something… you've got these two guys who have both been world-famous for over 30 years with a wonderful sense of friendship and brotherhood,” director Joe Carnahan told Tudum of working with the duo, who also serve as producers on the film. “Those guys are just so gifted and lovely and talented and open.” The rest of the cast, which includes Steven Yeun, Teyana Taylor, and Sasha Calle, got to “draft off them,” he continued.

The authenticity of that relationship is especially important as the two characters begin to question each other's motives. “It would be so much easier if we just stole this money, I swear to god,” Damon's character says before things really go downhill. He's joking, but there's clearly a grain of desire behind it, one Affleck's character picks up on. Later, he explains that a tattoo he has on his hand stands for “Are we the good guys?” It seems like that question will get harder for both men to answer as the movie goes on.



It was a friendship of his own that inspired Carnahan, whose previous credits include Copshop and The Grey, to make the film in the first place. “The Rip came out of a deeply personal experience that my friend went through, both as a father and as head of tactical narcotics for the Miami Dade police department,” he said. “It's inspired in part by his life and then, by my enduring love for those classic ‘70's cop thrillers that really valued the character and interpersonal relationships and became touchstones of that era—films like Serpico and Prince of The City and more recently, Michael Mann's Heat.”

Grab your friends and tune in on Netflix January 16—if for nothing else than to have a really intense conversation of your own about whether you would still be friends after stumbling on $20 million.

The deal for SenLinYu's novel is believed to be one of biggest in history for a new book's movie rights, not adjusted for inflation.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	In a significant, seven-figure deal, Legendary has bought the movie rights to Alchemised, an upcoming dark fantasy by author SenLinYu.


	The company made a preemptive offer meant to suppress any competition, prompting a whirlwind round of dealmaking, according to sources. 




	One source said that rights deal, an outright purchasing, exceeded $3 million. Another source said the deal may is one of the highest sums for a book's movie rights, not accounting for inflation.


	Legendary had no comment on deal terms. The acquisition comes as Legendary feels energized thanks to a three-year output deal with Paramount, which itself is reenergized thanks to new owners Skydance, and an almost billion-dollar hit with A Minecraft Movie.

	“I'm honored by Legendary's incredible enthusiasm for the project and can't wait to see the world of Paladia come to life,” said SenLinYu in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.


	SenLinYu, who identifies as they/them, is a known quantity in the Harry Potter fan fiction world, especially a subset known as Dramione, which centers on the forbidden love between Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy. They were best known for one book titled Manacled, a 2023 Potter meets Handmaid's Tale dark fantasy that drew more than 10 million views on fanfic platform AO3 and received over 100,000 five-star ratings on Goodreads.


	Sen, as they are also called, also dabbled in Star Wars fan fic pairing Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey and has won awards in that space. Their collected online works have garnered over 20 million individual downloads and have been translated into 23 languages. After growing up in the Pacific Northwest and studying classical liberal arts and culture, they started writing in the Notes app of their phone during their baby's nap time. 

	











	According to sources, Alchemised began as Dramione before being transfigured into a dark romantasy. Set in an alternate world of necromancers and corrupt guild families, the story centers on an alchemist and healer named Helen Marino, who may hold forgotten secrets in her mind. She is sent to the crumbling estate of one necromancer who is to probe her forgotten memories and, as the book jacket teases, “Helena's fight — to protect her lost history and to preserve the last remaining shreds of her former self — is just beginning. For her prison and captor have secrets of their own … secrets Helena must unearth, whatever the cost.”


	The book, from Penguin Random House division Del Rey, is due to hit stores Sept. 23 with a first printing of 750,000 copies and translations lined up in 21 languages. The book has already been mentioned in various outlets such as The New York Times, Bustle, Today, The Washington Post and Business Insider.


	This isn't the first time that fan fiction turned original material has bewitched Hollywood. 50 Shades of Grey also caused a fury and a major deal after E.L. James turned her Twilight fan fiction into an erotic romantic drama. The books became massive best-sellers and the movies massive moneymakers.


	SenLinYu is repped by WME and attorney Matthew Sugarman at Weintraub Tobin.

	Country music has a long history with guns and gun culture, from songs about handing down family heirloom rifles to harvesting that first buck of the season. Ketch Secor, the leader of Old Crow Medicine Show, is a gun owner, but never thought he'd become a staunch advocate for gun reform. That changed after the 2023 Covenant school shooting in Nashville, which left three children and three adults dead.


	“I didn't think that'd be a cause for me… But when the shooting happens in your town, it's different,” Secor tells Rolling Stone during this week's episode of the Nashville Now podcast. He began lobbying for gun reform, including red flag laws and a ban on assault weapons, and produced a forthcoming documentary, Louder Than Guns, about America's gun violence issue.

A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rscountry)


	Secor contrasts his response to a mass shooting with that of mainstream country star Jason Aldean, who was performing onstage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas when a gunman opened fire, killing 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

	











	“I thought, ‘Well, Mr. Aldean can stand up there at a shooting and make his choice for what to do when the volley is coming at his actual audience,'” Secor says. “I've made a different choice than maybe some other country musicians have made, but what I did is make a blueprint for others to make a similar choice, if they so choose. And I sure hope they will — because country has a unique opportunity to bring together the very folks who could make that minuscule difference to create a red flag law, for example, that would have kept this firearm out of the hand of a person who obviously shouldn't have guns.”

	











	Secor says the question often asked after a mass shooting is why the person was allowed to have a gun. “There's something for that: It's called a red flag law,” he says. “The people here in the center and on the right in the music business with a million followers or more, they can do something about it.”

The opening chapter of the final “Demon Slayer” movie trilogy begins with our heroes in free fall. Tanjiro Kamado and the other slayers are plummeting down endless stories after the ground was quite literally pulled out from under them in a cliffhanger at the end of season four. There's no time to catch a breath between then and now, just as there's no chance for Tanjiro to do the same as he immediately springs into action, slicing through swathes of demons who look like twisted rejects from the bathhouse in “Spirited Away.” 

“Demon Slayer” is in constant motion, and the same is true of the franchise as a whole. Much like the endless Infinity Castle from which this trilogy draws its namesake, there seems to be no limit to the success of this hit anime — and no space for latecomers to hop aboard. After smashing box office records for the biggest single-day and opening-weekend in Japanese history earlier this summer, “Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” has become the highest-rated original anime movie of all time on IMDb. Undisputed classics such as “Your Name” and “Perfect Blue” have fallen under Tanjiro's blade, not to mention every single Studio Ghibli movie ever made. And that's before “Infinity Castle” has even arrived in the West.

It's safe to say that “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” is on track to become the most successful anime film of all time — at least, in terms of international box office — with the potential to beat out none other than “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Train” (which knocked “Your Name” from the top in 2020). 

 










With such a considerable fanbase behind it, “Infinity Castle” doesn't need to cater to newcomers, but for wider audiences who might be curious, know that you've come in right at the end, just as Tanjiro and his friends are gearing up for one last fight to the death against Muzan Kibutsuji. But first, they must contend with the upper rank demons who defend the demon king, each more deadly than the last in ways reminiscent of classic video games as we build up to the final boss. That's not all though. The castle itself is an enemy in its own right, shifting and breaking around the slayers to throw them off guard and keep them apart. This dangerous playground they find themselves in is as expansive as it is claustrophobic, stretching out beyond where the eye can see even as floors give way and the walls close in. 

Working alongside animation director Akira Matsushima, longtime “Demon Slayer” director Haruo Sotozaki has elevated his already stunning series to new cinematic heights, combining hand-drawn frames with computer graphics to truly stunning effect. From intricate background details to the propulsive fight choreography, everything is just seamless, vividly rendered to perfection. Against such impressive craftsmanship, Koyoharu Gotouge's original character designs pop like they never have before on screen. Some might go so far as to suggest that Ufotable's work approaches the pinnacle of what animation can achieve this decade, tapping into that infinite potential of cinema's most pliable medium (your mileage will vary). 

 










Speaking of, such bold claims risk distracting from the film's equally impressive auditory elements such as new songs from Aimer and yes, LiSA (not to be confused with BLACKPINK's Lisa, of course). Combined with Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina's score, this soundscape bolsters the fights and emotional flashbacks alike with no degree of subtlety. That cinematic excess they bring is mirrored in the sound effects, with every loud grunt and squelch befitting of speakers at your local theatre rather than just a laptop back home. What stops all this from becoming too overwhelming or over-the-top is the film's calculated use of silence throughout, heightening the tension at key turning points in each battle. Plus, it's not like anyone's coming to a “Demon Slayer” film just to chill. In fact, the franchise is mostly defined by excess, be it through Inosuke's outbursts, Tanjiro's big heart, or, of course, “Demon Slayer'”s signature fight scenes.

“Infinity Castle” doesn't disappoint on that front either. Just like in the show, blistering choreography that defies every law of physics known to man pits slayer and demon against each other with artistic flourishes personified by elements of the natural world. There's real beauty in the way Giyu Tomioka channels water breathing techniques, for example, complete with elaborate names such as First Form: Water Surface Slash or Seventh Form — Drop Ripple Thrust (which, of course, must be spoken aloud each time they're used). Despite the lyrical quality to these moves, “Infinity Castle” is perhaps more violent than usual. Were this film traditionally animated, Japan would be in short supply of red ink in every shade thanks to the sheer volume of blood on display that drips and splatters and even bursts out of severed arteries depending on the moves in question.

 










As such, there's always been a thrill of danger to every fight, but the difference this time around is that the stakes are far higher than usual. If you haven't read Gotouge's manga up until the end, there's a real sense here that anyone (aside from Tanjiro) could die within the ever-shifting walls of this castle stronghold. And that's especially true when a demon as insidious as Doma or brutal as Akaza steps into frame (special shout-out to the deliciously cruel and twisted sympathy Doma shares for his opponent Shinobu Kocho during their fight). 

Like “Mugen Train” before it, “Infinity Castle” really looks like it belongs on the big screen, perhaps more so even than that mammoth hit did in 2020. The problem, however, is that this latest installment still feels like it belongs on the small screen, at least in some key respects. As refreshing as it is to see Tanjiro enjoy a new adventure rather than a compilation movie of what's happened previously in the show, there are some unfortunate pacing issues here which are impossible to ignore.  

As is often the case with “Demon Slayer,” many of the fights are punctuated by flashbacks that pull you out to reveal some hidden backstory or motivation that adds new layers of emotion to the conflict in question. That in of itself is not an issue. In fact, this is very typical for not just this series, but Shōnen anime in general. I'd also argue this approach can actually be rather effective at times, especially during Shinobu's fight with Doma that's fueled by past trauma which comes to light midway. Zenitsu Agatsuma also enjoys some much-needed growth in all aspects of his confrontation against Kaigaku, a former senior with whom he has unresolved beef. But the more these breakaways happen in the context of a film, the quicker a pattern emerges where critical moments are undercut by multiple breaks that drag things out to a not-so-welcome 155 minute runtime. It's like the story is interrupting itself to tell you other stories so that the central one will make more sense.  

 










This isn't so much a problem with a weekly anime drop, especially as those built-in pauses between episodes can encourage reflection on each new reveal or twist that these flashbacks bring. When handled right, it's actually one of the franchise's biggest strengths. The problem is how jarring this can become over the span of a rather unwieldy runtime, especially when it comes to Tanjiro's climactic fight with Akaza at the end. Flashbacks to the demon's past are admittedly rather moving and add emotional depth at exactly the time it's needed most, so as a story on its own terms, it's quite effective. The problem isn't with the story itself then but how said story is told, to the point where the third act's momentum slows just when it needs to amp up most. Had Sotozaki and his team cut the source material up a bit differently, deviating more from the manga's original structure, concessions to what works best in a cinematic space could have really benefited “Infinity Castle” a great deal more.  

This insistence on being faithful to Gotouge's vision — while admirable — also means that the titular Demon Slayer is barely in the first hour or so, and his sister, Nezuko isn't in the film at all, aside from one quick aside. Considering that she was once the heart of this story, and remains the primary drive for Muzan's destruction, Nezuko's absence is a failing of the source material that continues to be felt here in this adaptation. Other popular characters are largely missing in action too, including the fan-favorite Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, although they're clearly being lined up for what comes next.

 










It's unfair, perhaps. to critique a first instalment of a trilogy for not cramming in even more than it already has). After all, “Infinity Castle” has the thankless job of continuing Tanjiro's story from season four and setting up the final trilogy while also delivering a worthwhile, standalone experience for cinema-goers. With that in mind, it's no wonder that the story feels a bit busy or overstuffed in places. But for a franchise that's so frenzied and kinetic in general, “Infinity Castle” effectively sets the tone for what's to come, promising diehard fans the spectacle they've been craving which newcomers will also find enjoyable, if somewhat confusing at times. So sure, the beginning of this franchise's end might not be up there with defined classics of the past such as “Your Name,” “Perfect Blue” or most things Ghibli, but regardless, that won't stop “Infinity Castle” from taking over the world.

Crunchyroll will release “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” in theaters on Friday, September 12.

	Tim Dickinson



	The U.S. Senate race in Texas just got a lot more intriguing — with the addition of a young, charismatic foe of Christian nationalism, who is himself studying to be a minister.


James Talarico declared Tuesday that he's seeking the Democratic nomination, vying to contest the Senate seat now held by Republican John Cornyn. Talarico will be an underdog. He's up against Colin Allred, the former congressman who gave MAGA Republican Sen. Ted Cruz a scare in his race for reelection last year. Beto O'Rourke, who tangled with Cruz in 2018 and later made a moody bid for president, may also enter the mix.


	Talarico is a boyish 36 years old, with a mop of dark hair, cut to Playmobil perfection. The former school teacher is one of the rarest creatures in Democratic politics: a social media savant with more than 1.2 million followers on Instagram, where he posted his launch video. 


	Speaking before a crowd of supporters from the bed of a rusty pickup in front of a small, white church steeple, Talarico appears in the clip delivering a populist pitch to potential supporters: “The biggest divide in our country is not left versus right, it's top versus bottom,” he says. “Billionaires want us looking left and right at each other, so that we're not looking up at them. 

	











	“They divide us by party, by race, by gender, by religion,” Talarico continues, “so that we don't notice that they're defunding our schools, gutting our health care, and cutting taxes for themselves and their rich friends.” Invoking the biblical story of Jesus expelling money changers from the temple, Talarico insists: “It's time to start flipping tables!”

	











	On paper, the young politician would look like a long shot for the nomination. But Talarico has leveraged his modest political perch as an Austin-area state representative, in combination with his uncanny talents as a communicator, to establish himself as one of the most prominent Democratic voices in Texas — and as a rising player on the national scene.

	Talarico was a de-facto spokesman for Democrats who fled the state attempting to thwart Gov. Greg Abbott's partisan redistricting of the Lone Star State. He parlayed that into a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience.Talarico rose to prominence, in Texas and nationally, by inveighing against the moneyed politics of Texas, where the GOP's political machine is dominated by a pair of far-right, billionaire, West Texas oilman preachers named Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks. 


Rolling Stone spoke to Talarico last year for a profile of Dunn, who was a top Trump donor last election, and who has declared his intention to nationalize Texas' increasingly authoritarian form of governance. “Tim Dunn on Sunday mornings preaches at far-right church. And if you listen to his sermons, he doesn't preach a theology of universal love. He preaches a theology of power and control and domination,” Talarico said. “He believes climate change is God's will. He compares homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia. He believes only Christians have a right to serve in public office.”


	Talarico is far from an atheist — so when he speaks out against power-hungry Christians, he does so from his own religious convictions. “My granddad was a Baptist preacher in South Texas. I have attended the same church since I was two years old,” he told Rolling Stone. “In my limited free time, I'm a student at Austin Seminary studying to be a minister myself.” 


	Talarico said he recoils from the movement propelled by Dunn and Wilks. “What you're seeing is a perversion of Christianity,” he said. “You can call it Christian fascism or Christian nationalism. Essentially, it's the worship of power, in the name of Christ. And that is idolatry in its purest form.” That conflicts with his own reading of scripture: “There's so much in the Christian tradition about resisting the desire for power,” he said.

	Talarico got into politics as an evolution of public service. He is a former public middle school teacher who saw elected office as a new way of helping students. “In my first two terms, I was able to do a lot of good work,” he said. “We passed a bipartisan school-finance bill that gave teachers pay raises and funded dual-language education and full-day pre-K.” 


	But Talarico soon encountered a blitz of bills sponsored by the right-wing billionaires. The first sought to ban “critical race theory” in Texas classrooms — which Talarico described as an attempt to “whitewash the curriculum and silence teachers” from talking about race. 

	











	Other proposals kept coming, including ones to ban books and divert public school funding into private school vouchers for wealthy Texans. “I quickly realized that all of these bills were tied together by these two billionaire megadonors from West Texas,” he said.


	Talarico differentiates the Dunn and Wilks machine from that of better-known billionaires like the Koch brothers, whom he said were just “trying to enrich themselves.” The Texas duo, he said, carry “a scarier dimension” of seeking to build an “authoritarian theocracy in the state of Texas.” Dunn and Wilks' desire for domination, he said, goes beyond political and economic power: “It's also social power — social hierarchy.” 


	That includes efforts to strip civil rights icons from schoolbooks. “But it also includes patriarchy,” Talarico said, pointing to Texas' extreme abortion ban. “Women have been forced to give birth to their rapist's child in the state of Texas since that ban went into place. There are counties in Texas that will not allow women to drive on their roads if they are seeking to get an abortion in another state.”


	Talarico warned that Texas is a “testing grounds” for a national agenda, and he encouraged America to look at the Lone Star State with more than caution: “I would urge alarm.” He rattled off a list of reactionary policies that are on the agenda: “They're talking about banning abortion nationally, talking about banning contraception and IVF, talking about banning gay marriage, talking about banning pornography.”


	Talarico said he was not without optimism and pointed to the capacity of people to organize. “There is reason to hope — you actually see here in Texas, in the biggest red state in the country. If its citizens fight back, they can win.”

	I asked Talarico why he thought Texas' GOP was going off the deep end of far-right politics at the same moment the state itself is growing more mixed, politically: “The two are related,” he said. “The Republican extremism we're seeing is confirmation that Texas is changing. I think of Tim Dunn's extremism as a kind of death rattle for a dying worldview — that knows this new Texas won't tolerate that kind of division and authoritarianism.


	“It is backed into a corner,” Talarico added. “It's gonna go down swinging. I just hope it doesn't hurt too many people on its way down.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Michelle Buteau (Babes) and Zooey Deschanel (500 Days of Summer) have inked deals to star in Heather of the Valley, an indie comedy that award-winner Sheri Elwood (Tulsa King) will direct from an original script by Kate Spurgeon (American Dad!).


	In the film, slated for a Spring 2026 production start in Scotland, Buteau plays a burned-out suburban mom who has given up on everything except sarcasm and Diet Coke, with Deschanel as an awkward force of relentless optimism. These former high school classmates have nothing in common, except their shared obsession of the hit TV show, Scotlander. A twist of fate catapults them from the San Fernando Valley back in time to a hilariously gritty, historically accurate version of 18th-century Scotland. And what should have been a romantic escape from their lives turns into a violent, foul-smelling, and dangerously real nightmare — forcing the women to survive sword fights, scheming aristocrats, and the indignities of the past armed only with modern-day sass, resourcefulness… and the occasional Britney Spears dance routine.

	











Elevation Pictures (French Exit, Alice, Darling) and Who's On First (And Mrs., The Exchange) will produce, with worldwide sales handled by Upgrade. Writer Spurgeon calls the film “a story for anyone who's lost themselves in motherhood” — one “about finding yourself again, in the most unexpected (and uncomfortable) places with a little help from your friends.” She adds that she “wanted to write something that would make women laugh until they cry—and then cry for real.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Elwood shares, “I fell in love with Kate's script instantly. It's witty, audacious, a fresh, unflinching reminder that female friendships will always save the day. Michelle and Zooey are the perfect duo to bring this cinematic joyride to life—they're both original, fearless comedians with huge hearts and a willingness to be funny on horseback. Celtic kush, time travel, hot men in kilts. Buckle up, bitches!”


	Buteau is an actress and comedian known for co-creating and starring in Netflix's Survival of the Thickest, which is heading into its third and final season. She's also starred in Neon's lauded pregnancy dramedy Babes opposite Ilana Glazer, BET+'s First Wives Club, and Universal's Marry Me, and released her most recent stand-up special, Michelle Buteau: A Buteau-ful Mind at Radio City Music Hall, on Netflix last year. Most recently wrapping a role opposite Anna Faris, Isla Fisher and Leslie Mann in the comedy Spa Weekend, she's repped by CAA and Mosaic.


	Emmy- and Golden Globe-nominated for her work on the Fox sitcom New Girl, Deschanel is also known for roles in myriad films, including 500 Days of Summer and Elf. She most recently wrapped a starring role opposite Charlie Cox in the Amazon MGM rom-com Merv and is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.


	A multi-hyphenate best known for creating the TV series Moonshine and Call Me Fitz, who exec produces Paramount+'s Sylvester Stallone starrer Tulsa King, Elwood is repped by Anonymous Content and Yorn, Levine, Barnes.


	Spurgeon has also previously written on Elwood's Moonshine, as well as the shows The Last O.G. and Fuller House. She is repped by Heroes and Villains Entertainment, RBEL, and Cohen & Gardner.

Filmmaker Shinsuke Sato, known for his numerous manga adaptations such as "Bleach" and "Kingdom," remains attached to direct the feature from Netflix and Legendary.

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Jason Fuchs is going Plus Ultra.


	The screenwriter behind such tentpoles as Wonder Woman and Argylle has been tapped to write the live-action feature adaptation of My Hero Academia, based on one of the best-selling manga series.




	Netflix and Legendary are backing the project, which has been developing the project for several years now. Filmmaker Shinsuke Sato, known for his numerous manga adaptations such as Bleach and Kingdom, remains attached to direct the feature.


Academia is set in a world where most of the population has “quirks,” also known as superpowers, and tells of a non-powered fanboy who wants nothing more than to be a superhero. When the world's greatest hero sees his potential and gifts him powers, the teenager enrolls in a school for superheroes (the school's motto is “plus ultra,” Latin for “push beyond”). That, of course, is just the beginning of his adventures.

	One of the more modern mangas, Academia launched in 2014 in weekly comic magazine Shonen Jump. It's quick popularity engendered an anime series, anime movies, awards, plus plenty of merchandise. It is said that over 100 million copies of the manga are in circulation, making it one of the best selling mangas of all time.


	Anime is a massive business for Netflix as the form has crossed over into the mainstream as a cultural force not just in America but the world over.

	











	Fuchs is known for writing big-budget fare with heroic journeys, with his credits including the aforementioned Wonder Woman, the first live-action solo take on the heroine that starred Gal Gadot.  His next move is in television, acting as the co-creator, co-showrunner and exec producer of It: Welcome to Derry, as series prequel to Stephen King's It novel. That show debut in Oct. 26 on HBO and HBO Max.


	Fuchs also has a side hustle as an actor, appearing in movies such as It: Chapter Two and La La Land and shows such as The Passage and The Good Wife. He is due to appear in a recurring role on A24 and Peacock's Friday the 13th prequel series Crystal Lake.


	He is repped by WME and Brookside Artist Management.

She received a lifetime achievement award from Local 161/IATSE in New York in 2008.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Adeline Leonard Seakwood, who served as a production office coordinator on The Defenders, The Patty Duke Show, Trading Places, The Boys in the Band, Matlock and more, has died. She was 102.


	Leonard Seakwood died Wednesday at her home in Punta Gorda, Florida, her daughter, publicist Nanette Leonard, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	Her credits also included such films as Popi (1969), The Seven-Ups (1973), Godspell (1973), Death Wish (1974), Three Days of the Condor (1975), Superman (1978), Ragtime (1981), Starting Over (1979), Annie (1982), Krush Groove (1985), The Secret of My Success (1987) and Joe Versus the Volcano (1990).

	She worked alongside actors including E.G. Marshall, Christopher Reeve, Michael J. Fox, Robert Redford, Farrah Fawcett, Peter Falk, Robert Reed and Paul Newman, to name just a few.


	When she celebrated her 100th birthday, Redford signed a photo from their time on the set of Three Days of the Condor and sent her warm wishes.


	Born on Jan. 27, 1923, in Brooklyn and raised there, Adeline Leonard worked as a model for John Robert Powers before venturing into acting, and she appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959).


	As a co-founder of Local 161/IATSE in New York, she led a successful campaign to change the title of production secretary to production office coordinator (the position is now known as production coordinator). She was honored with a lifetime achievement award from her union in 2008.


	(Local 161 represents script supervisors, production accountants, payroll accountants and production coordinators).

	











	Leonard Seakwood also taught a class at the New School in New York.


	She lived much of her life in New York until she married U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Herbert J. Seakwood in 1980. They moved more than 30 years ago to Punta Gorda, where she would welcome new residents to town for three decades as the “Sunshine Lady” for the Punta Gorda Isles Civic Association.


	She also volunteered for more than 25 years with the Isles Girls & Guys — a nonprofit organization under the PGICA that organized estate sales — as a greeter.


	She was known for her warmth, kindness and signature hugs and for dancing every month at Harpoon Harry's.


	Survivors include her daughters, Nanette and Janine; grandchildren Morgan, Gunnar (Corissa) and Ian (Natalie); and great-grandchildren Carsten, Ronen and Troy. Her husband died in 2016 at age 96.


	Donations in her memory can be made to the Peace River Wildlife Center or the Animal Welfare League. A celebration of her life will be announced later.

'Alice' follows "the remarkable journey of a visionary artist who defied conventions and expectations as a filmmaker, entrepreneur, wife, and mother."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


HBO Max and France Télévisions said Wednesday that they have started filming in Paris on a six-part series, described as an “international fresco,” starring Bérénice Bejo about “the extraordinary life of Alice Guy Blaché — the world's first female director and one of the cinema industry's forgotten pioneers.” 


	Filming on the series, entitled Alice, will continue through December across France, Belgium, and Canada.




	“From Paris's Belle Époque to New-York and early Hollywood, Alice follows the remarkable journey of a visionary artist who defied conventions and expectations as a filmmaker, entrepreneur, wife, and mother,” reads a description of the project. “Her loves, her battles, and her relentless pursuit of recognition unfold against the birth of modern cinema.”

	Academy Award nominee Bejo (The Artist, The Past, OSS 117, Under Paris) stars alongside Thibaut Evrard (Differente, Escort Boy, No Man's Land, Paris Police 1900) as mentor Léon Gaumont, Oscar Lesage (The Count of Monte-Cristo, The Substance, Marie-Antoinette, The Crown) as her husband and partner Herbert Blaché, Irène Jacob (Liaisons, The Affair, 3 Colors Red) as her mother Marie, and Yannick Choirat (Under Paris, Home Jacking, A Damaged Man) as rival Charles Pathé.

	











	The cast also includes Marc Barbé (Paris Police 1900), Steve Driesen (Case 137), Sophie Nélisse (Yellowjackets), François Arnaud (Yellowjackets, The Borgias), and Vincent Leclerc (Dumas). 


	Created by Tim Loane (Versailles Seasons 3, Marcella, Das Boat) and Claire Lemaréchal (currently showrunning OSS 117 spin-off for Canal Plus and Apple's Drops of God season 2) and co-written with André Gulluni (Rematch), Alice is co-directed by Virginie Verrier (Marinette) and Guillaume Lonergan (Empathie). The series is co-produced by HBO Max and France Télévisions, with Wild Bunch, Palermo Production, Panache Productions & La Compagnie Cinématographique in Belgium, and Sphere Media in Canada.


	“Alice is an ambitious, long-anticipated drama, first announced four years ago,” said Manuel Alduy and Morad Koufane of France Télévisions. “It celebrates the extraordinary journey of a woman who lived many lives —a cinema pioneer, a passionate lover, a mother, and a bold entrepreneur. Her story is as cinematic as the art form she helped create and we want to finally give her the recognition she was denied for over a century.”


	Guillaume Le Gros of HBO Max added: “We are proud to partner with France Télévisions, Wild Bunch, and Palermo Production on this deeply human story that brings to light the French pioneer of world cinema long erased from history. Her strength of character, artistic vision, and fierce determination remain profoundly inspiring today. Alice perfectly reflects our commitment to telling universal, powerful and uplifting stories — while partnering with local talent to bring them to audiences worldwide.”

	











	Said producers Grégory Strouk of Wild Bunch and Caroline de Jenlis of Palermo Production: “We're thrilled to launch the first-ever scripted series on Alice Guy Blaché, the world's first female filmmaker. Alice is an epic saga diving into the struggles and triumphs of an extraordinary, free-spirited woman who helped shape the birth of cinema. With a powerhouse creative team and a story as bold as it is timeless, Alice is set to inspire and captivate audiences in France and across the globe.”

It's funny to hear Toni Collette, as quirky camp counselor/sadistic prison warden Evelyn Wade, mention “fixing the problem of adolescence” just a few days before another Netflix series is set to be hailed as the year's crowning achievement in television. At Netflix, there is no problem with “Adolescence” (unless you count its truncated episode count), even if “Adolescence” is very aware of the problems faced by youths watching Netflix.

Still, the “problem” Evelyn refers to isn't the one facing Jamie Miller, and what it is, exactly, forms the knotty little question at the heart of “Wayward.” Creator Mae Martin's eight-episode mystery-thriller is certainly concerned about our teens, but the dedication to those worries ebbs and flows much like the tone shifts from detached to sympathetic. The thrills are there, but muted. The mystery is functional, but short on “wow” moments. Martin's first stab at the genre can't help but feel like a comedian's interpretation — commenting from the outside looking in, rather than investing wholeheartedly. As a result, “Wayward” works better when seen from a remove than at the edge of your seat, which is fine, so long as you adjust your posture to make space for its handful of allegorical interpretations.

Told from two primary perspectives, “Wayward” follows Alex Dempsey (Martin), a cop from Detroit who moves to his wife's (fictional) hometown of Tall Pines, Virginia. Laura (Sarah Gadon) is pregnant, Alex is looking for a fresh start, and together they've been gifted a spacious house in the country by the unofficial local leader, Evelyn Wade (Collette). Turns out Laura used to be a student at Evelyn's academy, a local boarding school for “troubled teens,” and the two have maintained a familial connection ever since.

 










Their candid yet testy relationship is the first clue Alex gets that there may be things he doesn't know about his wife's upbringing, and “Wayward” strings those clues out a little past their limits. Still, the vibes are immediately unsettling, thanks to how quickly everyone in town knows who they are, where they're from, and all about the baby they're having. Or it could be the bloody kid who comes bursting out of the woods to kick off Alex's first shift on the force.

From there, Alex can't help but look into Evelyn's operation — his job demands it (even if his fellow officers show little interest), and Laura's past proves too personally tantalizing to leave buried — but our clearest view of the isolated institution comes from our two other leads, Abbie (Sydney Topliffe) and Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind). Best friends at their Toronto high school, the teens soon end up in Tall Pines by avenues best left unspoiled, but they're both determined to escape as soon as they arrive.

Why? Well, for one, the go-to induction method is being roused from your bed in the middle of the night, hog-tied, and tossed in a van. Once your supervised shower is over and you've donned the denim-blue uniform reminiscent of old prison garb, there's the dehumanizing nomenclature to contend with: Staff members are referred to by animal names, like “Rabbit” and “Mule.” Inmates Students aren't allowed to touch each other, with ugly exceptions: Guards can manhandle you as much as they want, but a friend's comforting hug or pat on the back means you have to spend the night on the concrete floor. Ratting out your roommates — or any fellow kids — is strongly encouraged.

 










Then there are the therapy sessions themselves, but those needn't be spoiled either. “Wayward” is filled with curious details that help establish a consistently creepy atmosphere, even if it falls short of evoking a grounded reality (to better criticize the billion-dollar teen trauma industry) or a more heightened horror story (to better satisfy genre fans looking for big thrills). Instead, it falls somewhere in the middle, setting aside any biting commentary or shocking frights in favor of accessible, varied interpretations.

Martin has been open about the “ton[s] of metaphor” infused in their second Netflix series (following the searing, semi-autobiographical comedy “Feel Good”), and different viewers will likely latch onto different readings. There's a rather straightforward application in how we move from adolescence to adulthood, what (and who) we take with us, and what we choose (or are forced) to leave behind — themes that have long resonated in Martin's work. “Wayward” also serves as an allegory for gender transition (Martin is non-binary, while their character, Alex, is a trans man), and it also demonstrates the dangers of isolationism and the healing influence of community. One could even argue there's a repudiation of authoritarianism and totalitarianism, though only in the broadest strokes.

 










It can be fun to chew on whatever ideas come to mind as “Wayward” moves through its sometimes perfunctory plotting, just as certain moments, scenes, and episodes are elevated above their predictable progressions by enticing choices. A local cop's enthusiastic obsession with the dullest tasks makes for a strange and silly running joke. Episode 6, “Mirror,” is like a mini-“Lord of the Flies” crossed with a Big Flashback Episode. The students are delightfully distinct, as is Collette, who once again distinguishes a new intimidating matriarch from all her others. While it may not go down as one of the stronger cult stories sweeping television, “Wayward” has fewer problems than peculiarities. Just keep an open mind. 

“Wayward” premiered Tuesday, September 9 at the Toronto International Film Festival. All eight episodes will be released Thursday, September 25 on Netflix.

	Rosie O'Donnell wasn't at her daughter's college graduation over concerns of attacks by Donald Trump amid her public feud with the president. 


	The comedian opened up about missing the ceremony during a recent interview with Kate Langbroke for the No Filter podcast. “My daughter graduated college and I didn't go back because the security people said to me they didn't think it was wise,” the former Rosie O'Donnell Show host said of her daughter Vivienne who graduated from college earlier this year. “Because I think Trump will use me to rile his base.” 


	The comic did not specify what type of security personnel had warned her. A representative for O'Donnell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


	Back in July, Trump threatened to revoke her citizenship. Trump said that O'Donnell “is not in the best interests of our Great Country” and “I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her.”

	











	O'Donnell, who has long been critical of Trump and moved to Ireland after his re-election, fired back at the threat in a lengthy message to the president that she posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.


	“You call me a threat to humanity – but I'm everything you fear: a loud woman, a queer woman, a mother who tells the truth, an American who got out of the country b4 u set it ablaze,” O'Donnell wrote at the time. “You are everything that is wrong with America.”

	











	In an interview with Ireland's RTE at the time, O'Donnell said she “didn't take [Trump's attack] personally,” as the president is frequently picking fights with celebrities like her. O'Donnell has continued to be vocal about her contempt for Trump and his administration on social media.

	O'Donnell added on the new podcast that the first Trump administration “created a lot of problems” for her, with people confronting her on the street and in front of her child Clay, who was five years old at the time. “[Trump's] ability to denigrate people and dismiss them and humiliate them encouraged other people to do the same,” she said.

Breakups are hard, but when two people are on the same page, life gets easier. Actor Orlando Bloom and Former “American Idol” judge and pop Icon Katy Perry are proving there's no bad blood after their split. The former couple, who recently ended their nine-year relationship, showed they remain on good terms when Perry shared Bloom's new movie “The Cut” with fans.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

On September 7, Perry shared the trailer on Instagram, captioning it, “proud of you @orlandobloom.” Bloom responded with a simple heart emoji, a gesture that showed appreciation for her support.

The show of support came just days after Bloom addressed the breakup publicly. During a September 5 appearance on Today with Craig Melvin, the 48-year-old actor said he was in a good place.

“I'm great,” Bloom shared. “I'm so grateful. We've got a beautiful daughter. You know when you leave everything on the field like I did in this movie, I feel grateful for all of it.”

Bloom also made it clear that his bond with Perry remains strong. “We're gonna be great,” he said. “It's nothing but love.”

While Friday marked Bloom's first public comments about his split from Perry, the actor had previously shared uplifting quotes on his Instagram Stories on June 30, just days after news of their breakup became public.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

Bloom and Perry share a 5-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove. While Perry, 40, has not directly addressed the split, the couple's representative released a joint statement in July confirming the breakup.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

“Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on coparenting,” the rep shared. 

“They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is—and always will be—raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect.”

Bloom, who is also father to 14-year-old Flynn with ex-wife Miranda Kerr, has consistently spoken about the importance of family. Perry echoed that sentiment in an interview on Call Her Daddy, where she explained why their relationship worked for so long.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

“We want to evolve,” Perry said at the time. “That's what I think our relationship is for: to become better humans so we can raise this beautiful human being.”

Even after their romantic chapter closed, Bloom and Perry continue to show that mutual love, respect, and shared dedication to Daisy will always come first.

Jessy Lanza has announced a new EP. Slapped by My Life is out this Friday, September 12, via Hyperdub. The project features two versions of the title track, which Lanza co-produced with Pearson Sound's David Kennedy. Below, watch a video for “Slapped by My Life,” directed by and starring Lanza's husband, Winston Case.

“I wrote ‘Slapped by My Life' while my husband, Winston, was going through chemotherapy,” Lanza shared in a press statement. “The treatment cycle was relentless and he spent most of the time bedridden, so while he slept I wrote this song for him. It's been challenging to find the space to be creative since cancer came into our lives, but I knew this song would make Winston smile and that was motivation enough. Collaborating with Pearson Sound made this track exciting, too, because listening to his music has always been a serotonin rush. When I wrote ‘Slapped by My Life' I was desperate to feel something other than sadness, to escape my mind and live inside the music, even for a few minutes. I dedicate this song to my husband, Winston, and to all the caregivers. You are the ones who keep the world turning.”

Case added: “My journey through cancer has been marked with insensitivity and sorrow so harrowing it borders on comedy. I'd often find myself between laughter and despair, and I wanted the video for Jessy's song to reflect that feeling.”

Lanza's last solo release was 2023's Love Hallucination. Physical editions of Slapped by My Life will include reworks of two songs from the album: “Limbo” and “Midnight Ontario.”

This post contains spoilers for this week's episode of Alien: Earth, now streaming on Hulu.


	After last week's flashback to all the poor decisions that killed the crew of the Maginot, “The Fly” brings us back to the present-day action at Neverland, where various adults, synthetics, and eyeball monsters conspire to make life very difficult — and, in one case, impossible — for the Lost Boys. Smee complains at one point that, “Being grown-up sucks.” But it's even worse when you still have the emotional intelligence of a child, and are treated that way by the genuine grown-ups (and synths and possessed sheep) around you. 


	By the end of the episode, Isaac is dead, Nibs has had part of her memory wiped, and Slightly has been manipulated by Morrow into letting one of the face-huggers turn Arthur into a Xenomorph incubator. All of it's bad. 


	Isaac's death is a master class in suspense, and another example of how the eyeball has somehow turned out to be the scariest creature on a show featuring one of the most iconic monsters in the history of filmed entertainment. On last week's official Alien: Earth podcast, Noah Hawley explained that, contrary to my interpretation, the eyeball was trying to distract Chibuzo rather than warn her about her thermos being infected. Here, the manipulation is even more overt, as the eyeball and its ovine host set up poor Isaac to get locked inside one of the other enclosures, resulting in evidence that the Lost Boys' “immortal” bodies can still be killed under the wrong circumstances.

	Atom's order to alter Nibs' memory seems wildly shortsighted, if the plan was to keep her around the other hybrids. Of course Wendy or one of the others would quickly realize that Nibs no longer remembers the crash and its aftermath. And of course Wendy tells Nibs the truth, putting them both on guard against the manipulations of their seemingly benevolent guardians. 

	











	Earlier, Kirsh dismisses Joe's question about how best to care for Wendy, saying, “That's like an onion, asking how to care for a star.” Kirsh sees Wendy as a wholly separate entity from Marcy Hermit. That Dame Sylvia is able to so easily alter Nibs' memories — even without the help of Arthur, who gets fired for taking the moral stand that his wife won't — suggests that Kirsh is probably right. An argument could be made that the Nibs who woke up in this new body was the same person as the little girl. But once the Prodigy team starts wantonly rewriting aspects of Nibs' brain, it starts to feel like that girl is dead and has been replaced with something else.

	(That said, Dame Sylvia addresses Wendy as Marcy at one point. We don't know whether this means Dame, like Joe, believes Wendy really is Marcy, or is just trying to manipulate her most precocious, potentially troublemaking charge.)  


	Slightly, meanwhile, targets Joe as his patsy to smuggle a Xenomorph embryo out of Prodigy, still resentful that Wendy's family is here safely while his mother is far away and being threatened by Morrow. But when Joe gets pulled away by his old search-and-rescue squad mates, Slightly has to improvise and take advantage of the chaos in the lab caused by the eyeball, locking poor Arthur — one of the few adults on the island putting the Lost Boys' safety above all else — inside to get his face hugged. 


	In the midst of all this, we get an interlude with the most powerful grown-up involved, albeit one who tries to carry himself like a kid. Boy Kavalier sits down for a mediation session with Yutani and pulls off a double victory. He gets her to pay him a $20 billion settlement for the Maginot crash — a crash Kavalier himself arranged, and wound up not even having to pay for when his saboteur died — then exploits the laws about quarantine to hang onto the specimens for an additional six weeks. Hawley doesn't try to hide the tech bro allegory here, as Kavalier even paraphrases Mark Zuckerberg's “move fast and break things” motto. (The bare feet are borrowed more from Steve Jobs.) For as much as Kavalier tries to present himself as an overgrown kid, he's ruthless and calculating in a way that none of the Lost Boys are capable of being; he's more like the eyeball than he is like Wendy.

	On the way out of the mediation session, Kirsh and Morrow ride an elevator together, taking one another's measure. Kirsh is as condescending toward Morrow as he was toward Joe, viewing cyborgs as obsolete dead-ends in mankind's quest for immortality. But we've seen how capable and dangerous Morrow is. 

	











	Maybe the biggest question left by the episode is how dangerous Kirsh is — not only to Weyland-Yutani forces, but to his own. We see that he's been watching Slightly and is aware of what he's doing at Morrow's behest. And when Slightly locks Arthur inside the lab, Kirsh not only doesn't intervene, he doesn't tell Boy Kavalier about it when his boss asks if all is well. In the movies, we've seen synthetics betray their co-workers, but on behalf of their corporate overlords. Is Kirsh acting against Kavalier, or does he have a plan that we mere onions can't yet comprehend? And whatever he's doing, will Wendy or any of the show's other children be able to stop him?

	For years, politicians and the American public have clamored for more disclosures about the activities and connections of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who surrounded himself with powerful, famous friends while trafficking hundreds of young women and girls for sex with the help of his now-imprisoned accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. As yet, records from a sprawling array of court cases and a vast trove of FBI materials related to their investigation of Epstein — together colloquially known as the “Epstein Files” — have not seen the light of day.


	But on Monday, the House Oversight Committee did release select documents provided by Epstein's estate, including the terms of a 2007 nonprosecution agreement — the so-called “sweetheart” plea deal that allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges at the time — and his last will and testament. The real bombshell was a birthday scrapbook that Maxwell put together for Epstein's 50th birthday, full of doodles, poems, photos, and letters from people in his life. One such person was Donald Trump, who allegedly contributed an abstract drawing of a nude woman and an imagined dialogue between the two men that concluded, “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump and the White House denied the existence of such a letter when it was first reported on by The Wall Street Journal in July; now they claim the letter itself is fake.

	











	The president's years of close association with Epstein before they fell out sometime in the mid-2000s (the birthday book was created in 2003) have come in for renewed scrutiny during his second term as president, in part because the MAGA faithful have been particularly vocal about the need for full government transparency on Epstein, believing that this will hurt prominent Democrats and Hollywood elites rather than Trump. This has largely backfired, with Trump continually seeking to move past the Epstein story and convince his supporters that it's a dead issue while more and more details of his friendship with the financier trickle out.

	What's remarkable about the birthday book, though, is that Trump's alleged letter is hardly out of place with its creepy innuendos and suggestive sketch. In fact, the three-volume scrapbook — totaling over 200 pages — is full of such veiled references from Epstein's pals, direct commentary about his insatiable lust and countless “girlfriends,” and redacted photos of Epstein with scantily clad or partially nude women. There are also drawings that allude to his travel by private jet (his Boeing 727-100 aircraft, on which he allegedly had sex with teenage girls, has been dubbed the “Lolita Express”) and nods to his illicit behavior. A collection of limericks written by his art adviser, Stuart Pivar, for example, notes that Epstein, “though up to no good/whenever he could/has avoided the penitentiary.”


	The book has an introduction by Maxwell and is organized by categories of relatives and acquaintances, opening with a “Family” section featuring recollections from his parents and his brother, Mark Epstein. This is followed by letters from people who knew him as he grew up in Sea Gate, a private community in Coney Island, Brooklyn, in the 1950s and 1960s. One unsigned, handwritten portion by a Brooklyn friend recalls how the author, Epstein, their friend Warren Eisenstein, and Epstein's brother Mark picked up girls on the beach and took them out on a boat, where the author claims to have taken out a knife and told them to strip off their bathing suits. The same author describes himself and Epstein “in bed porking some girls” while Epstein is “shoving penicillin down my throat.” He further recounts going out with Epstein and “two very young girls probably just 17.” The typewritten letter after that, signed by a “Johnny Boy Kafka,” describes Epstein's parents conceiving him in extremely graphic detail.


	Next comes one of two separate portions titled “Girlfriends,” which leads with a letter from an acquaintance whose name is redacted. The writer states that in the 1970s, Epstein “participated in peace marches because they were the easiest places to get laid,” and joked that this was a “truly unique perspective on political activism.” There are more intimate pictures of Epstein with women whose faces are redacted, and multiple shots of him luxuriating in bathtubs, including one where his genitals appear to be censored, and another captioned “waiting for my foot massage.” In another photo, Epstein appears to be buying something from a specialty grocer — the caption is “Are you sure this will make my ‘winkie' grow?” A photo of Epstein with a woman whose face is redacted is labeled with the quote “We think he works for the CIA.” (Rumors of Epstein's links to intelligence services, while widespread, have never been substantively confirmed.) There are also pictures of Maxwell: one in which she appears to be speaking with a woman whose image is redacted, bearing the caption “He promised you what?!!” In another partially redacted image, she and Epstein appear naked in a pool, with him holding her from behind.

	Then there is a section titled “Children.” It includes a short story, in what appears to be a child's handwriting, about a character named “Uncel F” attempting to use a toilet to defecate but eliminating on the floor instead. The subsequent pages include a childlike drawing of a wedding and redacted photos of young children in bed, playing piano, and evidently posing for the camera, with captions in what appears to be Maxwell's handwriting. Epstein was not known to have fathered any children himself, though he reportedly talked about a plan to impregnate multiple women at his New Mexico ranch to seed the human race with his DNA.


	The “Friends” chapter of the birthday book, which includes the letter that Trump denies writing, is perhaps the most disturbing. It begins with a photo of what appears to be Epstein and another man in hooded masks, and text that reads in part: “Jeffrey unveiled his plan. To some it may have seemed a get-rich-quick scheme, but to me it was pure genius: Rob and Kill was the name of the plan. The first victim, to be attacked and brutally plundered (would she want more than that?) on the boardwalk in Venice Beach. Broad daylight. The dastardly thieves were never caught.” Another letter addresses Epstein as “Degenerate One” and is signed “Degenerate II.” Alan Dershowitz, the famed attorney who once counted Epstein as a client, submitted a spoof cover of Vanity Fair, tweaked as Vanity Unfair, with fake headlines speculating that Epstein was Jack the Ripper and had financed the terrorist group Al Qaeda. Dershowitz joked that he had “talked them into changing the focus” of the issue “from you to Bill Clinton.” (Clinton, too, appears in the scrapbook, with a brief scribbled note commending Epstein for his “childlike curiosity.”)


	Other friends rehashed lewd incidents and wrote of “his luxurious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum).” Nathan Myhrvold, former Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft, noted that he was “ill prepared to comment on” Epstein's lifestyle “in any detail,” and instead appended pictures from a recent trip to Africa that showed zebras and lions having sex. Joel Pashcow, former chairman of a New York real estate company, contributed clip art of an airplane and women in bathing suits. The illustration following that page includes comic-book style drawings of Epstein: in the first panel, labeled “1983,” he is shabbily dressed and offering girls balloons at a birthday party. In the second, labeled “2003,” Epstein is seen relaxing at an oceanside mansion, his private jet overhead, as he is massaged by four practically naked blonde women, one sporting a heart tattoo with the letters “JE” on her buttocks. “What a great country!” reads the text on this half of the page.

	











	Trump comes up a second time in the “Friends” collage, with Epstein seen in a photo holding a large novelty check that bears his name. “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women!” the caption says. “Sells ‘fully depreciated' [name redacted] to Donald Trump.” Epstein is posing with Pashcow, a third man, and a woman whose face is censored. (Trump in July made the remarkable claim that he and Epstein eventually parted ways because the financier “stole” spa workers from his Mar-a-Lago club.) Another letter included an illustration of breasts, with the note “I wanted to get you what you want,” and painted designs with the impression of a nipple on the page — captioned as “tit prints” and “specially commissioned” by the late economist Henry Rosovsky.   


	A followup “Girlfriends” chapter includes a letter from a woman who wrote that her life was “forever changed” after she was hired by Maxwell to massage Epstein's feet and was then ushered into his world. “With you, dear Jeffrey, I laugh like a little girl and feel like a woman,” she wrote, attaching a photo of her buttocks in a bathing suit. Another woman supplied photos of her breasts, which are redacted, as well as a bra. A third recalled how she had gone shopping with Epstein at Bloomingdale's, where he inquired if she were a virgin and then threw her “down on the floor… right smack in the middle of the shoe dept. and started kissing and tickling me all over!!” This author included a photo of herself, face redacted, in her underwear, labeled: “Visiting you down in Palm Beach… Can't get a second of privacy with you and a camera around ha ha!” Yet another woman wrote that she wanted to “cut” Epstein “into bird-head pieces and chew them between my molars until I suck all the blood and juice out of you.” Letters from supposed “Assistants” were no less salacious: like the “Girlfriends,” they included plenty of bikini shots and other winks at sexual relationships.


	One of the last shocking items in the book comes in the “Business” chapter, from Elliot Wolk, who worked at Bear Stearns when Epstein was at the investment bank in the 1970s. “Jeffrey I remember in the mid 1970s you being a star salesman for our tax advantaged strategies and hedged option program,” he wrote. “I was running an account for Bob Maxwell.” That would be the media mogul Robert Maxwell, father of Ghislaine Maxwell. “You always had the ability to know everyone and be charming,” wrote Wolk. “Was that when you first discovered the Maxwell teen-age daughter…” Officially, Epstein and Maxwell did not date until 1991. In 1976, when Epstein joined Bear Stearns, he would have been in his early twenties, while Maxwell would have been in her mid-teens.

	All told, while the “birthday book” adds to the public knowledge of Epstein's social life, it will unlikely precipitate further prosecutions, coded as it is in the various authors' oblique language and cryptic references. A few contributors have already died, some of them long before Epstein himself was found hanged in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Nevertheless, it paints a chilling picture of power and wealth, and an aristocratic clique seemingly unfazed or even amused by Epstein's proclivity for very young women. 


	MAGA conspiracists are sure to keep pressing for the release of a purely hypothetical “client list” that names people Epstein supplied with children for sex, but this is likely as close as they will ever get.

Wall explained the story while sitting down with The Art of Dialogue.

	What would rap be without iced-out grills?


	New York City jeweler Eddie Plein is often credited with inventing the gold grill as we know it back in the '80s. His early handiwork was most notably sported by Bronx rapper Just-Ice on the album cover of his sophomore project Kool & Deadly released in 1987. Plein then took his Eddie's Famous Gold Teeth operation south to Virginia, then finally settling in Atlanta, where the gold grill has become a Southern staple. During the early 2000s, Paul Wall and his business partner Johnny Dang picked up where Famous Eddie left off and took the gold grill to another level, with the duo still being the go-to jewelers for custom grills nearly two decades later.


	Wall sat down with The Art of Dialogue recently and told a story about how he ended up on Nelly‘s hit record “Grillz” and revealed it all started with the St. Louis rapper getting tricked into purchasing a custom grill that he thought was made by Dang. The Houston rapper explained that he received a call from T.I. while the Atlanta rapper was on tour with Nelly and told Wall, “Yeah, man, I see my boy Nelly got a grill from you.” However, he recalled being “confused, 'cause I'm like, ‘Man, I never met Nelly a day in my life. I'd love to make him a grill,'” and asked Tip what he was talking about.

	











	He then explained that it was a jealous rapper that was trying to creep into his and Johnny's grill business that sold one to Nelly. “‘You want a Paul Wall grill? Yeah I'll get you a Paul Wall grill. A Johnny? I'll get you a Johnny grill,'” he said of other rappers that were also trying to sell grills during that period. “What they mean is the Paul Wall-style grill or a Johnny-style grill. So that essentially is what happened. It was another person who was selling grills who basically went to Nelly and was like, ‘Hey, wanna get you some Paul Wall grills?' And he was like, ‘Yeah, I want some Paul Wall grills,' and they got him some grills but they weren't Paul Wall grills. It was in the similar style, but they weren't the same.”

	Eventually, Wall ran into the St. Lunatics at a hotel in New York, who then put him in touch with Nelly after learning that his grill wasn't made by Johnny Dang. He then said they decided to gift him a custom grill so he could see the difference between their work and the competition. “It was a helluva investment, because, let me tell you, that was hands down the most expensive grill we made to that point and it was a walking billboard, and as soon as Nelly got his grill he was like, ‘Hey, I love my grill. I got this song I'm doing. You wanna get on it?'”


	And the rest, as they say, is history.


	“Grillz” hit the top of the Billboard Hot 100, was nominated for best rap performance as a duo or group at the 2007 Grammys and further popularized the dental jewelry, making a custom grill from Paul Wall and Johnny Dang a must-have status symbol.

We're nearing the five-year anniversary of Supernatural's series finale, which capped off the show's 15-season run. Though the series ran for a whole, there were still plenty of storylines that could have and should have happened. One of those storylines I wish happened was a crossover with The Vampire Diaries, something that had been discussed in the past by both shows' creative teams. However, TVD co-creator Julie Plec shared her reason for turning it down, and I understand it.

Throughout the two CW shows' respective runs, fans wondered if the Winchester brothers would ever cross paths with the Salvatore siblings, especially since they were on the same network and were in the same genre. Via TV Insider, Plec shared in the new book I Was Feeling Epic: An Oral History of The Vampire Diaries that she didn't think it made sense at the time when the network approached the creators about a crossover.

At that point, Supernatural was in its fifth season, while Vampire Diaries was just starting out and being impacted by Twilight's success. Plec admitted, however, that her tune would have changed had the request come in later:

By the way, if that same request had come my way in Season 7, I would've been like, ‘F**k yeah.'

It's interesting to learn that Plec's mindset changed as TVD went on, even despite initially refusing because the mythology was so different. She even admitted in 2019 that a crossover between Supernatural and Legacies could happen. That particular mashup would have been entertaining, not only because both shows were so big at the time but because they also represented two different worlds. Even the casts previously discussed the possibility of that crossover happening.

But that doesn't mean it would have been a good idea. At the very least, a Supernatural and TVD crossover à la Legends of Tomorrow would have also been fun.

As a fan of both Vampire Diaries and Supernatural, I would have loved nothing more than for the two to cross paths with one another. However, aside from the fact that TVD filmed in Georgia while SPN filmed in Vancouver, mythos-wise, it would have been hard to explain some details. For instance, at the time of Supernatural's fifth season, the series was focusing heavily on the devil and Hell and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The show was also setting up what would have been the final episodes of the series.

Additionally, Supernatural has basically every form of otherworldly creature you can think of, including actual mythological gods and the actual God. TVD, on the other hand, does have its fair share of creatures such as vampires, werewolves and witches, among a few others. However, demons and Hell weren't really tackled. The show did branch out, adding more creatures as it went on. That may or may not explain why Plec wouldn't have minded doing a crossover towards the end. Still, she was right to decline at first.

Alas, with Supernatural done and The Vampire Diaries seemingly at an end as well now, a crossover doesn't seem to be in the cards. However, considering how beloved both shows are, it wouldn't be surprising if they were to be revived in some way (and I don't mean as a prequel like The Winchesters) down the road.

A newly-released video captured by a U.S. reaper drone shows a glowing orb off of the coast of Yemen. Then in the video, a Hellfire missile suddenly struck the unidentified object and bounced off of it.

Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican from Missouri, shared the video at a House Oversight hearing on Tuesday on what the military calls "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" or better known as UFOs.

The video, which is dated Oct. 30, 2024, was provided by a whistleblower and when slowed down, the missile can be seen continuing on its own path after striking the orb.

A recent government report revealed the government received more than 750 new UAP sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, leaving lawmakers digging into the mystery and national security concerns posed by the objects.

"We've never seen a Hellfire missile hit a target and bounce off," said Lue Elizondo, a former senior intelligence official with the Pentagon.

"When a hellfire makes a hit, a kinetic strike on something solid, there's usually not much left of whatever it is it's hitting," Elizondo said. "It's very, very destructive. But in the video … what seems to happen is that the missile is either redirected, or in some case, perhaps glances off the object and continues on its way."

What was not shown in the video is a second reaper drone that launched the missile.

Details remain unclear, including what the mission was. 

The U.S. military was conducting regular air strikes against Houthi targets that posed a threat to the U.S. Navy and commercial vessels. 

Pentagon officials told CBS News they have no comment.

The Defense Department in 2023 launched a website for declassified UAP information, following a House Oversight Committee held a hearing earlier that year that featured testimony from a former military intelligence officer and two former fighter pilots, who had first-hand experience with the mysterious objects.

A never-before-seen video shown during a Congressional hearing purports to depict a U.S. military drone attempting – and failing – to shoot down a mysterious "orb"-like object.

Provided by a whistleblower to a member of the U.S. House, the video was arguably the highlight of a lengthy hearing Tuesday, Sept. 9 on Capitol Hill surrounding UFOs, which the government now refers to as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP.

The hearing was the third in as many years in the halls of Congress since fiery testimony in July 2023 reignited public fascination in UFOs – not to mention the possibility that aliens are piloting them. Across the three hearings, several witnesses – including journalists and high-ranking military members – have testified under oath about shadowy military programs to retrieve and study not only interstellar alien craft, but the extraterrestrial pilots themselves.

Congress' latest foray into the topic of UAP comes amid heightened calls for transparency as legislation in the works would compel the federal government to release more information about what they've uncovered.

Here's what to know about the UAP in question, as well as the military's apparent attempt to destroy it with a so-called Hellfire missile.

The viral video provided by an anonymous whistleblower to Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Missouri appears to show a military drone attempting to shoot down an unidentified object.

Burlison presented the video publicly for the first time during Congress' latest UAP hearing, which took place Sept. 9. The video shown at the House hearing, taken Oct. 30, 2024 off the coast of Yemen, shows an unknown object Burlison referred to as an "orb" being tracked by an MQ-9 drone, also known as a Reaper, he said.

In the video, a second MQ-9 drone off screen fires a Hellfire missile that enters from the left side to make contact with the object, Burlison said at the hearing. While the mysterious craft appears damaged as smaller debris breaks off, it is able to continue on its original course after the direct hit.

"Greenlight given to engage, missile appears to be ineffective against the target," Burlison said in a post on social media site X after the hearing. He added that an independent review of the video is underway.

A Hellfire missile is an American missile first developed for anti-armor use and later developed for precision drone strikes against other targets. The weapon can be used as both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground missile, providing precision strikes against tanks, bunkers, helicopters and other targets, according to Military.com.

"The Hellfire missile is capable of defeating any known tank in the world today," Military.com claims on its website.

Witnesses at the hearing, who included three military veterans, testified to Congress that no known human technology is believed to be capable of surviving a direct hit from a Hellfire missile.

But as journalist George Knapp observed during the hearing, the missile appeared to have "bounced right off" the object in question, "and it kept going."

The video was perhaps the biggest revelation amid the latest hearing in the halls of Congress about UAP, and whether the U.S. military and the intelligence community know more than they're letting on.

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, who chairs the task force that hosted the hearing, said in a statement ahead of time that "American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings." Luna's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets was established in February 2025 and is a separate House Oversight subcommittee from the one that last held a hearing on UFOs in November.

The four witnesses who testified discussed their own first-hand experiences of seeing what they believed were UAP, as well as their knowledge of what the U.S. federal government may be unlawfully shielding from lawmakers about the phenomena.

The hearing included discussion of what the Pentagon has – and may not have – disclosed about UAP and the Department of Defense's relatively new All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO,) tasked with investigating sightings.

The hearing, Congress' third about UAP in as many years, followed the latest round of testimony Nov. 14, in which a different slate of witnesses testified about unexplained objects violating U.S. airspace and secretive programs to recover and study downed extraterrestrial spacecraft.

The Pentagon has routinely maintained that it has not found any evidence that any UAP witnessed and investigated are extraterrestrial in nature.

Oni Press is back at it again with another sci-fi tale perfect for Halloween, this time from the mind of an Ignatz Award nominated writer. FANGORIA is excited to premiere an exclusive excerpt from Little Visitor & Other Abductions, a new comics anthology all about the aftermath of one of sci-fi's biggest tropes: alien abductions. 

The new graphic novella collection comes from the mind of Szym, who wrote and illustrated the 168 page story that hits shelves this month. The anthology features a variety of sci-fi horror stories about UFO abduction, and more specifically the “negligence and malice that allows it to happen,” featuring echoes of The Twilight Zone and The X-Files. The book's full synopsis is as follows: 

The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Connecting these three stories is one horrific theme . . .

Our excerpt features the first five pages of the titular story Little Visitor, about the cast of a doomed Russian film revealing what happened on set in the days leading up to the disappearance of their young child star. Everyone has something to complain about, calling the boy selfish or difficult to work with, but it's clear something else is going on under the surface — something much more sinister. 



Little Visitor & Other Abductions is one of Szym's many projects, having been a cartoonist for the last fifteen years. His other titles include stories like Their Use Continues, Swimming Holes, A Place You Can Go, Barge, Tiny House, and more. 

Little Visitor & Other Abductions hits shelves on September 23. Check out our exclusive excerpt below:

On Tuesday, US Congress held the latest hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), the relatively new term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) of the past.

“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades. We have spent years seeking information on the assassinations of President Kennedy, Senator Kennedy, Reverend King, and other government secrets without success. It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve, which is why I am honored to lead this bipartisan task force that seeks truth and transparency,” Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who led the hearing, said in a statement ahead of it.

“We will also investigate UAPs/USOs, the Epstein client list, COVID-19 origins, and the 9/11 files. We will work alongside President Trump and his cabinet members to deliver truth to the American people. From this moment forward, we will restore trust through transparency.”

During these hearings in the past, various videos from military and navy personnel have been shown, appearing to show unidentified phenomena captured on camera. Yesterday's hearing was no exception. 

In one particularly intriguing video, reportedly taken on 30 October 2024 by an American MQ-9 drone, an orb can be seen traveling off the coast of Yemen. Before long, a missile launched from a second, unseen drone can be seen apparently hitting the unidentified object, to little effect.

"That's a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off - and it kept going," as UAP journalist George Knapp put it during the meeting, adding, "there are servers where there's a whole bank of these kind of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see.”

     

“It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” Representative Eric Burlison, who released the footage, said during the hearing. “I'm not going to speculate what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from this information?”

According to Burlison, the footage was given to him by a whistleblower. Though certainly unusual and so far unexplained, that doesn't mean it is extraterrestrial in origin, or some kind of hidden human tech. Similar videos, particularly the infamous "Go Fast" video shot in 2015 have shown spherical objects moving at apparent high speed. 

     

The Go Fast video was eventually determined to be a weather balloon by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). According to the investigation, the object only appeared to move so quickly due to the angle the video was shot at, and a parallax effect. The new footage could have a similarly mundane explanation, though we will have to wait for further investigations to take place.

Other incidents were discussed in Congress, including one witnessed by U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins, who claimed to see an unusual object whilst serving on the USS Jackson in 2023.

“What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones, as they appear on our system. A self-luminous Tic Tac-shaped [object] emerged from the ocean before linking up with three other similar objects. The orb then disappeared simultaneously with a high, synchronized, near-instantaneous acceleration,” Wiggins said during the hearing, adding that there was no associated sonic boom, but that it was picked up by radar and other sensors.

“To be clear, I am not here to make claims beyond my lane,” Wiggins added. “I am here to provide a firsthand account of what I saw, what our systems recorded, and why it matters for safety, for intelligence and public confidence.”

Further hearings will be held on UAPs in the future, hopefully shedding a little more light on the assorted phenomenon, and the US government's interest in it.

Geologists have uncovered the ancient traces of a meteorite impact and subsequent tsunami that hit North Carolina's Sandhills, shedding light on Earth's tumultuous past.

Geologists in North Carolina's Sandhills have uncovered direct evidence of a late Eocene meteorite impact and tsunami, linked to the Chesapeake Bay impact structure. Led by G. Robert Ganis, this discovery sheds light on the long-term effects of extraterrestrial impacts on Earth's surface and ecosystems. The study, published in Southeastern Geology, highlights iridium spikes and shocked quartz as key evidence of the event.

The heart of this remarkable discovery lies within the Paint Hill area of Moore County, North Carolina, where geologists identified a series of distinct geological layers documenting the aftermath of a meteorite impact. These layers, which were deposited in a shallow channel carved into older Eocene sands and clays, provide a clear timeline of the catastrophic event and its aftermath. The formation, now named the Mount Helicon Formation, includes four key beds that track the timeline from the meteorite impact to the tsunami that followed.

Bed 1 is marked by 17 inches of dark, sandy clay, rich in carbon glass and rock fragments, with an iridium concentration that far exceeds typical crustal levels. This elevated concentration of iridium, ranging between 14 and 18 parts per billion, is a hallmark of extraterrestrial material, as iridium is common in meteorites but rare in Earth's crust. This layer captures the initial moments of impact, as fine debris and carbon-rich materials settled into the channel after the event.

Bed 2, about 3.5 inches thick, is composed of silt and small agglutinated pellets that resemble accretionary lapilli, which are typically formed during meteorite impacts. These particles, which are poorly understood in the context of meteorite impacts, are key evidence of the violent atmospheric disturbances caused by the celestial collision. As noted by M. S. Huber from the University of Vienna, meteorite-generated accretionary lapilli “are not well studied,” but this discovery adds crucial new data to the body of research on these rare formations.

Bed 3 contains a 2.4-inch breccia, a chaotic mixture of marine and terrestrial fragments, including fossil-bearing chert, rolled chunks of older strata, petrified wood, and hardened paleosol (soil layers). The mix of materials suggests a powerful surge of water that swept across the land, likely associated with the tsunami that followed the impact. The breccia in this layer, combined with the marine and terrestrial debris, speaks to the forceful nature of the event that reshaped the region.

Bed 4 is composed of 6 inches of coarse sand, which is thought to represent a later pulse or backwash from the tsunami. Its erosive base and swirled structures suggest the oscillating flow of water, characteristic of tsunami activity, confirming the immense energy unleashed by the impact event.

The Paint Hill impact deposits have been linked to the Chesapeake Bay impact crater, located about 235 miles to the northeast. The U.S. Geological Survey has described this impact crater as “the largest known impact crater in the United States and the seventh largest known on Earth.” This buried late Eocene crater is believed to have ejected debris far across the region, sending powerful waves of water inland and triggering a massive tsunami. The debris found in Paint Hill aligns perfectly with the characteristics expected from such an event, offering clear evidence that the region was deeply affected by the impact.

The association between the Chesapeake Bay impact and the geological evidence at Paint Hill provides valuable insights into the long-range effects of extraterrestrial impacts. It demonstrates how the energy from such an event could travel far beyond the immediate impact zone, causing significant geological upheaval even hundreds of miles away.

One of the key features of the Paint Hill deposits is the elevated levels of iridium found in the impact beds. Iridium is a rare metal on Earth, commonly associated with meteorites and asteroids, and its presence at Paint Hill serves as a strong indicator of extraterrestrial material. Similar iridium spikes were linked to the Chicxulub impact event, which is associated with the mass extinction of the dinosaurs approximately 66 million years ago.

In addition to iridium, the presence of shocked quartz further supports the impact hypothesis. Shocked quartz forms under extreme pressure, such as that generated during a meteorite collision, and is a recognized indicator of extraterrestrial impacts. While shocked quartz grains have been documented in regions like east-central Georgia, the findings at Paint Hill provide more evidence of the widespread effects of the Chesapeake Bay impact.

The Paint Hill discovery offers significant contributions to our understanding of Earth's ancient history and the role of extraterrestrial impacts in shaping the planet's surface. The clear sequence of impact-related deposits not only supports the link to the Chesapeake Bay impact crater but also provides valuable data for correlating Eocene strata across the region. Geologists now have a unique marker bed in the Mount Helicon Formation that enhances the understanding of ancient sea-level changes and shoreline dynamics.

As scientists continue to study these deposits, they will uncover more details about the impact event and its long-lasting effects on the Earth. By combining the evidence of iridium, accretionary lapilli, and tsunami deposits, this discovery helps fill gaps in the scientific understanding of ancient impact events and provides crucial data for future research on extraterrestrial impacts and their consequences.

A resident in New York state reported an object that they described as large and fast moving, that suddenly shot straight up in the sky. The sighting allegedly occurred late morning August 15, as the person says they were sitting on their front porch in upstate New York.

Sightings like these tap into New York's long history of so-called UFO phenomena, and once again raises the question if the source is some sort of otherworldly object, or simply something like military aircraft, or a natural occurrence?

A resident living in Syracuse filed a report to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center that they witnessed an object at "airliner height", that they said moved north to south at a high rate of speed.

The encounter happened August 15, as the witnesses say the object "slowed down to zig zag", and then "appeared to stop or slow down enough that it looked stationery then it went vertical and out of sight.".

The witness estimated that the object was at least 35,000 feet above.

New York has a long history with unidentified flying objects, as the state ranks 5th overall for sightings across the United States. It's no secret New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings.

As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

On Aug. 28, I received a string of messages about the Joint Agriculture Committee meeting in Casper. What should have been a discussion of Wyoming's water future turned into a debate over “chem trails,” a conspiracy theory claiming that airplanes are spraying chemicals to control the weather or even harm people.

The meeting wasn't a fringe gathering, but the convening of the Agriculture Committee of the Wyoming Legislature, the very group of people who should be conducting serious business to support agriculture in Wyoming. But instead of a critical policy discussion, we got internet conspiracies.

The Colorado River Basin is at a near-crisis point with water levels dropping, reservoirs shrinking and the river getting drier. In an effort to stretch water supplies, all seven Colorado River Basin states, including Wyoming, have instituted “cloud seeding” efforts, a process of dispersing microscopic particles of silver iodide into clouds by plane or ground-based means to boost snow production from clouds.

But rather than building on this proven tool, Rep. Schmid brought a proposal to the Joint Ag Committee to ban cloud seeding in Wyoming for the next 10 years. In the past, he has argued that cloud seeding is unsafe and could be harming bighorn sheep populations in the Wind River Mountains. However, experts from the Wyoming Water Development Commission testified that silver iodide levels are undetectable above natural background amounts and pose no health risk. Studies in Wyoming and neighboring states also show that cloud seeding does increase precipitation, and it is cost effective.

What started as a serious discussion about strengthening Wyoming's snowpack in a water-hungry basin quickly veered off course and unraveled into talk of “chem trails.” Freedom Caucus members, their allies in the Senate and their chosen “experts” testified that crisscrossed jet trails were proof of chemicals being sprayed to dim the sun. In reality, these so-called chem trails are nothing more than jet contrails, mainly water vapor, and a conspiracy theory that scientists repeatedly have debunked.

Yet, without any real facts, the Joint Ag Committee forged ahead with bill draft requests to ban both cloud seeding and chem trails in Wyoming, despite objections by Sen. Crago and Reps. Eklund, Provenza, Banks and Davis.

This is the Ag Committee, and its job is to help Wyoming agriculture.

So, how does banning cloud seeding help replenish our reservoirs? How does chasing conspiracy theories help a single rancher or farmer?

It doesn't.

What it does do is turn cloud seeding into collateral damage in a much bigger war the Freedom Caucus is waging against reason, common sense and our basic ability to discern the truth. Cloud seeding is not a silver bullet for Wyoming's water challenges. Still, it is a practical, science-based tool and certainly not a Trojan Horse sent by the government to poison wildlife or humanity.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on shocking allegations about the flying objects on 'Special Report.'

A House hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) stunned lawmakers when video evidence showed a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at an orb off Yemen—only for the object to remain intact and keep moving, raising urgent questions about technology beyond known military capabilities.

At a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on UFO transparency and whistleblower protection, Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., unveiled the video.

The footage showed an MQ-9 drone tracking a UAP orb as another MQ-9 launched a Hellfire missile at it. The missile struck the orb, but instead of destroying it, the round appeared to "bounce right off."

"That's a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and [it] just bounced right off, and it kept going," journalist George Knapp said. "There are servers where there's a whole bank of these kind of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see."

Lawmakers and witnesses stressed that no known U.S. technology could withstand a Hellfire strike.

"Are you aware of anything in the U.S. arsenal that can split a Hellfire missile like this…and do whatever blob thing it did, and then keep going?" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., asked each witness.

Nuccetelli and Wiggins testified that no U.S. technology is capable of surviving such a strike.

Nuccetelli described the "Vandenberg Red Square," a 2003 incident at what is now Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. At the time, it was still an Air Force installation.

He recalled hearing chaos unfold over the radio. His friend screamed, "It's coming right at us! It's coming right for us!" Just moments later, he said he heard them say the object "shot off and was done."

Wiggins also recalled a "Tic Tac" encounter, noting the craft showed no "conventional propulsion signatures" as it left.

House lawmakers urged Congress to pass proposed legislation and pursue further actions to shield whistleblowers with information about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) from any retaliation, after current and former U.S. military officials shared new details about their alleged encounters on active duty with baffling orbs and craft that appeared to eclipse existing weapons and technology.

“What we saw changed our lives — the way we think about everything. It was incredibly profound,” Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli said.

He provided testimony on Tuesday alongside other military veterans and oversight experts at the first UAP-focused hearing convened by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

“In general, we need more, stronger protections for everyone as a whole. But there is a different case in point for UAP whistleblowers specifically,” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), who chairs that task force, told DefenseScoop after the hearing. 

The U.S. government has a turbulent history associated with its handling of data and reports about UAP — a modern term for UFOs that accounts for transmedium objects — and records documenting those incidents. Pursuits to compel more transparency and oversight have continued to emerge over the last several years, largely due to mounting public pressure and congressional mandates.

At a high level, the Pentagon's mechanisms to study what it now refers to as UAP have taken different forms over the decades. The most recent iteration — the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO — was set up under the Biden administration in 2022 to fulfill a mandate from the National Defense Authorization Act.

AARO achieved full operational capacity in 2024. Since its inception, government officials have been secretive about the office's projects and caseload of dozens of open investigations.

Luna is part of a small group of policymakers who have been steadily prioritizing whistleblower hearings, public engagement sessions and other legislative efforts to promote more accountability and disclosure from the Intelligence Community and other government agencies regarding UAP.

“The [prior hearings] were under committees of different jurisdiction. And so you're seeing that there's a massive bipartisan support for this, specifically in this task force,” she told DefenseScoop. “And we'll continue to turn over and flip over the rocks.”

The panel of witnesses who testified on Tuesday shed new light on some previously-reported UAP incidents observed near military assets and installations, and presented new allegations of secrecy and retaliation.

Nuccetelli, a former military police officer who served 16 years in the Air Force, pointed to multiple possible UAP incursions between 2003 and 2005 near Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, (the installation is now known as Vandenberg Space Force Base), when officials were conducting high-stakes launches for the National Reconnaissance Office. According to Nuccetelli, massive objects that appeared “like flying buildings” approached military personnel, and pulsed and moved in strange ways.

He asked lawmakers to fund independent research for UAP and end secrecy and over-classification across the government.

“Each incident was witnessed by multiple personnel, documented, investigated and reported up the chain of command. We sent information up, but we got no guidance down on how to handle these events,” he said.

Another Air Force veteran who testified for the first time on Tuesday, Dylan Borland, told lawmakers he faced severe retaliation after coming forward about his alleged experience with a UAP at Langley Air Force Base in 2012, and related information he uncovered in its aftermath.

“Because of my direct knowledge of the reality of certain legacy UAP programs, my professional career was deliberately obstructed, and I have endured sustained reprisals from government agencies for more than a decade,” Borland said, alleging that he was subject to workplace harassment, efforts to undermine his ability to be employment for classified work, and other forms of mistreatment.

Notably, Tuesday's hearing also marked the first time an active-duty Navy official testified publicly before Congress about an incident involving UAP. U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins, who has 23 years of service, spoke in a personal capacity at the hearing about an incident that occurred in 2023 while he was serving aboard the USS Jackson.

“What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones, as they appear on our system. A self-luminous Tic Tac-shaped [object] emerged from the ocean before linking up with three other similar objects. The orb then disappeared simultaneously with a high, synchronized, near-instantaneous acceleration,” Wiggins told lawmakers.

He said there was no sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures — but the objects were detected on multiple sensors, including radar. 

“To be clear, I am not here to make claims beyond my lane,” Wiggins said. “I am here to provide a firsthand account of what I saw, what our systems recorded, and why it matters for safety, for intelligence and public confidence.”

He urged Congress to impel sensor standardization and personnel training to ensure the best data can be captured by the Navy in real-time. Wiggins also asked the lawmakers to reinforce witness protection efforts, and encouraged the military to maintain “confidential de-stigmatized channels” for UAP reports and associated data.

“Sailors need to know that reporting UAP encounters will not harm their careers,” Wiggins said.

During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO) unveiled video footage publicly for the first time that he said showed a U.S. military MQ-9 drone firing a Hellfire missile at a high-speed orb off the coast of Yemen in October 2024. The UAP appeared to be hit, but not destroyed.

“It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” Burlison said. “I'm not going to speculate what it is. But the question is, why are we being blocked from this information?”

Other witnesses on the panel — UAP journalist George Knapp, and Joe Spielberger, who serves as senior policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) — also called for Congress to continue its push for investigations and legislation to spark more transparency. 

“The secret is out. I mean, how many videos [of UAP] have there been?” Knapp said.

In an interview Monday ahead of the hearing, Spielberger noted that he hoped it would “restart serious bipartisan conversations” to strengthen disclosure channels and protections for all national security whistleblowers.

“The misdeeds that they expose can often have a direct impact on public safety, civil liberties and the security of our country. That makes them incredibly important to keeping our government accountable. When they speak up and do the right thing, the American people benefit,” Spielberger told DefenseScoop.
