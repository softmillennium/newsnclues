One of those storylines I wish happened was a crossover with The Vampire Diaries, something that had been discussed in the past by both shows' creative teams. At that point, Supernatural was in its fifth season, while Vampire Diaries was just starting out and being impacted by Twilight's success. Plec admitted, however, that her tune would have changed had the request come in later: It's interesting to learn that Plec's mindset changed as TVD went on, even despite initially refusing because the mythology was so different. She even admitted in 2019 that a crossover between Supernatural and Legacies could happen. That particular mashup would have been entertaining, not only because both shows were so big at the time but because they also represented two different worlds. But that doesn't mean it would have been a good idea. At the very least, a Supernatural and TVD crossover à la Legends of Tomorrow would have also been fun. As a fan of both Vampire Diaries and Supernatural, I would have loved nothing more than for the two to cross paths with one another. However, aside from the fact that TVD filmed in Georgia while SPN filmed in Vancouver, mythos-wise, it would have been hard to explain some details. Additionally, Supernatural has basically every form of otherworldly creature you can think of, including actual mythological gods and the actual God. TVD, on the other hand, does have its fair share of creatures such as vampires, werewolves and witches, among a few others. The show did branch out, adding more creatures as it went on. Alas, with Supernatural done and The Vampire Diaries seemingly at an end as well now, a crossover doesn't seem to be in the cards. However, considering how beloved both shows are, it wouldn't be surprising if they were to be revived in some way (and I don't mean as a prequel like The Winchesters) down the road.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on:  September 10, 2025 / 12:53 PM EDT / CBS News Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican from Missouri, shared the video at a House Oversight hearing on Tuesday on what the military calls "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" or better known as UFOs. The video, which is dated Oct. 30, 2024, was provided by a whistleblower and when slowed down, the missile can be seen continuing on its own path after striking the orb. A recent government report revealed the government received more than 750 new UAP sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, leaving lawmakers digging into the mystery and national security concerns posed by the objects. But in the video … what seems to happen is that the missile is either redirected, or in some case, perhaps glances off the object and continues on its way." Details remain unclear, including what the mission was. The U.S. military was conducting regular air strikes against Houthi targets that posed a threat to the U.S. Navy and commercial vessels. Pentagon officials told CBS News they have no comment. The Defense Department in 2023 launched a website for declassified UAP information, following a House Oversight Committee held a hearing earlier that year that featured testimony from a former military intelligence officer and two former fighter pilots, who had first-hand experience with the mysterious objects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across the three hearings, several witnesses – including journalists and high-ranking military members – have testified under oath about shadowy military programs to retrieve and study not only interstellar alien craft, but the extraterrestrial pilots themselves. Congress' latest foray into the topic of UAP comes amid heightened calls for transparency as legislation in the works would compel the federal government to release more information about what they've uncovered. Here's what to know about the UAP in question, as well as the military's apparent attempt to destroy it with a so-called Hellfire missile. The video shown at the House hearing, taken Oct. 30, 2024 off the coast of Yemen, shows an unknown object Burlison referred to as an "orb" being tracked by an MQ-9 drone, also known as a Reaper, he said. While the mysterious craft appears damaged as smaller debris breaks off, it is able to continue on its original course after the direct hit. "Greenlight given to engage, missile appears to be ineffective against the target," Burlison said in a post on social media site X after the hearing. He added that an independent review of the video is underway. A Hellfire missile is an American missile first developed for anti-armor use and later developed for precision drone strikes against other targets. The weapon can be used as both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground missile, providing precision strikes against tanks, bunkers, helicopters and other targets, according to Military.com. Witnesses at the hearing, who included three military veterans, testified to Congress that no known human technology is believed to be capable of surviving a direct hit from a Hellfire missile. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, who chairs the task force that hosted the hearing, said in a statement ahead of time that "American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings." Luna's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets was established in February 2025 and is a separate House Oversight subcommittee from the one that last held a hearing on UFOs in November. The four witnesses who testified discussed their own first-hand experiences of seeing what they believed were UAP, as well as their knowledge of what the U.S. federal government may be unlawfully shielding from lawmakers about the phenomena. The hearing included discussion of what the Pentagon has – and may not have – disclosed about UAP and the Department of Defense's relatively new All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO,) tasked with investigating sightings. The hearing, Congress' third about UAP in as many years, followed the latest round of testimony Nov. 14, in which a different slate of witnesses testified about unexplained objects violating U.S. airspace and secretive programs to recover and study downed extraterrestrial spacecraft. The Pentagon has routinely maintained that it has not found any evidence that any UAP witnessed and investigated are extraterrestrial in nature.</p>

We have spent years seeking information on the assassinations of President Kennedy, Senator Kennedy, Reverend King, and other government secrets without success. It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve, which is why I am honored to lead this bipartisan task force that seeks truth and transparency,” Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who led the hearing, said in a statement ahead of it. From this moment forward, we will restore trust through transparency.” During these hearings in the past, various videos from military and navy personnel have been shown, appearing to show unidentified phenomena captured on camera. In one particularly intriguing video, reportedly taken on 30 October 2024 by an American MQ-9 drone, an orb can be seen traveling off the coast of Yemen. "That's a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off - and it kept going," as UAP journalist George Knapp put it during the meeting, adding, "there are servers where there's a whole bank of these kind of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see.” Though certainly unusual and so far unexplained, that doesn't mean it is extraterrestrial in origin, or some kind of hidden human tech. Similar videos, particularly the infamous "Go Fast" video shot in 2015 have shown spherical objects moving at apparent high speed. The new footage could have a similarly mundane explanation, though we will have to wait for further investigations to take place. Other incidents were discussed in Congress, including one witnessed by U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins, who claimed to see an unusual object whilst serving on the USS Jackson in 2023. “What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones, as they appear on our system. A self-luminous Tic Tac-shaped [object] emerged from the ocean before linking up with three other similar objects. The orb then disappeared simultaneously with a high, synchronized, near-instantaneous acceleration,” Wiggins said during the hearing, adding that there was no associated sonic boom, but that it was picked up by radar and other sensors. “I am here to provide a firsthand account of what I saw, what our systems recorded, and why it matters for safety, for intelligence and public confidence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geologists have uncovered the ancient traces of a meteorite impact and subsequent tsunami that hit North Carolina's Sandhills, shedding light on Earth's tumultuous past. Geologists in North Carolina's Sandhills have uncovered direct evidence of a late Eocene meteorite impact and tsunami, linked to the Chesapeake Bay impact structure. Led by G. Robert Ganis, this discovery sheds light on the long-term effects of extraterrestrial impacts on Earth's surface and ecosystems. The study, published in Southeastern Geology, highlights iridium spikes and shocked quartz as key evidence of the event. These layers, which were deposited in a shallow channel carved into older Eocene sands and clays, provide a clear timeline of the catastrophic event and its aftermath. Bed 1 is marked by 17 inches of dark, sandy clay, rich in carbon glass and rock fragments, with an iridium concentration that far exceeds typical crustal levels. This elevated concentration of iridium, ranging between 14 and 18 parts per billion, is a hallmark of extraterrestrial material, as iridium is common in meteorites but rare in Earth's crust. Bed 2, about 3.5 inches thick, is composed of silt and small agglutinated pellets that resemble accretionary lapilli, which are typically formed during meteorite impacts. These particles, which are poorly understood in the context of meteorite impacts, are key evidence of the violent atmospheric disturbances caused by the celestial collision. As noted by M. S. Huber from the University of Vienna, meteorite-generated accretionary lapilli “are not well studied,” but this discovery adds crucial new data to the body of research on these rare formations. Bed 3 contains a 2.4-inch breccia, a chaotic mixture of marine and terrestrial fragments, including fossil-bearing chert, rolled chunks of older strata, petrified wood, and hardened paleosol (soil layers). Bed 4 is composed of 6 inches of coarse sand, which is thought to represent a later pulse or backwash from the tsunami. Its erosive base and swirled structures suggest the oscillating flow of water, characteristic of tsunami activity, confirming the immense energy unleashed by the impact event. The U.S. Geological Survey has described this impact crater as “the largest known impact crater in the United States and the seventh largest known on Earth.” This buried late Eocene crater is believed to have ejected debris far across the region, sending powerful waves of water inland and triggering a massive tsunami. It demonstrates how the energy from such an event could travel far beyond the immediate impact zone, causing significant geological upheaval even hundreds of miles away. Iridium is a rare metal on Earth, commonly associated with meteorites and asteroids, and its presence at Paint Hill serves as a strong indicator of extraterrestrial material. Shocked quartz forms under extreme pressure, such as that generated during a meteorite collision, and is a recognized indicator of extraterrestrial impacts. While shocked quartz grains have been documented in regions like east-central Georgia, the findings at Paint Hill provide more evidence of the widespread effects of the Chesapeake Bay impact. Geologists now have a unique marker bed in the Mount Helicon Formation that enhances the understanding of ancient sea-level changes and shoreline dynamics. As scientists continue to study these deposits, they will uncover more details about the impact event and its long-lasting effects on the Earth. By combining the evidence of iridium, accretionary lapilli, and tsunami deposits, this discovery helps fill gaps in the scientific understanding of ancient impact events and provides crucial data for future research on extraterrestrial impacts and their consequences.

A resident in New York state reported an object that they described as large and fast moving, that suddenly shot straight up in the sky. The sighting allegedly occurred late morning August 15, as the person says they were sitting on their front porch in upstate New York.

Sightings like these tap into New York's long history of so-called UFO phenomena, and once again raises the question if the source is some sort of otherworldly object, or simply something like military aircraft, or a natural occurrence?

A resident living in Syracuse filed a report to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center that they witnessed an object at "airliner height", that they said moved north to south at a high rate of speed.

The encounter happened August 15, as the witnesses say the object "slowed down to zig zag", and then "appeared to stop or slow down enough that it looked stationery then it went vertical and out of sight.".

The witness estimated that the object was at least 35,000 feet above.

New York has a long history with unidentified flying objects, as the state ranks 5th overall for sightings across the United States. It's no secret New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings.

As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Aug. 28, I received a string of messages about the Joint Agriculture Committee meeting in Casper. What should have been a discussion of Wyoming's water future turned into a debate over “chem trails,” a conspiracy theory claiming that airplanes are spraying chemicals to control the weather or even harm people. But instead of a critical policy discussion, we got internet conspiracies. The Colorado River Basin is at a near-crisis point with water levels dropping, reservoirs shrinking and the river getting drier. In an effort to stretch water supplies, all seven Colorado River Basin states, including Wyoming, have instituted “cloud seeding” efforts, a process of dispersing microscopic particles of silver iodide into clouds by plane or ground-based means to boost snow production from clouds. But rather than building on this proven tool, Rep. Schmid brought a proposal to the Joint Ag Committee to ban cloud seeding in Wyoming for the next 10 years. In the past, he has argued that cloud seeding is unsafe and could be harming bighorn sheep populations in the Wind River Mountains. However, experts from the Wyoming Water Development Commission testified that silver iodide levels are undetectable above natural background amounts and pose no health risk. What started as a serious discussion about strengthening Wyoming's snowpack in a water-hungry basin quickly veered off course and unraveled into talk of “chem trails.” Freedom Caucus members, their allies in the Senate and their chosen “experts” testified that crisscrossed jet trails were proof of chemicals being sprayed to dim the sun. In reality, these so-called chem trails are nothing more than jet contrails, mainly water vapor, and a conspiracy theory that scientists repeatedly have debunked. Yet, without any real facts, the Joint Ag Committee forged ahead with bill draft requests to ban both cloud seeding and chem trails in Wyoming, despite objections by Sen. Crago and Reps. Eklund, Provenza, Banks and Davis. So, how does banning cloud seeding help replenish our reservoirs? How does chasing conspiracy theories help a single rancher or farmer? What it does do is turn cloud seeding into collateral damage in a much bigger war the Freedom Caucus is waging against reason, common sense and our basic ability to discern the truth. Cloud seeding is not a silver bullet for Wyoming's water challenges. Still, it is a practical, science-based tool and certainly not a Trojan Horse sent by the government to poison wildlife or humanity.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on shocking allegations about the flying objects on 'Special Report.' A House hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) stunned lawmakers when video evidence showed a U.S. drone firing a Hellfire missile at an orb off Yemen—only for the object to remain intact and keep moving, raising urgent questions about technology beyond known military capabilities. At a House Oversight subcommittee meeting on UFO transparency and whistleblower protection, Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., unveiled the video. The footage showed an MQ-9 drone tracking a UAP orb as another MQ-9 launched a Hellfire missile at it. "That's a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and [it] just bounced right off, and it kept going," journalist George Knapp said. "There are servers where there's a whole bank of these kind of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see." Lawmakers and witnesses stressed that no known U.S. technology could withstand a Hellfire strike. "Are you aware of anything in the U.S. arsenal that can split a Hellfire missile like this…and do whatever blob thing it did, and then keep going?" Nuccetelli and Wiggins testified that no U.S. technology is capable of surviving such a strike. U.S. Air Force Veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli, U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins, journalist George Knapp, U.S. Air Force Veteran Dylan Borland and Project On Government Oversight senior policy counsel Joe Spielberger are sworn in to testify at a U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Sept. 9, 2025. Asked if the video frightened them, all three – Nuccetelli, Wiggins and U.S. Air Force Veteran Dylan Borland – answered "yes." Beyond the Hellfire video, witnesses also shared their own UAP encounters. KLAS-TV journalist George Knapp of Las Vegas, takes his seat for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets Subcommittee hearing on "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) Transparency and Whistleblower Protection" in the Capitol Visitor Center on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025. Nuccetelli described the "Vandenberg Red Square," a 2003 incident at what is now Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. At the time, it was still an Air Force installation. He recalled hearing chaos unfold over the radio. His friend screamed, "It's coming right at us! Wiggins also recalled a "Tic Tac" encounter, noting the craft showed no "conventional propulsion signatures" as it left. Though the origins remain unknown, lawmakers pressed for answers, demanding greater transparency on UAPs. Fox News Digital's Rachel Wolf contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House lawmakers urged Congress to pass proposed legislation and pursue further actions to shield whistleblowers with information about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) from any retaliation, after current and former U.S. military officials shared new details about their alleged encounters on active duty with baffling orbs and craft that appeared to eclipse existing weapons and technology. It was incredibly profound,” Air Force veteran Jeffrey Nuccetelli said. “In general, we need more, stronger protections for everyone as a whole. But there is a different case in point for UAP whistleblowers specifically,” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), who chairs that task force, told DefenseScoop after the hearing. The U.S. government has a turbulent history associated with its handling of data and reports about UAP — a modern term for UFOs that accounts for transmedium objects — and records documenting those incidents. At a high level, the Pentagon's mechanisms to study what it now refers to as UAP have taken different forms over the decades. Luna is part of a small group of policymakers who have been steadily prioritizing whistleblower hearings, public engagement sessions and other legislative efforts to promote more accountability and disclosure from the Intelligence Community and other government agencies regarding UAP. Nuccetelli, a former military police officer who served 16 years in the Air Force, pointed to multiple possible UAP incursions between 2003 and 2005 near Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, (the installation is now known as Vandenberg Space Force Base), when officials were conducting high-stakes launches for the National Reconnaissance Office. “Each incident was witnessed by multiple personnel, documented, investigated and reported up the chain of command. Another Air Force veteran who testified for the first time on Tuesday, Dylan Borland, told lawmakers he faced severe retaliation after coming forward about his alleged experience with a UAP at Langley Air Force Base in 2012, and related information he uncovered in its aftermath. “Because of my direct knowledge of the reality of certain legacy UAP programs, my professional career was deliberately obstructed, and I have endured sustained reprisals from government agencies for more than a decade,” Borland said, alleging that he was subject to workplace harassment, efforts to undermine his ability to be employment for classified work, and other forms of mistreatment. U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins, who has 23 years of service, spoke in a personal capacity at the hearing about an incident that occurred in 2023 while he was serving aboard the USS Jackson. “What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones, as they appear on our system. A self-luminous Tic Tac-shaped [object] emerged from the ocean before linking up with three other similar objects. The orb then disappeared simultaneously with a high, synchronized, near-instantaneous acceleration,” Wiggins told lawmakers. He said there was no sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures — but the objects were detected on multiple sensors, including radar. “I am here to provide a firsthand account of what I saw, what our systems recorded, and why it matters for safety, for intelligence and public confidence.” He urged Congress to impel sensor standardization and personnel training to ensure the best data can be captured by the Navy in real-time. Wiggins also asked the lawmakers to reinforce witness protection efforts, and encouraged the military to maintain “confidential de-stigmatized channels” for UAP reports and associated data. “Sailors need to know that reporting UAP encounters will not harm their careers,” Wiggins said. During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO) unveiled video footage publicly for the first time that he said showed a U.S. military MQ-9 drone firing a Hellfire missile at a high-speed orb off the coast of Yemen in October 2024. But the question is, why are we being blocked from this information?” Other witnesses on the panel — UAP journalist George Knapp, and Joe Spielberger, who serves as senior policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) — also called for Congress to continue its push for investigations and legislation to spark more transparency. I mean, how many videos [of UAP] have there been?” Knapp said. In an interview Monday ahead of the hearing, Spielberger noted that he hoped it would “restart serious bipartisan conversations” to strengthen disclosure channels and protections for all national security whistleblowers. That makes them incredibly important to keeping our government accountable.</p>
