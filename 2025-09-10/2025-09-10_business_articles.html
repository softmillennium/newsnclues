                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 63-year-old tech executive saw her personal wealth increase by roughly $412 million in the New York Stock Exchange's first six hours of trading on Wednesday, according to a Forbes estimate. The jump is tied to the software giant's stock price, which has soared by roughly 40% after the company's Tuesday afternoon report showed a massive $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. Catz's estimated net worth is now $3.4 billion, as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Forbes — up from $3 billion at the start of the day. Oracle's stock performance has benefited co-founder Larry Ellison's net worth even more: He's now estimated to be the second-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $386.3 billion, up from $293 billion on Wednesday morning. "Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz said on Oracle's Tuesday earnings call. Oracle's growth projections come from a fast-growing cloud infrastructure business, and deals signed with several large artificial intelligence companies, she said: "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD, and many others." Under Catz's leadership, Oracle's stock is reaching record levels and a type of surge it hasn't seen since the 1999 tech boom, CNBC reported. DON'T MISS: How to build a standout personal brand—online, in person and at work She spent more than a decade working on Wall Street as an investment banker, and joined Oracle as a senior vice president in 1999. Before her CEO appointment, Catz led an aggressive mergers and acquisitions team that acquired dozens of companies during her tenure and helped propel Oracle's growth. She's credited with steering acquisitions of fierce software rivals like PeopleSoft (acquired for $10.3 billion in 2004) and Sun Microsystems ($7.4 billion in 2009), navigating major antitrust hurdles to complete both deals. During her tenure as Oracle's CEO, dating back to 2014, the company's stock price has increased by more than 800%. She currently serves on the Homeland Security Advisory Council alongside fellow CEOs like General Motors' Mary Barra, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan and Chobani's Hamdi Ulukaya, along with Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen. Some Wall Street analysts, including at Bank of America, predict that Oracle's stock price could continue climbing based on the company's revenue growth projections. On Tuesday's earnings call, analyst Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank said he and other Wall Street analysts were "in shock, in a very good way," from viewing Oracle's report. John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities said he was "blown away." Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking to a large crowd at Utah Valley University in Orem, President Donald Trump said. Kirk, 31, was shot at least once in the neck just after noon local time, about 20 minutes into his event, according to statements from UVU. A university spokeswoman said that Kirk was shot by a rifle from the Losee Center, about 200 yards away from where he had been speaking. A suspect was not in custody, according to UVU's spokeswoman. Students earlier had described an older man being taken into custody. UVU closed its campus and cancelled classes, telling people still on campus to "secure in place until police officers can escort you safely off campus." "The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. "He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Kirk, who was married with two children, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he had been in surgery before Trump announced his death. Kirk was the co-founder of Turning Point USA and head of multiple related political organizations. He was at Utah Valley University on Wednesday for the first stop on Turning Point's "American Comeback Tour," according to the group's website. The event featured Kirk seated at his "prove me wrong table," a format in which he debates with people who challenge his views. UVU is Utah's largest public university, with nearly 47,000 enrolled students as of fall 2023. Jason Chaffetz, a former Republican congressman from Utah, in an interview with Fox News said he was at the event, and that Kirk had been asked a question about "transgender shootings, mass shootings." "As soon as this shot rang out, everybody hit the deck, and then everybody started scattering and yelling and screaming, as you might imagine," Chaffetz said. I can't say I saw him get shot, but as soon as that shot went out, he fell back into his left and everybody hit the deck." "Psalm 46:1 - God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble," Erika Kirk wrote. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said, "We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot," "A great guy from top to bottom. FBI Director Kash Patel said, "Our thoughts are with Charlie, his loved ones, and everyone affected." FBI agents and Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms agents were at the shooting scene, Attorney General Pam Bondi said. "Utah Valley University is FIRED UP and READY for the first stop back on the American Comeback Tour." Kirk was scheduled to return to Utah on Sept. 30 for a similar event at Utah State University. An online petition seeking to bar Kirk from speaking at that school garnered nearly 6,900 signatures. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that he is "praying for my friend Charlie Kirk during this difficult time." Blanche said the Department of Justice "is actively investigating this senseless act of violence." Gavin Newsom wrote on X, "The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, vile, and reprehensible." "In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form," Newsom wrote. — CNBC's Erin Doherty contributed to this story. We want to hear from you.

The headliner was OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, who shared a ton of fascinating data on the AI startup's booming business. The room was packed for her talk on Tuesday. Even the overflow room was full, with many analysts and investors sitting on the floor to watch. I've never seen so many loafers and crossed legs at the same time. OpenAI is raising billions of dollars at a $500 billion valuation. Investor interest in this company's performance is intense. Here's a taste of what Friar told Wall Street.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Klarna shares popped 30% in their New York Stock Exchange debut Wednesday, opening at $52, after the Swedish online lender priced its IPO above its expected range. The company, known for its popular buy now, pay later products, priced shares at $40 on Tuesday, raising $1.37 billion for the company and existing shareholders. The offering valued Klarna at about $15 billion. The IPO marks the latest in a growing list of high-profile tech IPOs this year, suggesting increased demand from Wall Street for new offerings. Companies like stablecoin issuer Circle and design software platform Figma soared in their respective debuts. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Gemini is expected to go public later this week. "To me, it really just is a milestone," Klarna's co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday. But in the end — marriage goes on." The company has in recent months talked up its move into banking, rolling out a debit card and personal deposit accounts in the U.S. Klarna has signed 700,000 card customers in the U.S. so far and has 5 million people on a waiting list seeking access to the product, Siemiatkowski told CNBC. He added that Klarna Card represents a different proposition to rival fintech Affirm's card offering, which has attracted 2 million users since its launch in 2021. "We're attracting a slightly different audience maybe than the Affirm card," Siemiatkowski said. "I get the impression that is more a card where people use it simply to be able to have financing with interest on slightly higher tickets." In addition to Affirm, Klarna also competes with Afterpay, which was acquired for $29 billion in 2021 by Square, now a unit of Block. At its IPO price of $40, that translates to over $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, Klarna raised $222 million from the IPO. The early work, he said, was around expanding in Europe. "Being here in New York 15 years later with over 100 million consumers and over $100 billion of GMV [gross merchandise value] and close to a million merchants, it is staggering what one year after another of execution and growth and Sebastian's long-term vision can do," Reed said. Another Klarna investor hasn't been so lucky. Japan's SoftBank led a 2021 funding round in Klarna at a $46 billion valuation and has since seen the value of its stake plunge significantly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of people who were among those detained by U.S. immigration authorities while working on building an electric vehicle battery plant for Hyundai and LG Energy Solution in Georgia are expected to fly home to South Korea on a chartered plane out of Atlanta as early as Wednesday. A Korean Air Boeing 747-8I that departed from Seoul landed in Atlanta on Wednesday to collect those workers. U.S. officials have not said if or when any of the workers will be released from detention and allowed to return to South Korea. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C. Cho arrived in the United States earlier this week, intent on helping his fellow citizens return to Korea. A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told reporters Tuesday that the plan was to fly about 300 LG employees home on Wednesday, and that a detailed plan would be announced when preparations were finished. As of Wednesday at midday, however, there had not yet been any announcements about flight plans. Nonetheless, the landing of a charter plane at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport appeared to signal that the return process was underway. "Our nationals who had been detained by U.S. immigration authorities will soon be returning home," South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said Tuesday during a cabinet meeting. Lee held a friendly meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Aug. 25. But he has since blasted the controversial detention of hundreds of Korean engineers and energy specialists in the massive raid on Sept. 4. "I hope that there will never again be an unjust infringement upon the activities of our people and companies in pursuit of the shared development of South Korea and the United States," said Lee. "Our government will move quickly, through close consultations with the United States, to advance reasonable institutional improvements so that similar cases do not occur again," Lee said. American officials said last Friday that 475 people were detained after a raid Thursday at the huge site near Savannah. More than the 300 South Korean nationals were among those rounded up for allegedly lacking necessary documentation to work in the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday appealed a federal judge's order blocking him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit challenging his removal of her continues. The appeal came a day after U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb, in her decision, said, "The public interest in Federal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cook's reinstatement." Cobb also said that Cook has "made a strong showing" that Trump's purported removal of her violated the Federal Reserve Act's requirement that board governors be removed only for legal "cause." Trump announced on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook, who is the first black woman to serve as a Fed governor. The president claimed he was doing so because of allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that she committed mortgage fraud. Her attorneys have argued that Trump is using Pulte's claims as a pretext, and that her would-be removal is part of a pressure campaign by the president on the Fed to cut interest rates. Trump has appointed two of the Fed's seven governors, who participate in decisions setting interest rates. House before his appeal was filed on Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee in a part-line vote recommended that the full Senate approve Trump's nominee Stephen Miran for a Fed governor's seat left vacant by the surprise resignation of Adriana Kugler last month. If Cook is ultimately removed from the Fed, Trump would be on track to nominate a majority of the central bank's board. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A leadership shakeup is brewing within xAI's data annotation team. At least nine high-level employees appear to no longer be with the team. Their Slack accounts were deactivated over the weekend, according to screenshots seen by Business Insider. Previously, the managerial ranks included around a dozen people, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles and workers with knowledge of the team. The employee had previously worked on Tesla's Autopilot data annotation team. The company has also been scheduling one-on-one meetings with some employees, four workers said. One worker told Business Insider that the meetings have created a "sense of panic." Unlike most AI companies, which often use third-party employment agencies, xAI hires many of its US tutors directly. XAI briefly outsourced some of its work to Scale AI, but ended the partnership earlier this year, Business Insider previously reported. XAI is also working with Mercor, a recruiting and data annotation services company. Mercor confirmed the arrangement but declined to comment. Though the team works in tandem with engineers, it uses a separate Slack, called TeachX, and has different email domains. Within TeachX, AI tutors are broken into specialized groups, including science, coding, and translation. Earlier this year, the company planned to hire thousands of AI tutors, Business Insider previously reported. Since February, xAI has added around 700 workers to the data annotation team, according to a tally in the company's Slack. Musk's AI company has nine roles listed for the data annotation team, including six AI tutor roles, with pay ranges between $35 and $80 per hour. Do you work for xAI or have a tip?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2003, Ghislaine Maxwell gifted Jeffrey Epstein a scrapbook for his 50th birthday. In between memorabilia from childhood friends, heartfelt letters from family, and photos of nude women, some of the world's wealthiest men and most prominent business leaders wished Epstein a happy birthday. Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft executive and associate of Bill Gates, sent several photos of animals having sex and with erect penises. A copy of the book, which spans over 200 pages, was released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday after it was obtained from Epstein's estate. The book includes apparent messages from now-President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as from childhood friends and family members. Wide swaths of it are redacted under sections titled "Girlfriends," "Children," and "Girl-friends." Inclusion in the book is not an indication of wrongdoing. Palm Beach police didn't start investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of girls until several years after Epstein received the book, in a case that culminated in a 2008 guilty plea on prostitution charges. A jury later found Maxwell guilty of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex, and she's serving a 20-year prison sentence. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the book in July, writing that it included a "bawdy" letter from Trump with a cryptic message that said "Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," bracketed with an outline of a naked woman and the now-president's signature in the place of pubic hair. On Monday, a White House spokesperson said Trump didn't write the letter. The former Apollo Global Management CEO — and one of Epstein's only known financial clients — wrote a handwritten poem in Epstein's honor in the "friends" section. "Let's all give a cheer, for today he's Fifty!" Another rhyme reads "Blonde, Red or Brunette, spread out geographically" followed by "With this net of fish, Jeff's now 'The Old Man and The Sea,'" with "Old Man" underlined. Black has previously said he regrets his association with Epstein and wasn't aware of any sexual misconduct. An Apollo-commissioned investigation found that Black paid Epstein over $150 million between 2012 and 2017 for financial advice, including for tax maneuvers that saved him around $600 million. Black's 2003 letter appears to reference Epstein's forte with taxes: "Green eyeshades, schemes and plans, a unique tax strategy," it reads. "As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you," Epstein replies. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," Trump says. Trump's lawyers described the letter as "nonexistent" in a defamation lawsuit against the Journal after it published its story in July. On Monday, a representative for Trump's personal legal team directed Business Insider to a statement from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who described reporting about the letter as a "hatchet job." "As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it," Leavitt wrote. Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, wrote a brief note to Epstein in honor of his 50th birthday, the card shows. Underneath that text is an illustration of what appears to be a woman's breasts, followed by Wexner's signature. Wexner said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007, amid a Florida law enforcement investigation into his sexual abuse of girls. In the process, Wexner said, he learned that Epstein "had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family." Elkus was a trustee at the organization's founding in 1991. In his note to Epstein, Elkus recounted a time in 1988 when Epstein visited him in Fairfield, Iowa, where he said he was managing the money of a wealthy local family. "It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women," Elkus wrote. "But not many people know that he can create them out of thin air." In an email on Tuesday, Elkus told Business Insider the event he recalled in the birthday letter was "long before any articles ever came out about Epstein, good or bad" and that the reference to girls and hogs jokingly cited an "old folk saying." Elkus recounted in his letter that, while visiting a local bookstore, "a spectacular tall blonde woman" approached Epstein, who then "did his magic, and she ended up going home with him to New York for the weekend." "I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow arranged the whole episode through some long-distance escort service" before being proven wrong after meeting the woman in Manhattan a week later, Elkus wrote. Elkus wrote in his email to Business Insider that the story referenced in the letter was not meant to be viewed nefariously. "I did not say that Epstein did anything inappropriate (and he didn't do anything inappropriate that I could see then or at any time before or after this incident)," Elkus wrote. At the time, Myhrvold had retired from his role as Microsoft's chief technology officer and was working as the CEO of Intellectual Ventures, a firm that incubates and markets inventions. He would go on to found the global health organizations Global Good and the Institute for Disease Modeling with Bill Gates. In an introductory letter published in the "friends" part of the book, Myhrvold wrote that he "agonized long and hard about what to write." "They seemed more appropriate than anything I could put in words," he wrote. A spokesperson for Myhrvold told Business Insider that he regretted meeting Epstein. "Mr. Myhrvold knew him from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific research," the spokesperson said. A spokesman previously told The Wall Street Journal that Mhyrvold didn't recall the submission and "regularly shares photos of and writes about animal behavior." "Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure, and watching his meteoric success has given me many vicarious thrills," Greenberg wrote in his note, which was included in the book's considerably less scandalous "business" section. She said that her husband "would never say no" if he were asked to write a birthday message. Another former Bear Stearns CEO, James "Jimmy" Cayne, handwrote a brief note to Epstein. Like Greenberg's note, it was published in the "business" section. The finance exec wished him a happy birthday and added what seems to be an inside joke: "From a 'six' to another 'six.'" His daughter did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. At the time of his death, he had no publicly known wife or children. The note is followed by a photo of then-President George W. Bush with his face blurred out, as well as a mock tabloid article headlined "International funny man of history revealed as alien in disguise." Epstein and Zuckerman briefly worked together on different media ventures. The pair, along with Harvey Weinstein and other investors, led a failed bid to buy New York Magazine in the early 2000s. Epstein and Zuckerman later briefly financed the celebrity magazine Radar. Zuckerman did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the birthday letter or his relationship with Epstein. Representatives for US News & World Report, where he is the editor in chief, and Boston Properties, where he is the chairman, did not respond to requests for comment either.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A day after Ethiopia inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Egypt has renewed warnings that the project poses a serious threat to its water security. The $5 billion dam, built on the Blue Nile, is Africa's largest hydroelectric project and is expected to more than double Ethiopia's power capacity. But Cairo has long opposed it, describing the dam as a direct danger to the livelihoods of more than 100 million Egyptians who rely on the Nile River for nearly all their freshwater needs. Any significant disruption in the flow could have devastating effects on food supplies and daily life. This is why Egyptian leaders have described the GERD as an “existential threat.” Officials in Cairo argue that Ethiopia pressed ahead with filling the dam's massive reservoir without proper consultation or a legally binding agreement. Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs insists this violates international law, pointing to long-standing treaties that gave Egypt special rights over the Nile. Former members of Egypt's assessment team have also raised the alarm. Mohamed Mohey el-Deen, formerly part of Egypt's team assessing GERD's impact, told reporters that the GERD is not only about water but about stability. “A major drop in supply threatens Egypt's internal security. The stakes are economic, political, and deeply social,” he said. Egypt also claims it reserves the right to use “all available means” to protect its water interests, though so far it has avoided direct confrontation. Despite more than a decade of talks, no agreement has been reached on how the dam should be filled and operated. Ethiopia maintains that it has the right to use its own resources to fight poverty and grow its economy, while Egypt insists on guarantees that its water supply will not be harmed. Ethiopia has consistently defended the GERD as a symbol of national pride and development. “Ethiopia has no intention of harming anyone and wants the dam to be seen as a regional asset rather than a regional threat”, he declared. The government says the GERD will change this reality by doubling national electricity capacity, boosting industries, and providing power exports to neighbours such as Kenya, South Sudan, and Tanzania. Ethiopia also points out that more than 90% of the project's funding came from its own people, through state contributions, diaspora donations, and bond sales. For many Ethiopians, the dam is a matter of sovereignty and proof that the country can pursue development on its own terms, without relying on foreign donors or lenders. For Ethiopia, the dam represents a once-in-a-generation chance to transform its economy. If not, it risks deepening mistrust between neighbours and fuelling one of the continent's most enduring geopolitical flashpoints.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans. Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported. Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses. Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. "That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said. In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alphabet's life sciences unit, Verily, plans to restructure its business as it anticipates a fresh round of investment. In a town hall meeting on Monday, Verily CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily would transform from a Limited Liability Company to a C-corp, a business structure generally considered more investor-friendly, according to a person who heard the remarks and asked to remain anonymous because they were not permitted to speak to the press. Gillett told employees the change was happening as Verily anticipated a fresh round of investment and stopped short of confirming whether any investment had been secured and by whom. Employees were also told on Monday that their Verily shares were being revalued, the person said. The value of each share has been reduced by around 80% compared to its 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider. Business Insider previously reported that Verily was trying to secure a new round of funding this year. Verily last month told staff it was closing down its long-running devices business and laying off staff, Business Insider first reported. The company, which began life inside Google's moonshot lab, has been on a multi-year cost-cutting and streamlining mission. It has also been gradually detaching its technology and other dependencies on Google as it prepares to eventually spin out into an independent company no longer under Alphabet. "The path forward requires difficult decisions, but I remain confident in Verily's future and grateful for the exceptional team that will continue building it," wrote Gillett in an email to staff last month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said he has not visited Washington, D.C., since stepping down from his role at the White House DOGE office. A recording of Musk's interview was uploaded to the "All-In Podcast" YouTube channel on Tuesday. "So, if AI and robots don't solve our national debt, we are toast." Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. Musk was a huge backer of President Donald Trump during the latter's 2024 election campaign. Musk continued to run his businesses while working in government. His 130-day stint as a special government employee ended in May. In January, Musk was optimistic about what he could accomplish with DOGE. The government is "a very target-rich environment for saving money," Musk told Penn. "It's like being in a room full of targets. It is unclear just how much money DOGE saved for the federal government. In April, Musk said the cost cutting outfit was on track to cut nearly $150 billion in spending for the 2026 fiscal year. In June, Musk's relationship with the president imploded publicly after they posted heated messages to each other on X and Truth Social, respectively. Musk took aim at Trump's signature tax bill, calling it a "MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK." He also took credit for Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election. "Such ingratitude," Musk wrote in an X post on June 5. Trump had earlier threatened to cancel the government's contracts with Musk's businesses, but has since taken a more conciliatory tone with Musk. Last week, Trump said during an interview on "The Scott Jennings Show" that Musk was a "good man."</p>
