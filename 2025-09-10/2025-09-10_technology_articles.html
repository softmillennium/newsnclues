                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But on Wednesday, the company successfully landed on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $1.4 billion, largely for its existing investors, rather than itself. The fintech giant sold shares at $40, above its announced range of $35 to $37, and came out of the gate with a $15 billion valuation. Shares popped, opening at $52, though quickly settling down to around $46 mid-day. Entities controlled by Dutch billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, Silver Lake, BlackRock, and many others sold as well. Yet, often these existing investors don't want to sell at the IPO price, a VC told TechCrunch. They kick in shares to help the company meet IPO demand. In Klarna's case co-founder CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did not sell any shares. Co-founder Niklas Adalberth still owns just under 3 million shares, Klarna disclosed. Famed VC Michael Moritz wrote Klarna's first check on Sequoia's behalf in 2010, and stayed on as Klarna's chairperson even after he left Sequoia in 2023. Some drama ensued when Sequoia added another member to Klarna's board. But it eventually sorted itself out when Sequoia's Andrew Reed joined its board in 2024.“This moment feels surreal,” Siemiatkowski shared in published remarks. “When we started Klarna back in 2005, it was just a wild idea — me, Niklas, and Victor, fumbling around, trying to make shopping and payments smoother for people. We got rejected left and right, laughed at more times than I can count. But we kept going.”He continued, “Going public in New York is huge. It's proof that a bunch of stubborn dreamers from Stockholm can take on the world — and win.” That's still held by CoreWeave, which raised $1.5 billion in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I felt a sense of déjà vu as I picked up the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max—in Cosmic Orange, of course—at the “Awe Dropping” Apple Event and tried to pin down what about these new Apple smartphones felt so familiar. Then it hit me as I left the Steve Jobs Theater in a tired daze last night: the iPhone 17 Pros remind me of the MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Everything, including the large camera bump or plateau, screams “professional,” just like those 2021 MacBook Pros. And they should because Apple finally prioritized function over form, just like those MacBook Pros, which brought back the SD card slot and MagSafe charging charging. Pro users want an uncompromised gadget—or at least the closest to it—and Apple delivers it this year. In every way, they are beefed-up versions of the iPhone Pros that came before them. Again, functional design first—this supposedly improves cellular and wireless connectivity, according to Apple. I have touched the Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro. Even with a heftier design, the iPhone 17 Pros don't feel bulky. In fact, the iPhone 17 Pro Max—the Pro Max model has always been too big and heavy for me—felt lighter and thinner than it actually is. For the first time ever, I felt I could use the iPhone 17 Pro Max daily and my hands wouldn't hurt from gripping it like an old Game Boy. The curved metal frame definitely helps to make the iPhone 17 Pros feel thinner than they really are. Its size still isn't great if you care about pocketability, though. Just like I said in my iPhone Air hands-on, I'll have to test the iPhone 17 Pros to see how well the performance and battery life are, and how good the cameras are. That being said, the thicker designs also meant Apple was able to improve the thermals for sustained performance when the A19 Pro chip is pushed hard for 3D mobile gaming and GPU-intensive tasks like capturing RAW photos and videos (and editing them). If that's not prioritizing function first over form, I don't know what is. Apple, post-Jony Ive, seems to give a sh*t about this now, and I'm all for it. The ability to hold the iPhone 17 Pros vertically and take horizontal selfies (works for video, too) is a game-changer if you ask me. No more contorting my hand into a claw to hold my iPhone sideways to shoot a selfie or vlog. I also really liked the “Dual Capture” feature, which lets you record video from both the rear and front cameras. The front camera appears as a picture-in-picture box that you can move to any corner of the screen. It's going to be great for reaction videos. I also did a table wobble test. There's really not much to say about the iPhone 17… it feels like an iPhone 16 Pro, with the same size screen, but with an aluminum frame. It's the everyperson's iPhone, and I don't foresee that changing. Also touched the iPhone 17 in this Sage color.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After blocking its service in Mississippi over its new age-assurance law, the social networking startup is taking a different approach to comply with laws in South Dakota and Wyoming. Instead of requiring Bluesky to restrict access to all unverified users, users in South Dakota and Wyoming can verify their ages through the Kids Web Services' (KWS) solution. The service allows users to choose from multiple methods to verify their ages, which may include payment cards, an identity document, an anonymous face scan for facial age estimation, or other alternatives. “We believe this approach currently strikes the right balance. Bluesky will remain available to users in these states, and we will not need to restrict the app for everyone,” the company explained in a blog post published on Wednesday. That law would have required Blueksy to verify all users, not just those trying to access age-restricted content, and obtain parental consent for users under 18. Its penalties are also hefty, at up to $10,000 per user. This resulted in its unfortunate decision to bow out in the state entirely, leaving larger competitors, like Meta, to continue their dominance. By comparison, Bluesky said the laws in South Dakota and Wyoming offer a better solution. Privacy advocates also complain that the laws put users at increased risk of identity theft and are generally invasive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading professors at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering are pushing back against the prevailing narrative that job prospects for graduates are dwindling in the age of AI and tech industry layoffs. “The industry will continue to need smart, creative software engineers who understand how to build and harness the latest tools — including AI.” Balazinska said a computer science degree remains “great preparation” for a broad range of fields within and beyond technology, including the natural sciences, finance, medicine and law. Amazon hired more than 100 engineers — an all-time high — from the most recent Allen School graduating class, and Microsoft hired more than two dozen. But Amazon CEO Andy Jassy did warn this summer that corporate headcount will shrink as generative AI takes hold. Balazinska said two factors are at play regarding AI's impact on software engineering jobs: how it relates to the worker's skills, and how it relates to the job market. She said it's not so much that AI is taking jobs, but companies are having to “reset” after over-hiring during COVID and now devoting very expensive resources to the infrastructure behind AI. “Coding, or the translation of a precise design into software instructions, is dead,” Balazinska previously told GeekWire. Grossman reiterated comments made by longtime UW computer science professor Ed Lazowska on a recent GeekWire Podcast, who in turn was quoting Oren Etzioni, an AI specialist and former UW professor: “You won't be replaced by an AI system, but you might be replaced by a person who uses AI better than you.” Elsewhere in the Q&A, Balazinska and Grossman discussed why students should still major in computer science even if AI can write code; how the Allen School is preparing students for a workplace and world being transformed by AI; what awaits a student interested in computing, but not AI; and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While we've had developer and beta versions since the summer following WWDC in June, this is the first official version that brings Liquid Glass to an entirely new generation of iPhones. Among those new features are Visual Intelligence, which allows AI to both see and interact with your iPhone screen, a live translation feature that's integrated into the Messages, FaceTime, and Phone apps, and a new, streamlined Camera app that should make it easier to switch between video and still photo modes. While those might be nice to have, I'm most interested to see how people react to Liquid Glass in its final form and whether Apple's big risk on changing the face of iOS 26 pays off. It's worth noting that if you don't want the new, glassy look, you can just turn it off in accessibility settings. I, for one, am going to be giving Liquid Glass a shot, though it's nice to know that if it's not getting the job done, I can just go back to basics. Either way, this will be a big test for Apple in its effort to steer a new generation of iPhones into the future and pioneer a new look along with them. iOS 26 isn't the only platform getting a makeover, either. The rest of Apple's software is also getting a revamp, and, according to Apple, those “26” versions will also be ready on Sept 15. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of speculation, Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are finally here, and while we haven't tried them for ourselves, they look like they were worth the wait. This generation brings new hardware, features, and some impressive improvements on paper over the last generation, which was refreshed in 2023 with USB-C and a few other features. Luckily, we're here to give you a categorical breakdown that shows all of this year's improvements and what's the same as the AirPods Pro 2. When it comes to AirPods Pro, ANC is one of the most important categories, and this year's generation is no different. Apple knows that, which is why it clearly went back to the lab and took a stab at improving noise-canceling gen over gen. According to Apple, AirPods Pro 3 use “ultra-low noise microphones and advanced computational audio” to help give this generation 2x more ANC than AirPods Pro 2. That equates to 4x more ANC than the original AirPods Pro. Apple says that this year's earbuds should also improve passive noise cancellation, thanks to new ear tips that are filled with foam, creating a better seal in your ears. Apple doesn't provide specific numbers for how many dBs are cancelled by its earbuds, but from the sounds of it, AirPods Pro 3 should excel in the ANC department and maybe even give Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (my favorite buds for ANC) a run for their money. I haven't gotten to listen to AirPods Pro 3 myself yet, but Apple says its new generation boasts some improvements over the AirPods Pro 2. Behind that is a tweak to the AirPods Pro 3 architecture. Apple couples that with a new Adaptive EQ, which is designed to give the AirPods Pro 3 a better bass response and widen the soundstage. Again, this all sounds good in theory, but we've yet to hear them for ourselves. If you want to extend the battery life even longer, you can listen to the AirPods Pro 3 with transparency on (ANC off), and you'll get 10 hours of battery life on a single charge, according to Apple. There's really no subjectivity here—more battery is just better—but if you're curious, the AirPods Pro 3 improve upon the AirPods Pro 2 battery by 33 percent when it comes to ANC playback. If you're picking up on a trend, it's that AirPods Pro 3 are pretty much better across the board, but this is where they really start to pull away. Thanks to new IR sensors in the AirPods Pro 3, which are combined with the preexisting accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, these earbuds can track fitness goals, calories burned, and heart rate. According to Apple, AirPods Pro 3 will combine with its suite of fitness tools, allowing Apple Fitness+ users to see real-time performance metrics onscreen. One thing that they share, though, is Live Translation, which does exactly what it sounds like—it translates speech in real time. That's all to say that you'll be able to do basically everything you can do with AirPods Pro 2 with the AirPods Pro 3—adaptive ANC, hearing test (though the AirPods Pro 3 is allegedly better at that), transparency, and more—but with one big new features in heart rate tracking. Comfort is another huge metric for earbuds, especially if you plan to wear them for long periods or while you're exercising. Once more, Apple seems to have taken strides here with its new generation of AirPods. While both earbuds have ear tips, Apple says that it used “over 10,000 ear scans with more than 100,000 hours of user research” to tweak the fit of AirPods Pro 3. AirPods Pro 3 also come with five ear tip sizes as opposed to four. With more sizes and a redesign, it looks like AirPods Pro 3 are poised to outpace the AirPods Pro 2 in comfort, too. So, there is one thing that's the same on these two pairs of earbuds, and while that sounds like a point against the AirPods Pro 3, it's actually a big win for Apple's newest pair of AirPods. Both pairs debuted at $250, and while you can currently get the AirPods Pro 2 for $200, AirPods Pro 3 still qualify as a static entry price gen over gen. More for the same amount!

All the things that politicians previously wouldn't talk about, rightly or wrongly. "This one is different, and he really hears us!". But then rather than any sort of reform, he merely directs that anger at other powerless scapegoats - a series of revolving spectacles that leave supporters with no time for it to set in just how much they're being had, or the wide trail of societal damage in his wake.I keep waiting for even half these people who claim to care about the Constitution and individual liberty to realize how their country is being mortally wounded. How every day they waffle and continue give this societal arsonist a pass, how much worse off our country will be. But being eternally hopeful that people will come around to seeing the truth is one of my personal flaws. So the cynical part of me is just waiting for Trump to start promoting gun control again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ann Arbor tech developer May Mobility has launched its self-driving car service on the Lyft app in a section of Atlanta, Georgia. Starting today, anyone who orders a Lyft in the area might be paired with an autonomous vehicle. And in Las Vegas, Amazon subsidiary Zoox is opening up its toaster-like, purpose-built robotaxis to anyone who wants to download the company's app. Self-driving vehicle technology has had a rocky past decade, with venture funding rushing in and then out of the industry, and developers failing to hit ambitious service launch targets in the second half of the 2010s. Now, it appears, the race to drive you around without a driver is back on. In the US, sector leader Waymo is running its paid self-driving taxi service in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. Electric vehicle maker Tesla is trying to keep up with CEO Elon Musk's expansive vision of personally owned self-driving cars, and Tesla launched a small robotaxi fleet with front-passenger-seat safety monitors in Austin in June. (The service is still only open to invited riders.) In interviews with WIRED, tech leaders acknowledged that, while the public launch of a robotaxi service is a handy milestone, autonomous ride-hailing—and investors' hopes that it'll transform the global transportation industry, recouping and then banking billions in the process—still has a ways to go. Zoox and its wheeled toasters will start rolling in Las Vegas. “How do we break down the journey into bite-sized pieces, so it doesn't feel overwhelming or insurmountable?” says Jesse Levinson, the cofounder and CEO of Zoox. “This moment is a huge one, but the service is still unpaid and fairly limited.” Zoox launched in 2014, and though it's been testing its technology in San Francisco, at its Foster City, California, headquarters, and in Las Vegas for years, this will be the first time it's allowing anyone willing to download an app to ride. The company was acquired by Amazon in 2020 for a reported $1.2 billion. He declines to say exactly when the firm would remove the safety drivers from its vehicles, or when it might expand its Lyft partnership to other areas or cities, but he says any moves the company makes will be tested and validated with real-world and simulated data. The service will scale more quickly as time goes on, he says. Two US self-driving vehicle firms shut down this past decade after their robotaxis were involved in serious road accidents. Uber sold off its self-driving technology to a competitor in 2020. General Motors got out of the robotaxi business a year later, citing high development costs and a desire to focus on personal vehicles. Still, robotaxi companies say they have plenty more public deployments on the horizon. Zoox says it will start picking up public riders in San Francisco later this year, and will then launch in Austin and Miami. Waymo has announced future service in several US cities, including Miami, Washington, DC, and Dallas. Tesla is running a small, invite-only ride-hail service in the California Bay Area with drivers behind the wheel using its more limited Full Self-Driving (Supervised) tech, which requires the person up front to stay alert at all times. Musk plans to move quickly: He said this spring that the company would have “millions” of vehicles operating autonomously by the second half of next year. Developers of self-driving vehicles have argued that their tech will increase safety and ride efficiency, bringing down prices in the long term. But even in Phoenix and San Francisco, where Waymo has been running public robotaxis for years, cities have yet to catch a clear glimpse of how the expensive-to-develop technology might transform residents' lives. “It's not at the scale yet where it's really dramatically changing anything,” says Adam Millard-Ball, an urban planning professor who directs the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies. Robotaxi services will likely have to get much bigger, Millard-Ball says, before they can prove out their expansive visions. Waymo has released studies suggesting that its tech is safer than human drivers in many situations, but some experts still argue that it's hard to compare robots' performance to humans' given the still-limited number of miles the cars have driven. Bird says Lyft has studied data from where autonomous vehicles have already been deployed, and he thinks the answer is yes. Clearly, though, plenty of people are still working to find out.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Capital City Online Auctions is a small auctioneer that requires local pickup, so it's not something that anyone could have taken part in, but the auction winner was very lucky nonetheless. The auctioneer sells a wide range of items, from mattresses to rowing boats, to full-on desktop PCs complete with internal hardware. In what appears to be a case of the seller not knowing what they had, they listed the lot as a Fractal Design Define 7 XL computer case. It still sells for around $250 new all by itself. Green-eyed Reddit posters spotted the clear-acrylic Puget Systems graphics card support bracket in one of the posted pictures, suggesting it was originally from that workstation and professional desktop builder. Indeed, a purported Puget staffer posted in the thread, claiming this system was probably sold in 2021 for around $8,000, highlighting what a steal the auction winner managed with their comparatively meager bid. The system in question appears to be a photo editor's personal work computer. They postulate that perhaps it was traded in as part of an upgrade program, or sent in for a service and never picked up. Regardless, the system Llamadeus won was a good one. The RTX 3080 Ti is roughly equivalent to an RTX 5070 but with 12GB of VRAM, and though the Threadripper chip is a couple of generations old, it still has more cores than you'll find in any consumer AMD CPUs. They originally planned to use the case as part of an AI development build, so they will now use the CPU, motherboard, memory, and storage as part of that. They're going to swap out the graphics card, though, as even though a 3080 Ti is still great for gaming, it falls far behind in AI performance compared to more modern Nvidia GPUs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major RTX Remix update adds fully path-traced fire, smoke, and VFX to classic games, but questions remain about performance on older cards. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia's modding platform for retrofitting classic games with ray tracing has just had a huge overhaul. On September 9, Nvidia announced major updates to RTX Remix, including an “advanced path-traced particle system” that adds real-time particle effects like fire and smoke with full lighting and animation controls, without touching the original game engine. In previous RTX Remix projects like Portal RTX, particle-heavy scenes have pushed high-end GPUs to their limits, even with DLSS enabled. While Nvidia explicitly recommends RTX 30-series cards as the baseline for an acceptable experience, some players with 3090-class GPUs reported dips well below 60 fps in particle-heavy scenes. The updates also introduce a more streamlined authoring workflow. Modders can now tag textures in-game as particle emitters via the Alt+X developer menu and tweak properties like size and color directly within the Remix UI. The more advanced Remix Toolkit adds scripting support for lighting behaviors and collision physics powered by PhysX in the backend, according to Nvidia's documentation. That still leaves plenty of room for quirks like potential crashes and rendering issues in some titles, but there's no denying that RTX Remix is becoming a more powerful and practical tool by the month for modders committed to rebuilding classic games. Since its release, the RTX Remix community has breathed new life into classic games like Half-Life 2, Need for Speed Underground, and Deux Ex, with more than 2 million downloads to date.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Big increases in performance when running a range of popular open source models. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Combining hardware improvements and software optimizations, Nvidia claims the top spot when running a range of models, and suggests this should be a primary consideration for any developers building out "AI factories," as it could result in major enhancements for revenue generation. Nvidia's Blackwell architecture is at the heart of its latest-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards, which offer the best performance for gaming, even if AMD's RX 9000-series arguably offers better bang for buck. But it's also what's under the hood of the big AI-powering GPU stacks like its GB200 platform, which is being built into a range of data centers all over the world to power next-generation AI applications. Blackwell Ultra, GB300, is the enhanced version of that with even more performance, and Nvidia has now tested it with some impressive MLPerf records. Nvidia claims a 45% increase in performance over GB200 when running the DeepSeek model, and up to five times the performance of older Hopper GPUs - although Nvidia does note those comparative results came from unverified third parties. Part of these performance enhancements comes from the more capable tensor cores used with Blackwell Ultra, with Nvidia claiming "2X the attention-layer acceleration and 1.5X more AI compute FLOPS." However, it was also made possible by a range of important software improvements and optimizations. Nvidia utilized its NVFP4 format extensively as part of these benchmarks, which quantized the DeepSeek R1 weights in a way that reduces the overall model size and allows Blackwell Ultra to accelerate the calculations for higher throughput while maintaining accuracy. For other benchmarks, like the larger Llama 3.1 405B model, Nvidia was able to "shard" the model across multiple GPUs at once, enabling higher throughput while maintaining latency standards. Greater inference through improved hardware and software optimizations makes GB300 a more potentially profitable platform in Nvidia's idea of the tokenized future of data center workloads.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British deckhand was just a week and a half into his first official yacht job, and he wasn't on just any boat. Below deck, the yacht's owner, Michael Lynch, had every reason to be sleeping soundly. The boat trip had been organized as a celebration. He had named his yacht Bayesian in honor of the statistical theorem that made him a billionaire, after the sale, in 2011, of his company Autonomy. The British tech giant sold software that could find meaningful signals amid the flood of unstructured data in emails, videos, and phone calls, but it would be better known as the company that allegedly defrauded, and nearly destroyed, Hewlett-Packard. Beside him in the master suite was his wife of 22 years, Angela Bacares, a former vice president in the investment division of Deutsche Bank who had caught his eye while working an Autonomy deal. Other cabins housed the Clifford Chance attorneys who had orchestrated Lynch's legal victory, as well as longtime colleagues, their partners, and a 1-year-old baby, all supported by 10 crew members. Her older sister, Esme, 22, had remained in London. The Bayesian and its human cargo were about to face forces that would test every calculation of the yacht's design, the terrifying and tragic culmination of a series of highly improbable events. To this day, mystery surrounds the final night of Lynch's life, making room for conspiracy theories about spies and secret hard drives that can't seem to be quashed. Today, Bayesian analysis is everywhere—powering spam filters, search engines, medical diagnoses, and artificial intelligence. Silicon Valley engineers casually talk about “updating their priors” as they refine machine-learning models. But in the 1980s, when Mike Lynch was a PhD student at Cambridge, Bayesian inference was still fighting for respectability, dismissed by many statisticians as unscientific because it dared to incorporate earlier beliefs into its calculations. Growing up in 1970s London as an Irish boy meant learning to navigate prejudice during the height of the IRA bombings. He had won a scholarship to Bancroft's School—money bequeathed in the 1700s for the education of “poor boys”—and spent three hours a day commuting to Woodford Green, often hitchhiking and listening to drivers talk about their lives. On weekends, he practiced clarinet and saxophone and worked at his mother's hospital, progressing from mopping floors to serving tea to patients. Samplers like the Fairlight CMI cost around £18,000 to £30,000. So Lynch, who had been tinkering with electronics since childhood and tried starting bands, created a groundbreaking program for the Atari ST computer that could manipulate sound with “an accuracy of one sample—that's one 50,000th of a second,” according to a 1988 interview with Sound on Sound magazine. These technical obsessions led Lynch to Peter Rayner's signal processing group at Cambridge, in the engineering department. “I initially thought he was a bit lazy,” Rayner told me, recalling how Lynch often hadn't done the assigned work. “But when we worked through problems in supervision, he showed great insight and came up with sometimes incorrect approaches, but often very interesting ones.” Rayner's lab had a distinctly commercial bent, focused on solving real-world problems. Many of his roughly 100 PhD students went on to found companies, becoming, he said, full professors, multimillionaires, and even one billionaire—Lynch. At Cambridge, Lynch discovered that the same mathematics he was using to clean up audio samples could be applied to any kind of noisy data. At the heart of this approach was Bayesian inference, a way of thinking about probability that had been developed by Thomas Bayes, a Presbyterian minister in the 1700s who died before publishing his findings. They were discovered by a friend who happened upon them when cleaning out Bayes' things. To the outside world, Mike Lynch appeared to be exactly what Europe needed: a homegrown technology champion who could compete with Silicon Valley. The power of Bayesian thinking lies in how it handles uncertainty. As Rayner explained to me, using a simple example: “If I gave you a coin and you tossed it and it came down heads, then all you could say based on that one experiment is the probability of tossing a head is 1—certain. But Bayes would say, ‘Come on, we know it's going to be around a half.' It allows you to take account of previous knowledge.” This idea, of starting with prior assumptions and updating them with new evidence, seems simple, but Bayesian methods proved extremely effective at pattern recognition in the age of computers. Lynch's doctoral thesis, completed in 1990, applied these techniques to neural networks for pattern classification—“a small step along the road” to modern AI, as Rayner put it. While supposedly working as a postdoc, he was often absent from the lab, secretly raising money for his first company. “He said, ‘I didn't want you to know! That company was Cambridge Neurodynamics, founded after he completed his PhD, and its flagship product was a fingerprint recognition system that could handle smudged or partial prints. Unlike keyword searches that might confuse different terminology, IDOL could recognize that a document about “automobiles” was relevant to a search for “cars.” It could identify concepts, find patterns, and extract meaning from chaos. The name Autonomy itself reflected Lynch's vision: software intelligent enough to operate independently, to make its own guesses about meaning and relevance without human intervention. They don't realize there's a whole new country stretching out behind those roses.” Lynch had always been more interested in how people thought than what they knew. I talked to one of his employees, Emily Orton, who still remembers her first interview with Lynch back in 2009. While other executives had asked about her qualifications and experience, Lynch wanted to see how she dealt with the unexpected. He asked her a single question: “Tell me what makes you angry?” By that point, Autonomy was Britain's largest software company. Its software was being used by intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and major corporations worldwide, and its acquisition, in 2005, of Verity—a search company double Autonomy's size in terms of sales—eventually led to a market value north of $6 billion. Andy Kanter, an American lawyer at Autonomy since the late '90s, had watched Lynch evolve from entrepreneur to CEO of a major corporation. “If something wasn't right, he would dismiss it as useless,” Kanter said. But this harshness—one of his own lawyers told me that “he could be a prick”—came with fierce loyalty. For Christmas parties, Lynch flew the entire UK staff to four-star hotels in European cities—Venice, Prague. To the outside world, Autonomy appeared to be exactly what Europe needed: a homegrown technology champion that could compete with Silicon Valley. But maintaining Autonomy's image of consistent growth required increasingly creative measures. Lynch and Hussain's relationship went back to their school days—though Lynch would later downplay this, testifying that Hussain was merely a “third-level acquaintance” who had arrived at Bancroft's in his final year. Yet they had both gone on to Cambridge and kept in touch over the years, and Lynch had attended Hussain's wedding. When Hussain returned to England after working in the oil industry abroad, Lynch hired him. Software companies are judged differently than other businesses. Investors expect them to maintain high profit margins, because software costs almost nothing to reproduce—once you write the code, you can sell it infinitely without manufacturing costs. So Lynch and Hussain developed practices designed to smooth out the randomness. When software sales fell short, Autonomy would purchase servers from manufacturers like EMC, Dell, and Hitachi, then resell them to customers—often at a loss. This wasn't unusual; many software companies bundled hardware with their products. Instead of recording all the hardware costs as “cost of goods sold,” which would have devastated those crucial gross margins, portions were allocated to “sales and marketing expenses.” This preserved the illusion of a pure software company while pumping up revenue. The company also developed complex, opportunistic arrangements with resellers. During analyst calls, when hedge funds would try to trip up Hussain with coordinated questions about the numbers, Lynch would protect, and at times coach, his CFO. So business stayed booming, and Lynch lived the life of a quirky multimillionaire. He had moved his family to a sprawling 69-acre farm he owned in Suffolk, complete with gardens, parkland, paddocks, and woodland. He restored a water mill and began breeding rare animals—“cows that became defunct in the 1940s and pigs that no one's kept since medieval times,” as he would later describe them. He loved dogs, especially the rare Otter Hound. His dogs were all named after engineering parts: Switch, Tappet, Pinion, Valve, and Cam. Politicians sought out his advice for Britain's technological future, and he was a popular speaker at events and in the business media. Everything Lynch touched, it seemed, turned to gold. Leo Apotheker had been CEO of Hewlett-Packard for less than a year when he announced his vision to transform the technology giant: It was time for HP to pivot from its roots in hardware manufacturing to become a software and services company. It was March 2011, and Apotheker needed a flagship acquisition to demonstrate this new direction. By July, Lynch and Apotheker were meeting in Deauville, the French seaside resort. HP initially proposed acquiring Autonomy for between £24.94 and £26.94 per share in late July 2011. When market volatility drove down Autonomy's stock price in early August, HP attempted to renegotiate lower, but Lynch held firm, refusing to accept anything below £25. Within weeks of that first proposal, the companies settled on £25.50 per share—approximately $11.1 billion total, a 64 percent premium over Autonomy's market value. HP's due diligence was, as Andy Kanter would later describe it, shocking in its brevity: “Having run billions and billions of dollars of acquisitions,” he told me, “I'd never seen anything like it.” The exact duration would become a matter of dispute—Lynch's lawyers would claim it amounted to just six hours in conference calls, while HP described hundreds of people involved and consultations with Deloitte, Autonomy's auditor. HP's board, watching their share price crater, seemed to panic. The acquisition closed in October, but by then Autonomy had already become, in Lynch's words, “the unwanted stepchild.” By May 2012, Whitman fired Lynch and reshuffled most of Autonomy's senior leadership. Six months later, HP was writing down $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value, with $5 billion attributed to what it called “serious accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations” at Autonomy. In its telling, it had been systematically deceived, the victim of a sophisticated fraud that had inflated Autonomy's value. HP sued Lynch in the UK for $5 billion. The US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation. Lynch countersued, claiming HP had destroyed his reputation and mismanaged the acquisition. What had begun as a transformative deal had become one of the most bitter corporate disputes in recent history. When HP announced its write-down in November 2012, Lynch had a choice. He could remain silent, let lawyers handle negotiations, perhaps reach a settlement. Instead, he went on Channel 4's main business program and blamed HP for running a broken company. That drove HP to double down even more. At times, he'd gather his legal team aboard the Bayesian—purchased just a year earlier—for strategy sessions. Lynch also continued to hobnob with British politicians and founded a new venture capital company, Invoke Capital, in 2012, assembling about 60 former Autonomy employees. Invoke's portfolio spun out multiple highly successful companies, with traces of Bayesian inference in each one. Featurespace's fraud-detection technology became standard for major banks, with a proposed £700 million acquisition by Visa. Sophia Genetics went public in 2021 at a $1.14 billion valuation. Most white-collar defendants stay silent; Lynch insisted on taking the stand. In this way, his wealth grew, but the legal threats hovered above him, an axe yet to drop. In 2018, Hussain, who had fought his criminal case first in the US, was convicted of conspiracy, wire fraud, and securities fraud. Lynch's civil trial ran for 93 days, and what emerged was deeply troubling. The court found that when Autonomy's US finance chief Brent Hogenson raised alarms in 2010 about suspect sales, Lynch's response was not to investigate but to suppress. He forwarded Hogenson's concerns with instructions to use “the usual encryption,” warned that “emails have been known to escape,” and ultimately plotted to fire Hogenson—indicating that Lynch knew the allegations were true. The court delivered a devastating judgment in January 2022. In a 1,700-page ruling, the judge found that Lynch had been “aware of improprieties in Autonomy's accounting practices” and had been “dishonestly involved in manipulating the accounts.” The systematic accounting practices weren't just aggressive. They were, the judge concluded, a deliberate scheme to mislead. If convicted on all counts, the 57-year-old faced up to 25 years in prison—effectively a life sentence. Despite US prosecutors promising the English court that Lynch wouldn't be incarcerated pretrial, Judge Charles Breyer immediately sent him to jail upon arrival, his lead attorney Reid Weingarten recalled. “That was probably the lowest moment.” He ended up in jail for only one day, though, after posting a $100 million bond. The mathematics of his situation became Lynch's obsession. “What are the odds?” he would constantly ask his friends and lawyers, especially Weingarten, who found it maddening. “It was the stupidest question ever,” he would later recall. “There's just too many variables.” At the same time, he respected Lynch's genuine curiosity—“there was nothing he didn't know about or didn't want to know about,” from astrophysics to politics, culture, music, even American baseball. The trial began in March 2024, with Lynch joined by his former VP of finance Stephen Chamberlain as codefendant. Hussain's conviction had taught them the playbook of US prosecutors, and they'd had years to ready a new defense. Each night, Lynch and his legal team would work out who the prosecution was going to bring the next day. They also hired a “shadow jury”—a barman and a clerk paid to sit through all 11 weeks of proceedings and register independent impressions. Most white-collar defendants stay silent; Lynch insisted on taking the stand. He presented himself as a down-to-earth British entrepreneur who had been victimized by American corporate incompetence. When prosecutors pressed him on specific transactions, he deflected skillfully—these were matters for the finance team, he was focused on technology and strategy. “I watched them take this beautiful company and just wreck it,” he told the jury, emotion creeping in. “And then they had the audacity to blame me for their incompetence.” As the jury foreman read “not guilty” to all remaining charges, Lynch cried. Speaking to journalists later, Lynch reflected on what he'd endured: “It's bizarre, but now you have a second life,” he said. As part of his recovery process, Lynch planned a long summer aboard the Bayesian, full of friends and celebration. For one particular outing in August, he invited along everyone who stayed close to him during the darkest period of his life. Christopher Morvillo, the Clifford Chance partner who had helped quarterback the US legal strategy, was there with his wife, Neda. Jonathan Bloomer, the Morgan Stanley international executive who had served as a character witness, had accepted the invitation along with his wife, Judy. The yacht itself was a 56-meter sailing vessel with a dark blue hull and a minimalist ­Japanese-style interior, later referred to by The Times of London as a “masterpiece of engineering and opulence.” The yacht's original name was Salute; Lynch rechristened it the Bayesian. The vessel was magnificent but also an anomaly: It had a single, towering aluminum mast. When that hot air collided with colder masses higher up, it produced a rotating updraft—a supercell. The August sailing was planned as a leisurely tour of Sicily's northern coast and Aeolian Islands. They anchored off Isola di Vulcano one day for a few hours to watch the active crater glow against the sky, visited Panarea, and enjoyed the crystal clear waters around Dattilo. It was exactly the kind of relaxed, intimate celebration Lynch had envisioned. It was also a sendoff for Hannah, an aspiring poet. That weekend, Lynch received two devastating calls from Andy Kanter about Stephen Chamberlain, his Autonomy codefen­dant. The first call, on Saturday, Lynch answered with a happy hello—laughter and cheer audible in the background—before Kanter delivered what he called “the gravest news”: Chamberlain, a middle-aged soccer fan and avid runner, had been struck by a car while jogging and suffered a traumatic head injury. The five-day trip had been blessed with perfect conditions—clear skies, warm temperatures, and gentle winds. Thunderstorm alerts were in force for Sicily's north coast, yet forecasters expected only scattered cells. Meteorological analysis later showed a perfect, if unlikely, recipe for disaster: Tyrrhenian surface water near 29 degrees Celsius—2 to  3 degrees above the norm—pumped moisture aloft like fuel into a furnace. When that hot air collided with colder masses higher up, it produced a rotating updraft—a supercell. As Griffiths ran to shut the forward hatches, the wind was already past 30 knots; 5 miles away, it was recorded at 41 knots. He made sure all three generators were operating and headed to the wheelhouse—the yacht's enclosed main control room. The vessel was lurching, but boats, of course, are always moving. Only some passengers woke up in the dark night. Key crew members—chief officer Tijs Koopmans and chief steward Sasha Murray among them—dressed hurriedly and made their way out of the crew's quarters. Charlotte Golunski and her husband brought their baby there, too, to avoid waking the other guests. Above, on the fly deck, the chief steward met a wall of rain that she'd later describe as unlike anything she'd ever seen. Below, a crew member passed the galley: Chef Recaldo Thomas was stowing pans. “Good morning!” he called, as if greeting just another squall. By now the yacht was sliding south‑southeast at 1.8  knots. A shaft of cold air dropped from 30,000 feet and hit the sea like an invisible fist. The weather service's review of satellite data would later suggest bursts over 87 knots, or nearly 100 miles per hour. Records indicate that the alarm was never pulled; no one had time. Below, guests Matthew Fletcher and Ayla Ronald escaped their forward cabin by pulling out drawers as steps. Three of them were momentarily trapped in an air pocket behind the wheelhouse door—James Emslie tried to force it open from outside but couldn't, due to the pressure of the rushing water. His first escape attempt failed in the black water, which was clogged with cushions and broken bits of the once-lovely interior. The remaining passengers and crew clung desperately to whatever they could find. At this point it was clear that there would be no saving the boat, only surviving its sinking. Murray counted heads and Griffiths improvised a tourniquet on Emslie's arm. The baby balanced on a cushion, absurdly, precariously. Then the group finally caught a break: Koopmans, the chief officer, surfaced and cut one life raft free right as other crew members were trying, and failing, to get to another one. Ten minutes later, the chief engineer fired a red parachute flare, but higher-altitude wind carried it sideways. He fired a second, and a crew member aboard the 42‑meter steel-hulled schooner Sir Robert Baden Powell, anchored nearby, spotted it and alerted the skipper. The downburst had struck like a scalpel; the other vessel, barely 100 meters away, lost nothing more than an awning frame. Its tender reached the raft and recovered 15 survivors. Her husband, daughter, and five others—Jonathan Bloomer, Judy Bloomer, Christopher Morvillo, Neda Morvillo, and Recaldo Thomas—remained inside the sunken yacht. Thomas—the chef who had called “Good morning!”—was found dead later that day. He grew up in a modest household, the son of Irish parents. Lynch and his daughter Hannah, who was an aspiring poet. Rescue boats eventually arrived, too late to do anything about those stuck inside the sunken boat. As Lynch's close friend and business associate, he found himself coordinating with authorities and helping Bacares navigate the bureaucratic maze that follows disasters. In an unforgettable coincidence, Chamberlain passed the following day—meaning both men had died from freak accidents, thousands of miles apart, roughly within 24 hours of each other. This would fuel wild conspiracy theories online for months. The scene that greeted Kanter was surreal in its intensity. The hotel where survivors were staying shut down reservations for five days to accommodate the press invasion, says Kanter. Reporters were climbing into ambulances, desperate for any scrap of information. Italian media speculated wildly about encrypted hard drives in the yacht's safe, with tabloids suggesting connections to Western intelligence services. The lack of verifiable information didn't stop the stories: One newspaper made up an interview with Charlotte Golunski, where she'd said she momentarily lost her baby for “two seconds.” In truth, she hadn't spoken to any journalist. In one particularly bizarre moment, while survivors were ensconced at a resort hotel, a 12-foot-tall minion walked by—a jarring reminder that normal life continued even as families dealt with unimaginable loss. What has emerged through the various investigations, and through press accounts, is a critical flaw in the Bayesian's design. The yacht's manufacturer initially filed a €222 million claim against Lynch's wife and crew members, though it was quietly withdrawn. Insurance companies began their own investigations, with potentially $150 million in claims at stake. Quickly, Italian prosecutors opened an inquiry, initially focusing on potential charges of negligent shipwreck and manslaughter. Captain Cutfield faced particular scrutiny—questions about the keel position, open hatches, and whether adequate warnings were given. The prosecutors moved swiftly, interviewing everybody during those first five days. Hannah was discovered in another cabin on the same side, by herself. The following Sunday, townspeople organized a memorial service that culminated in a candlelight vigil where people released wreaths into the water. In May 2025, a Dutch diver working for a company trying to recover the yacht died, adding another life to the toll. Griffiths, for his part, still plans on working in the yachting industry. In July, UK High Court judge Robert Hildyard ruled that Lynch's estate and former Autonomy CFO Sushovan Hussain owed Hewlett-Packard more than £700 million ($940 million) in damages from the Autonomy acquisition. In a postscript to his judgment, Hildyard expressed his “sorrow at this devastating turn of events, and my sympathy and deepest condolences, having come to know and admire Dr Lynch (notwithstanding my findings against him) over the course of a very long trial.” The ruling, which represented a significant reduction from HP's original $4 billion claim, nonetheless reportedly threatened to bankrupt the estate, estimated to be worth around £500 million. Hussain, now out of prison, has started a company to help former criminals find work. The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch published an interim report in May 2025 that focused on design and environmental vulnerabilities—though Italian prosecutors are separately investigating the captain and two crew members for manslaughter and negligence. What has emerged through the various investigations, and through press accounts, is a critical flaw in the Bayesian's design. This problem might have been noticed earlier except for one other factor: Elite luxury yachts don't have to comply with the same robust safety rules as commercial ones. The vessel capsized within 15 seconds and sank in just 18 minutes, settling 50 meters below on the seabed off Porticello, Sicily. What are the odds of all this happening? White-collar defendants are either acquitted or dismissed about 15 percent of the time, but when the CFO is already convicted? Lynch was one of the few CEOs in the past 25 years to walk free from a criminal conviction after his other subordinates had already been convicted. Then that final night: Severe downbursts strike Sicilian anchorages perhaps once every 14 years, but for one just 75 meters wide to bull's-eye a 56-meter yacht while missing the schooner 100 meters away? Probably on the order of once in 2,300 years. And Stephen Chamberlain—a jogger's daily risk of fatal collision is about one in 9 million; multiply by Lynch's yacht-disaster probability and you get roughly one in 760 billion for both dying the same day. But if you look at things from a different angle, not everything seems up to chance. Lynch was an unruly thinker from his college days and a perfectionist boss who pushed everyone around him to their limits; was it inevitable that he would end up in court eventually, defending his risky decisions? Of all the events in Mike Lynch's improbable life, his death turned on something that was, actually, quite knowable. Let us know what you think about this article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When treating severe burns and trauma, skin regeneration can be a matter of life or death. Extensive burns are usually treated by transplanting a thin layer of epidermis, the top layer of skin, from elsewhere on the body. However, this method not only leaves large scars, it also does not restore the skin to its original functional state. They have developed two types of 3D bioprinting techniques to artificially generate thick skin that is vascularized, meaning it contains blood vessels. One technique produces skin that is packed with cells, and the other produces arbitrarily shaped blood vessels in the tissue. “The dermis is so complicated that we can't grow it in a lab. We don't even know what all its components are,” said Johan Junker, an associate professor at Linköping University and specialist in plastic surgery who lead this work, in a statement. Junker and his team designed a bio-ink called “μInk” in which fibroblasts—cells that produce dermal components such as collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid—are cultured on the surface of small spongy gelatin grains and encased in a hyaluronic acid gel. By building up this ink three-dimensionally using a 3D printer, they were able to create a skin structure filled with high-density cells at will. Blood vessels play an extremely important role in the construction of artificial tissues. No matter how many cells are cultured to create a tissue model, without blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients cannot be carried evenly to all cells. The research team has also created a technology called REFRESH (Rerouting of Free-Floating Suspended Hydrogel Filaments), which enables the flexible construction of blood vessels in artificial tissues by printing and arranging threads of hydrogel, a gels that 98 percent water. These threads are much tougher than ordinary gel materials and can maintain their shape even when tied or braided. A hydrogel thread made using the REFRESH technology. Notably, these threads can be disassembled without leaving any trace by the action of a specific enzyme. When the hydrogel threads placed in the tissue disappear, only a long, thin cavity remains in their original place. By integrating these two technologies, it could be possible to incorporate a freely designed network of blood vessels into the thick, cell-filled artificial skin, allowing oxygen and nutrients to reach every nook and cranny. There remain many uncertainties in the wound environment, such as how to avoid inflammation and bacterial infection, and careful verification of these techniques will be needed to bridge the gap between these results obtained in the laboratory and rolling out these techniques in clinical practice.
