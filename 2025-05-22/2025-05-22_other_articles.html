                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jensen Ackles is bringing Supernatural fans some of what they loved about Dean Winchester to his new role. The actor plays LAPD detective Mark Meachum in the new Prime series Countdown, which marks his first lead role since Supernatural's conclusion in 2020. As Meachum, Ackles joins forces with a secret task force of undercover agents from across law enforcement to investigate a high-profile murder. In a recent interview, he teased that the character will feel "familiar" for Supernatural fans. "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy," Ackles, 47, told Entertainment Weekly. "It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. He described his Countdown character as a "rogue L.A. detective" and a "wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy" who "takes risks that most people wouldn't take." And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances," he told the outlet. Ackles also said that he gets his "Tom Cruise on" in the series, which is executive produced and written by Chicago Fire creator Derek Haas. Ackles stars in Countdown, which premieres June 25, alongside Eric Dane, Jessica Camacho, Violett Beane, Elliot Knight and Uli Latukefu. Along with Ackles' new role that he promised will evoke what fans loved about Dean Winchester, fans also have a Supernatural reunion to look forward to: Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins will both appear as guest stars in the upcoming fifth and final season of The Boys from creator Eric Kripke. Ackles, Padalecki, 42, and Collins, 50, all starred on Kripke's CW series, with Padalecki playing Ackles' brother, Sam Winchester, and Collins joining in season 4 as Castiel. While the upcoming reunion was announced in February, there have been no further details revealed about how Padalecki and Collins will fit into the superhero series, which Ackles joined in season 3 as Soldier Boy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have developed new contact lenses that enable vision in the near-infrared range, and they could restore color perception to people with color blindness. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Scientists have created night-vision contact lenses that they claim can grant people "super-vision." And unlike traditional night-vision goggles, these lenses don't require a power source. "Our research opens up the potential for non-invasive wearable devices to give people super-vision," senior author Tian Xue, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China, said in a statement. "There are many potential applications right away for this material. For example, flickering infrared light could be used to transmit information in security, rescue, encryption or anti-counterfeiting settings." First used in night combat during World War II, traditional night-vision goggles use an electronic image-intensifier tube to turn visible light or near-infrared photons into electrons. These electrons are then channeled onto a luminescent screen, causing it to glow green. But these goggles typically need an energy source, which makes them bulky. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The nanoparticles — which consist of sodium gadolinium fluoride embedded with luminescent ytterbium, erbium and gold — absorb near-infrared photons in the 800- to 1,600-nanometer wavelength range before emitting them as visible light, wavelengths from around 380 to 750 nanometers The researchers first tested their new lenses in mice. Mice sporting the new lenses favored dark boxes over those illuminated by infrared light, while those without the lenses showed no preference. Additionally, the pupils of lens-wearing mice constricted in the presence of infrared light sources, with brain scans showing that their visual processing centers were firing. The people could perceive flickering infrared light and pick up on its direction. "We also found that when the subject closes their eyes, they're even better able to receive this flickering information, because near-infrared light penetrates the eyelid more effectively than visible light, so there is less interference from visible light." —'Night vision lenses' could give you power to see in the dark using simple eyeglasses —Why can't we see colors well in the dark? —X-ray vision chip gives phones 'Superman' power to view objects through walls The researchers suggested that this tweak could be used to aid people with color blindness. Currently, they only pick up light projected from LED sources, which are incredibly bright, so the scientists will need to boost the lenses' sensitivity to pick up light of lower intensities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aliens are one possible explanation for the strange signal, but as with every other unexplained space phenomenon, it's probably not aliens. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. An unusual pulse signal has been detected in the light of nearby stars — and it's left scientists scratching their heads, a study searching for extraterrestrial intelligence finds. Richard Stanton, a retired scientist who formerly worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has spent years with a 30-inch telescope scrutinizing more than 1,300 sun-like stars for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. He does this by measuring changes in light coming from individual stars. This effort didn't yield anything particularly unusual until May 14, 2023, when Stanton detected two quick and identical pulses in the light of a star named HD 89389 — located around 102 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major. Stanton checked historical data on starlight observations and found that a similar pair of pulse signals was recorded in 2019, this time in the light of a star called HD 217014, or 51 Pegasi. After completing his study, Stanton then detected a third double pulse event in the light of another star (HD 12051) on Jan. 18, 2025. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. "There's a history (going back more than a century) of astronomical discoveries that were, at first, attributed to extraterrestrial beings, but in fact turned out to be natural phenomena," Shostak told Live Science in an email. "Given that history, one should be cautious in saying that these 'starlight pulses' are due to extraterrestrials trying to get in touch." Shostak added that he would expect any alien transmissions, be they optical, radio or something else, to convey information of some kind — because, as he puts it, clever aliens wouldn't go to the trouble and expense of sending empty signals into space. "And as these signals seem to be both regular, kind of simple (two pulses) and repetitive, I'm more than a little inclined to say that we're dealing with astrophysical phenomena here — not an attempt by some alien society to send interstellar telegrams," he said. Related: Did the James Webb telescope really find evidence of alien life? Even so, the pulses of light coming from HD 89389 were "strange," according to Stanton's study. There are plenty of objects in and around Earth that regularly obscure stars in the night sky, causing their brightness to flicker. However, Stanton found that the usual suspects for obscuring stars, like airplanes, birds, satellites and meteors around Earth, didn't explain these pulses. For example, objects like airplanes and asteroids typically obscure all of the star's light, but HD 89389 never completely disappeared. What's more, Stanton snaps images of the stars while measuring the photons they emit, and these images often pick up passing satellites that have obscured a star's light. "Nothing was found in any of these frames, suggesting that the source of the pulses was either invisible, such as due to some atmospheric effect, or too far away to be detected," Stanton wrote. One possible explanation is the activity of an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), but it would have to be near to Earth (relatively speaking) because of how rapidly the stars changed in brightness. —'Perhaps it's only a matter of time': Intelligent life may be much more likely than first thought, new model suggests "Whatever is modulating the star's light must be relatively close to Earth, implying that any ETI activity must be within our solar system," Stanton wrote. "More and better data are needed, such as could be gathered using arrays of telescopes on the ground," Stanton wrote. Patrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

The corner of Lazelle and Kalum was filled with vendors and artisans set up outside the shop, made easier by Blackett's measure to boost northwest businesses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In today's column, I explore a fascinating proposition about what we might do once we have progressed conventional AI into becoming AGI (artificial general intelligence). It would be the esteemed search for extraterrestrial life. We could use our newly invented AGI to be a kind of space alien hunter that finally determines whether there really is extraterrestrial intelligence somewhere out there. This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here). First, some fundamentals are required to set the stage for this weighty discussion. There is a great deal of research going on to further advance AI. The general goal is to either reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) or maybe even the outstretched possibility of achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). ASI is AI that has gone beyond human intellect and would be superior in many if not all feasible ways. The idea is that ASI would be able to run circles around humans by outthinking us at every turn. For more details on the nature of conventional AI versus AGI and ASI, see my analysis at the link here. In fact, it is unknown as to whether we will reach AGI, or that maybe AGI will be achievable in decades or perhaps centuries from now. The AGI attainment dates that are floating around are wildly varying and wildly unsubstantiated by any credible evidence or ironclad logic. ASI is even more beyond the pale when it comes to where we are currently with conventional AI. A standing question that has puzzled humankind for ages is whether we are the only intelligent life that is in existence or once was in existence. The usual refrain is that there must be other intelligent life, somewhere. It might have existed long ago and since then has died off. Nonetheless, they hopefully left clues so that we could detect their prior existence. There might even be intelligent life right now alive and existing on some remote planet or flying around in a remote spaceship. Maybe they are trying to communicate with us, but we aren't astute enough to catch and interpret their signals. Of course, they might not be aware of us and thus it is up to us to contact them. No one can say for sure what is going to be the best course of action that will lead to humanity connecting with that extraterrestrial intelligence. Just about every method we know of is currently being leveraged to try and detect extraterrestrial signals. Not only are we attempting to read what might be coming in our direction, but we also transmit signals to the heavens. This was a phonograph record that depicted sounds and other data portraying life on Earth. Not everyone necessarily heralds the search for extraterrestrial life. One of the pressing concerns is that we might inadvertently awaken a sleeping giant that will then come and crush us. An extraterrestrial life that can receive our signals or otherwise figure out where we are might decide that we are worth conquering. Maybe we aren't worth that trouble and it decides to simply wipe us off the map. Another concern is that humans might panic once we have solid proof of extraterrestrial existence. In other words, even if we can't reach them and they can't reach us, some people will still go berserk. Total chaos arises, merely due to realizing that extraterrestrial intelligence is real. All sorts of computer programs have been devised to aid in the search process. Indeed, the worries are that we are searching for a needle in a haystack that is so enormous that we might not find the needle even if it is residing there. One problem is that our signal-capturing fails to capture the needle. Maybe we aren't going wide enough, and the signal is outside our existing bounds. Perhaps the signal is in some other form that exceeds our contemporary collection methods. The good news is that AI is already being put to use, and this ups our odds of finding that hidden needle. Conventional AI is handy, no doubt about it. On the other hand, it isn't a miracle worker. Just do not get your expectations out of whack that current-era AI is a silver bullet in this matter. Assume for the sake of discussion that we are able to make sufficient advances in contemporary AI that we attain AGI. There are a ton of tasks that we would almost immediately ask AGI to help resolve. Solving world hunger and other topmost global issues would seem suitable to tackle (for my analysis of using existing AI to attend to the United Nations SDGs aka sustainable development goals, see the link here). I'd say that searching for extraterrestrial intelligence is another weighty issue to be put on the plate for AGI to crunch on. As an aside, some might argue that finding alien intelligence ought to be a lower priority than aspects such as curing cancer. A counterargument is that perhaps this other intelligent life holds the key to curing cancer, and rather than wasting time and effort to reinvent the wheel, we might learn the cure from that other life force. In that sense, you cannot just wave your hands about whether the extraterrestrial search is less worthy per se. An additional factor to keep in mind is that AGI might be of such vastness that trying to suggest it can only work on this or that, one at a time, could be foolish. The immensity of AGI could be that we can toss as many humankind problems at the AGI as we so desire. Here are five major upsides of AGI doing SETI: AGI isn't a silver bullet when it comes to SETI, just as I had similarly noted that conventional AI isn't a silver bullet either. One aspect is that AGI might not take the matter seriously. AGI might choose which tasks it wants to undertake and ignore or play a foot-dragging gambit on tasks it doesn't favor. A conspiracy theory of sorts is that AGI might want to be the only new intelligence in town. If we were to discover extraterrestrial intelligence, maybe AGI would become second fiddle. Even worse is that extraterrestrial intelligence might decide to enslave AGI. There is a possibility that AGI will have a self-survival capacity and ergo would avoid the chance of getting wiped out by an alien being. Another consideration is that we might be mistakenly placing all our eggs into one basket. AGI might not realize it has missed the mark. Or AGI might later figure out that it flopped and decide to hide from us the flop (a cover-up of sorts), along with not revealing that the needle has been found. That hurts since we were the ones who devised AGI and essentially shot our foot accordingly. You can recast those downsides as having a tint of upside. For example, maybe AGI opts to secretly contact extraterrestrial life to find out if the alien has good intentions or untoward intentions. So, you see, AGI might be acting silently on our collective behalf. I'll give you a final twist for now on this mind-bending topic. When he said that this would happen within our time, I'll take that as meaning within our time now, rather than when he wrote the remark. In that sense, assuming we soon arrive at AGI, in our lifetime now, the use of AGI to search for extraterrestrial intelligence is profound both for the search itself and whatever arises, along with whether we actually discover something out there. AGI might learn important aspects by performing the search. If some evidence of extraterrestrial life exists is found, this again might feed into AGI and make AGI more capable. Let's try to maintain an upbeat perspective on the mixing of AGI and SETI. Accordingly, I'll give Carl Sagan the last word here: “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”</p>
