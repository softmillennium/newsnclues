Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the media after President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill' was passed by the House. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday declared that the Democratic Party "has never been more radical and out of touch with the needs of the American people" after voting against President Donald Trump's "one big, beautiful bill." Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package was passed by the House of Representatives by a razor-thin 215-214 vote early this morning. "Every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted against all of these common-sense and massively popular policies. The Senate should pass this as quickly as possible and send it to President Trump's desk for a final signature." Leavitt also said it will "permanently secure the border by delivering the largest border security investment in history, funding at least 1 million annual removals of illegal aliens to carry out the largest deportation campaign ever, finishing the Trump border wall and giving pay raises and bonuses for our incredible ICE and Border Patrol agents." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks with reporters at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Two House Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the bill — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio. When asked by a reporter Thursday if Trump thinks both lawmakers should be primaried, Leavitt said, "I believe he does." Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., announces the final vote total after the House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and program cuts after an all-night session at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. "And I don't think he likes to see grandstanders in Congress. Did they want to see a tax hike? Did they want to see our country go bankrupt?" "That's the alternative by them trying to vote no. They are trusting in President Trump, as they should, because there's a reason he's sitting in this Oval Office. It's because he's the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party, not just a president for Republicans, but all Americans," she added. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., speaks to reporters following a series of votes at the U.S. Capitol on March 11. He was one of two House Republicans to vote against the bill on Thursday. "The president's approval rating is at an all-time high right now. That's because he knows how to deliver, and Republicans like Thomas Massie and others should take note," Leavitt also said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? From F1 influencers to Taylor Swift, WAGs are in a new golden age. But many in the media are heralding this moment as a “new era” for WAGs, and Kelce is just one of several famous women who are at the fore of this renaissance: Everyone from TikToker Alix Earle, who is dating Miami Dolphins player Braxton Berrios, to Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles — unquestionably the more famous athlete — who is married to the Chicago Bears' Jonathan Owens. Meanwhile, a host of lesser-known women are experiencing their first taste of fame through their relationships with tennis players, Formula 1 race-car drivers, and even pole vaulters. A sizable number have leveraged their romantic lives to receive brand deals, podcasting opportunities, and magazine profiles. They've transformed from tabloid punching bags to an appealing status symbol. Still, the continued use of the term does raise some complicated questions: Why are we so interested in defining these women, some of whom are independently successful, by their relationships to men? British tabloids and football fans alike lambasted women — celebrities in their own right — like former Girls Aloud member Cheryl Cole and former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham for their partying, extravagant spending, and flashy, maximalist looks. In the United States, being a WAG could be an equally dangerous public position. From Jessica Simpson to the Kardashians, they've been painted as distractions, attention-seekers, and bearers of bad luck. Over the past two decades, though, a WAG has become less of an involuntary title and more of an identity that some women are willing to cultivate, given that it can come with its own rewards. This modern version of WAG-dom can be credited to early 2010s reality shows like WAGS, Basketball Wives, and La La's Full Court Life. These platforms allowed these women — some anonymous before they entered into relationships with athletes — to craft their own public narratives and become notable personalities on their own. For years now, Ayesha Curry, wife of Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, has modeled what it means to be a “WAG influencer,” embracing her public relationship with her spouse while building a separate career as a successful cookbook author and host. Since then, WAG influencers have become a welcome staple of certain sports cultures. Formula 1 has exploded in recent years, with a small part of that popularity owed to the sport's stylish other halves. This has been largely credited to the popular Netflix series Formula 1: Drive to Survive, which put a spotlight on the personal lives of drivers and, naturally, their partners. Lily Herman, who writes the F1 newsletter Engine Failure, says that the current popularity of WAG influencers in Formula 1 can be credited to the former partners of a few young popular drivers from 2019 to 2022, like Carlos Sainz's girlfriend Isa Hernáez and Charles Leclerc's girlfriend Charlotte Sine, who were both featured on Drive to Survive. “They were around during an era where the sport saw a lot of growth in its younger fan base, especially among teen girls and younger women, and there was a new wave of interest in these young drivers' personal lives,” Herman says. Lately, the organization has fully embraced WAGs as recognizable supporting characters in the F1 universe, featuring them on social media and including them on chyrons during racing broadcasts. Morgan Riddle, who's dating highest-ranked American male player Taylor Fritz, has been making get-ready-with-me videos for tournaments and vlogging about her life on the tennis tour since 2022. Ayan Broomfield, a former college tennis player who's dating Frances Tiafoe, and influencer Paige Lorenze, who's dating Tommy Paul, have mimicked the same career path, broadcasting their lives as WAGs on social media. “Fritz is pretty bland as a public figure without his girlfriend,” Herman says. “She's done way more in her work as an influencer and content creator to make him seem multidimensional than he has through solo interviews and profiles.” It certainly benefits younger, newer WAGs who are already powerful women. In our current political climate, the WAG boom raises interesting questions. Research shows that some Gen Z-ers are identifying as more conservative than their parents. WAG influencers share some obvious similarities to tradwife influencers, women who've created lucrative identities and even businesses by perpetuating conservative ideas of marriage and motherhood. In a Substack essay, sports writer Frankie de la Cretaz argues that WAGs are essentially the tradwives of men's sports: “No matter how many businesses a WAG starts or how many charities she runs, she still embodies a heteronormative idea of family and a woman's place in society.” It's hard to get around the fact that most WAGs are initially famous for their association with a male partner, although they may ultimately transcend that attachment (see Kelce's complaint about being called a WAG and consider that her podcast, Not Gonna Lie, briefly dethroned The Joe Rogan Experience when it debuted in 2024). WAGs are gaining visibility while the most talented female athletes are still fighting for wage parity and struggling to land brand deals. But even attempts to define WAGs outside of their relationships come off a bit shallow. Stories about how these women are impacting sports largely focus on their brand deals and follower counts. When we celebrate the influence of WAGs, we're mostly talking about their ability to turn other women into consumers and spectators, not athletes. Meanwhile, WAGs are gaining visibility while the most talented female athletes are still fighting for wage parity and struggling to land brand deals. Back in March, Australian tennis pro Daria Saville made a TikTok about the lack of sponsorships she and other female pros receive compared to tennis WAGs. “Female tennis players are not getting those brand deals,” she said. “It's an extension of “girlboss” feminism, the idea that promoting women regardless of what that looks like is somehow good for women,” de la Cretaz says. “It's also this idea that whatever you're choosing is valid, even though those choices don't exist in a vacuum.” The most visible WAGs are still predominantly in straight relationships, and a large part of being one still involves affirming a male athlete's heterosexuality. As journalist Kira Cochrane wrote in a 2010 piece for The Guardian about football WAGs, “consciously or not, the women know their role is to boost their partner's masculinity.” She added that their often highly feminized presentation “underlines [their] status as possessions, part of the package for footballers.” WAGs, with their new clout and influence, haven't exactly gotten a total makeover. After all, they represent all the things women are encouraged to be in a time when mainstream culture is trending more conservative. Now is a good time to think about tech training wheels. Why are we mad at the football coach's girlfriend?</p>

Senior advisor for ‘Make America Healthy Again' Calley Means discusses how the Health and Human Services Department is cutting some artificial dyes from the food supply on ‘The Ingraham Angle.' President Donald Trump's Make America Healthy Again Commission released its anticipated report assessing chronic diseases that have gripped U.S. youths in recent years, pinning blame for a spike in childhood issues on a host of variables stretching from ingesting foods with added chemicals to an increase in prescribing pharmaceuticals to young kids. "After a century of costly and ineffective approaches, the federal government will lead a coordinated transformation of our food, health, and scientific systems," the report, released Thursday and reviewed by Fox News Digital, outlined. "This strategic realignment will ensure that all Americans—today and in the future—live longer, healthier lives, supported by systems that prioritize prevention, wellbeing, and resilience." The report's findings include teenage depression nearly doubling from 2009 to 2019, more than one-in-five children over the age of 6 being considered obese, one-in-31 children diagnosed with autism by age 8 and childhood cancer spiking by 40% since 1975. "Although estimates vary depending on the conditions included, all studies show an alarming increase over time." Chronic diseases have a chilling effect on national security, commission members said in a Thursday morning phone call with the media. Roughly 75% of America's youth aged 17–24 do not qualify to serve in the military due to obesity, asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases or behavioral disorders, they said. I hope this marks the grand pivot from a system that is entirely reactionary to a system that will now be proactive." The report itself pointed to a handful of variables leading to what Kennedy and other Trump administration leaders called a "chronic disease crisis," including a "food system (that) is safe but could be healthier;" exposure to environmental chemicals such as pesticides outside or microplastics in food consumed; as well as a culture shift that moved kids from playing outside to being glued to their phones or tablets. "American children are highly medicated — and it's not working," the report added of another variable compounding the chronic health issues. The report found that prescribing medication to children has skyrocketed in recent history, such as a 250% increase in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder prescriptions between 2006 and 2016 despite scientific evidence that the prescriptions did not "improve outcomes long-term," as well as a 1,400% increase between 1987 and 2014 for antidepressant prescriptions for kids, and 800% increase in antipsychotic medications for children between 1993 and 2009. President Donald Trump's Make America Healthy Again Commission released its anticipated report assessing chronic diseases that have gripped U.S. youth in recent years. "These time trends significantly outpace more moderate increases seen in other developed countries," the report found. The crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in children is therefore both empirically evident, and proportionally specific to American youth." While the report detailed that fluoride, which is a water additive frequently used to protect teeth from decay and cavities, was found to have a "statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children." By 2022, more than 60% of Americans — more than 70% of those on public water systems — were consuming fluoridated water, the report said. A 2025 systematic review published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzing 74 high-quality studies, found a statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children. The EPA is currently conducting a review of additional research that will inform any potential revisions to the federal drinking water standard. Director of the National Institutes of Health Jay Bhattacharya shared during the press call that the report underscores that America's next generation of children are less healthy than their parents and will subsequently live shorter lives if not addressed. "What the report says is that the next generation of children will live shorter lives than their parents," he said. "For me as a parent, that is absolutely shocking. And in fact, they are less healthy than their parents were at the same age." The report found, "Despite outspending peer nations by more than double per capita on healthcare, the United States ranks last in life expectancy among high-income countries — and suffers higher rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Today's children are the sickest generation in American history in terms of chronic disease and these preventable trends continue to worsen each year, posing a threat to our nation's health, economy, and military readiness." The Trump officials stressed on the call that America's food system is "100% safe," but that it could be even healthier, such as shifting from "ultraprocessed foods" that contain added "sugars, chemical additives, and saturated fats, while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables." Kennedy added that the "holistic" review of U.S. health as it relates to children includes promoting a strong economy, citing that "weak economies kill people." The report "represents an invitation to the American people and the American press to have a complex conversation about a nuanced subject, including that environmental policy, good economic policy and good public health policy are ultimately 100% aligned," Kennedy said on the press call. "The reason for that, particularly regarding public health, is that a strong economy is a social determinant of public health," he continued. President Donald Trump, right, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed on the campaign trail to "Make America Healthy Again," including directing their focus on autism among the youth in recent years. Trump signed an executive order in February establishing the commission, chaired by Kennedy and joined by other agency leaders such as EPA chief Lee Zeldin, USDA's Brooke Rollins and VA Secretary Doug Collins. The executive order directed the commission to release "an assessment that summarizes what is known and what questions remain regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, and include international comparisons." The commission will release its next report advising on how to tackle chronic health issues in the next 100 days, which falls on Aug. 30.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republican leadership celebrated passing President Donald Trump's ‘one big, beautiful bill' on Thursday morning. House Republicans took a victory lap Thursday morning after passing President Donald Trump's "one big, beautiful bill." "It's finally morning in America again," House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed 215 to 214. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., voted "present." "Today, the House has passed generational, truly nation-shaping legislation to reduce spending and permanently lower taxes for families and job creators, secure the border, unleash American energy dominance, restore peace through strength and make government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans," Johnson added. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks to the media after the House narrowly passed President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill." The bill is a victory for Trump and House Republicans, who overcame policy disagreements to deliver on Trump's key campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts and no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security. "We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation. We stand ready to continue our work together to deliver on the one big, beautiful bill, as President Trump named it himself. We're going to get there by Independence Day, on July 4th, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America," Johnson said. House leaders took turns Thursday thanking Republicans for rallying together to pass the bill. "Democrats made it very clear they didn't want to have any part in helping get America back on track again, but we were never fettered when this bill could have failed 10 times over. And we meant it," said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. Trump celebrated his victory on Thursday in a Truth Social post. "Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! There is no time to waste," Trump wrote. The multitrillion-dollar bill includes provisions to advance Trump's "America First" agenda by lowering taxes, securing the border, increasing national defense, reforming Medicaid and slashing Biden-era energy policies. The bill aims to make a dent in the federal government's spending trajectory by cutting roughly $1.5 trillion in government spending elsewhere. The U.S. government is still more than $36 trillion in debt and has spent $1.05 trillion more than it has collected in the 2025 fiscal year, according to the Treasury Department. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., touted Trump's border security investments in the "big, beautiful bill." We've shown, time and time again, that we deliver for the American people, especially when it matters most. By taking hold of this historic opportunity, I truly believe we've unlocked the opportunities for generations to come," House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said. "Democrats voted to put Americans last, and it's a shame. But thank God for House Republicans, and thank God for our president, Donald J. Trump," said GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich. Senate Republicans have already signaled they expect to make changes to the bill when it reaches the upper chamber, despite House GOP leaders publicly urging them to amend as little as possible. A significant number of senators have voiced concern over the extent of Medicaid and SNAP cuts proposed by the House. And Senate Democrats are already piling on the criticism of Trump's "big, beautiful bill." There's nothing beautiful about stripping away people's healthcare, forcing kids to go hungry, denying communities the resources they need, and increasing poverty," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Thursday.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? One of the GOP justices must have defected in a case about religious schools, but the Court didn't reveal who it was. The justices split 4-4 in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. That means that an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision holding that the state should not and cannot fund a Catholic charter school stands, and there can be no religious public schools — for now. At oral arguments in Oklahoma, this case appeared likely to be the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions mandating government funding of religious education. Most notably, in Carson v. Makin (2022), the Court held that states that offer private school tuition vouchers must allow those vouchers to be used to pay tuition at religious schools. Both federal law and the laws of 46 states also require charter schools to be non-religious. Though Thursday's non-decision in Oklahoma means that this long-standing regime guaranteeing public schools remain secular institutions is still in effect, it is far from clear whether this regime will last. Though Barrett, a Republican who voted in the majority in Carson, did not say why she recused herself from the Oklahoma case, USA Today notes she “is close friends with the Notre Dame Law School professor who was an early legal adviser to the Catholic Church in Oklahoma.” Before joining the bench, Barrett was a tenured professor at Notre Dame's law school. It is likely that proponents of religious charter schools will simply try again to create such a school, this time without doing so in a way that causes Barrett to recuse. If Barrett is present for those future arguments and applies similar reasoning to the decision she joined in Carson, she could easily be the fifth vote for religious charter schools. The Court also did not reveal in its very brief order resolving the Oklahoma case how each justice voted, but based on their past decisions and their comments at oral arguments in Oklahoma, it is extremely likely that all of the Court's three Democrats voted against allowing religious public schools. That means one of the five Republicans who were not recused from this case, all of whom joined the majority in Carson, defected. Because none of the justices explained why they voted as they did in Oklahoma, we also do not know why this defection happened. Religious charter schools remain unlawful, for now. But it is far from clear whether they will remain so in the future. Much of the hearing focused on whether Richard Nixon can save Trump's tariffs.

A federal judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs. It marks a setback to one of Trump's major campaign promises. Leavitt used her press briefing to attack by name the federal judge who ruled that the White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries, calling Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston a “liberal activist” and accusing the jurist of threatening U.S. diplomatic relationships. “Judge Brian Murphy is not the secretary of State. The president will take part in a gathering in Calgary, Canada, from June 15 to June 17 with leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Thursday, May 22, 2025, in Washington. Leavitt said “hatred has no place in the United States of America” under Trump. The 7-hour-long voiced read was created with technology from ElevenLabs, a startup that has helped other people mimic their own voices when medical issues rob them of their speech. The first lady's embrace of AI for her book comes as her husband has said he wants to limit regulations on the technology that could hinder innovation. The president and first lady also recently signed the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including through AI deepfakes. As House Republicans passed their multitrillion-dollar budget bill overnight, 562 state lawmakers signed a letter to Congressional leadership urging them not to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood and calling the organization “an integral and irreplaceable part of the health care system.” “‘Defunding' Planned Parenthood blocks patients from getting the care they need and increases health care costs for everyone,” the letter said. It also performs more cancer screening and prevention procedures than abortions, according to the report. That's according to an American official familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss an upcoming private diplomatic meeting. Steve Witkoff, special envoy, watches as President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. 3, 2025, in Washington. Witkoff and the State Department's director of policy planning Michael Anton will attend Friday's talks in Rome that had been announced earlier by Oman's foreign minister whose country has been mediating the talks, the official said. The U.S. Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and plans to stop making the coin when those run out, a Treasury official confirmed Thursday. In February, President Trump announced he ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin. Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint. U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump's goal to dismantle the department. It marks a setback to one of the Republican president's campaign promises. ▶ Read more about Trump's effort to shut down the Education Department FILE - Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Saturday, July 27, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) The dinner Trump is hosting at his suburban Washington golf club is for top investors in a meme coin controlled by his family. “It's auctioning off access,” Blumenthal said on a press call. The senator said those attending Thursday night's dinner don't have to file any federal paperwork — despite enriching the Trump Organization — because crypto currency isn't regulated like traditional campaign donations. Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said during a contentious House hearing earlier this month, “Never in American history has a sitting president so blatantly violated the ethics laws.” Attorney General Pam Bondi, center, walks to her car as law enforcement work the scene after two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in Washington were shot and killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum, Thursday, May 22, 2025, in Washington. Netanyahu “told the families that he shares in their deep sorrow, together with the entire Jewish People,” his office said in a statement. The prime minister also spoke with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, his office said. “It is just a horrific tragedy, an act of terror, and another way in which we have to recognize Jewish people all over the world are being singled out for these kind of horrible attacks,” U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said in an interview on Fox & Friends. Huckabee went on to push back against critics of Israel's execution of the war in Gaza, blaming Hamas for the war dragging on. “We've got a lot of ignorant, idiotic people who don't seem to understand the difference between right and wrong,” Huckabee said. It seems like a triumph for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought mainstream acceptance: Top investors in one of President Trump's crypto projects invited to dine with him at his luxury golf club in Northern Virginia on the heels of the Senate advancing key pro-crypto legislation and while bitcoin prices soar. While Democrats charge that Trump is using the power of the presidency to boost profits for his family business, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts worry that the president's push into meme coins isn't helping their efforts to establish the credibility, stability and legitimacy they had thought his administration would bring to their businesses. The president in his morning social media posting praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican leadership for getting his major tax bill through the lower chamber. Now, he's pushing Senate Republicans to get moving and notch a political win on Democrats. The Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination.” FILE - The Planned Parenthood Health Center located in Chapel Hill, N.C., is seen, May 3, 2024. Planned Parenthood will spend $40 million ahead of November's elections to bolster President Joe Biden and leading congressional Democrats. The group says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to one-third of its health centers closing. Planned Parenthood said about 200 centers are at risk — most of them in states where abortion is legal. The nation's largest abortion provider also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening. State Medicaid money covers abortion in some states, but not others. “We're in a fight for survival — not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,” Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the provision, saying in a statement, “Congress took a big step toward stopping taxpayer funding of the Big Abortion industry.” The institute and many of its board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and stop DOGE from taking over its operations. U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell's opinion on Monday reversed DOGE's actions. Speaking after a short examination of the headquarters, Moose said all appeared to be in order. Here's a look at what's in the legislative package, which is expected to undergo more changes when it goes to the Senate: The outcome caps an intense time on Capitol Hill, with days of private negotiations and public committee hearings, many happening back-to-back, around-the-clock.</p>

He's the best player on an Oklahoma City Thunder team that had the best record this season and set a league mark for margin of victory. If that wasn't enough, he also won the scoring title. It's now seven straight years that a player born outside the U.S. won MVP, extending the longest such streak in league history. And when it happened, Gilgeous-Alexander said a life of moments — getting cut, traded, overlooked, celebrating, the wins, the good times — all flooded into his mind. “I don't think there's enough emphasis on how much off the court influences on the court,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “And once I became better off the court my career started to skyrocket. Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander signs autographs prior to Game 1 vs. Minnesota Timberwolves in a NBA basketball Western Conference Finals playoff series Tuesday, May 20, 2025, in Oklahoma City. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, getting 88 of the 100 possible third-place votes. 11 pick in the 2018 draft — averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game this season, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record. He becomes the second Canadian to win MVP; Steve Nash won it twice. “He set the foundation,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of Nash. “He was the first Canadian basketball player I knew of. And without seeing guys go to the NBA from Canada, it wouldn't have been as much of a dream as it was for us as kids growing up. And Gilgeous-Alexander is the first guard to win MVP since James Harden in 2018. “His confidence that he has in himself and the confidence that he instills in every one of his teammates, including the coaches.” Jokic — a winner of three of the last four MVP awards — was second, despite a season for the ages. He averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game, the first center to average a triple-double and the first player since all those stats were tracked to finish in the NBA's top three in all three of those categories. Russell Westbrook did it four times and Oscar Robertson once, but only one of those triple-double seasons led to an MVP win. Antetokounmpo, who averaged 30.4 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, was third. He started this run of international players winning MVP; Antetokounmpo, of Greek and Nigerian descent, won in 2019 and 2020. Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic warms up before Game 7 in the Western Conference semifinals of the NBA basketball playoffs against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Sunday, May 18, 2025, in Oklahoma City. And Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, who was born in Cameroon but since became a U.S. citizen, won the award in 2023. Now, it's Gilgeous-Alexander — a son of Ontario, where hockey reigns — carrying the MVP flag. He was fifth in the voting two years ago, second behind Jokic last year, and used being so close to the award as fuel this season. “And last year, all it meant was that more people thought I shouldn't have won than should have won. This year I wanted to change the narrative and have it flipped. Boston's Jayson Tatum was fourth, Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James was sixth — the 20th time in his 22-year career that he got some MVP votes. Detroit's Cade Cunningham and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards tied for seventh, Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth and three players — the Los Angeles Clippers' Harden, New York's Jalen Brunson and Cleveland's Evan Mobley — tied for 10th.

The award came at a price for Gilgeous-Alexander, who is in line for an extension that will easily top $300 million and could even see him make about $1 million per regular-season game in 2030-31 and 2031-32.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Apple users are starting to get ways out of the iPhone maker's so-called “walled garden.” For years, the company blocked app developers from informing people about how to pay for a subscription or service that didn't involve going through its own iOS App Store. But all that changed last month, when U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a scathing decision against Apple that promises to shake up the iPhone app payment ecosystem. She also ordered Apple to stop preventing app makers from communicating directly with users through their apps to let them know about deals and offers. She told Apple not to impose new commissions on purchases made outside the App Store. Some companies, including Spotify, moved quickly to capitalize on the judge's demand with app updates. That's because Spotify long ago removed the in-app payment option in protest against Apple's practice of requiring that digital subscriptions be bought only through iOS apps while taking a commission of up to 30%. Following a U.S. app update, Spotify said users “can finally see how much something costs in our app, including pricing details on subscriptions and information about promotions that will save money.” Free users who want to upgrade to a premium subscription can sign up by tapping a button directly in the app. And in another update, the company said users can also view individual audiobook prices and buy them within the Spotify app. Premium subscribers will also be able to buy “top up” hours for audiobook listening if they've maxed out their 15 free listening hours each month. Five years after Apple ousted Fortnite for trying to introduce a direct payment plan to bypass the App Store, the popular game is back on iOS. The comeback appeared in jeopardy after Apple initially refused to approve Fortnite's bid before Apple relented this week, clearing the app for U.S. users. It's also back in the European Union, where alternative app marketplaces have been mandated since last year. Fortnite maker Epic Games had previewed the updated app's new payment buttons to let players buy V-bucks currency to spend on character “cosmetics” like outfits, wraps for weapons or dance movements known as “emotes.” One button leads to Apple's in-app purchasing system while the other is for Epic's own payment system, which can earn players up to 20% extra V-bucks for their accounts. Amazon has updated its Kindle app to add a button so that users can more easily buy books directly from their iPhones. Previously, users could only look up books and download a sample on the app, but did not have an option to buy directly. “We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible,” Amazon said in a statement. If you support online creators by paying for their podcasts, videos, music or other content on Patreon, you've now got the option to bypass Apple when buying subscriptions. You can use credit cards, PayPal, Venmo or even the Apple Pay mobile wallet. There's still the option to stick with Apple's in-app purchasing system — displayed less prominently underneath the Join button — which will include Apple's fees, according to screenshots posted on Patreon's website. Patreon said the update doesn't apply to fans in other countries. The platform said that based on Apple's feedback, eventually it will move its alternative checkout method to an external browser so it can continue to avoid adding the extra fees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It's a provocative idea: that empathy — that is, putting yourself in another person's proverbial shoes, and feeling what they feel — is a sin. The Bible contains repeated invocations from Jesus to show deep empathy and compassion for others, including complete strangers. Moreover, Christianity is built around a fundamental act of empathy so radical — Jesus dying for our sins — that it's difficult to spin as harmful. Yet as stunning as it may sound, “empathy is a sin” is a claim that's been growing in recent years across the Christian right. In this construction, empathy is a cudgel that progressives and liberals use to berate and/or guilt-trip Christians into showing empathy to the “wrong” people. Yet we are living in an age when the Christian right has gained unprecedented power, both sociocultural and political. The increasing overlap between conservative culture and right-leaning tech spaces means that many disparate public figures are all drinking from the same well of ideas — and so a broader, secular version of the belief that empathy is a tool of manipulation has bubbled into the mainstream through influential figures like Elon Musk. On Reddit, which tends to be relatively left-wing, one popular mantra is that you can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. That is, too much empathy for someone else can erode your own sense of self, leaving you codependent or open to emotional abuse and manipulation. But in recent months, the idea that empathy is inherently destructive has not only become a major source of debate among Christians, it's escaped containment and barreled into the mainstream by way of major media outlets, political figures, and influencers. The conversation began with an incendiary 2019 essay by Rigney, then a longtime teacher and pastor at a Baptist seminary, in which he introduced “the enticing sin of empathy” and argued that Satan manipulates people through the intense cultural pressure to feel others' pain and suffering. Rigney's ideas were met with ideological pushback, with one Christian blogger saying it “may be the most unwise piece of pastoral theology I've seen in my lifetime.” As his essay incited national debate, Rigney himself grew more controversial, facing allegations of dismissing women and telling one now-former Black congregant at his Minneapolis church that “it wouldn't be sinful for him to own me & my family today.” (In an email to Vox, Rigney denied the congregant's version of events.) In practice, what Rigney is typically decrying is any empathy for a liberal perspective or for someone who's part of a marginalized community. Now well-known for spreading Christian nationalism, and for allegedly fostering a culture of abuse (allegations he has denied), Wilson's infamy also comes from his co-authored 1996 essay “Southern Slavery: As It Was,” in which he claimed that “Slavery produced in the South a genuine affection between the races that we believe we can say has never existed in any nation before the War or since.” (“My defense of the South does not make me a racist,” Wilson said in 2003.) Rigney appeared on Wilson's 2019 podcast series Man Rampant to discuss empathy; their conversation quickly devolved into decrying fake rape allegations and musing that victims of police violence might have “deserved to be shot.” In an email, Rigney told me that both he and Wilson developed their similar views on empathy from the therapist and Rabbi Edwin Friedman, whose posthumously published 1999 book, A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix, has influenced not only family therapy but conservative church leadership and thought. In the book, Friedman argues that American society has devalued the self, leading to an emotional regression and a “low pain threshold.” Alongside this he compares “political correctness” to the Inquisition, and frames a “chronically anxious America” as one that is “organize[d] around its most dysfunctional elements,” in which leaders have difficulty making tough decisions. This correlation of emotional weakness with societal excess paved the way for Rigney to frame empathy itself as a dangerous weapon. “Just as ‘the sin of anger' refers to unrighteous or ungoverned anger, so the sin of empathy refers to ungoverned, excessive, and untethered empathy,” Rigney told me. This kind of unrestrained empathy, he writes, is a recipe for cultural mayhem. In practice, what Rigney is typically decrying is any empathy for a liberal perspective or for someone who's part of a marginalized community. Despite receiving firm pushback from most religious leaders (and indeed most people) who hear about it, Rigney's argument has been spreading through the Christian right at large. Last year, conservative personality and author Allie Stuckey published Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion, in which she argues that “toxic empathy is a dangerous guide for our decisions, behavior, and public policy” while condemning queer people and feminists. “Empathy almost needs to be struck from the Christian vocabulary,” Josh McPherson, host of the Christian-centered Stronger Man Nation podcast and an adherent of Wilson and Rigney's ideas, said in January, in a clip that garnered an outsize amount of attention relative to the podcast episode itself. That same month, Vice President JD Vance struck a nerve with a controversial appearance on Fox News in which he seemed to reference both the empathy conversation and the archaic Catholic concept of “ordo amoris,” meaning “the order of love.” As Vance put it, it's the idea that one's family should come before anyone else: “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country,” he said. As part of the odd crossover between far-right religion and online reactionaries, it picked up surprising alliances along the way, including evolutionary biologist turned far-right gadfly Gad Saad. In January, Saad, applying a survival-of-the-fittest approach to our emotions, argued against “suicidal empathy,” which he described as “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets.” (Who are the wrong targets according to Saad? In a February appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Elon Musk explicitly referenced Saad but went even further, stating, “The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy — the empathy exploit. That same month, a broad-ranging conversation in the New Yorker with Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, led to interviewer Isaac Chotiner pressing him about why empathy is bad. The connective tissue across all these disparate anti-empathy voices is two-fold, according to Christian scholar Karen Swallow Prior. Prior, an anti-abortion ethicist and former longtime Liberty University professor, singled out the argument's outsize emphasis on attacking very small, very vulnerable groups — as well as the moment in which it's all happening. “The entire discourse around empathy is backlash against those who are questioning the authority of those in power,” she told me, “not coincidentally emerging in a period where we have a rise in recognition of overly controlling and narcissistic leaders, both in and outside the church.” Those people “understand and appreciate empathy the least.” “He made it kind of cool for Christians to be jerks,” Bell said. Prior believes that the argument won't have a long shelf life because Rigney's idea is so convoluted. That hypermasculinity goes hand in hand with evangelical culture, and with the ideas Rigney borrowed from Friedman about too many emotions being a weakness. That leads us to the grimmest part of Rigney's “untethered empathy” claims: the way he explicitly genders it — and demonizes it — as feminine. Throughout his book, he argues that women are more empathetic than men, and that as a result, they are more prone to giving into it as a sin. It's an inherently misogynistic view that undermines women's decision-making and leadership abilities. Though Rigney pushed back against this characterization in an email to me, arguing that critics have distorted what he views as merely “gendered tendencies and susceptibility to particular temptations,” he also couldn't help reinforcing it. “Everybody's supposed to have sympathy for the white male,” she said, “but when you show empathy to anyone else, suddenly empathy is a sin.” What's heartening is that, whether they realize what kind of dangerous extremism undergirds it, most people aren't buying Rigney's “empathy is sin” claim. Across the nation, in response to Rigney's assertion, the catchphrase, “If empathy is a sin, then sin boldly” has arisen, as heard in pulpits, seen on church marquees, and worn on T-shirts — a reminder that it takes much more than the semantic whims of a few extremists to shake something most people hold in their hearts. From F1 influencers to Taylor Swift, WAGs are in a new golden age. Now is a good time to think about tech training wheels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When CNN's Jake Tapper went on his book tour, he probably did not expect it to turn into an apology tour instead. “Knowing what I know now, obviously I feel tremendous humility about my coverage,” Tapper confessed to Megyn Kelly when he joined her influential podcast to discuss the book he co-authored with Alex Thompson, a reporter for Axios, about the age-related decline of former President Joe Biden and its cover-up. And I own that.” Here, Tapper is referring to a 2020 interview he did with Lara Trump in which he accused her of ridiculing Biden's stutter at an event. I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline.” '” The CNN anchor now says he apologized to Lara Trump “months ago.” He added, “But yeah, I mean, of course, I look back at my coverage with humility. The reappraisal of Biden's physical and mental abilities while in office is really primarily a media story. Yes, Biden was enabled by people around him, including his family and White House staff. But it was the task of the press to report facts that would help voters understand whether Biden was up to doing that highly coveted job. (In giving him an award for his 2024 coverage of Biden, the White House Correspondents Association seemingly acknowledged Thompson was a rare exception to the rule.) The steady stream of new accounts examining Biden's limitations as president, including the Tapper-Thompson Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, contains revelatory details and interesting color. But they don't reach conclusions about Biden's condition that are markedly different from those most voters, including many rank-and-file Democrats, arrived at on their own simply by watching him. Reading the Washington Examiner would have helped voters gain insight into Biden's age problem years before the current flood of books only now being published after he left office. “Whatever their differences, the two front-runners in the Democratic presidential race, Joe Biden, born November 20, 1942, and Bernie Sanders, born September 8, 1941, share one common trait: They are too old to be president,” chief political correspondent Byron York wrote in April 2019. “And that fact is, Biden, now 77, has clearly slowed down,” York wrote in late July 2020. … At the moment, Biden is facing very little commentary and criticism about his age. There was more discussion of age when Republican John McCain, who would have been 72 had he been elected, ran in 2008, and when Republican Bob Dole, who would have been 73, ran in 1996. “President Joe Biden's great age and concomitant physical and mental decline have been subjects of intensifying contention since before Democrats first chose him as their leader in 2020,” Gurdon wrote in late 2023, nearly 190 days before Biden's catastrophic debate with President Donald Trump. Gurdon added that Biden's “aides and first lady Jill Biden do their best to manage his schedule and lighten his load. They want to reduce his commitments, so he doesn't tire himself out, thereby cutting down on opportunities for him to embarrass himself and the rest of us at our choice of president.” David Freddoso wrote for the Washington Examiner magazine in February 2024 about how some progressive Democrats saw Biden's deficits as an asset. Megyn Kelly, her former colleagues at Fox News, and many others in conservative media raised similar questions about Biden. But it's not impossible to imagine a popular groundswell in which the press, backed by supermajorities of Democrats, had successfully applied all its leverage with the aim of convincing Biden to bow out at the end of his first term.” But this exact scenario unfolded much as he described it in the aftermath of Biden's dreadful June 27, 2024, debate showing. That's when the press as a whole, without any “conservative” qualifier, turned sharply against Biden as it appeared he was not up to beating Trump a second time. Olivia Nuzzi's New York magazine piece came out seven days after the debate. After the debate, some Democrats who had publicly pushed back began calling for Biden to reconsider his reelection campaign. Some outlets undoubtedly preferred to have concerns about Biden's age and capacity to run or serve come from Democrats rather than let Republicans repeat their familiar criticisms of “Sleepy Joe.” Man bites dog, Dems bite Biden. After the debate, more Democrats were willing to go on the record with these complaints, and it's likely that editors were more comfortable running what was still on background. “The editors who drove a lot of these coverage decisions will remain quiet and hidden,” Axios reporter Marc Caputo wrote on X. “This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever,” Scarborough asserted in March 2024, after calling the then-president “more than cogent.” The Morning Joe host finally admitted on Wednesday that he was “obviously wrong.” (Albeit with more caveats than he applied to his original statement.) The obviousness is now being used to defend how Biden was covered. Mark Leibovich unloaded in the Atlantic about “why I think that the ‘cover-up' of Biden's ‘true condition' is beside the point — and why I'm not really vibing with the umbrage-mongering: It's pretty much impossible to ‘cover up' for something that is hiding in plain sight.” “Democrats could trot out as many White House officials as they wanted to claim I was with the president just this morning, and he was sharp as a tack and running circles around staffers less than half his age,” he continued. Journalistic problems with this take aside, Leibovich sang a different tune in 2023. Fast-forward to May 2025, and now Leibovich writes, “Biden was in no position to keep doing his job given his condition, which had been evident for years to most people paying even casual attention.” Leibovich, nevertheless, highlights, however tendentiously, an important point: Biden has spoken on television and in public for decades. His diminishment as a communicator, at least, was obvious to anyone covering him. And Biden's public schedule both suggested that the White House was cognizant of that decline and that there was, as Tapper and Thompson write in their book, “a limit to the hours in which he could reliably function.” There was nothing former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre or top advisers like Anita Dunn or $4 million man Michael Donilon could really say that would alter what voters — or journalists, for that matter — could see and hear for themselves. A real test of whether anyone has learned anything will be how the larger media treats questions surrounding Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and transparency about his health while he was still president. Those questions should be handled sensitively, given the severity of Biden's condition, but they still need to be asked and answered forthrightly. So far, it has been a mixed bag: a number of nuanced interviews with urologists and other medical experts discussing the odds that Biden's cancer would have appeared so suddenly, but also an at least arguably disproportionate focus on what Trump is saying — almost always “without evidence” — about the matter. Some Democrats have urged that the discussion be “muted” as Biden recovers. “Alex and I are here to say the conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul searching, not just among me, but among the legacy media,” Tapper told Kelly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A top Romanian court on Thursday validated the results of Romania's presidential election rerun, shortly after rejecting a request to annul the results by the hard-right candidate who decisively lost the race to his pro-European Union opponent. After deliberations on Thursday, Romania's Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the annulment request, filed on Tuesday by George Simion, in which he alleged that foreign interference and coordinated manipulation affected the vote. “A new chapter is beginning in Romania's recent and contemporary history. I want to assure Romanian citizens that I understand the responsibility of the mandate they have entrusted to me,” he said. The court said its decision on Thursday is final. In his request to annul the election, Simion claimed he had “irrefutable evidence” that France, Moldova and “other actors” meddled in the ballot, but did not present any evidence. “We have no choice but to fight!,” his post read. “I call on you to stand with me, today and in the coming weeks!” The Court's unprecedented decision last year to cancel the election plunged EU and NATO member Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, compounded by a string of crises such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and a significant budget deficit. Dan is expected to be officially sworn in next week, after which he must also contend with deep societal divisions laid bare by the vote, revealing a country where endemic corruption, inequality and an erosion of trust in traditional institutions and parties have fueled a broad rejection of the political establishment. “Romanian society has shown wisdom, and I am convinced that in the period ahead, it will continue to push for the positive change that Romania needs,” Dan added Thursday. “I will fight for the strengthening of state institutions ... Dan will also face the challenge of nominating a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a government — a tall order in a country where strong anti-establishment sentiment led to the emergence of figures like Georgescu and Simion. Simion capitalized on the furor over last year's annulment and, after coming fourth in the canceled race, allied with Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. Hours after voting opened on Friday for Romanians abroad, Simion accused the government of neighboring Moldova of election fraud, which both Moldovan and Romanian authorities rejected. In comment to The Associated Press on Sunday, he reiterated claims that people were being illegally transported to voting stations in Moldova, allegedly affecting 80,000 votes. More than half a million Moldovans hold Romanian citizenship, and about 158,000 people voted at polling stations set up in Moldova in the second round. Many more dual citizens would also have cast ballots in other countries. Many observers saw Sunday's vote as crucial to maintaining Romania's place within the network of Western alliances — especially amid fears that the Trump administration is reconsidering its security commitments to the United States' European partners.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Critics of the president's decision to auction off a private dinner via his Trump-branded crypto token were worried about the stunt for a few reasons. Billed by organizers as the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world,” Thursday's gala is set to take place at the president's private Trump National Golf Club, just outside of Washington, DC, according to an email sent to guests and reviewed by Fortune. The guests are expected to include President Donald Trump himself and 220 of the top $TRUMP buyers, who collectively dumped an estimated $148 million over three weeks into the memecoin — a type of crypto product that is functionally useless as a currency or investment vehicle, and one that serious investors avoid because of their tendency to collapse in value. And because crypto is anonymous by design, the identities of the top investors — who appeared on a public leaderboard with nothing but self-selected three- or four-letter usernames and long, cryptographic digital wallet addresses — aren't easy to pin down. But an analysis by Bloomberg News found that all but six of the top 25 holders of the $TRUMP memecoin used foreign exchanges that are ostensibly off-limits to anyone living in the US. More than half of the top 220 holders used similar offshore exchanges, Bloomberg found. His apparent contempt for such boundaries has angered commentators across the political spectrum. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who introduced legislation to ban officials from selling memecoins, said in a hearing this week that the gala “represents a real problem” because there is “clearly a way around the State Department for foreign individuals of significant influence and wealth to be able to directly lobby the president.” And even Republican crypto advocate Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said the event gives her “pause.” The progressive advocacy group Public Citizen is organizing a protest outside the Potomac Falls, Virginia, golf course on Thursday, and is calling on the Department of Justice and other officials to hold Trump accountable. “He'd help himself by calling off his Thursday gala,” the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page wrote Tuesday. “If he won't do that, he could at least disclose his crypto contest's winners so Americans know who may be trying to buy access to the President.” When CNN asked the White House whether a gala guest list would be released, a spokesperson replied with a statement saying: “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.” Organizers of the auction didn't respond to CNN's request for comment. One publicly known guest is Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur, who wasn't exactly hiding his status. Sun later confirmed on social media Tuesday that he was “honored” to support Trump and excited to attend the gala “as his TOP fan!” Trump's reelection and his newfound enthusiasm for crypto came at a fortunate time for Sun, the 34-year-old founder of blockchain company Tron. In 2023, US regulators charged Sun and his company with selling unregistered securities and fraudulently manipulating the price of the digital token Tronix. Sun eventually poured at least $75 million into the World Liberty token (which is separate from the $TRUMP token), and he's amassed more than $22 million worth of President Trump's memecoin, based on Wednesday's prices. All told, Sun's actions, including the buying they sparked from other crypto enthusiasts, have generated an estimated $400 million windfall for the Trump family, according to Forbes. Then, about a month into Trump's second term, the Securities and Exchange Commission did a 180 on virtually all of its crypto enforcement actions, including the civil fraud charges it had filed against Sun and his company. In February, SEC lawyers asked a federal judge to put the agency's civil fraud case on hold, citing “the public's interest.” He's known as a showman, having previously spent $4.6 million on a dinner with Warren Buffett (which Sun canceled and rescheduled) and $28 million to join Jeff Bezos aboard Blue Origin's first crewed mission (though Sun had to drop out). Sun, who told Forbes his net worth from his expansive crypto empire is over $40 billion, made headlines last year when he bought a $6.2 million conceptual artwork of a banana duct-taped to a wall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump's whirlwind visit last week to the Middle East saw a wave of AI dealmaking that could reshape the global technology landscape. US companies Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm also announced deals to supply chips and partner on AI infrastructure with Humain. The Trump administration also announced that it would rescind and replace the “AI Diffusion” rule, a Biden-era regulation capping sales of the most advanced chips that was set to take effect on May 15. By comparison, the current global market capacity of data centers is approximately 59 gigawatts – according to Goldman Sachs. The Trump administration said that it also secured Saudi and UAE investment for data centers located in the US. The deals, and new partnerships, could reshape the global AI landscape in myriad ways, according to officials and experts. “We're still waiting for the full details to emerge, but the scale of some of these announced projects is massive,” says Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, whose focus is technology and international affairs. Trump's AI czar David Sacks said in a post on X that the deals are a “game-changer in the global AI race” that will “help to cement American technology as the global standard – before our competitors can catch up.” Some experts agree that working with the Middle East will fill gaps in current US capabilities. “We have a huge problem when it comes to fueling our own data center infrastructure in the US,” Mohammed Soliman, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think-tank in Washington-DC, tells CNN. Growing demand for energy to power data centers has strained parts of the US grid. Although some say the issue can be resolved domestically, others say partnering with the oil-rich Gulf is a wise strategic bet. “There's not really an immediate [domestic] solution,” Soliman adds, “You need to invest heavily in energy infrastructure, and that takes capital, land, a lot of resources, and time.” On May 19, leading Democrats warned in a letter that “the deals – without any clear and enforceable protections to stop this sensitive technology from falling into China's hands – present an immediate national security threat.” If chips are given directly to Saudi and Emirati companies, without the right safeguards, it could present national security risks, and the nations could employ them for tasks like autonomous weapons research and development, says Winter-Levy. In another possible scenario, in which the data centers might be controlled and operated by US tech companies, he says the risks are more limited. The UAE and Saudi Arabia both have ambitious plans to build AI industries to prepare their economies for a post-oil future. US authorities say that not working with the Gulf could have increased the risks of a Gulf-China AI alliance. The chip technology of companies like Huawei is quickly advancing. He adds that current talent constraints might hold the region back from competing with current AI leaders US and China. Experts say the deals mark a new era in US-Gulf relations. But if a situation emerges in the future where a significant amount of US computing power is in the region, said Winter-Levy, it could give Gulf governments “some significant degree of leverage, both over US tech companies but also over US foreign policy more generally.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an elaborate battle of Senate procedure, Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) set the stage for California‘s strict emissions standards to be repealed. But first, Republicans had to overcome a series of objections raised by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who accused Republicans of setting a filibuster-breaking precedent with their vote. A vote for repeal would ignore the Government Accountability Office, which determined the waivers are not eligible under a fast-tracking process used to reverse regulations. The floor vote reflected a carefully calibrated attempt not to challenge the parliamentarian directly, a prospect that initially prompted GOP concern. Democrats were ultimately unsuccessful as Schumer moved to recess or adjourn the chamber. Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier… pic.twitter.com/ahMkns1uTB Schumer relented shortly before 11 p.m., but not before warning that Democrats would take an expansive view of the filibuster-skirting Congressional Review Act when they returned to power. “Make no mistake, Republicans have set a new precedent that will come back to haunt them and haunt this chamber,” Schumer said. Thune rebutted Schumer in a Tuesday floor speech announcing the vote and again on Wednesday. In a Washington Examiner op-ed, Thune denied that Republicans were weakening the filibuster and accused the “audacious” GAO of improperly limiting Congress's power.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Two Israeli Embassy staff members were killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting an event on Wednesday night. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing to reporters today that Trump is “saddened and outraged” over the killing of the embassy workers. “The evil of antisemitism must be eradicated from our society,” she said. She called the two diplomats killed, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, a “beautiful young couple” and talked about their love for each other. Leavitt said she talked to Attorney General Pam Bondi this morning. Shortly after two Israeli embassy staffers were killed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night, a lengthy letter authorities are investigating as potentially being authored by the suspected gunman was posted to social media advocating for violent retaliation over the war in Gaza. The letter was posted to an account on X that has a long history of expressing outrage over Israel's treatment of Palestinians. A CNN review of that X account, @kyotoleather, found that it is linked to other accounts with the name and photo of Elias Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago who authorities identified as the suspected shooter and included replies in which other users addressed him by name. Authorities are also investigating whether the account was Rodriguez's, according to multiple law enforcement sources. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X, that “the FBI is aware of certain writings allegedly authored by the suspect, and we hope to have updates as to the authenticity very soon.” Police say that Rodriguez approached a group of four people outside the Capital Jewish Museum and opened fire with a handgun shortly after 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, fatally killing two people who worked for the Israeli Embassy. The letter describes the author's anger with a perceived a lack of action from Western and Arab governments to stop Israel's war in Gaza, advocates for armed action and compares it to forms of nonviolent protest. CNN's Sabrina Shulman, Evan Perez and Holmes Lybrand contributed reporting to this post. US President Donald Trump expressed his “deep sorrow” over the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in a phone call with Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu today, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office. Netanyahu also thanked Trump for “the efforts he and his administration are making against manifestations of anti-Semitism in the United States,” it added. Leiter said he talked to Trump last night and met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and interim DC attorney Jeanine Pirro at the site of the shooting. He said the US president was “very firm in his statement expressing condolence and condemning violence.” This post has been updated with more from the Trump-Netanyahu call. The alleged shooter is expected to make his first appearance today in Federal court later this afternoon, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Sarah Milgrim, one of the Israeli Embassy staffers killed last night, was “a devoted and active volunteer” for Tech2Peace, an organization that provides entrepreneurial training to young Palestinians and Israelis alongside conflict dialogue. “Sarah was a deeply curious person, always seeking to learn and connect. She brought people together with empathy and purpose, and her dedication to building a better future was evident in everything she did. Her voice and spirit will be profoundly missed,” Tech2Peace said in a statement today. Esti Rozenfeld, CEO of Tech2Peace, told CNN that Milgrim managed two seminars while she worked there, which was an intensive process. Rozenfeld said plans were in the works for a memorial to honor Milgrim next week. Yaron Lischinsky, the other victim of the shooting, was a “respectful and kind person” who loved books and working in diplomacy, one of his friends from Reichman University in Israel told CNN. “We would sit in various coffee shops around Jerusalem, discussing religion, politics, and books,” his friend Jakub Klepek told CNN in a message. “We often exchanged book titles and then jokingly complained about not being able to start new ones because of our university reading lists.” “What made him stand out was not just his intelligence, but his generosity of spirit,” Klepek said, who also described 30-year-old Lischinsky as a “man of purpose.” FBI Chicago is “is conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity in the Chicago area in relation to yesterday's tragic shooting in Washington, D.C.,” according to a post on X from the FBI's Washington field office. Earlier, CNN observed that law enforcement was searching an address in Chicago that appeared to be associated with the suspected shooter. Law enforcement did not confirm that the address was associated with the shooter but public records appear to show that. Police said the suspect was from Chicago, and it's unclear what if any connections he has with Washington, and how long he has been in the city. Organizers of the event did not list its location, which according to the American Jewish Committee's website was available upon registration. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's accusation that European officials are inciting antisemitism is “outrageous and completely unjustified,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson said today. Sa'ar earlier said an atmosphere of “antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement” led to the killings of Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, DC, pointing blame at officials in “many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe.” French foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told journalists this accusation was “outrageous and completely unjustified,” adding that “France has condemned, France condemns, and France will continue to always and unambiguously condemn any antisemitic act.” Some context: Sa'ar's accusation came with the backdrop of tense diplomatic relations between Israel and European leaders, as both the European Union and the United Kingdom announced measures distancing themselves from Israel over its new military offensive and aid blockade in Gaza. The UK paused trade negotiations and sanctioned West Bank settlers as Britain's foreign minister slammed Israel's actions in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” Meanwhile, the EU announced it would review its relationship with Israel, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip” as his military roots out Hamas in the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians face starvation due to the Israeli blockade. May they, and all who grieve this devastating loss, be comforted by their communities,” Dr. Beatrice Gurwitz said. “In an act of horrific antisemitic violence, a gunman attacked our beloved community. Such acts of terror attempt to instill fear, silence voices, and erase history — but we refuse to let them succeed,” she said. “No parents should have to be called and told that their children were violently murdered leaving a religious event at the Jewish Museum,” Bondi said. Bondi declined to comment on where the investigation stands and whether the suspect, who is in custody, is cooperating with authorities. The attorney general said that federal and local law enforcement are working “hand in hand” to investigate the “horrific” attack, and that the department is “doing everything we can to protect our entire community, and especially our Jewish community.” Levin, who also leads a research and policy center at California State University, San Bernardino, slammed the Trump administration's moves to cut funding for things like hate crime training for law enforcement and grants related to domestic extremism. “We need to have the federal government be a partner. He said this is a “national security issue” and will require bipartisan support to “renew efforts to protect Jews and Jewish institutions.” Levin's comments came after two Israeli diplomats were killed in Washington, DC, last night. A striking 46% of adults across the globe harbor “deeply entrenched” antisemitic attitudes, according to an annual survey conducted by the ADL, published in January. Levin said one thing that could contribute to these attitudes is “bigoted rhetoric online,” which oftentimes is accompanied by hate crimes. He claimed religious hate crimes specifically have continued to rise. An Israeli official told CNN that one of the victims of last night's shooting, Yaron Lischinsky, identifies as Jewish, adding that he has a Christian mother and Jewish father. He had worked at the embassy for a little over two years. The other victim, Sarah Milgrim, an American from Kansas, had started working there shortly after the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. Milgrim hadn't met Lischinsky's family in Israel yet, and they planned to do that at the same time as getting engaged. While Lischinsky worked in the embassy's political section, Milgrim helped coordinate a variety of groups' travels to Israel, including political, religious and others, like visitors studying climate change. A security team has been sent over from Israel to assess the situation and review protocols, as is standard when embassy personnel are attacked around the world. Both were young American women, and neither one was injured in the shooting. KU Hillel, a Jewish student organization at the University of Kansas, said it is mourning the loss of “beloved” alumna Sarah Milgrim and her boyfriend Yaron Lischinsky “with profound sadness.” Milgrim graduated from the University of Kansas in 2021, according to KU Hillel. “Sarah's bright spirit and passion for the Jewish community touched everyone fortunate enough to know her. Those closest to her describe (her) as ‘the definition of the best person,” KU Hillel said in a statement today. The organization said she served as a member of KU Hillel's Board of Directors and “exemplified the values we hold dear.” “In the face of such hateful violence, we come together as a community to support one another and to honor Sarah's memory,” the statement continued. “May Sarah and Yaron's memories always be a blessing.” “Sarah was only beginning her life's journey, and it is anguishing that her light was taken away because of hate,” the President of American University Jonathan Alger said in a statement. This post has been updated with the statement from American University. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine,” while being arrested in Washington, DC, last night, authorities said. Netanyahu also spoke with US Attorney General Pam Bondi, “who promised that the murderer, and everyone who cooperated with him, would be brought to justice,” the statement said. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine,” while being arrested in Washington, DC, last night, authorities said. Prosor, who currently serves as Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in a post on X that Lischinsky was “a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause.” Prosor called Lischinsky “bright, curious, engaged” and said he “embodied the Judeo-Christian values.” Lischinsky was born in Nuremberg, Germany, Prosor said, adding that Lischinsky was his master's student at Reichman University in Tel Aviv. Prosor said he paid his condolences to Lischinsky's parents this morning. Vice President JD Vance: “My heart breaks for Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, who were murdered last night at the Capital Jewish Museum. Antisemitic violence has no place in the United States. We're praying for their families and all of our friends at the Israeli Embassy, where the two victims worked,” he said in a post on X. US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee: “People here in Israel are devastated,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “I got a call early this morning Jerusalem time from Pam Bondi, the Attorney General. JB Pritzker: “Young Jewish people and diplomats came together in a museum built to honor their shared history but then had to flee gun shots and witness the killing of a young couple. As a Jew who led the building of a museum dedicated to standing up against bigotry and hatred, I know how sacred these places are and what trauma this incident has caused,” he said in a statement. I continue to pray for the victims' loved ones. Rest assured, justice will be served,” he said in a post on X. I proposed to Lori in Jerusalem under the Montefiore Windmill, and we were married 28 years ago this Sunday. Former Vice President Kamala Harris: “Doug and my prayers are with the loved ones of Yaron and Sarah — two young Israeli diplomats murdered in what appears to be a shocking act of antisemitic violence. I stand with the entire Jewish community in condemning this sickening violence. Antisemitism and violence have no place in our country. We all must come together and fight hatred,” Harris said on X. Former second gentleman Doug Emhoff: “The shocking murder of two young Israeli diplomats in DC is horrifying, heartbreaking and completely unacceptable. Jews must be able to gather without fear or violence. Yaron Lischinsky, one of the Israeli embassy staffers killed last night, dreamed of being a diplomat after studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, according to his former professor. Otmazgin, who taught Lischinsky in three different courses related to Japanese studies, said he was “an excellent student” and “very much dedicated.” Otmazgin remembers him getting a perfect score on an honors seminar, a sign of how hard he worked. The professor said Lischinsky truly “became an Israeli” after moving from Germany. “In many ways, I think for me, he symbolizes the hope of Israel,” Otmazgin said. “Young people — idealistic — that are going abroad, studying about different cultures, and trying to do good for their country. “He is the best that Israel can offer,” Otmazgin said. Law enforcement are searching an address in Chicago that appears to be associated with the suspected shooter, CNN has observed. Many law enforcement vehicles were pulling up on the block to allow for others to park in front of the building. Currently, there are approximately twenty law enforcement vehicles on scene. Law enforcement has not confirmed that the address is linked to the suspect but public records show it may be associated with him. “Targeted acts of anti-Semitic violence are typically carried out by spineless, gutless cowards. The German-Israeli Society, an organization in Germany that promotes relations with Israel, said the Israeli embassy staffer who was killed in Washington, DC, was a founding member of its sister organization, and that he “will be greatly missed.” “Yaron Lischinsky was a founding member of the Young Forum of the Israeli-German Society, our sister organization that connects young Israelis and Germans and initiates joint projects,” the German-Israeli Society said in a statement today. “In this role, he organized numerous political and cultural events in cooperation with the Young Forum of the German-Israeli Society and thus made a significant contribution to strengthening German-Israeli relations,” it said. Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told lawmakers in the Bundestag today that Lischinsky held both German and Israeli nationality. The Society described Lischinsky as “an incredibly warm, intelligent, calm and interested person.” He had a passion for photography, and “focused his lens on the special corners and details that others often missed.” New details continue to emerge about a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, that killed two young diplomats last night. CNN's Eugenia Yosef, Michael Schwartz, Nadeen Ebrahim, Catherine Nicholls, Lex Harvey, Diego Mendoza, Jessie Yeung, Teele Rebane, Isaac Yee, Samantha Waldenberg and Elise Hammond contributed reporting to this post. Security at the event ushered us quickly back into a safe location behind the main room, and we were there for a few minutes.” Epstein said he thought it was a “random shooting” in the neighborhood at first. “I had no idea that he was the shooter. I see security right now, they run, grab him and take him outside and he is still yelling and had no idea he was the shooter we got pretty close I was ten feet away from him, I look him in the eyes and then I stepped back,” he said. Shooting victim Yaron Lischinsky, one of the Israeli Embassy staffers killed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night, held a German passport. Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told lawmakers in the German Bundestag on Thursday that Lischinsky was an Israeli diplomat and held German citizenship. The Embassy of Israel to the USA said in an earlier social media post that “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said “our worst fears came true” following the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members at an event the committee hosted on Wednesday night. This was an event we all look forward to every year that brings together AJC's young leaders,“ Deutch said on Thursday. And all of the good feeling was shattered immediately after when these two, when these two beautiful young souls were taken by this murderer.” Deutch said he was very familiar with both of the victims, telling CNN's “This Morning” that “Yaron is an Israeli Jew. She cared deeply for our work in the diplomatic space. It's a tragedy, of the worst magnitude that these beautiful young people were taken from us.” The Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, outside of which two Israeli embassy staff members were killed in a shooting on Wednesday night, expressed condolences and horror at the violence that took place after an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem expressed “deep sorrow” Thursday over the killing of Israeli embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in Washington, DC. “We share in the profound grief of their families and loved ones.” Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau asked regional officials to “tighten security around symbolic sites and to contact representatives of the Jewish community,” according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, citing a comment from the minister's entourage on Thursday morning. Nothing can justify such violence,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. “There is a direct line connecting antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement to this murder,” Sa'ar said at a news conference on Thursday in Jerusalem. Sa'ar went on to say that there is a concern in European countries for security threats against Israeli missions abroad and the Jewish community. The UK paused trade negotiations and sanctioned West Bank settlers, as Britain's foreign minister slammed Israel's operation in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” Meanwhile, the EU announced that it would review its relationship with Israel, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic.” On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada threatened to take “concrete actions,” including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not stop its renewed military offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza. Since May 5, Israel has been conducting a new offensive in Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Monday that his country plans to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip.” IsraAID, an Israel-based non-governmental organization, said the event in Washington, DC, where two Israeli staff members were shot dead was focused on humanitarian aid for Gaza. The event, where IsraAID members were keynote speakers, “focused on bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israeli-Palestinian and regional collaboration,” the NGO said in a statement Thursday. The event had just ended at around 9 p.m. when gunshots rang out, said attendee Sara Marinuzzi, 28. They had been leaving an event when the gunman opened fire, police said. Then, attendees saw a man run into the museum. Several asked if he was injured, and security guards offered him water. He didn't interact much with the other attendees, said 31-year-old attendee Yoni Kalin. “I went up to him and asked if he was okay as he muttered ‘call the police' again and again. It was only when police arrived, around 10 minutes later, that the man said he was responsible for the crime — stunning those around him. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.” Police have since identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, 30, from Chicago, Illinois. As of late Wednesday night, he was being questioned by the FBI and DC police. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said he is “very worried” about more attacks on diplomatic missions around the world following the killing of two embassy staffers in Washington, DC. “I have been worried for the past few months that something like this would happen and it did, and the list of fallen foreign service members has grown today,” Sa'ar said, speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem on Thursday. He also said there have been a number of attacks and attempted attacks on Israeli missions around the world, many of which he says have not been reported. “There is no one week without a terror attacks or attempts (at) terror attacks around the world and usually more than one,” he said in response to a question from CNN. “I told him that his son was a warrior on our diplomatic front that fell just like a soldier on the battlefield,” Sa'ar said. He also said he has been in touch with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Israel's Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has ordered the reinforcement of security at Israel's missions worldwide following the attack. In the early hours of Thursday morning in Washington, DC, investigations are underway into a shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers the night before. They had been leaving an event when the shooting occurred. Then the gunman approached four people and opened fire with a handgun, killing two. The alleged shooter who gunned down two Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” as he was being taken into custody, according to an eyewitness. Eyewitness Yoni Kalin, 31, was at the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday night, attending an event organized by the American Jewish Committee, when shots rang out. Kalin added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event. “At first I didn't recognize them as gunshots,” Kalin told CNN in a phone interview. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.” Kalin added that in the period between when the man walked in and before his arrest, people went up to him to offer him water and to check if he was ok. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn't get us where we need to be.” “We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington — Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a post to X on Thursday. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” “A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has ordered the reinforcement of security at Israel's missions worldwide following the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, DC on Wednesday. “My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said in a statement. Video obtained by CNN from an eyewitness appears to show the suspect in the deadly shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff yelling, “Free, free Palestine,” as he is taken into custody inside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night. She said at a news conference the attack is believed to have been carried out by just one person. The suspect was seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four people and shooting two of them, Smith said. A separate eyewitness, Sara Marinuzzi, told CNN the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once he was inside the museum and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard him say “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.” Israel's ambassador to the United Nations said his country's embassies are on “high alert” following the fatal shooting of two embassy staff members in Washington, DC on Wednesday. “It is a very difficult night for all of us here in the United States,” Danny Danon told CNN's MJ Lee. The two embassy staffers who were killed were a couple who planned to get engaged next week in Jerusalem, Danon said. President Donald Trump expressed his condolences to the victims' families, saying the shooting that killed two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, DC, was “based obviously on antisemitism.” He added: “Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.” Other top US officials also condemned the shooting Wednesday night: “I went up to him and asked if he was okay as he muttered call the police again and again. Obviously I didn't know at the time,” she said. “Here we are, a bunch of Jews lumped in one room for him to pick us off. The terrorist sat on a bench, amongst us,” she said. Jewish people “cannot allow fear to dictate how we're going to live our lives,” the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington said following Wednesday's fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff. “It was a young couple about to get engaged and spend the rest of their lives together,” Ron Halber told CNN's MJ Lee. “And that some depraved individual thought that shooting down two innocent young Jewish people, Israelis in the middle of Washington DC, was somehow going to accomplish an objective 6,000 miles away is just horrible,” Halber said. “We have to live proud, open, Jewish lives, and take necessary security precautions.” “Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” he wrote on X. Israeli officials expressed outrage and offered condolences following a shooting that killed two employees of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC on Wednesday night near the Capital Jewish Museum. The sold-out “Young Diplomats Reception” is described as an event “bringing together Jewish young professionals (22-45) and the diplomatic community,” according to its Eventbrite page. The two Israeli embassy staff members who were shot dead were leaving an event, according to Pamela A. Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department. CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the event would have likely hosted people from many different embassies. “It's sort of a way for young professionals in the foreign policy and foreign service space to get to know each other, so in many ways it was counter to the hate that would be experienced that evening in DC,” Kayyem told CNN's MJ Lee. The man accused of killing a young couple outside the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night “pretended to be a witness” and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming he “did it for Gaza,” eyewitness Sara Marinuzzi told CNN. Marinuzzi, 28, said gunshots rang out shortly after the event ended at 9 p.m. “There were some more shots and then a guy came running into the center, and the security guards offered him water, trying to comfort him. Once police arrived about 10 minutes later, Marinuzzi said the man took accountability for the crime, saying “I did it, I did it for Gaza. Details are emerging about the deadly shooting that killed two people near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night. President Donald Trump, in his first comments on Wednesday night's shooting, sent his condolences to the families of the two Israeli Embassy staff members who were killed near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC. “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a news conference following a shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC, which killed two people, that she spoke with President Donald Trump “multiple times tonight.” “On behalf of the president, his prayers are with all of us, all of the Jewish community, everyone in Washington, DC, state, local and federal agencies, and our great US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who will be prosecuting this case,” Bondi said. Bondi added that federal agencies will “work hand-in-hand” with DC authorities to do “everything we can to keep our citizens safe.” Trump issued his own statement on Truth Social shortly after, sending his condolences to the families of the couple that was killed. “The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of ‘Free Palestine,' was a young couple about to be engaged. A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said that a suspect is in custody in connection with the shooting near Capital Jewish Museum that left two dead. “We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody. Smith said that the suspect, which she named as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, “approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire striking both of our decedents.” Following a shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday that killed two people, Mayor Muriel Bowser reassured the community that “there is no active threat.” “I will say up front that there is no active threat in our community,” Bowser said at a news conference. Bowser went on to share a message of unity, saying “We're going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate antisemitism.” Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with other officials, is giving an update to the shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post on Wednesday that “two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.” We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice,” Noem said. “We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue,” Deutch said in a statement. “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.” Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more. “The fatal shooting that took place outside the event that took place at the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. – in which Israeli embassy employees were also injured – is a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The amendment also strikes language to sell federal lands in Nevada and Utah, changes “MAGA” savings accounts for children to “Trump accounts,” and removes a federal requirement that firearm suppressors must be registered. They had emerged tight-lipped from a meeting at the White House after talks on how to move the bill forward fell apart overnight. The Rules Committee has been debating the bill for nearly 20 hours as Democrats offer up hundreds of amendments on legislation that includes over $1.5 trillion in cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks. Over one hundred Democrats testified in front of the Rules Committee. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), who sits on the Rules Committee, wouldn't say if he would vote for the bill after receiving a deal from the White House, because he wanted to see everything they agreed to set in stone before making a decision. “I'm not going to say, because things move around up here … one word could change this whole thing.” “We're going to get back together once we see it in writing, all of us that you saw in here, do that, and make a call,” Norman added, referring to the caucus members. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), who were also at the White House meeting, were optimistic when they returned to Capitol Hill. They told reporters that they would be moving forward with the legislation and to expect a vote “tonight or tomorrow morning.” A whip notice sent out Wednesday night detailed that the House would proceed with a vote series later in the night or early Thursday morning, though no specific times have been provided. “I think that all of our colleagues here will really like this final product, and I think we move forward,” Johnson said. Freedom Caucus members declined to share any changes they agreed to or whether they'd vote for the bill when exiting a meeting with Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) Wednesday evening. Several of his colleagues left the Freedom Caucus meeting without providing details. Reps. Eli Crane (R-AZ) and Keith Self (R-TX) said “no comment” when asked if they'd vote yes on the bill. Rep. Josh Brecheen (R-OK), who was one of four GOP lawmakers who held up the vote in the Budget Committee, quipped, “All you'll get from me is a long pause.” He wouldn't answer any questions from reporters related to his vote or the details of the White House deal. While Freedom Caucus members were huddling, centrist GOP lawmakers met in the speaker's office to chat with Johnson. Main Street Caucus Chairman Dusty Johnson (R-SD) echoed the speaker, promising a “modest number of tweaks.” The speaker has every expectation that we will get there.”</p>
