                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio on Thursday sounded another alarm on soaring U.S. debt and deficits, saying it should make investors fearful of the government bond market. "I think we should be afraid of the bond market," Dalio said at an event for the Paley Media Council in New York. I would say that if we're really looking over the next three years, to give or take a year or two, that we're in that type of a critical, critical situation." Recently, investors have begun demanding lower prices to buy the bonds that cover the government's massive budget deficits, pushing up yields on the debt. Rising worries about the fiscal situation last week triggered a high-profile credit rating downgrade from Moody's. The yield on the 30-year Treasury yield on Thursday traded at levels not seen since 2023, around 5.14%. Rising financing costs along with continued spending growth and declining tax receipts have combined to send deficits spiraling, pushing the national debt past the $36 trillion mark. In 2024, the government spent more on interest payments than any other outlay other than Social Security, defense and health care. "We will have a deficit of about 6.5% of GDP — that that is more than the market can bear," Dalio said. Dalio said he's not hopeful politicians would be able to reconcile their differences and lessen the country's debt load. In a party-line vote early Thursday, House members approved legislation that lowers taxes and adds military spending. The bill — which now goes to the Senate — could increase the U.S. government's debt by trillions and widen the deficit at a time when fears of a flare-up in inflation due higher tariffs are already weighing on bond prices and boosting yields. I have to be realistic," Dalio said. "I think it's the essence of the challenge of our country that anything related to bipartisanship and getting over political hurdles ... essentially means 'give me more,' which leads to these deficits."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After selling online pharmacy PillPack to Amazon seven years ago, the founding team is launching a new company that aims to make the experience of getting medical care "as easy as shopping online." PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen on Thursday launched a new venture called General Medicine. Parker and Cohen are joined by Ashwin Muralidharan, who most recently served as the technical adviser, or "shadow," to Amazon's top health executive Neil Lindsay. General Medicine is an online health-care marketplace, where users can get connected with a provider based on specific medical needs or chat with someone about their symptoms. The platform can be used for a range of health needs, such as securing prescriptions or locating a specialist. Users can pay with cash or insurance, with most major providers accepted, the company said. General Medicine relies on a mix of its own medical groups, networks of specialists and local providers, clinics and labs to provide care. General Medicine was founded in 2023, and began serving patients earlier this year before launching broadly this month. The company says it hopes to address "the terrible experience of American healthcare and create access to excellent care." It's a similar goal held by Amazon, which has sought to disrupt health-care in the U.S. over the past several years by applying its "customer obsessed" mentality and rapid delivery capabilities. It's had mixed success, sunsetting some offerings like a telehealth service and a fitness wearable. It also acquired primary care provider One Medical in 2022 for $3.9 billion, giving it both an online and brick-and-mortar health-care presence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration blocked Harvard University on Thursday from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students. The Department of Homeland Security said it revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification because the private school's leadership "has created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students, and otherwise obstruct its once-venerable learning environment." "Many of these agitators are foreign students," DHS said. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who ordered the revocation, said, "Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country." "We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University – and this nation – immeasurably," the university said in a statement "We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community," the statement said. DHS said that in addition to barring enrollment of future international students, "existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status." As of the fall 2023 semester, International students comprised more than 27% of Harvard's total enrollment, according to university data. As Noem's order became public, a federal judge in Oakland, California, issued an injunction against President Donald Trump and Noem barring them from terminating the legal status of international students pending the outcome of a lawsuit challenging the termination of the legal status of several such students. The injunction could block the Trump administration from acting on its threat against international students currently enrolled at Harvard. She warned the university at that time that its certification to enroll foreign students was contingent upon complying with federal immigration laws. In a statement on Thursday, Noem said, "This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus." "It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing," Noem said. "They have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law." The Trump administration in April froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, hours after the university roundly rejected demands that it eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and evaluate international students for ideological concerns.

The AI Race:

Anthropic is set to roll out two new versions of its Claude artificial intelligence software, including a long-delayed update to its high-end Opus model, as the startup vies to stay ahead of a crowded market.

The company on Thursday plans to unveil Sonnet 4 and Opus 4, the latter of which is billed as Anthropic's most powerful AI system yet. Both models are designed to better follow directions and operate more autonomously when fielding tasks such as writing code and answering complicated questions.</p>

Google's Antitrust Crisis:

The Google campus in Mountain View, California.

The Justice Department is probing whether Alphabet Inc.'s Google violated antitrust law with an agreement to use the artificial intelligence technology of a popular chatbot maker, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 

Antitrust enforcers have recently told Google they're examining whether it structured an agreement with the company known as Character.AI to avoid formal government merger scrutiny, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential probe. In a deal with Google last year, the founders of the chatbot maker joined the search firm, which also got a non-exclusive license to use their venture's technology. </p>

Canada's Election:

Mark Carney, Canada's prime minister, shakes hands with Francois-Philippe Champagne, his finance minister, after a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on May 13.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will begin to use artificial intelligence “at scale” to make the government more productive, as his administration looks for ways to squeeze out cost savings in a time of economic pressure. 

Carney released a letter spelling out seven major priorities for his new cabinet, one of which is “spending less on government operations” to free up money for other priorities. The prime minister promised during the recent election campaign to rebuild Canada's military and use the financial backing of the government to accelerate home construction, among other spending ideas. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BYD just scored a major win against Tesla in one of its biggest markets. The Chinese electric vehicle giant outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as Elon Musk's automaker saw its sales collapse amid furious backlash over its CEO's politics. It's a major milestone for the Chinese brand, and suggests BYD has taken advantage of Tesla's alarming decline in Europe. ƒNew Tesla registrations dropped nearly 50% in April compared to the same month last year, while BYD sales surged 169% over the same period, per JATO Dynamics data. BYD outsold Tesla without even taking hybrid sales into account. The Chinese carmaker sold 12,525 vehicles last month, meaning its total sales comfortably outstripped Tesla, which only sells battery-powered EVs. Tesla has taken a battering this year in Europe, its third-largest market after the US and China. The automaker's European sales were down 30% in the first three months of 2025, according to JATO Dynamics, despite EV sales rising overall. The automaker has faced a wave of backlash over CEO Musk's role in the Trump administration and endorsement of German far-right party AfD. In an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Musk denied Tesla was facing a sales slump. That was despite Tesla reporting its weakest quarter for deliveries since 2022 last month as it retooled factories for the launch of its updated Model Y. The compact hatchback will go on sale in 15 European markets in June, with prices starting at 23,000 euros ($26,000) — about $19,000 less than Tesla's cheapest model. Having challenged Tesla in China, BYD is eyeing aggressive expansion overseas. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new North Korean naval destroyer was badly damaged during a botched shipyard launch that caused part of its hull to be "crushed," Pyongyang state media reported. Blaming "inexperienced command and operational carelessness," KCNA wrote that the stern of the 5,000-ton ship started sliding down a ramp too early and that a flatcar meant to support its weight didn't move with the vessel. According to KCNA, Kim blasted the disastrous launch, saying it was "out of the bounds of possibility and could not be tolerated." It reported that Kim censured the officials responsible for the ship and its launch, including the country's munitions department and ship designers, and said their mistakes would be "dealt with" at a party meeting next month. The failed launch is a blow to Kim's military agenda, given his emphasis over the past two years on building up North Korea's maritime forces. "A new historic time is coming before our naval forces," Kim said during a 2023 speech, declaring North Korea would focus on capabilities for projecting naval power beyond its own waters. The same year, Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile submarine, the Hero Kim Kun Ok, which is a redesigned Soviet model equipped to fire cruise missiles. Last month, North Korea launched the largest warship it had ever built, a 5,000-ton "multipurpose" destroyer, which it said was a new class of armed vessel. State media didn't provide further details about the damaged ship at Chongjin. In March, North Korea said it was also building its first nuclear-powered submarine.
