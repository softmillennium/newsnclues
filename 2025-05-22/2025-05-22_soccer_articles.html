                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March, after dropping two home games in the Concacaf Nations League to Panama and Canada, the assessment of the U.S. men's national team was that things couldn't get much worse. There would be extended time for manager Mauricio Pochettino to get to know his players better and come up with some tactical wrinkles to maximize the team's potential at next year's FIFA World Cup. Two months later, it's not only worse, but Pochettino is looking at something close to a worst-case scenario, at least in terms of the team's preparations. On Thursday, Pochettino announced his 27-player roster for next month's friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, and the list of absences was staggering. AC Milan's Christian Pulisic is out, citing fatigue and nagging injuries from a long club season. The same is true for Fulham defender Antonee Robinson, who according to Pochettino has been unable to train on a consistent basis. Yunus Musah, Pulisic's teammate in Milan, asked to be omitted from the roster due to an undisclosed personal reason. U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker later put out a statement explaining the decision to allow Pulisic to skip the Gold Cup. It could get even worse if Johnny Cardoso completes his move to Atlético Madrid, and is also diverted to the Club World Cup. Sources told ESPN that the 23-year-old Real Betis midfielder is Diego Simeone's side's top target this summer. Pochettino insisted he was making his judgements on a case-by-case basis. Also left off the roster were players like Norwich City's Josh Sargent, and Lyon's Tanner Tessmann, although the manager said those were for "footballing reasons." Pulisic is poised to log more than 3,500 minutes for the second consecutive season. The clubs pay their salaries, so it's clear what everyone's priorities are. There is an emotional component to this that doesn't wear well, though. Every week, fans have been watching Pulisic and Robinson tee things up for their clubs. The fact that they are choosing to take a break at this moment, with the USMNT clearly at a low ebb, grates. This current generation is already being called out by former USMNTers for not being devoted enough to the cause. Pochettino thinks that perception can be changed. "I think that our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game match the aggressivity of the opponent, and that is what we want to show in these two friendly games and also in the World Cup," Pochettino said. "I think if the fans start to see that energy and to translate this type of energy, I think the fans, they're going to be positive with us." The circumstances have left Pochettino wearing a set of handcuffs embossed with the logos of FIFA and European clubs. It doesn't matter that confederation championships like the Gold Cup require clubs to release players. Pochettino also indicated that if a player isn't fully fit, then he doesn't want them around. "If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" If we want be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day." After this summer, there will be four FIFA international match windows left, not including the period just prior to the World Cup. Those windows are far from ideal in terms of building a cohesive unit. The players arrive, have one or two training sessions, and then play a game; that's followed by rest and recovery and maybe one more training session before a second game. That's why this Gold Cup was so important. A month spent with the team's core players will have allowed for more understanding of Pochettino's approach. Pochettino also said that there was "too much importance" placed on the team being together. It's a situation that looks increasingly akin to the U.S. being asked to cram for its final exam when it meets for a pre-World Cup camp in a year's time. About the only silver lining -- and it's a small one -- is that Pochettino now has the chance to give some fringe players an opportunity for playing time in matches with higher stakes than during the January camp. Diego Luna figures to be a huge beneficiary of the absences of players like Pulisic and Reyna. On a team that has looked complacent at times, new players stepping up can only help. It's the only approach he can take at this point, but it's one that is still setting off alarm bells.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has warned FIFA that he suspects “players and managers” do not want to be at FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup this summer, reiterating his concerns that players are at risk of burning out. Carragher was speaking on a media call organised by the U.S. broadcaster CBS Sports to promote their upcoming coverage of the UEFA Champions League final between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Carragher said: “I've got no time for it at all, to be honest. I don't think football can ever stand still. Different things have to happen and you have to keep the interest of players, coaches and people around the world. “It's a bit like FIFA think, ‘Well, we've only got the World Cup every four years and UEFA or Europe have this Champions League. There's this unbelievable money and financial aspect to it and they have it every year but we've got to wait every four years for the World Cup.' They've just tried to create something and I don't think there's any appetite really from players, clubs and even supporters. I can't envisage in the summer me stopping my holiday or going in from the (swimming) pool to go and watch a game. Now I might be wrong and in 20 years time this may become that. So we're talking now about players who will only get a rest one summer every four years. But if you've got a tournament that the players don't really want to play in and the coaches don't want to be there, I think you've a bit of a problem. The European football season ends on May 31 with the UEFA Champions League final but players go straight into international matches and World Cup qualifiers, with the latest fixtures on June 10. The Club World Cup then starts on June 14, while some teams are likely to organise preparatory exhibition games ahead of the competition. In 2024, two of Europe's largest players unions, the English PFA and its French counterparts, the Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels, teamed up to launch a case against FIFA. They argued the rights of its members were being violated under European Union (EU) laws. FIFA last week unveiled an in-house video at their annual congress in Paraguay where star names featuring in the Club World Cup such as Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola, Bayern Munich forward Harry Kane and Inter Miami icon Lionel Messi appeared to promote the tournament. However, Kane has also previously told reporters he does not believe players are being listened to when it comes to player welfare, while Guardiola has previously implied his players may have a more relaxing schedule than normal and joked that the golf courses are “really nice” in America. FIFA have previously said that the calendar was “unanimously approved” by the FIFA Council which includes representatives from all continents and after consultation that included FIFPro. Only two clubs will play the maximum seven games every four years. A FIFA spokesperson said: “The FIFA Club World Cup will usher in a new era for club football worldwide. It will be the greatest, most inclusive and merit-based global club competition in history, bringing together the most successful club sides from every continent to decide the true world champion at club level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If the U.S. men's national team is to win its first Concacaf Gold Cup since 2021 this summer, it will do so severely shorthanded. Coach Mauricio Pochettino on Thursday named a 27-player USMNT training camp roster ahead of the biennial regional championship and the two early June friendlies that precede it. And as expected, many of the American regulars are missing. FOX Sports reported on Wednesday that star attacker Christian Pulisic would skip this summer's tournament following two grueling seasons with Italian club A.C. Milan. Several other prominent names are absent; 2024 U.S. Soccer Male Athlete of the Year Antonee "Jedi" Robinson is still dealing with the minor injuries that prevented him from participating in the Concacaf Nations League final four in March. Yunus Musah was supposed to be with their USMNT next month;  Pochettino said he withdrew from consideration earlier this week for personal reasons. Joe Scally, Josh Sargent and Tanner Tessmann, who all started the Nations League semifinal loss to Panama, were also left off the squad, which will be trimmed to 26 on June 4, when the final list must be submitted to Concacaf. Understandably, Pochettino is focusing on not who's missing but the players that are available, a group led by 2022 World Cup veterans Brenden Aaronson, Sergino Dest, Matt Turner and Haji Wright, and Premier League center back Chris Richards. Now recovered from an ACL tear he suffered last spring, Dest is participating in his first camp under the Argentine manager. So is striker Folarin Balogun, who missed much of Monaco's season following shoulder surgery. "It's so exciting to see different players," Pochettino said. Some of Pochettino's selections – and omissions - were still surprising. Five players have never been capped at senior level: Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder and the son of former USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter; Orlando City fullback Alex Freeman; Matt Freese, New York City FC goalkeeper; Philadelphia Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan; and German-born forward Damion Downs, who helped Cologne earn promotion to the Bundesliga this season by scoring 10 goals in 29 games. Freeman is the son of former NFL star Antonio Freeman, a Super Bowl champion and Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer. Aaronson returns after being left off the March squad. Pochettino cited Aaronson's "energy, positivity, enthusiasm and passion," when asked why he'd been recalled. The full training camp roster is as follows: Forwards: Patrick Agyemang, Charlotte (MLS); Folarin Balogun, Monaco (France); Damion Downs, Cologne (Germany); Brian White, Vancouver; Haji Wright, Coventry (England) Doug McIntyre is a soccer reporter for FOX Sports who has covered United States men's and women's national teams at FIFA World Cups on five continents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich keeper-in-waiting Jonas Urbig could be getting his next chance to start at the summer's Club World Cup competition in the United States. As captured by Sky Sport DE journalist Florian Plettenberg: It's the clear and agreed plan: Jonas Urbig is set to feature at the Club World Cup in the USA with FC Bayern! The captain fought his way back into the starting lineup after returning from injury for the final Bundesliga games of the season, but the summer will be a good opportunity for him to rest — and for Urbig to get a jump start on competitive integration with the team. The 21-year-old has impressed as a shot stopper in his cameo stretch for Neuer this season, but teammates have not looked as comfortable yet relying on him in distribution. Of course with Neuer, that is a high bar...but Urbig can take some strides in June. Looking for more thoughts on the latest Bayern Munich news?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel names his England squad on Friday for World Cup qualifier with Andorra on June 7 and Senegal friendly on June 10; Club World Cup begins four days later; Arsenal's Ben White available again but Phil Foden has requested to be rested after difficult season However, players at Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich will also be involved in the relaunched Club World Cup, which kicks off in the USA on June 14. Captain Harry Kane, Chelsea star Cole Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham are among the England first-team players who could find themselves with a busy period ahead, while it is understood Real Madrid are also looking into a deal with Liverpool to allow Trent Alexander-Arnold to link up with them in time for the Club World Cup. Find out who makes Thomas Tuchel's England squad - and who misses out - from 10am on Friday on the Sky Sports website, App and Sky Sports News. Chelsea's players will also be involved in the Conference League final on Wednesday May 28, while Manchester United players will be going on a two-game post-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong immediately after the end of the Premier League season. Tuchel intends to have a week-long training camp with his players in Spain ahead of the qualifier with Andorra and sees this as a crucial opportunity to implement his tactical ideas, having highlighted how important each international window is for him ahead of the World Cup next year, when England will be targeting victory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But Tuchel did say in March that he would prioritise England objectives during international windows. White has not been involved with an England squad since leaving the 2022 World Cup camp during Gareth Southgate's reign. White missed much of this season following knee surgery but is back in action now. Among other attacking options, Marcus Rashford - who started both of Tuchel's first games in charge - was ruled out of the rest of Aston Villa's season, where he's on loan from Manchester United, but is working on returning to fitness after a hamstring injury. His Villa team-mate Ollie Watkins should get the call, though. Watkins agreed with Tuchel to rest a minor knee issue in March, but is finishing the season strongly and will be aiming to push Bundesliga winner Kane for a starting role. Key man Bukayo Saka will definitely be back in the mix after returning to fitness at Arsenal. Morgan Gibbs-White was belatedly added to Tuchel's squad in March when it became clear Palmer would not recover from injury in time to join up with the squad and will hope to get another reward for his good performances for Forest. Crystal Palace's FA Cup winner Eberechi Eze also looks sure of a spot given his brilliant form. He has scored nine goals and recorded three assists in 12 games for Palace since netting his first international goal against Latvia. It was a similar story with Kyle Walker, on loan at AC Milan from Man City, but he has since struggled with form and fitness in Italy. Centre-back stalwart Harry Maguire should return though, having shaken off injury problems which saw him miss out against Albania and Latvia and reclaim a starting spot for Man Utd. Marc Guehi's head injury, sustained in the FA Cup final, could keep him out and open up a centre-back spot. Eighteen-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly is a certainty to be included again after he became the youngest-scoring debutant for England against Albania, although Luke Shaw's return to fitness for Man Utd will add competition in a previously light left-back area. Dan Burn, Morgan Rogers and Dominic Solanke are set to be included again, with the latter hoping to show Tuchel what he can do on the back of Tottenham's Europa League success, having not played a minute during the previous camp. Lee Carsley's age-group side are out to defend their U21 Euros title when the tournament begins on June 11, so there will need to be a decision made on whether the likes of Wharton, Rico Lewis, Jarrad Branthwaite (who is nursing an injury of his own) and Taylor Harwood-Bellis get the chance to add to their senior caps or focus on the U21 tournament. Liam Delap, Ethan Nwaneri, Harvey Elliott, James McAtee and Archie Gray could also be used by Carsley rather than Tuchel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer today announced that Columbus Crew goalkeeper Patrick Schulte and midfielders Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki were selected by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino for the squad's June training camp in Chicago, Ill. ahead of two friendlies against Türkiye (at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, East Hartford, Conn. on June 7) and Switzerland (at Geodis Park, Nashville, Tenn. on June 10). The deadline for final rosters for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is Wednesday, June 4. The USMNT will play its Group D matches against Trinidad and Tobago (at PayPal Park, San Jose, Calif. on June 15), Saudi Arabia (at Q2 Stadium, Austin, Texas on June 19) and Haiti (at AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas on June 22). Arfsten has made three appearances (two starts) for the USMNT and earned his first cap on Jan. 18, playing 65 minutes in a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. In 2025, Arfsten has started 13 MLS matches for the Crew, recording six goal contributions (three goals, three assists), including the game-winning goal against the San Jose Earthquakes on April 26. Owning three caps with the USMNT, Schulte made his senior debut against Slovenia on Jan. 20, 2024, when he played 90 minutes and registered three saves. He recorded his first win for the U.S. on Jan. 18 during a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. This season, Schulte has started 13 MLS fixtures, notched two clean sheets and tallied 32 saves. The goalkeeper ranks second all-time for the Club in regular season wins by a goalkeeper with 39 in his 71 appearances. Zawadzki previously took part in the USMNT's 2024 January Camp, recording his first start against Slovenia on Jan. 20. Coverage of the USA's match against Türkiye begins at 3:30 p.m. The USMNT's match against Switzerland  will kick off at 8 p.m. Live Spanish-language audio for the matches will be available on Fútbol de Primera radio.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland. “As we continue preparations for the World Cup, this is a fantastic opportunity to work with this group of players for an extended period and it's important we take advantage of every moment we have together,” Pochettino said. These players have earned the chance to compete for our fans and to show their quality and mentality.” Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. [TICKETS]Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca-Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary on USMNT matches for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. DEFENDERS (8): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 33/2), Alex Freeman (Orlando City; 0/0), DeJuan Jones (San Jose Earthquakes; 10/0), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/FRA; 19/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 68/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 24/1), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 32/3), MIDFIELDERS (10): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/ENG; 47/8); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 44/2), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 0/0), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 18/0), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC; 24/1), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 4/0), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; 4/1), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union; 0/0); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 17/0), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew; 1/0) Chris Richards and Matt Turner joined former USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard as the only U.S. internationals to win the prestigious FA Cup in England. Malik Tillman and Sergiño Dest are Dutch league champions once again with PSV Eindhoven, the club having a remarkable late season surge capped off by a victory on the final matchday to capture their second straight title. With eight goals in 10 matches, Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White is tied for third in the MLS Golden Boot race, while Diego Luna sits one behind with seven goals in 13 appearances this season. Veteran attacker Brenden Aaronson pocketed nine goals and two assists in 46 matches, while first-time call-up Damion Downs tallied 10 goals in 29 matches. Striker Haji Wright collected 12 goals and one assist in 29 matches as Coventry City fell just short of Premier League promotion. Meanwhile, first-time call-up Quinn Sullivan's seven assists in 14 matches for the Philadelphia Union leave him tied for second league wide. Several familiar faces make their return to the USMNT. Following an injury, forward Folarin Balogun is back for the first time since September 2024. The roster features five exciting young prospects, including first-time call-ups in defenders Alex Freeman and Quinn Sullivan, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and forward Damion Downs. Sebastian Berhalter has been one of the MVP performers for Vancouver Whitecaps in leading them to the Concacaf Champions Cup final, which included back-to-back victories against Inter Miami in the semifinal. Downs, a dual national of Germany and the United States, grew up playing football in Texas before moving to Germany. Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS Next Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season,” U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said.</p>

The 33-year-old former Espanyol winger hopes to bring a cutting edge to Branko Ivankovic's squad, who need to win their next two matches

Wu Lei looks set to make his first appearance for China in more than eight months after being included in Branko Ivankovic's 27-man squad for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Indonesia and Bahrain on Thursday.

The 33-year-old former Espanyol winger, who has scored 36 goals in 99 appearances for his country, last played an international against Saudi Arabia last September before being sidelined by a knee injury.

He returned to action for Shanghai Port last month and Ivankovic will hope he can bring a much-needed cutting edge to China's forward line, which has failed to find the net in either of their past two qualifiers.

Uncapped midfielder Yang Mingyang was also included in the squad after the former Swiss youth international had his request to change international allegiance approved by Fifa on Monday.

China are bottom of Group C and cannot now earn direct passage to the 2026 World Cup finals from the third stage of Asian qualifying.

They could, however, still get through to a fourth stage if they can leapfrog Bahrain, who are above them on goal difference, and Indonesia, who stand three points ahead, after the final round of qualifiers.</p>

Real did not provide a timeline for the player's return, but Spanish media reported the Brazil international could be sidelined for at least two months, forcing him out of the Club World Cup in the United States.

"Following tests carried out today on our player Endrick by Real Madrid's medical services, he has been diagnosed with an injury to the hamstring tendon in his right leg. He will be monitored closely," Real said in a statement.

The 18-year-old will also miss Brazil's upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay.

Endrick adds to Real's growing injury list, which already includes Vinicius Junior, Lucas Vazquez, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Eduardo Camavinga, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy and David Alaba.

Real host Real Sociedad in their final LaLiga game of the season on Saturday before kicking off their Club World Cup campaign against Al Hilal next month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer's governing body announced in March the tournament will have a record $1 billion prize pot. FIFA included a tiered system for how the money would be distributed — with the Sounders, Inter Miami CF and possibly Los Angeles FC, if they win a play-in match against Club América, receiving a $9.55 million payday for participating as part of the CONCACAF clubs. But MLS, according to the Players Association, isn't reflecting that mission. Under the league's current collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in 2021, the CWC falls under a clause for “performance and/or participation in a compulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament.” That stipulates a collective $1 million cap for players, which in the case of the initial CWC earnings would be an approximate 90-10 split. “There's no incentive for us to play, really, if you're talking about 90-10 for performance bonuses,” Sounders keeper Stefan Frei said Wednesday. “I don't think that's what FIFA had intended. We're not arguing about more money coming in for bonuses at all, just divvied up accordingly.” The league didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Union leadership for the clubs held virtual meetings the past month to educate their teammates and strategize. Midfielder Cristian Roldan, defender Jackson Ragen and keeper Andrew Thomas are representing the Sounders. MLS has revisited CBA issues in the past and may seek the MLSPA's approval for a change in their competition schedule. Teams that advance out of the group stage receive another $7.5 million. Seattle opens play against reigning Copa Libertadores champion Botafogo on June 15 at Lumen Field. PSG is playing Italy's Inter Milan for its first UEFA Champions League title on May 31. Botafogo will receive a $15.21 million participation payout. Atlético and PSG are part of 12 European clubs that will be paid between $12.81 to $38.19 million based on sporting and commercial rankings, according to FIFA. “We are engaging more than they (MLS) are and that's a bit frustrating because we want to resolve it together. There are no terms on the actual Club World Cup, so we want to create those terms.” Ragen was part of training Wednesday and remains on track to be available to play Saturday when the Sounders (5-4-5) host FC Dallas (4-5-4) at Lumen. “I've got a smile on my face because he looked sharp,” Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer said of the session. “But he's got to pass some tests, so we'll see.” “He put in heavy minutes, and he worked his butt off against LAFC,” Schmetzer said of the 4-0 road loss last week. Xfinity announced Wednesday it will carry MLS's “Sunday Night Soccer” beginning this weekend with a matchup between Atlanta and FC Cincinnati. Customers can also say “MLS” into their voice remote to start watching.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County. “With this big event coming to the city, it has a chance to put Kansas City on a map worldwide — not only for all sports, but also for our business community,” Joe Burger, the executive director of the Kansas State Youth Soccer Association, said. Burger served as the emcee for an Olathe Chamber of Commerce Business Luncheon focused on World Cup readiness Wednesday at the Ball Events Center in south Olathe. Dozens of Olathe business owners heard a panel discussion with two KC2026 representatives, Director of Regional Impact Tracy Whelpley and Director of Volunteer Operations Lori Thomas, and Johnson County Transit Director Josh Powers about how to get ready for the region to welcome a 650,000 visitors who will spend $650 million, according to VisitKC projections. “Then, if we have base camps, we have teams and their fans and support systems that will be coming to the region potentially as early as two weeks before that. ... We're talking about six different major events that are almost on the scale of a Super Bowl.” That's why Whelpley is touring the region, meeting with business groups to ensure Kansas City's entrepreneurs are ready to meet the moment. More than 1,400 regional businesses already have filled out the KC2026 Business Interest form, an online tool that will help keep businesses in the loop about World Cup-connected business opportunities. “We've talked to a lot of organizations — ESOs (entrepreneur-support organizations), chambers — that regularly work with small businesses to advise us on how we should be counseling them,” Whelpley said. What we need are those World Cup-specific information and trainings that help them contextualize this opportunity, that help them understand more about the people that will be coming to visit here, and how to best serve and welcome them. Part of KC2026's mission is to make sure the entire region — especially restaurants, hotels, attractions and retail shops — benefits from the World Cup. That didn't happen with the 2023 NFL Draft, which proved to be a fairly insular event. “I think what's coming is on a world scale we haven't seen yet,” Burger said. Visitors will arrive earlier, stay longer and spend more time in the local communities. “You mentioned the NFL Draft, and it's something that we're very aware of — that there was a level of disappointment amongst some business owners,” Whelpley said.</p>
