Leclerc will be hoping to stand on the podium in front of his home crowd again Williams continue to impress this season as Alex Albon was fighting for a podium spot for the majority of the Emilia-Romagna race before finishing fifth, his third top-six finish in seven races. Kimi Antonelli ended his home race in heartbreak as his Mercedes suffered reliability issues forcing him to retire - only the second race in 2025 where the Italian has missed out on a top-six return.
