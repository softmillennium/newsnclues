            An Indian passenger jet that encountered a hailstorm mid-flight and left passengers terrified, made a safe landing, despite significant damage to the plane.
    


            The IndiGo plane was traveling from Indian capital New Delhi to Srinagar, the largest city in India-administered Kashmir on Wednesday – a flight that typically takes about an hour and a half – when it was met with “a sudden hailstorm en route,” according to a statement from IndiGo.
    


            “The flight and cabin crew followed established protocol, and the aircraft landed safely in Srinagar,” it said.
    


            The statement did not specify what damage the plane encountered but photographs of the aircraft show a large hole in the nose.
    


            Delhi experienced widespread rain, lightning, and thunderstorms Wednesday night.
    


            Video taken by a passenger, Sheikh Samiullah, and posted to X shows widespread panic and fear the moment the plane encountered the hail, causing severe turbulence that rattled the inside of the aircraft.
    


            People can be heard screaming and children can be heard crying as the plane shakes violently.
    


            The flight was going smoothly and passengers assumed they would arrive in Srinagar within 30 minutes when the pilot made a fasten seatbelt announcement, Samiullah told the Press Trust of India news agency.
    


            “There was so much turbulence that I thought it was my last flight. Everyone thought we would crash. It was such a traumatic experience,” he said.
    


            “I am a frequent flier, but I've never experienced anything like this. We are very thankful to the pilot for landing safely.”

            Samiullah described his shock at seeing the plane's condition when he got off.
    


            “After we deboarded and saw the plane's damage, it was even more traumatic,” he said. “I wish no one goes through an experience like this.”
    


            Incidents like these are not uncommon, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general of the US Department of Transportation.
    


            Hail can cause significant damage to planes, including breaching the nose and damaging the windshield, but despite this, many planes have been able to land safely, she said.
    


            Sometimes bad weather doesn't show up on the radar “and you're in the hail before you know it,” Shiavo said.
    


            “There have been other planes where the hail has beaten the nose in or beaten pieces of the nose off. And while (the plane) can lose equipment, the important thing is they still have the control.”
    


            Shiavo described how the pilot would have had to manually fly the plane in a “stressful” situation.
    


            “The performance of the plane will be impacted (by the hail). They have to make sure they keep it under control,” she said. “And of course, they have to worry if more can go wrong other than losing the nose… It'll be a very stressful event but it's amazing the planes… can make it through that.”
    


            Incidents of severe turbulence have made headlines in the past, including one from Singapore Airlines last year, when a passenger died and more than 70 were injured.

Editor's Note: Find the latest coverage of the Capital Jewish Museum shooting here.



            Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, Wednesday night, authorities said.
    


            The slain staffers, who the Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs named as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were a couple who officials say were soon to be engaged.
    


            The two were attending an event for young professionals at the Capital Jewish Museum hosted by the American Jewish Committee. At around 9 p.m. outside the museum, they were approached by a gunman who opened fire and killed them, officials said.
    


            The suspect, whom DC police identified as 30-year-old Chicago native Elias Rodriguez, pretended to be a bystander after the shooting, an eyewitness told CNN.
    


            When police arrived, the man turned himself in and shouted “Free, Free Palestine” while being handcuffed. He is currently in custody, according to authorities. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the man “implied that he committed the offense.”
    


            The shooting, which took place in the heart of the Hill, has shaken the Jewish community at a time of heightened global tensions, as US-led attempts to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas remain unsuccessful and fighting in Gaza continues.
    


            Tensions are also high across US college campuses where hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested amid polarized debates over the right to protest Israel's military actions and accusations of antisemitism.

2 Israeli Embassy staff members killed outside Jewish museum in Washington, DC



            “We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters late Wednesday.
    


            “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA,” President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims.
    


            Rodriguez is being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X.
    


            “Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” Bongino said.
    


            Ted Deutch, the CEO of the AJC, described the shooting “an unspeaking act of violence.”
    


            “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families,” he said.
    


            Police Chief Smith said Rodriguez was allegedly seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four and shooting two of them with a handgun.
    


            The 30-year-old later retreated inside the museum, where he was eventually detained, according to Smith.
    


            According to Sara Marinuzzi, an eyewitness who spoke with CNN, the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once inside the building and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming responsibility for the attack.
    


            Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard Rodriguez say, “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.”
    


            Rodriguez, who was taken into custody on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” according to eyewitness Yoni Kalin.
    


            Kalin was at the museum attending the same event organized by the AJC when he heard shots rang out. “At first I didn't recognize them as gunshots,” he told CNN over the phone.
    


            Moments later, a man entered the museum appearing to be a witness, according to Kalin. He recalled the man sitting in the museum but not interacting with many people present at the event. Ten minutes later, when police entered the building, the man appeared to confess to shooting, telling officers, “I did this, I did this for Palestine,” according to Kalin.
    


            “It's horrible,” Kalin said. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.”
    


            Kalin added that between the shooting and the arrest, Rodriguez appeared shaken up. People approached the suspect to offer him water and check if he was okay, he said.
    


            Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, which was organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza. He added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event.
    


            “I'm still in shock,” Kalin told CNN. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn't get us where we need to be” he added.
    


            When officers arrived on the scene minutes after the shooting, they found “one adult male and one adult female unconscious and not breathing,” Smith told reporters late Wednesday. “Both victims succumbed to their injuries,” she said.
    


            “We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington,” the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a post on X in the early hours of Thursday.
    


            “We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read.
    


            “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also said in a social media post Thursday. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” Leiter earlier shared with reporters that the couple was about to be engaged.
    


            “A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” he said.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, expressed his condolences to the families of the young couple.
    


            “My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said.

Beijing has accused the European Union and its allies of “double standards,” following the latest wave of sanctions targeting Russia and Chinese companies allegedly linked to Moscow's military supply chains.

The EU's 17th sanctions package against Russia, adopted on Tuesday, targets what the bloc claims is the country's shadow fleet used for transporting crude oil. Several Chinese firms accused of supplying Moscow with drone parts and microelectronics were also included in the measures. The UK coordinated with Brussels, adding 18 vessels to its own blacklist.

Responding to the measures, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday rejected the accusations and warned against disrupting the normal trade exchanges between the two countries.

“Those in Europe need to stop using double standards on trade and economic cooperation with Russia,” Mao said. “Most countries, including those in Europe and the US, continue to trade” with Moscow, she added.

The spokeswoman emphasized that China strictly regulates exports of dual-use goods and insisted that Beijing has not supplied any lethal weapons to parties involved in the Ukraine conflict.

The new sanctions were announced shortly after a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, in which Trump reportedly warned that further sanctions might complicate efforts to reach a peaceful settlement in the Ukraine conflict.

Delegations from Russia and Ukraine met last week for the first time since 2022 – when Kiev halted negotiations in favor of a military strategy reportedly encouraged by then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

On the same day the EU adopted its new sanctions, Beijing expressed support for the resumption of direct talks between Moscow and Kiev. China also vowed to continue supporting efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully.

North Korean state media reported a “serious accident” during the attempted launch of a 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday.

The country's leader, Kim Jong-un, attended the side-launch ceremony at the Chongjin Shipyard. He observed the incident and issued a stern rebuke, news outlets said.

According to reports, the slide system beneath the ship's stern activated prematurely, resulting in a failure of the slides to move in parallel and damage to the vessel. Officials attributed the incident to “inexperienced command and operational carelessness.”

Kim condemned the mishap as an unacceptable act of criminal negligence and ordered immediate repairs. He instructed that the warship be fully restored before a major meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in June. The government reportedly views the failure as a political embarrassment with implications for the country's global image.

No photos or video footage of the incident have been released by Pyongyang.

South Korea's military confirmed it has been monitoring the construction of the destroyer, adding that the ship appeared to be partially capsized following the failed launch.

Last month, North Korea unveiled a new destroyer, the Choe Hyon, and conducted a weapons demonstration shortly afterward. According to reports, the warship fired cruise missiles designed to strike targets at various ranges, an anti-aircraft missile, and a 127mm automatic gun during the test.

China's economic might makes the Asian nation a unique challenge as the US competes with it for global influence, CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis has said.

“China is the existential threat to American security in a way that we really have never confronted before,” Ellis said in an interview with Axios on Wednesday. Unlike with the Soviet Union, the current competition is primarily unfolding along economic lines, he explained.

Ellis said technological supremacy in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, semiconductors, and advanced energy storage will ultimately determine the outcome of the geopolitical contest.

He outlined the CIA's evolving priorities in an era where traditional methods of human intelligence gathering face increasing limitations. There has to be an “evolution in operational tradecraft,” Ellis stated. “While some of the tools and techniques from the 1960s or 70s might still work today, a lot of them need to be updated and refreshed.”

To meet the challenge, Ellis said the agency is recruiting an “elite workforce” with advanced scientific and engineering expertise, emphasizing a drive to build “the ultimate meritocracy at the CIA.”

Beijing has repeatedly accused Washington of clinging to a “Cold War mentality” and seeking global dominance instead of embracing a multipolar world based on cooperation and mutual benefit.

The US and China remain embroiled in a protracted trade dispute, which has escalated under the administration of President Donald Trump following the imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese products. Beijing has responded with countermeasures.

Following the latest round of talks, both sides issued a joint statement pledging to resolve their disagreements through “mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.”

This week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated the Trump administration's intention to shift its attention from European affairs to China.

“Every dollar we spend on this [Ukraine] conflict in Europe is distracting both our focus and our resources away from the potential for a much more serious, much more cataclysmic confrontation in the Indo-Pacific,” Rubio told lawmakers during a Senate hearing.

Justices' 4-4 ruling leaves intact lower court's decision that blocked establishment of Oklahoma school

The US supreme court on Thursday blocked an attempt led by two Catholic dioceses to establish in Oklahoma the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school in a major case involving religious rights in American education that challenged the constitutional separation of church and state.

The 4-4 ruling left intact a lower court's decision that blocked the establishment of St Isidore of Seville Catholic virtual school. The lower court found that the proposed school would violate the US constitution's first amendment limits on government involvement in religion.

The conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, leaving eight justices rather than the full slate of nine to decide the outcome. Barrett is a former professor at Notre Dame Law School, which represents the school's organizers.

When the supreme court is evenly divided, the lower court's decision stands. The justices did not provide a rationale for their action in the unsigned ruling. It was not disclosed how each member of the bench voted, though it is likely that the three liberal-leaning justices favored upholding the block and if that was indeed the case it poses the intriguing question of which conservative-leaning justice joined them.

Parties in favor of religious charter schools can be expected to try to bring another case that will wind its way to the supreme court but not cause Barrett to recuse herself, probably in hopes that as a religious conservative she would support public funding of religious charter schools.

Set up as alternatives to traditional public schools, charter schools typically operate under private management and often feature small class sizes, innovative teaching styles or a particular academic focus. Charter schools are considered public schools under Oklahoma law and draw funding from the state government.

St Isidore, planned as a joint effort by the Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and Diocese of Tulsa, would offer virtual learning from kindergarten through high school. Its plan to integrate religion into its curriculum would make it the first religious charter school in the United States. The proposed school has never been operational amid legal challenges to its establishment.

The Oklahoma Democratic state representative Mickey Dollens wrote in a post on X that Thursday's decision represented a “significant win for religious freedom”.

The Committee on Education and Workforce Democrats, a group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives, wrote in a post: “Public charter schools, just like other public schools, must abide by the constitution. In a victory for the separation of church and state, today's decision means that taxpayer dollars cannot be used to fund religious charter schools.”

And the Freedom from Religion Foundation, a non-profit that works to keep the separation of church and state, said it was “glad” about the decision but said in an X post that “the fight isn't over”.

“The forces trying to undermine our public schools and constitutional freedoms are already regrouping,” the post said. “FFRF will continue to defend secular education and the rights of all Americans to be free from government-imposed religion.”

The Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal advocacy group that defended the initial approval of St Isidore, expressed disappointment at the decision.

Chief legal counsel Jim Campbell said in a statement: “Oklahoma parents and children are better off with more educational choices, not fewer. While the supreme court's order is disappointing for educational freedom, the 4-4 decision does not set precedent, allowing the court to revisit this issue in the future.”

The case explored the tension between the two religion clauses of the US constitution's first amendment. Its “establishment clause” prohibits the government from establishing or endorsing any particular religion or promoting religion over non-religion. Its “free exercise” clause protects the right to practice one's religion freely, without government interference.

Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, sued in October 2023 to block St Isidore in a legal action filed at the Oklahoma supreme court, saying he was duty bound to “prevent the type of state-funded religion that Oklahoma's constitutional framers and the founders of our country sought to prevent”. Oklahoma's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, backed the proposed school, as did Donald Trump's administration.

Opponents have said religious charter schools would force taxpayers to support religious indoctrination. Establishing them also could undermine non-discrimination principles, they argued, because religious charter schools might seek to bar employees who do not adhere to doctrinal teachings.

Organizers estimated in 2023 that St Isidore would cost Oklahoma taxpayers up to $25.7m over its first five years in operation.

The Oklahoma charter school board in June 2023 approved the plan to create St Isidore in a 3-2 vote.

Oklahoma's top court in a 6-2 ruling last year blocked the school. It classified St Isidore as a “governmental entity” that would act as “a surrogate of the state in providing free public education as any other state-sponsored charter school”.

That court decided that the proposal ran afoul of the establishment clause. The first amendment generally constrains the government but not private entities.

St Isidore, the court wrote, would “require students to spend time in religious instruction and activities, as well as permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St Isidore – all in violation of the establishment clause”.

School board officials and St Isidore argued that the Oklahoma court erred by deeming St Isidore an arm of the government rather than a private organization. They argued that the government had not delegated a state duty to St Isidore merely by contracting with it, and that the school would function largely independently of the government.

They also argued that Oklahoma's refusal to establish St Isidore as a charter school solely because it is religious is discrimination under the first amendment's free exercise clause.

Thursday's decision was something of a surprise, as the supreme court has recognized broader religious rights in a series of rulings in recent years.

Newsom issues rallying cry as GOP-controlled Senate votes to reverse EPA waiver and prevent state setting own rules

California has long been one of the nation's pre-eminent eco-warriors, enacting landmark environmental standards for cars and trucks that go much further than those mandated by the federal government. Vehicles across the country are cleaner, more efficient and electric in greater numbers because of it.

But that could all change if Donald Trump and his Republican allies manage to revoke the state's ability to set its own, stricter emissions standards amid a White House crusade to combat climate-friendly policies.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets and updates its own federal standards for all states on smog and emissions from cars and trucks, which the Biden administration made even stricter last year, saying they will save American drivers thousands in fuel costs and maintenance over the life of a vehicle.

But for decades, California has been granted the ability to make those rules even stricter to help address some of the worst smog and air quality issues in the nation, which are linked to a host of health effects that disproportionately affect people of color.

On Wednesday, the Senate voted to reverse the waivers, in move that prompted fury from Democrats who call it a “nuclear” option, calling it an unprecedented, and illegal, use of the statute. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian have agreed, saying EPA waivers are not subject to the review law.

The House approved similar resolutions earlier this month. The resolutions now go to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign them.

“This move will harm public health and deteriorate air quality for millions of children and people across the country,” said Senators Alex Padilla, Sheldon Whitehouse and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, in a statement.

Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, emphasized California's ability to mandate strict emissions standards for cars, trucks and buses had existed for nearly 60 years, noting the state had been granted more than 75 waivers under Republican and Democratic presidents.

Among the waivers include rules to increase the share of electric vehicles each year among all new car and truck sales, as well as mandates that auto companies introduce progressively cleaner vehicles.

She described the waivers as a “quadruple win”, benefiting public health, air quality, drivers' pockets and the economy as a whole.

“These waivers are not new or novel,” Harris said in an interview. “California has historically been innovators in systems to help produce cleaner air and stymying California's ability is a direct attack on our ability to limit pollution and health harming pollutants in the air.”

She added revoking the waivers would immediately lead to an increase in pollution on the nation's roadways.

More than a dozen states follow California's lead on emissions standards, according to the California air resources board. The standards now cover nearly 40% of new light-duty vehicle registrations and more than a quarter of heavy-duty vehicles like trucks across the entire US.

Automakers have largely followed California's emissions standards as well so they can continue to sell cars there, as the state equates to the fourth-largest economy on the planet.

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, upped the ante in the nation's environmental future in 2020, declaring his state would ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Eleven states have also joined California's plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by the 2035 deadline, a reality that has spooked major car companies.

Joe Biden's administration approved the plan at the end of his term. Trump, however – a vehement opponent to many of the nation's climate efforts – has vowed to see them reversed.

“California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world, with mandates to move to all electric cars,” Trump said during his campaign last year. “I will terminate that.”

Newsom on Wednesday cast the battle as a nail in the coffin for the American car industry and decades of public health advancements.

“The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean-air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” he challenged Republicans in a statement. “Will you side with China or America?”

The Senate's decision may have sweeping effects far beyond the state's borders.

Harris said she recently pulled up pictures of what air quality looked like in cities around the country in the 1960s before the Clean Air Act, the seminal environmental law that regulates the nation's air quality, was in effect. She described normal levels of smog in California as blanketing the state similar to the apocalyptic clouds of wildfire smoke that have descended during recent fire seasons.

The American Lung Association also found last month that Los Angeles remained the country's smoggiest city for the 25th time in 26 years of tracking, despite decades of improvements in air quality.

“I think we have forgotten about what our air used to look like,” Harris said. “We take it for granted because it's a policy that's been around for so long we don't really recognize those direct benefits.

“There is still a long way to go, we have not succeeded in fully cleaning up our air yet,” she added. “These types of policies help ensure we are moving in a positive direction.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

White House press secretary says Trump is ‘saddened and outraged' by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC

Suspect's home raided after shooting of Israeli embassy staff

Lawmakers condemn antisemitism after DC shooting

Explained: what we know so far

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, is briefing the media now She starts by saying Donald Trump is “saddened and outraged” by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC last night.

She adds:

The department of justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator of this to the full extent of the law.

In a preview of coming events, Leavitt looks ahead to Trump's birthday, which coincides with the US army turning 250. She says:

The president will further honour our military on June 14, when he hosts the 250th anniversary of the United States Army with a grand military parade.
  President Trump will be joined by veterans, active-duty troops, wounded warriors, Gold Star families and patriotic Americans from across the country.

Trump will attend the G20 summit in Canada from 15 to 17 June, Leavitt confirms.

Leavitt says “hatred has no place in the United States”.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), the US's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has condemned political violence as “completely unacceptable” after a deadly attack on Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC, and said that the crime does not reflect or represent the millions of Americans peacefully advocating for an end to US support for the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza.

In a statement, Cair said:

We condemn last night's deadly attack on Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC.

While millions of Americans feel extreme frustration at the sight of the Israeli government slaughtering Palestinian men, women and children on a daily basis with weapons paid for with our taxpayer dollars, political violence is an unacceptable crime and is not the answer.

Such violence only undermines the pursuit of justice. Peaceful protest, civil disobedience and political engagement are the only appropriate and acceptable tools to advocate for policy change in our nation, including an end to US support for the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza.

Yechiel Leiter, a hardline supporter of Israel's war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank, also told reporters:

Israel has a right to exist that goes back over 3,000 years, long before there was anything called Palestine as a geographic location. There was Israel, the people of Israel and the land of Israel.

We've come home, we plan to stay there, and we're not going to be intimidated by the violence of those screaming on behalf of Palestine.

For the uninitiated, here's more about Leiter from my colleague Andrew Roth:

The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, is speaking to reporters near the scene of the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers last night in Washington DC.

He says Donald Trump just spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu.

He repeats the claim that there has been a wave of violent antisemitism across US university campuses.

Leiter claims last night's shooting was “done in the name of a political agenda to eradicate the state of Israel”.

He says it is part of a war “to demonise, delegitimize, eradicate the right of the state of Israel to exist”.

A Republican push to dismantle clean energy incentives threatens to reverberate across the US by costing more than 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households and threatening to unleash millions more tonnes of the planet-heating pollution that is causing the climate crisis, experts have warned.

A major tax bill moving through the Republican-held House of Representatives will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US.

Under the reconciliation bill, tax credits for cleaner cars will end this year, with incentives for wind, solar and even nuclear energy projects scaled down and then eliminated by 2032. Clean energy manufacturing tax credits will be axed by 2031, while Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances will get no further subsidy after the end of this year.

“This bill is worse than what people envisioned – it pulls the rug out from facilities banking on these incentives, it raises everyday household costs by hundreds of dollars and undercuts any sort of action on climate change,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan climate policy thinktank.

“You can't overstate how significant this will be in weakening the US's position. With inflation, tariffs and rising electricity use, it really couldn't come at a worse time. It's a really damaging bill.”

Facing a barrage of false claims from Donald Trump that white people were being persecuted in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa remained composed, pushed back politely and even tried to joke with Trump, earning him praise back home, reports Reuters.

Ramaphosa may have drawn on his experience as the African National Congress's lead negotiator in talks that led to the peaceful end of apartheid in 1994 during yesterday's chaotic televised confrontation, in which he managed to avoid a Zelenskyy-level bust-up in the Oval Office. The ANC said of the South African president:

His conduct was in keeping with the proud diplomatic tradition of President Nelson Mandela.

Repeatedly interrupted by Trump, Ramaphosa calmly challenged claims that minority Afrikaners were the targets of a “white genocide”, the once fringe theory has been exponentially amplified by Trump and his South African-born ally Elon Musk.

The way he handled Trump's onslaught was mostly drawing praise back home on Thursday. Author Pieter du Toit said:

President Ramaphosa did well to maintain a calm demeanour and he did well to stick to the facts as close as possible.

Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said Ramaphosa kept sight of the bigger picture and did not take the bait.

There was never a sense of arrogance on the side of Ramaphosa. He managed his emotions in a tactful way.

Ramaphosa's extensive network was evident in the Oval Office, where he was accompanied by luxury goods billionaire Johann Rupert, South Africa's richest man, and by champion golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen. “It was pragmatic of him to bring the golfers and Rupert, they are the sort of people Trump likes to speak with,” said Mathekga.

That pragmatism extended to inviting the three men and agriculture minister John Steenhuisen, all of whom are white, to address Trump, who listened to them without interrupting - in contrast to how he treated Ramaphosa.

At the start of the meeting, Ramaphosa complimented Trump on his changes to the Oval Office decor, offered him a 14-kg book on South African golf courses and joked about having worked on his own golf so he could take on Trump, who loves the sport.

Even after Trump began his attacks and played a video that falsely purported to show thousands of graves of white farmers in South Africa and flipped through printouts of news stories he claimed were of white people killed in the country, Ramaphosa tried to defuse tensions with humour.

With Trump raging at a reporter for asking about a luxury jet he has accepted as a gift from Qatar, Ramaphosa interjected: “I am sorry I don't have a plane to give you.” Trump appeared unamused. “I wish you did,” he said, before resuming his attacks.

Mahmoud Khalil, the detained Palestinian activist, was allowed to hold his one-month-old son for the first time after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's efforts to keep the father and infant separated by a plexiglass divider, reports the Associated Press.

The visit today came ahead of a scheduled immigration hearing for Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Columbia University graduate who has been held in a Louisiana jail since 8 March.

His request to attend his son's 21 April birth was denied last month by Ice. The Trump administration then aimed to block Khalil from a “contact visit”, only permitting him to meet with his wife and son from behind a barrier. The government claimed that allowing the trio to meet in the same room could present a security risk.

After days of legal fighting, triggering claims by Khalil's attorneys that he is being subject to political retaliation by the government, a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz, intervened last night, allowing the meeting to go forward on Thursday morning.

Farbiarz is currently considering Khalil's petition for release as he appeals a Louisiana immigration judge's ruling that he can be deported from the country.

Federal authorities have not accused Khalil of a crime, but have sought to deport him on the basis that his prominent role in protests against Israel's war in Gaza may have “undermined US foreign policy interests”.

Khalil is scheduled to appear before that immigration judge, Jamee Comans, for a routine hearing later today. His attorneys said it was unclear whether the baby would be permitted to attend the hearing.

Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, co-founder of the Mizrahi Family Charitable Fund and friend and colleague of Sarah Milgrim, one of the two Israeli embassy staffers shot dead last night in Washington DC, says she has a “broken heart” in a tribute she wrote to Milgram published in the Times of Israel.

Sarah was a young, passionate, and brilliant environmental advocate. She worked on climate and sustainability issues at the Embassy of Israel in Washington, DC, and was deeply committed to building a more peaceful and sustainable world.

Just eight days ago, I spoke with her about an upcoming climate initiative. She was full of energy and optimism. Recently, I attended an Earth Day event she co-organized, which featured Israeli environmental nonprofit leaders. Her leadership shone through – bright, compassionate, and determined.

She added that Milgrim “truly embodied the Jewish value of tikkun olam – repairing the world. Her loss is devastating not only to her family and friends but to the entire global environmental and Jewish communities.”

In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that his “Big, Beautiful Bill … is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!” after the bill's passage in the House.

The president wrote that the bill “includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for the Golden Dome.”

He added that the “Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination”.

The American Osteopathic Association said it was “shocked and saddened” over the deaths of two Israeli embassy staff members. The suspect in the shooting, Elias Rodriguez, was an employee of the American Osteopathic Information Association, the statement said.

“We were shocked and saddened to learn that an AOIA employee has been arrested as a suspect in this horrific crime,” the statement reads. “Both the AOIA and AOA stand ready to cooperate with the investigation in any way we can. As a physician organization dedicated to protecting the health and sanctity of human life, we believe in the rights of all persons to live safely without fear of violence.”

A federal judge has blocked Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs.

US district judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump's goal to dismantle the department.

The injunction was requested in a lawsuit filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts and the American Federation of Teachers, along with other education groups.

The groups argued that the layoffs amounted to an illegal shutdown of the education department. They said it left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including supporting special education, distributing financial aid and enforcing civil rights laws.

FBI agents were present this morning at the Chicago apartment where Elias Rodriguez, the man whom authorities suspect of shooting and killing two Israeli Embassy workers, reportedly lived, the New York Times reported.

Agents blocked the sidewalk in front of the apartment building, and some were seen going in and out of the apartment, including two agents in full tactical gear. Bomb technicians were also reportedly present at the scene.

The Times reports that in the window of the apartment where Rodriguez lived were two signs related to Palestine. One sign read “Justice for Wadea,” a reference to the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy killed in Chicago two years ago. Another sign read “Tikkun Olam means free Palestine.” (Tikkun Olam is a Hebrew phrase that means “repairing the world.”)","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Hundreds of young Mongolians turned out this week in the country's capital calling for the prime minister's resignation on allegations of corruption, a longstanding source of deep public anger in the landlocked democracy.

Mongolia has for decades struggled with endemic graft and the widespread view that the proceeds of a coal mining boom are being hoarded by a wealthy elite has sparked frequent protests and unrest.

Under Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene — in power since 2021 — Mongolia has plummeted in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.

Fueling public outrage are allegations that the prime minister's family are enjoying wealth far beyond that expectation of a civil servant on the public dime — claims sparked by a social media post by his son's girlfriend showing a lavish birthday gift.

The prime minister's office said it “vehemently” denied allegations of impropriety, describing them as a “smear.”

However, hundreds of mostly young protesters have gathered for eight consecutive days at Sukhbaatar Square, also known as Genghis Khan square, in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, demanding the premier's resignation.

“The prime minister has to resign,” protest organizer O. Ulamsaikhan, 24, said.

“What we are trying to achieve is to establish a new political culture in which unethical behavior by public officials leads to accountability and resignation,” he said.

Also deepening anger in the country are worries over the economy and cost of living. Inflation, which soared following neighboring Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — reached 9 percent last year, national news agency Montsame reported.

“Young people are working hard to make a living,” said university freshman O. Khulan, 19, who was among the crowd holding placards reading: “It's easy to resign.”

“Yet it is unfair that the prime minister's son and his girlfriend have a lavish lifestyle, while I'm buying my bag from a thrift shop,” she said.


BACKLASH: 
                                        The National Party quit its decades-long partnership with the Liberal Party after their election loss to center-left Labor, which won a historic third term                                        Australia's National Party has split from its conservative coalition partner of more than 60 years, the Liberal Party, citing policy differences over renewable energy and after a resounding loss at a national election this month.
“Its time to have a break,” Nationals leader David Littleproud told reporters yesterday.
The split shows the pressure on Australia's conservative parties after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left Labor party won a historic second term in the May 3 election, powered by a voter backlash against US President Donald Trump's policies.
Under the long-standing partnership in state and federal politics, the Liberal and National coalition had shared power

After votes from national juries around Europe and viewers from across the continent and beyond, JJ gave Austria its first victory since bearded drag performer Conchita Wurst's 2014 triumph. 
After the nail-biting drama as the votes were revealed running into yesterday morning, Austria finished with 436 points, ahead of Israel — whose participation drew protests — on 357 and Estonia on 356.

As the cinema lights came back on, filmmaker Sepideh Farsi held up an image of the young Palestinian woman killed with younger siblings on April 16, and encouraged the audience to stand up and clap to pay tribute.

“There are still children to save. It must be done fast,” the exiled Iranian filmmaker added.

Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) and New Taipei City Mayor Hou You-yi (侯友宜) suited up to compete at the World Masters Games yesterday, while participants continued to complain of organization issues, media said yesterday.

Chiang had a good run in recreational squash, winning two matches on Wednesday in the 40+ singles, but bowed out yesterday when his opponent beat him 3-1. 

Hou played in recreational table tennis in the 60+ singles, but was eliminated in the preliminary round, with one win and two losses. The win was due to his opponent failing to show up.

Meanwhile, management issues continued to plague the Games, with competitors complaining about the venues and facilities, schedule confusions, missing their events and erroneous information from officials. Some people participating in the orienteering competition yesterday posted on social media that before the event, competitors had to squat and crawl on the ground to find their map.

“We were at the check-in location to receive materials and get ready, then 10 minutes before we were to collect the orienteering map, the officials just dumped everything on the ground. Competitors had to scramble to search for the map with their assigned number,” one participant wrote, attaching photos.

“It was awful to see, like a group of athletes picking through trash. There were more than 500 maps, and you had no idea which one has your assigned number. Anything is better than just throwing everything on the ground for people to search through,” he wrote.

Triathlon participants also complained, saying that officials had changed the check-in times on its Web site, but participants had already received their kits through the mail, which had different schedules.

The sprint distance triathlon is to take place tomorrow and the full race on Sunday in Dongshan Township (冬山) in Yilan County, so most competitors had to arrange transportation to arrive in time for the check-in, one person said.

“For the Saturday race, we had to arrive on Friday. According to the kit we received, the latest time for check-in was 8pm, during which you were to collect the patch with your assigned number, a chip to monitor your time and a swimming cap. However, we had no idea that the cut-off time had been changed to 6pm,” he wrote.

“The race time for Saturday had also been changed. If people do not check the Web site, they would not be able to take part in the competition,” he added.

Foreign competitors have also complained about a lack of interpreters, with organizers saying that they are short on volunteers who can speak foreign languages, which has led to some being unable to participate in their events, social media posts showed.

Many participants also said there was a lack in updated information and long delays. 

Some said when they arrived at venues, they had to wait for a very long time, as officials were still working through the check-in procedures. 

Others said that although they already underwent the check-in process and were dressed for their competitions, they had to wait many hours, with some people not being able to compete at all. 

Checks found that problems with the sound system and likely erroneous name pronunciation were the reasons that some athletes missed their call.



                                                                                Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr arrived in Taiwan last night to kick off his first  visit to the country since beginning his second term earlier  this year.
After arriving at Taoyuan International Airport at around  6:30 pm, Whipps and his delegation were welcomed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍).
Speaking to gathered media, the Palauan leader said he  was excited and honored to be back in Taiwan on his first  state visit to Taiwan since he was sworn in this January.
Among those traveling with Whipps is Minister of State  Gustav N. Aitaro, Public Infrastructure                                    


RESOLUTIONS DEBATE:
                                        Taiwan's allies said that UN and WHA resolutions cited by China and other nations ‘do not determine Taiwan's participation in WHO activities'                                        A proposal to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) was rejected on Monday, resulting in Taipei's absence from the annual meeting for a ninth consecutive year, although partners spoke up for Taiwan's participation at the first day of the meeting.
The first agenda item after the opening was a “two-on-two debate” on a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate at the WHA as an observer.
Similar to previous years, two countries made statements in favor of the proposal, while two others expressed their opposition.
Philippine Secretary of Health Teodoro Herbosa, president of the 78th WHA, accepted the WHA General Committee's

The incident happened at about 4pm when a car rammed into pedestrians at an intersection near Bei Da Elementary School.
Witnesses said the sedan, being driven at a high speed, ran a red light, knocking scooters out of the way and hitting students crossing the road before careening into a median near the intersection of Guocheng and Guoguang streets.

A log burns in the hearth in the artfully lit drawing room. The armchairs look plush and inviting. Glasses and a bottle of wine stand ready as a grandfather clock keeps time. It is all straight out of a glossy magazine and yet every carefully crafted item in the room could fit into the palm of one hand.

“I love Victorian (19th century) houses and always wanted to live in one but it never happened,” laughed doll house enthusiast Michele Simmons, admiring the cozy miniature scene by historical specialists Mulvany & Rogers.

The 57-year-old corporate recruiter revived her childhood passion for doll houses during the pandemic and has since “flipped” about 10, buying them, doing them up and selling them on.

She and her daughter thought nothing of flying all night from Boston in the US to hunt for tiny curtains and a child's crib at the leading Kensington Dollshouse festival in London.

“I love it! You don't think about anything else when you are doing this,” she said, admitting she often had to be dragged out of her work shed to feed her children as she became so absorbed.

EXQUISITE MINIATURES

The annual festival has been gathering some of the world's finest miniature craftspeople since 1985, celebrating a hobby that has seen rising interest recently and a mushrooming of online activity. It showcases tiny versions of anything needed to furnish a house, from chandeliers and paintings to mahogany dining tables and kitchen items, all with steep price tags.

Doll houses may be traditionally associated with children, but this high-end miniature collecting is very much an adult hobby.

“This is craftspeople working on just exquisite things,” said self-confessed “tiny-obsessed” Rachel Collings, who bought toys from renowned miniaturists Laurence & Angela St. Leger.

Every single one of her purchases, which cost at least US$53, fits easily into a small plastic container and will be added to her collection of equally small items.

“I've got half a cut lemon. Just imagine the size of that. A lemon squeezer and a pastry brush and a hand whisk that actually works,” said the 47-year-old editor.

“It's an inner child thing. These things are just so beautiful.”

Doll houses originated from Europe in the 1500s when they were used to display the miniature possessions of the wealthy.

Just as at the London festival, these so-called “baby houses” were strictly for adults, not children.

Retired midwife Susan Evans, 67, on her annual pilgrimage from Colwyn Bay in north Wales, does not just have one doll house.

“I have a whole village,” she said. “It's got 18 Victorian shops, a school, a manor house, a pub and now a church,” she said.

Initially the hobby was just a stress-buster to help her unwind, but she has now raised thousands of pounds hosting groups to visit the display in her home.

“It's my passion. It's escapism and it's about using your imagination, which I think is very good for your mental health,” she said.

“IN CONTROL”

Kensington Dollshouse organizer Charlotte Stokoe said there was currently huge interest in doll houses and miniatures compared to before the pandemic.

“When the world itself is going a bit crazy with so much stress in everyone's lives, it's quite relaxing. You are in control,” she said, adding that many people had delighted in pulling out old doll's houses during the COVID lockdowns.

And at a time of rising costs, she said, people had “discovered they can do interior design that maybe they can't do with their own homes — in small scale it's so much more doable.”

Medical anthropologist Dalia Iskander of University College London (UCL) has spent three years researching the subject for her forthcoming book Miniature Antidotes.

“For many people it's a way of exploring their own experiences and memories and imagination and incorporating that into these miniature worlds,” she said.

A whole range of medical issues such as depression or anxiety could all be explored through miniatures in a “beneficial” way, she added.

Miniatures enthusiast Collings said the hobby had become such a source of happiness that her 12-year-old daughter also got involved. She urged anyone to give it a try.

“When everything is difficult, there are these tiny things,” she said.

“Sometimes I just go and sit and look at them and it just makes me happy.”

Pastor Yang Hsu's (楊煦) congregation was shocked upon seeing the land he chose to build his orphanage. It was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and the only way to access it was to cross a river by foot. The soil was poor due to runoff, and large rocks strewn across the plot prevented much from growing. In addition, there was no running water or electricity. 
But it was all Yang could afford. He and his Indigenous Atayal wife Lin Feng-ying (林鳳英) had already been caring for 24 orphans in their home, and they were in

Chu claimed that unlike any other democracy worldwide in history, no other leader was rooting out opposing parties like Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). That his statements are wildly inaccurate was not the point. It was a rallying cry, not a history lesson.
This was intentional to provoke the international diplomatic community into a response, which was promptly provided. Both the German and Israeli offices issued statements on Facebook

In the speech, Lai affirmed Taiwan's global role in technology, trade and security. He announced economic  and national security initiatives, and emphasized democratic values and cross-party cooperation.
The following is the full text of his speech:

Ukrainian defense manufacturers have issued a public letter to President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to lift export restrictions on domestically produced military-grade equipment, particularly drones, to help the sector grow and integrate better into Europe's security architecture. 

The open letter, signed by leading representatives of Ukraine's defense-industrial sector, highlights the strategic potential of the country's homegrown military technologies, from drones to electronic warfare systems, and calls for decisive political action to authorize the controlled export of surplus weaponry to allied nations.

""It is time to demonstrate that Ukraine is capable of being not only a party that receives international support, but also a full-fledged partner that exports security through cooperation, technology, and its own experience,"" the letter reads. 

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine's defense sector — and its drone industry in particular — has exploded. More than 200 drone companies have emerged, many producing cheap, adaptable systems that have reshaped modern warfare. Industry leaders have previously said many smaller firms are burning through capital with no lifeline in sight.

Under the current laws, drones and other dual-use military goods require a permit from the State Export Service. But drone producers earlier told the Kyiv Independent that those waivers are nearly impossible to obtain — even for companies the government cannot afford to contract. The system, they say, blocks access to global markets just as foreign demand is surging.

""As Europe grapples with transatlantic uncertainty and armed conflicts escalate worldwide, our strategic partners are actively seeking to strengthen their defense capabilities through innovative and affordable technological solutions,"" the letter reads.

""And here, Ukraine holds a unique advantage. Our defense industry — evolving under constant battlefield conditions — is already producing the technologies the world is looking for.""

Kateryna Mykhalko, executive director of Tech Force in UA, told the Kyiv Independent in May 2024 that Ukraine manufactures a lot of drones, but ""not all of them can be used in the army."" 

""Export is one way to ensure that companies do not go bankrupt, develop their R&D, and perhaps in the future the military will need their products,"" she said. 

Ukraine's defense industry was capable of producing up to $20 billion in equipment in 2024, but the government could fund only half, then-Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin Minister said in May of last year.

U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not ready for peace in Ukraine because he believes he is winning the war, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 22, citing three undisclosed sources.

Trump's reported statement marked the first time he acknowledged to European leaders what they and Kyiv have long maintained — the Kremlin has no intention of ending its full-scale war against Ukraine.

The conversation on May 19 reportedly included President Volodymyr Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Earlier the same day, Trump held a phone call with Putin, days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials.

European leaders on the call reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin, Axios reported on May 20.

Despite U.S. efforts, Putin has shown little willingness to compromise to achieve a settlement. After the call, Putin reiterated Russia's maximalist demands, denying full ceasefire agreement.

Since taking the office in January, Trump has been inconsistent in his rhetoric toward the Russian leader, at times voicing frustration with the stalled peace efforts but mostly avoiding direct criticism of Putin.

Although Trump now seems to recognize that Putin is not prepared to pursue peace, the White House so far has not yet imposed new sanctions or taken direct steps to penalize Russia, despite growing frustration among allies.

Ukraine accepted the U.S.-backed unconditional 30-day ceasefire when Washington first proposed it on March 11. Russia rejected the proposal and continued its attacks.

A scene from North of North.jasper savage/CBC/APTN/Netflix

One of the hottest new television shows of the year is North of North, which just got renewed for its second season on CBC, APTN and Netflix. The Nunavut-set comedy stars Anna Lambe as Siaja, a plucky, young Inuk mother.

In a supporting role is the show's soundtrack, which mixes originals songs and Inuktitut covers by Inuk artists with classic pop recorded by Britney Spears, Stevie Nicks, Alanis Morissette and more.

North of North music supervisor Michael Perlmutter, who just won a Canadian Sync Award for best soundtrack in a comedy series, spoke to The Globe and Mail about the unique role the music plays in connecting north and south.

You collaborated with North of North show runners Stacey Aglok MacDonald and Alethea Arnaquq-Baril on the show's music concept. Can you talk about those early discussions?

Early on, it felt like music was going to be a character. It wasn't an afterthought. They wanted to work with Inuk artists, and show the Inuit music world to the rest of the world. We also wanted to show that an Inuit community was still connected with the rest of world. So, we used songs by Britney Spears, Caroline Polachek, Alanis Morissette, the list goes on. 

What about using music to support characters, such as the lead, Siaja?

The idea was to create a fun, upbeat, female-centric mix. Siaja is an independent Inuk woman, super fun and super driven. We were connecting a lot of dots through her character. So we have Riit's cover of Dua Lipa's Levitating and Angela Amarualik‘s cover of Kelis's Milkshake. And you're probably familiar with Elisapie, who covers Stevie Nicks's Dreams.

I did notice a character wearing an Elisapie T-shirt. Her Inuktitut version of Dreams was previously recorded, but, elsewhere, you had Inuk musicians recording covers specifically for the show. How common is that?

I don't know if it's standard in the business, but in the last five or ten years I think you're seeing it a bit more. For each one, we find the right artist, we find a producer and we have a creative conversation on how we want it to sound. Riit's Levitating turned out to be super cool. 

There are time constraints as well, right?

It's a creative choice, if you have the time. And we had it. That's the key. But it all depends on the project. With this show, it was hand in glove

Using a song is one thing, covering it in a different language is another. How hard was it to secure the rights for the songs?

We wrote the rightsholders long letters about what we were doing and what the show is about. We also sent lyrics in Inuktitut that had been translated. In the case of Levitating, we had to get Dua Lipa's approval and also the approval of the other songwriters. They were really excited about the idea.

Did the Netflix money allow you to afford all these songs? How big was the song licensing budget?

That's a state secret. I would say that there was a budget. Because we had incredible support from all three networks involved, we were able to afford these songs. The cost is not as astronomical as you may think. We let them know we have X amount of dollars. We negotiate with them. We explain what the show is about. This was a project people could get behind. 

You say people. Do you think the Dua Lipas and Alanis Morisettes are involved in the process, or is it their managers, labels and publishers?

We know Dua Lipa saw the request. We think Alanis knew about it. Caroline Polachek's camp seemed excited by it. 

Now that the show is a hit and has been renewed for a second season, does the dynamic shift? Are you getting pitched by publishers now?

Publishers, labels, mothers, daughters, dog walkers, friends, cousins, they all want to be on a successful show. I've had emails already, suggesting a playlist for the second season. I'm not really responding to those just yet. 

Let's discuss the creative thinking behind a couple of the songs, starting with Levitating, in the first episode.

You're coming into the show. You're seeing the North for the first time and it's beautiful. We wanted something that reflected Siaja's state of mind. She's full of hope and full of love. She wants to celebrate life.

How about the string quartet cover of Keane's Somewhere Only We Know?

Siaja has what might be a fever dream. She's running toward a man, and we have this beautiful, romantic piece supporting that scene. We're having a little fun with it, but it's not necessarily ironic.

The show's use of music reminds me of Northern Exposure. But where that show had a theme song, yours doesn't. Why not?

What Stacey and Alethea wanted to do was use a different theme song every episode, whether it plays for five seconds at the beginning or whether it rolls into the next scene for another 15 seconds. It's all to give it a different flavour and a different feel. Not that there's anything wrong with the same 30-second song every episode. We just wanted a surprise of some kind. You don't know what you're going to get.

Bloc Quebecois candidate Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagne speaks in the Foyer of the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, on May 15.Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press

In a less partisan, more conciliatory political environment, there would be cross-partisan consensus about the need for a by-election in the Quebec riding of Terrebonne. 

It's not simply that the margin of victory was razor-thin, with the Liberals' Tatiana Auguste winning the riding by a single vote. Nor is it about the flip-flopping of the result: Terrebonne was first won by Ms. Auguste, then it flipped to the Bloc Québécois' Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné after a validation process, then flipped back to Ms. Auguste following a judicial recount.

But the issue that so irremediably undermines the result in Terrebonne is that we know that at least one vote that should have been counted (and possibly more) was not. 

Last week, Elections Canada released a statement saying that the return postal code on a special ballot envelope issued in Terrebonne contained an error in the last three digits. It noted that it was only aware of one case where a marked ballot was returned because of the error, and though the statement didn't include specifics, CBC News reported that the individual who came forward had voted for the Bloc. Had that vote been counted, Ms. Auguste and Ms. Sinclair-Desgagné would have been tied, which would have meant a new election for the riding. The Bloc Québécois, through a legal challenge, is calling for that now. 

Elections Canada has subsequently said it is aware of five more return envelopes with the misprinted postal code, but that is essentially superfluous: because Ms. Auguste won the riding by one, one returned vote is enough to undermine the result. Indeed, it would be reasonable for voters to consider the results null and void until such a time that they have the opportunity to cast their ballots again.

There is precedent here. In 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on a challenge to the 2011 federal election results from Liberal candidate Borys Wrzesnewskyj, who lost the Ontario riding of Etobicoke Centre to the Conservatives' Ted Opitz by just 26 votes. Though the Ontario Court of Justice sided with Mr. Wrzesnewskyj, discounting a total of 79 votes based on alleged irregularities in vouching and registration, the SCC upheld the election result in a split decision, which restored 59 of the 79 votes the lower court judge set aside. In its decision, the Court held that the entitlement to vote cannot be annulled by procedural errors. That determination will be relevant when the legal challenge over the results in Terrebonne is heard in Quebec's Superior Court. 

Though Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said last week that “the situation is quite clear,” and most impartial observers would agree with him, he is the only party leader calling for a by-election in Terrebonne. When asked about it last week, Prime Minister Mark Carney first quipped that it is “better to win by one vote than to lose by one vote,” and then said that the matter of a by-election in the riding is “up to Elections Canada” (though, in fact, only the court can nullify the result now). 

No one should be naive as to the political implications at play here. Mr. Blanchet knows that his party has a much better shot at taking the riding now than he did back in April simply because Terrebonne residents already know the overall outcome of the federal election. Mr. Carney is and will be the prime minister regardless of what happens in Terrebonne; therefore traditional Bloc voters who might have voted strategically for the Liberals last month will feel safe going back to the Bloc. That could very well mean that a one-vote margin of victory for the Liberals turns into a several-thousand-vote landslide for the incumbent Bloc candidate. In fact, it's quite likely, and both Mr. Carney and Mr. Blanchet know it.

Is that fair for the Liberals? No, not particularly. But the integrity of our electoral system should take precedence over partisan interests, even if it costs money (and it will – millions) and changes the result (people can change their minds in a democracy, alas). It is also important, at a time when there is so much skepticism, distrust, and outright disinformation being circulated about the integrity of our elections, that there is political consensus about the need to get things right, and to ensure that every single vote is counted. It would send a strong message if a leader besides the one whose party stands to benefit would come out and advocate for the voters in Terrebonne, though it's likely the next voice we will hear on the matter will come from the benches in court, not Parliament.

Two Israeli Embassy staff were killed outside a Jewish museum in Washington. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered security at embassies to be boosted as leaders condemned the attack and antisemitism.

Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy were shot dead outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington on Wednesday night.

The two victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event at the museum when the 30-year-old suspect approached a group of four people and opened fire, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith told a news conference.

The suspect, who has been identified as Elias R. from Chicago, was detained by event security, Smith said, adding that he was not previously known to police. 

When he was taken into custody, the man began chanting, ""free, free Palestine,"" Smith said.

Authorities believe the suspect acted alone, US Attorney General Pamela Bondi told Fox News.

The attack comes amid rising international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. 

Antisemitic incidents have dramatically increased since the war in the Palestinian enclave began in October 2023.

In a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday night's attack was ""the terrible price of antisemitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.""

""My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were abruptly cut short by a despicable antisemitic terrorist,"" he said.

Netanyahu added that he has ordered ""security agencies to strengthen the protection arrangements for Israel's representations worldwide and to raise the level of security for all the state's emissaries.""

Later on Thursday, Netanyahu also spoke with US President Donald Trump about the shooting as well as the situation in Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said there is ""a direct line connecting antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement to this murder.""

Saar added that leaders from many countries and international organizations, ""especially from Europe,"" were responsible for this ""incitement."" 

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was ""devastated"" by the scenes in Washington. 

""This is a despicable act of hatred, of antisemitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,"" he said in a statement, adding: ""We stand with the Jewish community in DC and across the US. America and Israel will stand united in defense of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.""

Israel's ambassador to the US said the two victims had been a couple. They were identified by Israel's Foreign Ministry as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.

German diplomatic sources said Lischinsky held German citizenship. According to the German-Israeli Society (DIG), he was originally from Germany and grew up partly in Bavaria. 

Lischinsky had been a founding member of the Israel-Germany Youth Forum and took a post at the Israeli embassy in Washington in 2022, the DIG said.

US President Donald Trump also condemned the killings. ""These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform. ""Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said authorities would ""track down those responsible"" for the fatal shooting. ""This was a brazen act of cowardly, antisemitic violence. Make no mistake: we will track down those responsible and bring them to justice,"" he posted on X.

US Attorney General Bondi posted on X: ""I am on the scene of the horrible shooting outside the Washington, DC Capital Jewish Museum. Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more.""

FBI Director Kash Patel said he and his team had been briefed on the shooting.

""While we're working with [Metropolitan Police Department] to respond and learn more, in the immediate, please pray for the victims and their families,"" he wrote on X.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has condemned the shooting, calling it ""a despicable act.""

Posting on X, Merz said he condemned the attack ""in the strongest terms"" and added that ""at the moment we must assume there was an antisemitic motive.""

The head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany has said his heart was ""torn apart"" by the killings. Council President Josef Schuster said the attack confirmed fears shared during a recent visit to Israel.

""Just one day later, this has been confirmed in the most tragic way,"" Schuster said. ""The rise in political and antisemitic violence, even in Western societies, is shocking and threatening.""

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said she is ""shocked"" by the shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington that killed two Israeli embassy staffers.

""There is and should be no place in our societies for hatred, extremism, or antisemitism. I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Israel,"" Kallas wrote on X.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius are attending a ceremony to mark the start of Germany's first permanent foreign troop deployment since WWII. DW has the latest. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius are in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, on Thursday to take part in a ceremony to mark the launch of a new armored brigade aimed at protecting NATO's eastern flank.

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul held talks with Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar.

Here's a roundup of top news stories from Germany on Thursday, May 22:

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has said the new coalition government in Berlin will revive the country's economy.

Klingbeil made the remarks on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in Canada on Thursday.

The German government — a coalition between the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) — is expected to meet next week to adopt an economic agenda that will outline its policy priorities, Klingbeil said.

One of the main ways the government is hoping to boost the German economy is a so-called ""investment booster."" 

He said it would allow companies to write off up to 30% of investments, which will encourage private investment and boost public spending, German news agency dpa reported.

""I am sure that companies will also immediately get involved, that  hesitation about investing will be abandoned, and that we will then also see progress in Germany,"" Klingbeil said.

During the remarks, Klingbeil also said he was confident of reaching a solution on the international tariff dispute with the US after the G7 talks in the mountain resort of Banff.

""We need movement in the negotiations now,"" he said, referring to talks between the European Commission and the United States.
 

German authorities have arrested a Yemeni man suspected of being a member of the country's Houthi rebels.

A statement by federal prosecutors said Bavarian state police had arrested the man, named as Hussein H., in the town of Dachau, just outside the southern city of Munich.

The man is a ""suspected member of the foreign terrorist organization 'Houthi Movement,'"" the statement said.

""The accused is strongly suspected of having been a member of a terrorist organization abroad as a young adult"" in October 2022.

The arrest warrant accuses the suspect of having ""participated in ideological training, followed by three months of military training.""

He also allegedly briefly fought for the Houthis in Yemen.

The Iran-backed Houthis have fought an insurgency in Yemen, which has been devastated by war since 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition failed to defeat the rebels.

The Houthis have regularly attacked Israel since the outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip in 2023, and have targeted shipping concerns in the Gulf of Aden.

In the statement, German prosecutors said the militant Islamist organization's ""stated goal is to strengthen and expand its power in Yemen and destroy Israel.""

""To this end, it carries out military attacks within Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Red Sea,"" the statement said.

On Monday, the rebels warned they would impose a naval blockade on Haifa, a port in Israel, in response to the intensified Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Thursday that he supports higher military spending, amid growing pressure on NATO members to boost their defense budgets in light of the threat seen to come from Russia.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has proposed that members of the alliance should spend 3.5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense and an additional 1.5% on defense-related infrastructure, such as roads and railways, in the coming years.

US President Donald Trump had led the calls for NATO members — in particular European nations — to increase spending to 5% of GDP. Data from the US Department of Defense put US defense spending in 2024 at 2.7%.

The new spending target is expected to be adopted at an upcoming June NATO summit in The Hague.

These figures ""seem reasonable to us, they also seem achievable to us, at least in the specified timeframe up to 2032,"" Merz said.

The chancellor, who was confirmed this month after federal elections in February, made modernizing Germany's armed forces one of his main campaign pledges.

In March, Germany eased a so-called ""debt brake"" — a fiscal rule that limits government borrowing — to fund an increase in defense spending.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has also backed Trump's demand to boost NATO defence spending to 5% of GDP.

Last year, Germany's defense spending was 2.12% of its GDP, up from 1.19% in 2014, according to NATO estimates.

Lithuania has also announced plans to increase defense spending to over 5% from next year.

The Baltic country, which, along with Estonia and Latvia, is considered among the most vulnerable to a potential Russian attack, is expected to spend over 3% of its GDP on defense in 2025.

""My country is ready to play its part. Next year we will reach 5% of GDP for defence,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said.

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who joined Merz in Vilnius on Thursday to mark the overseas deployment of a German tank brigade, said that ""deterrence and defence are Germany's top priorities.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the German military had entered a ""new era"" on Thursday, after its first permanent overseas deployment was officially unveiled in Vilnius.

Merz was in the Lithuanian capital for a ceremony to mark the creation of an overseas tank brigade that will be permanently stationed in the Baltic country.

It is the first such foreign deployment by the German army since World War II, and comes in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as part of NATO efforts to strengthen its eastern flank.

The deployment is ""a step into a new era"" for the German military, Merz said. ""Never before have we permanently stationed a large military unit abroad.""

""Lithuania has asked for support — and Germany stands ready,"" Merz said during the ceremony, which Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda also attended.

""Anyone who challenges NATO must know that we are prepared. Anyone who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will jointly defend every inch of NATO territory,"" the German chancellor said.

Nauseda said the deployment was a ""historic moment"" for the two countries and a ""landmark event for the security architecture of NATO and the whole of Europe.""

Merz said the ceremony was a sign of the ""solidarity"" and ""friendship"" between Berlin and Vilnius. The chancellor said he was ""all the more grateful"" given the ""suffering that Nazi Germany brought"" to Lithuania.

Two young men are on trial in the southern German city of Stuttgart, accused of making bomb threats against schools, authorities and religious communities throughout the country.

According to prosecutors, one 20-year-old defendant is alleged to have sent a total of 51 threatening emails in autumn 2023, while his 21-year-old accomplice is said to have encouraged him via the messenger service Discord.

They are charged with disturbing the public peace by threatening to commit criminal offenses. Bomb threats were made against schools, government offices, universities, and religious communities in eight of Germany's sixteen federal states.

In addition to the bomb threats, the prosecution accuses the older defendant of attempted incitement to murder for an incident that occurred two years ago, when he allegedly paid two people to kill someone. The murder was not carried out.

German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche defended the government's decision to drop its opposition to nuclear energy being deemed sustainable.

""Every ton of CO2 we can save is a good thing. We have to be open to technology here,"" Reiche told journalists in Brussels.

She noted that, in the European Union's taxonomy for sustainable economic activities, technologies that emit no or low levels of carbon dioxide should be prioritized.

The taxonomy lists areas in which investments can be made to combat climate change. Certain investments in gas or nuclear power plants are categorized as climate-friendly.

This has been the subject of fierce opposition by Germany's previous government, but the new leadership in Berlin under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz has embraced a different stance.

However, Reiche said  Germany has no plans to return to nuclear energy.

Half of Germans surveyed support taking consistent action against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified the party as right-wing ""extremist.""

The non-governmental organization Campact, which commissioned the survey, announced that 60% of eligible voters consider the AfD to be the greatest threat to democracy since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Half of eligible voters are in favor of banning the party at the federal level, while 41% oppose it, and 9% have no opinion, according to the survey.

However, a majority of respondents (54%) believe that a ban would be unsuccessful. Only a third believe that a ban would be successful.

The two victims of a shooting outside the Israeli embassy in Washington had been identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.

German diplomatic sources told Reuters that Lischinsky held German citizenship. According to the German-Israeli Society (DIG), he was originally from Germany and grew up partly in Bavaria. 

Lischinsky had been a founding member of the Israel-Germany Youth Forum and took a post at the Israeli embassy in Washington in 2022, the DIG said.

Israel's ambassador to the US said the two victims had been a couple.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned that Russia threatens European security.  ""There is a threat to us all from Russia,"" he told a press conference in Vilnius, adding: ""We are protecting ourselves against this threat — and that is why we are here today.""

Merz is visiting the Lithuanian capital to attend a ceremony to mark the official formation of Germany's first permanent overseas military deployment since World War II.

He also stressed that Germany and its partners are determined to defend NATO's territory.

""Together with our partners, we are determined to defend the alliance territory against any aggression. The security of our Baltic allies is also our security,"" Merz said.

Roughly 21.2 million people living in Germany in 2024 have a ""immigration history,"" according to figures published by the Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, on Thursday.

That means they either migrated to Germany themselves or were born to two people who moved to the country.

Overall, these people account for just over a quarter, or 25.6%, of the total population of about 83.6 million. It represented a one percentage point increase from the figure in 2023, Destatis said.

Of those with an immigration history, some 16.1 million people immigrated to the country themselves.

And 6.5 million people living in the country have migrated there since 2015, the agency said.   

People with a history of immigration are relatively younger compared to the overall population, with an average age of 38.2 years, nine years younger than that of those without an immigration history.

In the age group of 20-39 years, the proportion of people with a history of immigration was as high as 34%. Among the over 65s, it was just 14%.

Sentiment among German companies has improved again in May, with uncertainty easing and expectations brightening, the Ifo Institute reported Thursday.

The leading German economic institute's business climate index rose to 87.5 in May from 86.9 in April. While companies were slightly less satisfied with current conditions — down 0.3 points to 86.1 — expectations rose by 1.5 points to 88.9.

""The German economy is slowly regaining its footing,"" said Ifo President Clemens Fuest. He noted that the recent sharp rise in corporate uncertainty has declined.

In manufacturing, the index rose significantly. Companies revised their expectations noticeably upward and assessed their current situation as having improved.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has condemned the shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, calling it ""a despicable act.""

Posting on X, Merz said he condemned the attack ""in the strongest terms"" and added that ""at the moment we must assume there was an antisemitic motive.""

The head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany has said his heart was ""torn apart"" by the killings.

Council president Josef Schuster said the attack confirmed fears shared during a recent visit to Israel.

""Just one day later, this has been confirmed in the most tragic way,"" Schuster said. ""The rise in political and antisemitic violence, even in Western societies, is shocking and threatening.""

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is meeting the Danish minister of immigration and integration, Kaare Dybvad Bek, in Berlin.

Their talks will focus on migration policy at the national and European level, according to the Interior Ministry.

Shortly after taking office earlier this month, Dobrindt tightened Germany's migration policy, ordering tougher border checks at the country's borders and allowing officials to turn back undocumented migrants even if they apply for asylum.

The measures are part of the new German government's effort to curb irregular migration.

Bek has previously suggested that European nations including Germany could emulate his country's success in handling migration.

Denmark's social democratic government has pursued a tough course on migration for years.

While rights activists have criticized the approach, others have seen it as a model that succeeded in reducing the migrant influx.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius are traveling to Lithuania to take part in a ceremony to mark the official formation of a new armored brigade aimed at protecting NATO's eastern flank.

The new heavy combat unit, the 45th tank brigade, is also known as the ""Lithuania Brigade.""

It will consist of around 4,800 troops and 200 civilian Bundeswehr employees.

The brigade will be gradually deployed over the coming years and is expected to reach full operational capability by 2027.

It is Germany's first permanent overseas military unit since World War II.

The decision to form the brigade came in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The deployment is aimed at deterring potential Russian aggression towards Lithuania and fellow Baltic countries Estonia and Latvia.

Japan is a world leader in funding natural gas projects, while at the same time leading a forum in Asia calling for a fossil fuel phase-out. 

Japan is one of the world's biggest public financiers of gas and oil production, despite a pledge to halt all such funding for fossil fuel at the G7 summit in 2022.

From 2013 to 2024, Japanese public financial institutions provided $93 billion (€82 billion) worth of investments for oil and gas projects, according to a report from the South Korea-based Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). Overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development projects amounted to $56 billion worth of this financing.

In the same period, the report estimates $24.5 billion in funding was provided for clean energy projects.

""Japan's international influence in energy financing, and specifically fossil fuel financing, is enormous,"" Walter James, a private consultant focusing on Japan's climate and energy policies, told DW.

""It's really across the fossil fuel supply chain … all the way from exploration, production, transportation to actual use and power plants.""

In what the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a US-based research center, calls the ""Japanese model"" of LNG investment, decades of policy development by Japan to ""encourage direct overseas investment in LNG export projects,"" have turned Japan into the main driver of LNG development in the Asia Pacific.

A report by the IEEFA says that Japan benefits in two ways: By having more access to the LNG supply for its domestic energy needs, and improved access to ""demand centers where Japan can resell surplus LNG.""

""Japan's LNG resales to overseas markets have reached record highs, indicating a shift in its role within the global LNG market,"" from a consumer to an exporter, the IEEFA report says.

Another IEEFA report shows Australian LNG as the top source of supply for Japanese LNG shipments to third countries. 

At the same time, Japan depends on energy imports to fuel its economy, with little domestic access to fossil fuels. Oil, coal and LNG make up more than 83% of Japan's primary energy mix, according to data cited by the Asia Natural Gas and Energy Association.

After Japan's fossil fuel pledge at the 2022 G7 summit to halt financing fossil fuel projects, it launched the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) with partner countries in Asia to provide a platform for cooperation on ""net zero emissions in the Asia region.""

In August 2024, a total of 70 Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) were signed with 11 nations, including Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

However, many of the projects focus on developing natural gas, ammonia and carbon capture storage (CCS) technology.

LNG is deemed a ""transitional fuel"" for Japan's partner countries in AZEC.

A 2024 study from Cornell University, however, found that LNG involves 33% more emissions than coal, when processing and shipping are considered.

Loopholes in Japan's G7 pledge allow for investment in LNG projects, even though it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, according to Hiroki Osaka, development finance and environment campaigner at Friends of the Earth Japan, an NGO.

Osada said Tokyo's pledge was based on ""unabated fossil projects,"" so if countries decide the projects are ""abated"" like the ones with use of CCS, they can go ahead.

""Unabated"" refers to using fossil fuels without taking any measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as CCS. Abated fossil fuels, on the other hand, use measures to reduce emissions.

""It's a form of greenwashing,"" Osada told DW. ""Another loophole is that even if the projects are regarded as 'unabated,' if they say they align with the 1.5-degree energy plan [Paris Agreement] or are necessary for energy security and diplomacy, they are justified.""

Indonesia signed a deal in November 2022 to mobilize $20 billion in public and private finance for energy transition at the G20 summit, led by the US and Japan.

According to Osada, Japan ""helped write"" Indonesia's long-term energy plan ""so there would be a demand for gas.""

""There's a lot of renewable potential available and it's actually cheaper and more beneficial for the whole of Southeast Asia, while LNG is too costly and they can't import if there's a blackout,"" she said.

Natural gas in Indonesia costs more than renewables, according to the calculations from the Institute for Essential Services Reform, an Indonesian energy and environment policy research center.

Indonesia is also the world's largest coal exporter, and coal comprises over 40% of its energy consumption. To phase out coal and oil, Indonesia in March rolled out a $1.5 billion LNG distribution project to feed power plants.

However, Wicaksono Gitawon, policy strategist at the Indonesian NGO CERAH, told DW that more overseas investment in LNG would hamper Indonesia's future transition to renewable energy.

""I genuinely think Japan should skip investment in gas [in Indonesia] and push for renewables,"" Gitawon said.

""We already have a coal infrastructure locked in. They are now pushing for gas, and gas is a big investment, so it would be another lock-in. If we have a gas infrastructure in Indonesia, I don't think we would be able to achieve energy transition.""

Energy policy consultant James said that Japan is also meeting demand for technology and investment from countries like Indonesia.

""Indonesia came up with their own energy transition strategies and include things like natural gas and LNG, coal firing with ammonia and hydrogen — all the things Japan would love to sell and invest,"" he said.

The third AZEC meeting is slated to be held in Malaysia this September.

Unless you're very wealthy, this bill will ultimately leave you worse off and more economically vulnerable.

Unless you're very wealthy, this bill will ultimately leave you worse off and more economically vulnerable.

Early on Thursday, Republicans passed Donald Trump's “one big, beautiful bill” in the House of Representatives, with just two GOP defectors. The budget codifies trillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy, alongside hugely increased spending on immigration enforcement and the military, both by adding to the national debt and through slashing programs that aid tens of millions of low-income Americans. The Center for American Progress noted last week that, with somewhere in the region of $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (food stamps) over the next decade, “this would be the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in a single law in U.S. history.”

The budget, which seems likely to pass the Senate, contains the biggest ever cuts to Medicaid and to the SNAP program. As a result of these cuts, tens of millions of people will be impacted — as will states that depend on Medicaid dollars flowing in order to cover their poorer residents, and as will hospitals that need Medicaid funds in order to make ends meet. Ironically, some of the worst-hit areas will be in poor parts of red states, where rural hospitals often survive only because of their Medicaid dollars.

In poorer neighborhoods, the erosion of SNAP will mean much less money flowing through the local economy, as residents tighten their belts and spend less on food at neighborhood stores. For the first time in the program's history, the federal government will no longer ensure that children in all 50 states have access to food stamps.

The bill imposes strict time limits on food stamp access for working-age adults through the age of 65, as well as work requirements, and makes it harder for states or localities to secure waivers from that requirement during economic downturns. At the same time, it requires working-age adults to have jobs or do community service in order to access Medicaid — and it ramps up the frequency of eligibility checks, which health advocates believe will create a red tape burden that has the effect of deterring large numbers of people from accessing or retaining health care.

If these changes do indeed kick in, estimates are that a staggering 14 million Americans could lose their health coverage, returning the numbers of uninsured back up almost to pre-Affordable Care Act levels. The Urban Institute and other groups have estimated that somewhere in the region of  3 million families could be cut off from food stamps.

On health care, the budget contains one poison pill after the next — including penalizing states that have used their own dollars to expand Medicaid to cover undocumented immigrants and forbidding any reproductive health care organization from receiving Medicaid funds.

But the damage that this budget will do to poor Americans goes far beyond these two core parts of the safety net system. Pick pretty much any policy that has benefited low-income Americans in recent years, and this budget takes a chainsaw to it.

The bill will, for example, eliminate, in its entirety, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides subsidies to almost 6 million households so that they can stay warm in winter and cool in summer. This will, in effect, reduce poor families' incomes in many states by thousands of dollars per year.

It will jack up the repayment expenses for student loans, and will eliminate the ability of borrowers to temporarily pause repayments in the face of economic hardship or unemployment. It will end the program that subsidizes student loans for students who are still in college — meaning that, if it passes, beginning next year these borrowers will have to pay interest on their debt even while still enrolled in classes. And it will restrict access to the Pell Grant by requiring students to be enrolled in more classes to qualify than is currently the case. Estimates by advocacy groups suggest many student loan borrowers could see their monthly payments soar by hundreds of dollars.

The bill makes it harder for kids to access free school meals and summer EBT cards to tide them and their families over during the school holidays.

It tightens up eligibility for the child tax credit, with the result that 4.5 million fewer children will qualify for this benefit. It guts clean energy programs, eliminates most tax credits for low-emission energy sources and ends tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles. Given that the impacts of climate change fall disproportionately on poorer people, all of these cuts will have a particularly harmful impact on low-income Americans.

Go down the list, and the consequences of this budget for the poor are devastating. Sure, there are gimmicks — such as ending taxes on tips, and giving tax breaks for the interest paid on car loans — that will put a bit more cash in the pocket of the poor and income-insecure. But these small plusses will be more than cancelled out by all the losses that this legislation stacks up against poor people — and also people higher up the income chain. In fact, unless you're a very wealthy American, this is a bill that will ultimately leave you and your community worse off and far more vulnerable to shifts in the economic winds.

Taken as a whole, this budget is an assault on the well-being of low-income Americans that has virtually no precedent in U.S. history.

In 1909, the British Parliament ushered in that country's age of the social safety net with what the liberal government grandiosely termed a “people's budget,” intended to “wage implacable warfare against poverty and squalidness.” One hundred and sixteen years later, Congress is poised to pass what might be termed the U.S.'s “oligarch's budget,” one that wages implacable warfare not against the conditions that generate poverty but against the poor themselves. And for what? Not for any high ideals or noble causes. Not for some grand cultural renaissance or vital public project. No. This budget is one great gift bag, wrapped in a pretty bow, for U.S. oligarchs, for its old military-industrial complex, and for its new immigrant-hunters.

My lived experience of Chile under Pinochet's dictatorship drives my opposition to the current US crackdown on dissent.

My lived experience of Chile under Pinochet's dictatorship drives my opposition to the current US crackdown on dissent.

On May 13, UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher delivered a harrowing account of the genocide in Gaza. Before he started, he asked the audience “to reflect for a moment on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza.”

As has been the case before, students across the world are leading the way. For over a year, from California to New York, college students have resorted to different forms of protest — encampments, walkouts, calls to sanction, boycott and divest, even hunger strikes — to condemn Israel's genocide in Gaza and rightly express their anger and horror in the face of these human rights violations. Encampments, walkouts, boycott campaigns and hunger strikes — these are all popular nonviolent protest tactics that civil society has used before.

I was born in Chile during Augusto Pinochet's infamous civic-military dictatorship. I have written elsewhere about the inventive practices Chilean civil society conceived to denounce the dictatorship's forced disappearances, acts of torture, and other human rights violations. One strategy devised in the late 1970s by the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared to make their plight more visible was to chain themselves to the fences of prominent institutional buildings in downtown Santiago (the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean headquarters building, the Courts of Justice, and others) with photographs of their beloved ones pinned to their chests. Chained, they shouted, chanted and posed for the cameras — freelance photojournalists were always alerted about these planned actions. I thought about this last month, when I read that a group of Jewish students had chained themselves to the fence of Columbia University to protest the illegal arrest of graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on March 8, right outside his university housing.

On May 8, City University of New York (CUNY) students and members of the CUNY community staged a demonstration at Brooklyn College to protest against the genocide in Gaza, which has been ongoing for over 600 days now and where, according to reports by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification System, over 71,000 children below the age of 5 are experiencing acute malnutrition, half a million people are being starved to death and the whole population is on the brink of famine. As part of the demonstration, students erected an encampment on the East Quad of the campus.

I did not personally witness what happened at Brooklyn College, but in the last few days, I have viewed dozens of videos and photographs, read written accounts by participants in the encampment and talked to colleagues who were present that day and witnessed the police repression in the evening. I also read an email that Brooklyn College President Michelle J. Anderson sent to the Brooklyn College community on May 9. As a CUNY worker and tenured faculty, I feel compelled to respond to the draconian measures the CUNY administration has adopted to suppress our students' constitutional rights in this moment.

In her May 9 letter, President Anderson indicates that CUNY “has a zero-tolerance policy for encampments” and quotes the Brooklyn College Events Protocol, which states, “semi-permanent, or permanent structures – such as stages, booths, canopies, tents, bouncy houses or other party rentals, or any constructions – are prohibited unless an organization obtains explicit permission.” She then adds, “protesters here had no permission to erect tents on the East Quad.” This same argument was rehearsed by college administrators to justify the violent clearing of students' Gaza solidarity encampments a year ago.

This kind of reasoning raises the question: What are the costs, the material consequences for our students, of so-called “zero-tolerance policies”? Last spring, fellow colleagues argued that the prosecution of the CUNY community members who participated in the City College (CCNY) Gaza solidarity encampment last spring could set a dangerous “legal precedent for prosecuting pro-Palestinian activism across the U.S.” Given the current context, when immigration laws are being weaponized and a simple arrest can lead to being caged indefinitely, and even deported with no due process, the criminalization of college encampments becomes even more dangerous.

The last thing we need is for universities to become the police force or the armed extension of an administration that does not seem concerned with hiding its authoritarian and fascist traits.

The “Henderson Rules” are a body of university regulations adopted by the CUNY Board of Trustees in 1969, partly in response to the students protests at CCNY, and they have been amended twice since then. The first two paragraphs mention the word “sanctuary” repeatedly to describe the university as a space where academic freedom has been traditionally honored and vigilantly guarded. Henderson Rules also state that this principle “cannot be invoked by those who would subordinate intellectual freedom to political ends, or who violate the norms of conduct established to protect that freedom.”

“Sanctuary” is a capacious concept, an aspirational principle that even today “remains unbounded by a legal definition,” as author A. Naomi Paik suggests in Bans, Walls, Raids, Sanctuary. This means, among other things, that sanctuary is not a given; it must be enacted and practiced. One of the principles of sanctuary is “do no harm.” I wonder, then, who inflicted harm on whom on May 8? I do not think we can say CUNY is a sanctuary of academic freedom if college administrators think it is justified to call on agents of the NYPD Strategic Response Group to violently crash a student-led protest comprising a few tents, Palestinian flags, posters and chants denouncing a heinous genocide. While watching a video of a protestor holding a Palestinian flag being punched in the face and shoved to the ground by several agents, I wondered, who is subordinating intellectual freedom to political ends here? Who is violating the norms of conduct?

In the past few months, activists, scholars and media outlets have been drawing parallels between the forced disappearances carried out by civic-military dictatorships in Latin America during the ‘70s and ‘80s and the kidnappings and deportations ICE is carrying out under the current Trump administration. This is not the only parallel to be drawn. As some readers may know, under Pinochet's dictatorship, the armed forces took control of all universities — military officials were appointed rectors and university administrators; university faculty and staff were suspended or dismissed; and scores of students were expelled, kidnapped, tortured, and, in some cases, disappeared or executed. This is a cautionary tale. The last thing we need is for universities to become the police force or the armed extension of an administration that does not seem concerned with hiding its authoritarian and fascist traits.

After the Trump administration stated that it would ignore the sanctuary status of sensitive locations (including hospitals, houses of worship, courts, schools and universities), workers organized to demand that their administrators put clear procedures in place to prevent ICE agents from entering buildings and sensitive premises without judicial warrants. I was involved in the efforts to make sure my campus adopted such measures. But, of course, this is not enough. Pledges to not let ICE agents inside a college campus mean nothing if the next minute the police can be called onto campus to suppress students demonstrating.

In this moment, what we need is a sanctuary university that is willing to defend its community members' constitutional rights, including their right to free assembly. A sanctuary university that is ready to protect them against any authoritarian measure, not a university that exposes its students to more danger by enabling the presence of immigration enforcement agents or local police on campus, as happened at Brooklyn College.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

For more than five years, Chinese vessels operating in the South China Sea have repeatedly collided with Philippine ships, sometimes dousing them with water cannons and injuring personnel. In response, the United States deployed a Typhon intermediate-range missile system to the island country last year. It was the first time since the end of the Cold War that the United States had supplied an ally with a weapon of such magnitude—and it kicked off a diplomatic storm. China's foreign ministry argued that the installation “disrupts regional peace and stability, undermines other countries' legitimate security interest, and contravenes people's aspiration for peace and development.” China, the ministry continued, would “not sit idly by” if the Philippines refused to remove it.

Beijing's actions and threats against the Philippines are part of a broader attempt to counter the United States' policy of “extended deterrence,” a strategy that commits Washington to defending its allies against aggression, including, in certain cases, with U.S. nuclear weapons. Beijing has long been critical of U.S. extended deterrence, on the grounds that it is a way for the United States to advance its interests against China. Chinese officials are now ramping up their efforts to undermine it. They have portrayed the United States as a destabilizing force in the region, made attempts to peel off U.S. allies using economic enticements and penalties, and engaged in ever more confrontational military operations. Such acts are intended to sap the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence, which is predicated on trust in Washington and faith in the United States' capabilities.

For the Trump administration, maintaining extended deterrence in the Indo-Pacific should be a priority. It should challenge Beijing's rhetoric in diplomatic forums and counter Chinese gray-zone tactics, as well as strengthen military cooperation with regional allies. Otherwise, Washington's power and influence in the region will soon be eclipsed.

For Chinese leaders, U.S. extended deterrence is not a defensive strategy but part of a broader effort by the United States to contain and even roll back China's rise. Beijing also dismisses the idea that extended deterrence exists because U.S. allies want it. Rather, Chinese officials see Washington's strategy as an imposition on Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others that, in Beijing's view, belong in China's rightful sphere of influence.

American officials have long argued that U.S. extended deterrence keeps nuclear proliferation in check, because U.S. allies under the protection of the United States' nuclear umbrella see no need to develop their stockpiles. That logic does not hold sway in Beijing. In the words of Guo Xiaobing, a scholar at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, “The concept of ‘extended deterrence' itself is a major contributor to nuclear proliferation” since it spreads “nuclear weapons geographically.” China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs echoes this perspective, accusing the United States of having “double standards” on nonproliferation because it “exerts maximum pressure on so-called geopolitical adversaries” but also “strengthens nuclear sharing and extended deterrence arrangements” with its allies.

In diplomatic forums, Beijing has long sought to undermine U.S. extended deterrence by castigating the United States as a destabilizing force in the region. In a speech in 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled his displeasure with the United States playing the role of security guarantor. “It is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia, and uphold the security of Asia,” Xi said. “The people of Asia have the capability and wisdom to achieve peace and stability in the region through enhanced cooperation.”

China has also attacked U.S. extended deterrence directly. Last year, Beijing called on all parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to adopt a no-first-use policy and used the proposal to attack extended deterrence, arguing that it is a threat to peace, contributes to nuclear proliferation, and prevents the establishment of nuclear-free zones. According to this view, there is no place for U.S. alliances in the region. As Beijing sees it, if the United States did not maintain such a large military presence in the Indo-Pacific, there would be fewer crises to manage. Hence, the way to prevent and mitigate crises in the area is for the United States to withdraw its forces—or to constrain their use considerably.

Beyond challenging U.S. alliances and extended deterrence in diplomatic forums, Beijing takes economic actions to weaken Washington's regional role. It does so using both carrots and sticks. Before it began menacing Philippine ships at sea, Beijing had tried, in vain, to forestall deeper military cooperation between the Philippines and the United States by offering substantial infrastructure projects and economic incentives through its Belt and Road Initiative.



In 2016, after the United States stationed a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, Beijing banned Chinese group tours to South Korea, blacklisted South Korean celebrities so they could not appear on Chinese television programs, imposed restrictions on South Korean businesses in China, and excluded South Korea from a number of Chinese-led diplomatic and cultural initiatives. Similarly, after Australia began strengthening defense ties with the United States in the late 2010s, Beijing imposed restrictions on Australian exports.

Beijing's military responses to U.S. extended deterrence have also become more assertive. In recent years, China has scaled up its use of gray-zone tactics against U.S. allies in many areas, but especially in the maritime and cyber domains, where there is no clear redline that would trigger a response from the United States. Beijing has gradually militarized the South China Sea, deploying the Chinese coast guard and maritime militia to harass U.S. allies' vessels. Beijing has also orchestrated influence operations and cyber-campaigns against Taiwan and other American allies. Chinese hackers have also targeted U.S. critical infrastructure to demonstrate Beijing's ability to disrupt essential services and deter American involvement in regional conflicts.

For years, China has patrolled and conducted military drills in contested waters, and it has increased the scale and scope of those drills significantly. Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, has called such exercises “rehearsals” because they simulate attacks on U.S. allies, such as an invasion of Taiwan. In 2024 and 2025, for example, China conducted large-scale exercises (Joint Sword-2024A and Joint Sword-2024B) that involved coordinated operations by the Chinese navy, air force, rocket force, and coast guard around Taiwan. Earlier this year, Beijing also ramped up military incursions into Taiwan's airspace and waters.

Finally, Beijing is building up its military forces to allow for quick action, such as the seizure and control of territory close to China, and to make it prohibitively costly for the United States to intervene. At the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2017, Xi announced that China is committed to building “world-class military forces” by 2049. Since then, Beijing has made significant investments in conventional and nuclear weapons. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, China has the world's most active and diverse ballistic missile development program and is currently pursuing a nuclear buildup. Beijing is also enhancing its capabilities in cyberspace, outer space, and electronic warfare.

Taken together, these steps are meant to make the United States hesitate to act in the event of a contingency—and to cast doubts in the minds of U.S. allies that Washington will abide by its defense commitments.

China is hardly alone in pushing back against U.S. extended deterrence. Russia has long been critical of this strategy, and as of late, the two countries have joined forces to counter it. At a summit in Beijing in early 2022, just two weeks before Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a “friendship without limits.” In that spirit, Beijing and Moscow have promoted “global strategic stability,” calling for a more multipolar world and chastising the United States for its pursuit of “absolute security.” They have criticized the security arrangement among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS) as one of the latest efforts to militarize the Indo-Pacific, and they have expressed alarm at U.S. plans to deploy more intermediate-range missiles in their respective regions.

Beijing and Moscow are also strengthening their military cooperation, conducting numerous joint military exercises and joint air and maritime patrols in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic, including near the territories of U.S. allies such as Japan and the Scandinavian countries. Moreover, according to a 2024 Reuters investigation, Moscow has established a covert program in China to develop long-range attack drones. The Russians are also assisting Beijing in developing a missile early warning system.

Since the first decades of this century, successive U.S. administrations have taken important measures to adapt to China's evolving approach. The Biden administration has done much to strengthen regional alliances and its spearheading of the AUKUS security partnership has also helped promote stability in the region. The Trump administration appears committed to continuing the same trajectory and further strengthening regional defense and deterrence. To do so effectively, it should take further action across several additional fronts.



In diplomatic forums, Washington should step up its efforts to challenge Chinese rhetoric about the United States' role in the Indo-Pacific and the aim of U.S. extended deterrence. Chinese officials have portrayed the United States as a destabilizing force in the region, if not an existential threat to China. Speaking at the 2022 Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's largest annual defense summit, Wei Fenghe, then China's defense minister, called the United States a “bully” and accused Washington of “interference” in territorial disputes in the region. “Some people in the U.S. try to suppress China on all fronts,” he said. To regain control of the narrative, American officials should set the record straight on the goals of extended deterrence and nuclear sharing. Washington should also call greater attention to China's increasingly aggressive measures against U.S. allies, as well as to Beijing's nuclear buildup.

Additionally, the United States should increase its efforts to counter Chinese gray-zone tactics. In recent years, Washington and its allies have enhanced intelligence collaboration, and they have countered disinformation and cyberattacks. They should further strengthen policy and operational coordination and enhance resilience in vulnerable regions, such as Southeast Asia and the Pacific. To counter Chinese disinformation campaigns, Washington and its allies should better integrate their economic tools, such as export controls and sanctions. In the absence of severe consequences, Beijing will continue and even intensify its coercive actions.

Crucially, the United States and its allies should develop military concepts and capabilities allowing them to respond to aggression quickly and effectively. In other words, they should make every effort to be able to deny territory grabs by China. They should be prepared to fight and win a conflict with Beijing, if necessary, despite the increasingly long nuclear shadow that China casts over the region. They should, in turn, consider how they can best leverage their collective military might, including nuclear weapons, against China.

Finally, Washington and its allies should expect Beijing and Moscow to strengthen security ties in the years ahead. The relationship between China and Russia has significant implications for both the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic. As both ratchet up their defense cooperation, the United States and its allies from these regions must likewise deepen their security cooperation. Failure to do so could prove fatal to U.S. extended deterrence, with far-reaching consequences for U.S. power and influence.

The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act was the United States' most ambitious foray into industrial policy in more than half a century. The bill included roughly $50 billion to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry, which had been hollowed out over decades as manufacturing migrated overseas. Industrial policy, long eschewed in policy circles, had come back in vogue as a way to strengthen supply chain resilience for industries critical to economic and national security. Moving the legislation through Congress required a multiyear process that involved lengthy negotiations and complex maneuvering. But passing the law was just the beginning. As soon as it was signed, the action moved from Congress to the Department of Commerce, which had to figure out, quickly and with little room for error, how to stand up a new office and infrastructure to deliver on its aims.

Washington was out of practice when it came to industrial policy, which the United States had largely abandoned since the Cold War. So there was no playbook available to the new CHIPS Program Office, which was established to administer the bill's $39 billion in semiconductor manufacturing incentives (another $11 billion or so was for semiconductor-related research and development). Where possible, the office drew lessons from past large-scale grant and loan initiatives, such as the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program; the 2009 Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, which bailed out automakers; and the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, which has financed more than $40 billion in clean energy and advanced transportation projects. But much of the time, the program was building the plane as it flew.

It's too early to pass a final judgment on how well it did: the semiconductor industry is fast-moving and cyclical, and many projects are just getting underway. But the program has made real progress. In two and a half years, it has unlocked more than $450 billion in private investments, helped support the construction of 17 new semiconductor fabrication plants (known as fabs), and made the United States the only country to secure manufacturing commitments from the world's five leading chip manufacturers. When the CHIPS Act was passed, the United States produced none of the most advanced logic or memory chips, the hardware used in smartphones, laptops, and powerful AI systems; it is now projected to produce 20 percent of the world's leading-edge logic chips by 2030 and ten percent of its dynamic random-access memory chips by 2035.

CHIPS set itself up for success in part thanks to clever statutory drafting and early choices on hiring, goal setting, and structure. Amid bipartisan consensus to expand industrial strategy beyond CHIPS, future programs would do well to learn from its example. Of course, there is no one way to do industrial policy, and the details will vary by sector and circumstance, but one constant is that large federal programs require the government to work quickly, efficiently, and well. That requires establishing nimble and dynamic teams with sophisticated expertise; building productive and transparent relationships with industry, other governments, and the general public; and figuring out how to overcome sources of delay—within government and outside it—that make it hard to build new things. Most important, industrial policy requires clarity of purpose: a concrete set of specific objectives to guide investments and against which to measure success.

The first days of any new program are when the most critical decisions are made. For CHIPS, having a director that did not require Senate confirmation was an early advantage, since it meant that Michael Schmidt—whom Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo tapped to head the office—was able to get working right away. Requiring a Senate-confirmed leader for an industrial policy program would, in most cases, be a mistake: confirmation takes a long time and can dissuade people from taking on the role. During the Biden administration, confirmations took an average of 192 days from official submission—nearly three times as long as they took under President Ronald Reagan. That is time an industrial policy program cannot afford to waste.

Most government programs take months to get off the ground. In its first few months, however, the CHIPS team released its first funding opportunity for commercial chip fabs, published an investments strategy paper, and hired dozens of staff across investments, strategy, legal, and external affairs. Raimondo also appointed a chief investment officer with private-sector investment experience and credibility with large industry players to work with Schmidt. Hiring from the private sector was essential for an industrial policy program intended to go toe to toe with some of the biggest, most sophisticated companies in the world. At the same time, the point of industrial policy is to meet economic and national security objectives, not just earn market returns. So the CHIPS team also needed staff that could evaluate deals based not just on financial terms but also by judging whether they would improve supply chain resilience, meet the needs of the defense industrial base, and strengthen cybersecurity.



Hiring for these roles is easier said than done. By broad consensus, federal hiring is a mess. In 2024, it took the government more than 100 days, on average, to hire new employees. But even that number understates the problem because it includes various forms of expedited hiring that are often not possible. Typical government hiring, through competitive public job announcements, takes significantly longer. What's more, federal offices responsible for screening résumés rarely have the financial and technical expertise to evaluate applicants for specialized jobs and tend to review résumés more for consistency with the wording of the job announcement than for the substantive qualifications needed for the role. That's one reason that, according to Jennifer Pahlka, who helped found the U.S. Digital Service, roughly half of all competitive federal job announcements fail, resulting in no hire.

The Office of Personnel Management, the independent agency that oversees the federal workforce, should systematically overhaul and improve government hiring. But in the meantime, high-priority programs need to be creative to get good people in the door quickly. For CHIPS, bureau heads in the Commerce Department temporarily loaned staff to get the nascent office off the ground. To build up its full-time staff, meanwhile, the CHIPS Office sought permission from the OPM to use two expedited hiring authorities that were critical to the program's success: direct hiring, which bypasses most HR screenings, and excepted service hiring, which allows managers to hire without HR involvement. CHIPS hired more than 150 people using expedited authorities. The CHIPS Act itself also included a special hiring pathway, allowing the program to recruit its most senior staff quickly and pay them above-standard government rates.

For industrial policy to work well, recruiting is essential. The government needs to draw sharp minds from finance, industry, and other federal agencies. For workers in the private sector, a federal job means much lower pay; it might also mean long commutes or relocation to Washington. During the early months of the CHIPS program, CHIPS relied on personal outreach from Raimondo and from office leadership. Their pitches were simple: get in on the ground floor of a once-in-a-generation experiment in industrial policy. When the ask was made directly, most people said yes.

Equally important to staffing is developing an investment strategy—figuring out what, exactly, the United States is buying with its congressional funding. This strategy should be clear, provide concrete goals and metrics, and be accessible to the public so that Americans can judge whether the program is succeeding on its own terms and whether those terms are the right ones. Such a strategy, although hardly unique to industrial policy, is critical for a program's operational and political success. Not every worthy project can receive funding. By specifying clear criteria by which applications for funding would be evaluated and by publishing a vision of success that set specific production objectives across the semiconductor industry, the CHIPS office could manage expectations for stakeholders both within and outside government.

Importantly, the vision for success served as a guide to actual investment decisions. CHIPS tasked teams to evaluate how every potential deal would advance the program's aims. In working on individual deals, however, it's easy to get caught up in negotiations with specific companies over minute details and lose sight of the bigger picture. To offset that effect, the office also established an investment committee, composed of CHIPS leadership and a few outside experts, whose job was to recommend deals to a committee of senior Commerce Department leaders based on a portfolio-level view of the office's investments. To manage industry expectations and ensure that there was enough money for a broad array of projects, CHIPS made clear that successful applicants would generally receive grants worth no more than 15 percent of a project's capital expenditures.

A successful industrial policy also must incorporate foreign, state, and local governments. Foreign governments matter because modern goods have complex global supply chains and are sold into global markets. Industrial policy is not about onshoring all production to the United States. Even had that been the goal for CHIPS, $39 billion would not have been enough. Instead, industrial policy should identify which components must be made in the United States and work with friendly partners to create robust and resilient global supply chains for those that cannot be. For CHIPS, those partners included Costa Rica, Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Taiwan, many of which had their own chip subsidy programs. To avoid duplicative efforts and to prevent companies from playing countries off each other in search of the highest award, CHIPS hired an international team responsible for monitoring global subsidies, developing a global strategy, and working with the White House and State Department to communicate or reinforce specific requests of foreign partners. CHIPS also developed close relationships with state and local governments, which provided their own subsidies in addition to controlling site selection and various permitting levers.

The same political will that drove the passage of CHIPS—and which may drive future industrial policy bills—also created a demand for fast results. But government processes rarely move quickly, and there are lots of opportunities for outside players—other agencies, courts, and Congress—to slow momentum. 

Government differs from the private sector in the sheer number of actors that can impede progress. To be sure, officials outside an industrial policy program—in a legislative affairs office, on a communications team, or at the National Security Council—can spot gaps or missing priorities. But although many of them know the importance of their functions, few are able to trade off between them—to decide, for example, when a national security imperative outweighs a labor concern, or vice versa. Resolving such disagreements can slow things down. CHIPS was largely able to avoid such delays thanks to a statute that granted substantial discretion to Commerce and a funding process that gave the CHIPS office the flexibility to make policy tradeoffs during negotiations.

Other programs may not be so lucky. It could help for them to have a full-time coordinator at the White House, as CHIPS did, tasked with moving the program forward and resolving conflicts before they resulted in significant delay. A White House coordinator can also help ensure a comprehensive approach to industrial policy that aligns funding with other tools, such as export controls, tariffs, and government procurement.



Courts can serve as another source of delay. In theory, nearly any program decision can eventually be litigated in court, and even if no suit is ultimately filed, processes are designed in the shadow of potential litigation. Consider the National Environmental Policy Act, a law that requires the federal government to evaluate possible environmental impacts of proposed action. NEPA reviews come on top of ordinary permitting requirements and apply only to federal projects. Although well intentioned, such reviews can take years, and if an opponent of the project sues, even longer. The original version of CHIPS required NEPA reviews for CHIPS projects; to comply, the office built an environmental team and published a 200-page programmatic environmental assessment. This strategy would have sped up reviews, but it would still have been vulnerable to lawsuits and considerable delay. In the end, two years after passing the CHIPS Act, Congress exempted most CHIPS projects from NEPA, easing this burden. But including a NEPA waiver in the initial law, and broadening it to cover all projects, would have saved a lot of time and effort. 

Congress can also act as a source of friction. Ideally, the statute that creates any new program will include sufficient money and authorities to achieve its goals, but that is not always the case. Asking Congress to address an urgent need can take months or even years, as was the case for the NEPA exemption for CHIPS projects. Careful legislative drafting—including waivers of other laws when necessary—can make a big difference. Appropriating the entire budget of the program up front can help a program make long-term plans without worrying about political disruptions.

Finally, state and local governments can create permitting bottlenecks, which lead to years of delay. States want to win big projects, however, so the best approach to such obstacles is to set up a competitive dynamic among them. CHIPS, for its part, explicitly rated applications based on how quickly they could be constructed, including permit timelines. This created incentives for interested states to strengthen their processes and adopt reforms, such as creating fast tracks and a single permitting point of contact for a project. CHIPS also engaged early and often with local governments to break through logjams when they arose.

When making difficult decisions, the U.S. government often justifies outcomes by reference to a scrupulously fair, diligent, and transparent process. Such processes often lead to the right outcomes, and strictly following them can help protect ambitious government programs from legal consequences and reputational harm when some investments inevitably fail. But they can also be inflexible, counterproductive, and time-consuming. A successful program thus hews to standard rules where appropriate but seeks workarounds where necessary.

Take, for example, the rules governing federal grants. The rules run 180 pages long with 12 appendices, and it can be difficult to parse what is mandatory and what is merely standard practice. Because many of these rules are ill suited to ambitious industrial policy, Commerce appealed to Congress to include in the bill a special exemption from grant rules known as “other transaction authority.” A typical government grant simply reimburses applicants for the cost of their activities, which means that negotiations over cost are limited if they happen at all. But CHIPS wanted to have holistic negotiations with companies over how many and what kind of fabs companies would build and how much funding the government would provide—an iterative process that was critical to ensuring projects met ambitious economic and national security goals. Unlike the traditional government grants process, in which applicants set project scope, most CHIPS negotiations involved pushing applicants to build more, which paid off handsomely when companies such as TSMC agreed to construct additional fabs in the United States.

Another source of procedural delay are statutes such as the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires two separate comment periods to evaluate the necessity and burden of providing information to the public, making it difficult to quickly announce funding opportunities. Procurement laws, meanwhile, can require months-long competitions among potential bidders before a program can purchase outside services. A critical job for early staff is to identify and, to the extent possible, work around such obstacles by leveraging statutory exceptions and other available “fast track” procedures.

Finally, designing an industrial policy involves difficult tradeoffs between speed and nuance. One example is the complex process the CHIPS office designed to determine grant subsidies, which included calculating the rate of return for proposed projects. To avoid wasting taxpayer dollars, CHIPS deal teams sought to bring the rate of return for CHIPS projects close to the company's standard rate of return. But rate of return is a difficult number to model, and small changes in assumptions can lead to big changes in the result. A simpler approach might have opened negotiations over grant size at a fixed percentage of total costs, avoiding drawn-out debates over model assumptions. Such an approach, however, would have been less accurate and might have resulted in overpaying companies that could have executed projects with less government money. CHIPS calculated that a more involved process was worth it for larger fab projects, particularly to signal to the biggest companies that the team was ready for serious, financially sophisticated negotiations. When it came to designing a funding process for semiconductor suppliers, which are smaller and sometimes less well-resourced than other program applicants and for which long negotiations are impractical, CHIPS followed the simpler approach, fixing most awards at ten percent of the project's capital expenditures.

CHIPS was not without its critics. The program faced early pushback, for example, for embodying “everything-bagel liberalism”—an attempt to shoehorn too many social and economic goals into a national security program. When the first funding opportunity was published in February 2023, critics took issue with language that encouraged labor agreements and required applicants requesting more than $150 million to submit a plan to provide childcare to their workforce. There were no signs that the language deterred companies from participating, and many companies spoke publicly about the need for affordable childcare options to meet workforce demands. But the blowback sapped some of the bipartisan support for the program, and the Trump administration has resurfaced some of the criticisms. This is not to say industrial policy programs should never include additional policy requirements, but these should always be in service of the overall goal: onshoring sufficient production capacity for technologies critical to economic and national security.

In addition, getting early design choices right does not inoculate a program against issues down the line. This is especially true for programs, such as CHIPS, that target a cyclical and sometimes unpredictable industry. When Intel's stock took a nosedive in 2024, for example, the CHIPS team had to scramble to finalize a deal with the company to secure important projects while safeguarding taxpayer money in the event of the company's collapse. NEPA delays remain a concern for projects that were not exempted from its reviews. And some external statutory requirements, such as retroactive prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act, have slowed and complicated funding negotiations.

Doing industrial policy well is not easy. It requires scaling up production quickly and carving out a place in government that can act like a private-sector startup by staffing up, implementing new processes, and finding creative ways to avoid delays. The U.S. government, bogged down by rules and bureaucracy, is not the ideal home for a startup. But with the right playbook, it can become a more hospitable one. As CHIPS demonstrated, policymakers need to make government an attractive place to work for people from finance and industry, identify and mitigate sources of delay, and measure success against clear and definable metrics. At the same time, policymakers should push for structural reforms to make government work better. Under the best of circumstances, industrial policy is an uphill battle. Making smart early decisions can make the climb a little easier.

Donald Trump just finished his first tour of the Middle East since returning to the White House. The region has changed a lot since he was last there as president. There's been Hamas's attack on Israel, the ensuing Israeli retaliation, the weakening of Iran and its proxies, and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Trump used the visit to announce flashy deals with Gulf leaders and to commit to lifting sanctions on Syria. But with big questions remaining about Gaza and about nuclear negotiations with Iran, the future of the region and the U.S. role in it remain unsettled.

In a recent essay for Foreign Affairs, Dana Stroul argues that a new regional order could emerge from the recent upheaval—but only if Washington takes the lead in what will undoubtedly be an intricate political process. Stroul is director of research and the Shelly and Michael Kassen senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. During the Biden administration, she served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, witnessing firsthand how quickly new regional power dynamics can take shape—and how quickly they can unravel.

Stroul spoke with Dan Kurtz-Phelan on May 20 to discuss the prospect of a new Iranian nuclear deal, the future of Israeli policy in Gaza, and what Trump's recent moves herald for the new Middle East.

            In the spring of 2020, America faced a once-in-a-century health crisis that crashed the economy and threatened the lives of millions. Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a forceful, and expensive, emergency response that helped prevent permanent scarring to the economy.
    


            Today, America's mountain of debt is casting a shadow over Washington's financial capability to respond to the next emergency, whatever it might be.
    


            In a future crisis, Congress may not have as much firepower to come to the rescue because the government is already saddled with $36 trillion of debt.
    


            The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” would pile another $3.8 trillion to that mountain of debt. That kind of extra borrowing would only amplify growing concerns about America's unsustainable financial trajectory.
    


            “The US is heading in the wrong direction. This bill would be one more nail in the coffin of a country falling under an enormous debt burden,” said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund.
    


            The federal government hit a telling milestone last fiscal year: For the first time ever, interest payments on the national debt exceeded the entire defense budget. Spending on interest has more than tripled since 2017.

            “There's an argument that no great power can remain a great power if it spends more on interest than defense,” said Hooper.
    


            While budget fights and deficit worries may seem arcane, there are real-world implications for what happens next.
    


            First, there's a risk that sky-high deficits will make it harder, and more expensive, for the federal government to come to the rescue in the next crisis, whether that's a health emergency, a financial meltdown, a war or something else.
    


            Consider that US debt-to-GDP, a closely watched gauge of a nation's leverage, stood at around 62% before the Great Recession began in 2007. Today it stands above 120% and is on track to continue growing.
    


            The more leveraged that investors believe the federal government to be, the more they will likely demand in compensation in the form of higher interest rates. And that has significant consequences.
    


            Many Americans will feel the impact of these higher rates — including in their cost of living.
    


            That's because US Treasuries serve as a critical benchmark that influences the cost of other forms of credit.
    


            The higher Treasury rates go, the more expensive it will be to get a mortgage and achieve the American dream of homeownership.
    


            For homeowners, higher rates mean more expensive home equity loans to upgrade, repair and improve the value of their existing homes.
    


            The same is true for people who want to take out a car loan or pay down credit card debt.
    


            “The reason everyday Americans should care about fiscal sustainability is this is a long-running cost of living issue,” said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a former economist in the Biden White House.
    


            Higher rates will also make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money to expand and hire workers. That means fewer jobs and lower wages for Americans.
    


            The other issue is that every $1 billion the federal government must pay on interest is $1 billion that could be going towards something most Americans care about, like education or fixing roads and bridges.
    


            Simply put, the more the government spends on interest, the less it has to invest in more productive uses.
    


            And, in the long run, economists say that will translate to a weaker economy and a lower standard of living.
    


            Not only that, but higher rates to service America's mountain of debt would likely weigh on the stock market. That's in part because boring government bonds would make stocks look more expensive in comparison.
    


            A weaker stock market makes it harder for Americans to build a nest egg for retirement, to save for their kids' college or have a rainy day fund for a financial emergency.
    


            Higher mortgage rates would similarly keep a lid on home values, hurting a key source of wealth for many families.
    


            There's also the risk that, at some point, there would be a full-blown debt crisis in America where the debt load is so high that investors throw their hands up and say no more.
    


            Washington got a glimpse of what that might look like earlier this year when the so-called bond vigilantes revolted over Trump's sky-high tariff hikes, sending yields surging. Fears of a bond market catastrophe helped convince Trump to back down.

            “We don't want to live through a Greece- or Portugal-style meltdown. We're not close to that but we don't even want to play with that,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute.
    


            Concerns about the fiscal situation sparked a market sell-off on Wednesday. Investors demanded higher rates on US debt in a 20-year Treasury auction. That weak auction drove down US stocks, bonds and the dollar.
    


            Treasury rates climbed even higher on Thursday after the House passed the bill. That, in turn, drove down US stock futures.
    


            Holtz-Eakin, an economic adviser to President George W. Bush and former director of the CBO, said Congress must act because allowing the 2017 Trump tax cuts to expire would amount to a major tax hike that would hurt the US economy.
    


            Yet Holtz-Eakin said there is a way to do that without further adding to the deficit.
    


            “They're going to make things worse than current policy. This is a bad outcome,” he said.
    


            The White House has argued the sweeping legislation will essentially pay for itself by turbocharging growth and boosting wages.
    


            However, the House GOP bill would only slightly boost the US economy, adding 0.5% to gross domestic product over 10 years, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. And yet the package would add an estimated $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, the analysis found.
    


            Notably, House Republicans have not changed course even after Moody's Ratings delivered a wake-up call last week by removing the perfect credit rating it had kept on the United States since 1917.
    


            Of course, deficit hawks have been warning of trouble for years, if not decades.
    


            And yet the United States has been able to run large deficits and US debt is still viewed as one of the safest assets on the planet.
    


            There is a risk of a boy-who-cried-wolf situation where concerns about the federal budget are not heeded.
    


            “The wolf is not at the door. The ants are in the woodwork, and they are eating at the foundation,” said Holtz-Eakin. “Every year we are cutting away from our capacity to do better because we're borrowing so much.”

Critics of the president's decision to auction off a private dinner via his Trump-branded crypto token were worried about the stunt for a few reasons. At the top of the list: the potential for foreigners to buy access to the sitting president, something the US Constitution explicitly prohibits.
    


            Those concerns, it seems, were well founded. The vast majority of the top holders of Trump's memecoin appear to be based overseas, including the top investor — a Chinese-born crypto mogul who, until recently, was facing civil fraud charges in the United States.
    


            Billed by organizers as the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world,” Thursday's gala is set to take place at the president's private Trump National Golf Club, just outside of Washington, DC, according to an email sent to guests and reviewed by Fortune.



            The guests are expected to include President Donald Trump himself and 220 of the top $TRUMP buyers, who collectively dumped an estimated $148 million over three weeks into the memecoin — a type of crypto product that is functionally useless as a currency or investment vehicle, and one that serious investors avoid because of their tendency to collapse in value.  The top 25 $TRUMP coin holders are eligible for a private White House tour the following day — the kind of access typically reserved for heads of state.

Trump's crypto conflicts keep piling up. He's not even trying to hide them



            And because crypto is anonymous by design, the identities of the top investors — who appeared on a public leaderboard with nothing but self-selected three- or four-letter usernames and long, cryptographic digital wallet addresses — aren't easy to pin down.
    


            But an analysis by Bloomberg News found that all but six of the top 25 holders of the $TRUMP memecoin used foreign exchanges that are ostensibly off-limits to anyone living in the US. More than half of the top 220 holders used similar offshore exchanges, Bloomberg found.
    


            Thursday's “ultra-exclusive private VIP reception” is just the latest instance of the Trump administration flouting ethical boundaries between the office and the president's personal profit-seeking. His apparent contempt for such boundaries has angered commentators across the political spectrum.
    


            Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who introduced legislation to ban officials from selling memecoins, said in a hearing this week that the gala “represents a real problem” because there is “clearly a way around the State Department for foreign individuals of significant influence and wealth to be able to directly lobby the president.” And even Republican crypto advocate Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said the event gives her “pause.”
    


            The progressive advocacy group Public Citizen is organizing a protest outside the Potomac Falls, Virginia, golf course on Thursday, and is calling on the Department of Justice and other officials to hold Trump accountable.
    


            “He'd help himself by calling off his Thursday gala,” the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page wrote Tuesday. “If he won't do that, he could at least disclose his crypto contest's winners so Americans know who may be trying to buy access to the President.”
    


            That, too, seems unlikely.
    


            When CNN asked the White House whether a gala guest list would be released, a spokesperson replied with a statement saying: “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.”
    


            Organizers of the auction didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            One publicly known guest is Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur, who wasn't exactly hiding his status. Observers were pretty sure the billionaire was leading the pack when the auction's public leaderboard displayed the username SUN topping the ranks. Sun later confirmed on social media Tuesday that he was “honored” to support Trump and excited to attend the gala “as his TOP fan!”
    


            Trump's reelection and his newfound enthusiasm for crypto came at a fortunate time for Sun, the 34-year-old founder of blockchain company Tron. In 2023, US regulators charged Sun and his company with selling unregistered securities and fraudulently manipulating the price of the digital token Tronix.

A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve on civil fraud charges



            Sun, a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, became the first prominent investor to back the Trump family crypto project, World Liberty Financial, which launched in the fall of 2024. Sun eventually poured at least $75 million into the World Liberty token (which is separate from the $TRUMP token), and he's amassed more than $22 million worth of President Trump's memecoin, based on Wednesday's prices.
    


            All told, Sun's actions, including the buying they sparked from other crypto enthusiasts, have generated an estimated $400 million windfall for the Trump family, according to Forbes.
    


            Then, about a month into Trump's second term, the Securities and Exchange Commission did a 180 on virtually all of its crypto enforcement actions, including the civil fraud charges it had filed against Sun and his company. In February, SEC lawyers asked a federal judge to put the agency's civil fraud case on hold, citing “the public's interest.”
    


            Sun is a polarizing figure, even within crypto. He's known as a showman, having previously spent $4.6 million on a dinner with Warren Buffett (which Sun canceled and rescheduled) and $28 million to join Jeff Bezos aboard Blue Origin's first crewed mission (though Sun had to drop out). Sun, who told Forbes his net worth from his expansive crypto empire is over $40 billion, made headlines last year when he bought a $6.2 million conceptual artwork of a banana duct-taped to a wall. He promptly ate the banana.

            US President Donald Trump's whirlwind visit last week to the Middle East saw a wave of AI dealmaking that could reshape the global technology landscape.
    


            On May 12, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund Public Investment Fund announced the establishment of AI startup Humain. US companies Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm also announced deals to supply chips and partner on AI infrastructure with Humain.
    


            The Trump administration also announced that it would rescind and replace the “AI Diffusion” rule, a Biden-era regulation capping sales of the most advanced chips that was set to take effect on May 15.
    


            On the final leg of the tour, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that they will partner to build a data center complex in Abu Dhabi with 5-gigawatts of capacity – the largest data center cluster outside of the US, according to the Commerce Department. By comparison, the current global market capacity of data centers is approximately 59 gigawatts – according to Goldman Sachs.



            The Trump administration said that it also secured Saudi and UAE investment for data centers located in the US.
    


            In Abu Dhabi, Trump said that the countries had “agreed to create a path for the UAE to buy some of the world's most advanced AI semiconductors from American companies.”
    


            The deals, and new partnerships, could reshape the global AI landscape in myriad ways, according to officials and experts.
    


            “We're still waiting for the full details to emerge, but the scale of some of these announced projects is massive,” says Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, whose focus is technology and international affairs.
    


            In recent years, Beijing and Washington have been vying for supremacy in AI technology that could confer the winner advantages in economic productivity, scientific breakthroughs and national security.
    


            Trump's AI czar David Sacks said in a post on X that the deals are a “game-changer in the global AI race” that will “help to cement American technology as the global standard – before our competitors can catch up.”
    


            Some experts agree that working with the Middle East will fill gaps in current US capabilities. AI models require vast amounts of computing power, commonly referred to simply as “compute,” to train and run. That requires huge amounts of energy.
    


            “We have a huge problem when it comes to fueling our own data center infrastructure in the US,” Mohammed Soliman, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think-tank in Washington-DC, tells CNN.
    


            Growing demand for energy to power data centers has strained parts of the US grid. Although some say the issue can be resolved domestically, others say partnering with the oil-rich Gulf is a wise strategic bet.
    


            “There's not really an immediate [domestic] solution,” Soliman adds, “You need to invest heavily in energy infrastructure, and that takes capital, land, a lot of resources, and time.”
    


            But some are concerned about how the flow of chips to the Gulf will be controlled. On May 19, leading Democrats warned in a letter that “the deals – without any clear and enforceable protections to stop this sensitive technology from falling into China's hands – present an immediate national security threat.”
    


            If chips are given directly to Saudi and Emirati companies, without the right safeguards, it could present national security risks, and the nations could employ them for tasks like autonomous weapons research and development, says Winter-Levy.
    


            In another possible scenario, in which the data centers might be controlled and operated by US tech companies, he says the risks are more limited.
    


            The UAE and Saudi Arabia both have ambitious plans to build AI industries to prepare their economies for a post-oil future.
    


            US authorities say that not working with the Gulf could have increased the risks of a Gulf-China AI alliance. The chip technology of companies like Huawei is quickly advancing. “If we reject them, we will drive them into China's arms,” said Sacks' X post.
    


            While much is still unknown, one thing is clear: The Gulf's role in the global AI landscape is growing.
    


            “This could well see the emergence of the Gulf as the third-biggest power in the AI competition,” says Winter-Levy. “If the countries use the chips to train their own frontier models, the Gulf could move closer to competing with the US on the technology.”
    


            He adds that current talent constraints might hold the region back from competing with current AI leaders US and China.
    


            Experts say the deals mark a new era in US-Gulf relations. “This is going to be a pivotal moment for the way the US-Gulf relationship is defined,” says Soliman. “It's no longer about crude; it's mostly about compute.”
    


            In the Democrats' letter, they urged the administration to make sure “American technology prioritizes the buildout of this critical industry here at home, not abroad.”
    


            But if a situation emerges in the future where a significant amount of US computing power is in the region, said Winter-Levy, it could give Gulf governments “some significant degree of leverage, both over US tech companies but also over US foreign policy more generally.”

Live Updates


            • Two Israeli Embassy staff members were killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting an event on Wednesday night.
    


            • The man and woman killed, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were a “young couple about to be engaged,” according to Israel's ambassador to the US. Lischinsky, 30, was a research assistant in the political department at the embassy, while Milgrim, 26, organized trips to Israel, according to the Israeli foreign ministry.
    


            • The sole suspect was identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, who chanted “Free, free Palestine” while in custody, police said. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter waited for police to arrive before saying he “did it for Gaza.”
    


            • President Donald Trump said antisemitism, “hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said today that federal and local officials are working together in the probe and the shooter will “be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            The White House said “hatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump” and vowed that the man suspected of killing two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, DC, last night would be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing to reporters today that Trump is “saddened and outraged” over the killing of the embassy workers.
    


                    “The evil of antisemitism must be eradicated from our society,” she said.
                





            She called the two diplomats killed, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, a “beautiful young couple” and talked about their love for each other. They were expected to be engaged, officials said.
    


            Leavitt said she talked to Attorney General Pam Bondi this morning. The Justice Department will be “prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.
    


            Shortly after two Israeli embassy staffers were killed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night, a lengthy letter authorities are investigating as potentially being authored by the suspected gunman was posted to social media advocating for violent retaliation over the war in Gaza.
    


            The letter was posted to an account on X that has a long history of expressing outrage over Israel's treatment of Palestinians. A CNN review of that X account, @kyotoleather, found that it is linked to other accounts with the name and photo of Elias Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago who authorities identified as the suspected shooter and included replies in which other users addressed him by name. Authorities are also investigating whether the account was Rodriguez's, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
    


            The letter posted on Wednesday expressed fury over the “atrocities committed by the Israelis against Palestine” and referenced “armed action” as a valid form of protest – one that is “the only sane thing to do.”
    


                    FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X, that “the FBI is aware of certain writings allegedly authored by the suspect, and we hope to have updates as to the authenticity very soon.”
                





            Police say that Rodriguez approached a group of four people outside the Capital Jewish Museum and opened fire with a handgun shortly after 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, fatally killing two people who worked for the Israeli Embassy. Police detained Rodriguez about 20 minutes after the shooting. As he was detained, video showed him yelling, “Free, free Palestine.”
    


            The letter was posted to X around 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. It is not clear who posted it or if it was a pre-scheduled post set before the incident.
    


            The letter describes the author's anger with a perceived a lack of action from Western and Arab governments to stop Israel's war in Gaza, advocates for armed action and compares it to forms of nonviolent protest.
    


CNN's Sabrina Shulman, Evan Perez and Holmes Lybrand contributed reporting to this post. 



            US President Donald Trump expressed his “deep sorrow” over the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in a phone call with Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu today, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.
    


            Netanyahu also thanked Trump for “the efforts he and his administration are making against manifestations of anti-Semitism in the United States,” it added.
    


                    “The president reaffirmed his commitment to uproot the violent antisemitism that has swept across university campuses in this country,” Israeli Ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter told reporters earlier outside the Capital Jewish Museum today.
                





            CNN has reached out to the White House about the call.
    


            Leiter said he talked to Trump last night and met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and interim DC attorney Jeanine Pirro at the site of the shooting. He said the US president was “very firm in his statement expressing condolence and condemning violence.”
    


This post has been updated with more from the Trump-Netanyahu call. 



            The alleged shooter is expected to make his first appearance today in Federal court later this afternoon, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The suspect was identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, who chanted “Free, free Palestine” while in custody, police said. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter waited for police to arrive before saying he “did it for Gaza.”
    


            Sarah Milgrim, one of the Israeli Embassy staffers killed last night, was “a devoted and active volunteer” for Tech2Peace, an organization that provides entrepreneurial training to young Palestinians and Israelis alongside conflict dialogue.
    


                    “Sarah was a deeply curious person, always seeking to learn and connect. She brought people together with empathy and purpose, and her dedication to building a better future was evident in everything she did. Her voice and spirit will be profoundly missed,” Tech2Peace said in a statement today.
                





            Esti Rozenfeld, CEO of Tech2Peace, told CNN that Milgrim managed two seminars while she worked there, which was an intensive process. She said Milgrim “came here to promote peace, to promote the effort in this beloved land for dialogue, for partnership, for commitment.”
    


            Rozenfeld said plans were in the works for a memorial to honor Milgrim next week. “The community is heartbroken,” she said.
    


            Yaron Lischinsky, the other victim of the shooting, was a “respectful and kind person” who loved books and working in diplomacy, one of his friends from Reichman University in Israel told CNN.
    


                    “We would sit in various coffee shops around Jerusalem, discussing religion, politics, and books,” his friend Jakub Klepek told CNN in a message. “We often exchanged book titles and then jokingly complained about not being able to start new ones because of our university reading lists.”
                





            “What made him stand out was not just his intelligence, but his generosity of spirit,” Klepek said, who also described 30-year-old Lischinsky as a “man of purpose.”
    


            FBI Chicago is “is conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity in the Chicago area in relation to yesterday's tragic shooting in Washington, D.C.,” according to a post on X from the FBI's Washington field office.
    


            Earlier, CNN observed that law enforcement was searching an address in Chicago that appeared to be associated with the suspected shooter.
    


            Law enforcement did not confirm that the address was associated with the shooter but public records appear to show that.
    


            Investigators today are talking to witnesses and poring through the background of the suspect in the Capital Jewish Museum shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers, with the expectation that he will face hate crime and other federal charges, according to people briefed on the investigation.
    


            A so-called manifesto making the rounds online and possibly connected to the suspect is among the information investigators are reviewing, according to multiple law enforcement sources, as members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and Washington, DC's, Metropolitan Police try to determine how the suspect allegedly chose to carry out the attack at the museum event, which is across from the FBI's Washington, DC, field office.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI officials have highlighted the apparent antisemitic connections to the shooting, and members of an antisemitism task force were with Bondi as she visited the site of the shooting today.
    


            Police said the suspect was from Chicago, and it's unclear what if any connections he has with Washington, and how long he has been in the city.
    


            Witnesses have told investigators that the suspect verified with bystanders that the museum was at the location. Organizers of the event did not list its location, which according to the American Jewish Committee's website was available upon registration.
    


            Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's accusation that European officials are inciting antisemitism is “outrageous and completely unjustified,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson said today.
    


            Sa'ar earlier said an atmosphere of “antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement” led to the killings of Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, DC, pointing blame at officials in “many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe.”
    


                    French foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told journalists this accusation was “outrageous and completely unjustified,” adding that “France has condemned, France condemns, and France will continue to always and unambiguously condemn any antisemitic act.”
                





            France denounced the killings of the staffers' killings “in the strongest possible terms,” Lemoine said, describing the shooting as “an antisemitic, heinous, and unacceptable act.”
    


            “Nothing can justify such violence. France reaffirms its absolute rejection of antisemitism in all its forms and is using all means at its disposal to combat this scourge,” he added.
    


Some context: Sa'ar's accusation came with the backdrop of tense diplomatic relations between Israel and European leaders, as both the European Union and the United Kingdom announced measures distancing themselves from Israel over its new military offensive and aid blockade in Gaza.
    


            The UK paused trade negotiations and sanctioned West Bank settlers as Britain's foreign minister slammed Israel's actions in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” Meanwhile, the EU announced it would review its relationship with Israel, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip” as his military roots out Hamas in the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians face starvation due to the Israeli blockade.
    


            The executive director of the Lillian and Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum said they are “heartbroken” by the murders of two Israeli embassy staffers last night.
    


            “We are heartbroken by the murders of Yaron (Lischinsky) and Sarah Milgrim, and send our sincere condolences to their families and friends. May they, and all who grieve this devastating loss, be comforted by their communities,” Dr. Beatrice Gurwitz said.
    


            The two diplomats were shot and killed shortly after leaving an event at the museum.
    


                    “In an act of horrific antisemitic violence, a gunman attacked our beloved community. This tragedy is devastating. Such acts of terror attempt to instill fear, silence voices, and erase history — but we refuse to let them succeed,” she said.
                





            Gurwitz said her team is working to reopen the museum in the coming days “with all necessary security in place, so we can return to telling the story of Jewish Washington for thousands of visitors from around the world.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters in Washington, DC, from the scene of the fatal shooting, said the suspect “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law” and lauded law enforcement for their response.
    


                    “No parents should have to be called and told that their children were violently murdered leaving a religious event at the Jewish Museum,” Bondi said. “That should never happen in this world and not in our country. And this person will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
                





            Bondi declined to comment on where the investigation stands and whether the suspect, who is in custody, is cooperating with authorities. She also declined to say whether the Justice Department would pursue the death penalty in the case.
    


            The attorney general said that federal and local law enforcement are working “hand in hand” to investigate the “horrific” attack, and that the department is “doing everything we can to protect our entire community, and especially our Jewish community.”
    


            Leo Terrell, head of the Justice Department task force to combat antisemitism task force, stood next to Bondi as she spoke to reporters.
    


            Combating extremism and hate crimes will take “a whole of government and whole of society effort,” Brian Levin, the chair of the California Commission on the State of Hate, said today.
    


            Levin, who also leads a research and policy center at California State University, San Bernardino, slammed the Trump administration's moves to cut funding for things like hate crime training for law enforcement and grants related to domestic extremism.
    


                    “We need to have the federal government be a partner. They have cut all the research and they've changed what they're doing with regard to the data,” Levin told CNN.
                





            He said this is a “national security issue” and will require bipartisan support to “renew efforts to protect Jews and Jewish institutions.”
    


            Levin's comments came after two Israeli diplomats were killed in Washington, DC, last night. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter had waited for police to arrive before saying he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Once in custody, the DC gunman chanted: “Free, free Palestine.”
    


            Antisemitism has surged around the globe over the past decade, according to the Anti-Defamation League. A striking 46% of adults across the globe harbor “deeply entrenched” antisemitic attitudes, according to an annual survey conducted by the ADL, published in January.
    


            Levin said one thing that could contribute to these attitudes is “bigoted rhetoric online,” which oftentimes is accompanied by hate crimes. He claimed religious hate crimes specifically have continued to rise.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN that one of the victims of last night's shooting, Yaron Lischinsky, identifies as Jewish, adding that he has a Christian mother and Jewish father. He had worked at the embassy for a little over two years.
    


            The other victim, Sarah Milgrim, an American from Kansas, had started working there shortly after the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel.
    


            Their relationship and love for each other was well-known at the Israeli Embassy, where they met, said the official.
    


                    “It was the cutest love story,” the official said, adding it was “like a poster for a Netflix rom-com.” They would often be seen having lunch together at the embassy.
                





            Lischinsky's plan to propose to Milgrim in Jerusalem was also known, the official said. Milgrim hadn't met Lischinsky's family in Israel yet, and they planned to do that at the same time as getting engaged.
    


            While Lischinsky worked in the embassy's political section, Milgrim helped coordinate a variety of groups' travels to Israel, including political, religious and others, like visitors studying climate change.
    


            A security team has been sent over from Israel to assess the situation and review protocols, as is standard when embassy personnel are attacked around the world. The embassy is also providing support services to personnel in the wake of their colleagues' killing.
    


            There were two other Israeli Embassy staffers who were with shooting victims Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim when they were killed, an Israeli official tells CNN.
    


            Both were young American women, and neither one was injured in the shooting.
    


            KU Hillel, a Jewish student organization at the University of Kansas, said it is mourning the loss of “beloved” alumna Sarah Milgrim and her boyfriend Yaron Lischinsky “with profound sadness.”
    


            Milgrim graduated from the University of Kansas in 2021, according to KU Hillel.
    


                    “Sarah's bright spirit and passion for the Jewish community touched everyone fortunate enough to know her. Those closest to her describe (her) as ‘the definition of the best person,” KU Hillel said in a statement today.
                





            The organization said she served as a member of KU Hillel's Board of Directors and “exemplified the values we hold dear.”
    


            “In the face of such hateful violence, we come together as a community to support one another and to honor Sarah's memory,” the statement continued. “May Sarah and Yaron's memories always be a blessing.”
    


            Milgrim also graduated from American University in 2023 with a Master's degree in International Affairs.
    


            “Sarah was only beginning her life's journey, and it is anguishing that her light was taken away because of hate,” the President of American University Jonathan Alger said in a statement.
    


This post has been updated with the statement from American University. 



            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that he spoke to the parents of the two Israeli embassy staff members killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.
    


                    “The Prime Minister told the families that he shares in their deep sorrow, together with the entire Jewish People,” according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.
                





            Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine,” while being arrested in Washington, DC, last night, authorities said.
    


            Netanyahu also spoke with US Attorney General Pam Bondi, “who promised that the murderer, and everyone who cooperated with him, would be brought to justice,” the statement said.
    


            Veteran Israeli diplomat Ron Prosor said the killing of two embassy staffers in Washington, DC, did not “happen in a warzone” but “in the capital of the free world.”
    


            Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine,” while being arrested in Washington, DC, last night, authorities said.
    


            Prosor, who currently serves as Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in a post on X that Lischinsky was “a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause.”
    


            Prosor called Lischinsky “bright, curious, engaged” and said he “embodied the Judeo-Christian values.”
    


            Lischinsky was born in Nuremberg, Germany, Prosor said, adding that Lischinsky was his master's student at Reichman University in Tel Aviv.
    


            Prosor said he paid his condolences to Lischinsky's parents this morning.
    


Reactions from US politicians to the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, last night continue to pour in, with leaders from across the political spectrum decrying the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members.
    


Here's what some US politicians have said: 



Vice President JD Vance: “My heart breaks for Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, who were murdered last night at the Capital Jewish Museum. Antisemitic violence has no place in the United States. We're praying for their families and all of our friends at the Israeli Embassy, where the two victims worked,” he said in a post on X.
    


US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee: “People here in Israel are devastated,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “I got a call early this morning Jerusalem time from Pam Bondi, the Attorney General. She was at the scene. She gave me a brief on what was going on. I've spoken with the foreign minister. I've spoken with the minister, the Ambassador of Israel to the US and to the father of the young man who lives here in Israel.”
    


Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: “Young Jewish people and diplomats came together in a museum built to honor their shared history but then had to flee gun shots and witness the killing of a young couple. As a Jew who led the building of a museum dedicated to standing up against bigotry and hatred, I know how sacred these places are and what trauma this incident has caused,” he said in a statement.
    


Office of the Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff: “Last night's horrific murder of two Israeli emb(a)sssy staff members was an act of antisemitic terrror, tragic and senseless. I continue to pray for the victims' loved ones. This evil has no place in our world. Rest assured, justice will be served,” he said in a post on X. 



Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro: “Next week, Yaron and Sarah were headed to Jerusalem, where Yaron would propose. I proposed to Lori in Jerusalem under the Montefiore Windmill, and we were married 28 years ago this Sunday. Yaron and Sarah should have had the same opportunity — and a life together far beyond what their murderer cut short. May their memories be a blessing and a call to action for each of us,” Shapiro posted on X.
    


Former Vice President Kamala Harris: “Doug and my prayers are with the loved ones of Yaron and Sarah — two young Israeli diplomats murdered in what appears to be a shocking act of antisemitic violence. I stand with the entire Jewish community in condemning this sickening violence. Antisemitism and violence have no place in our country. We all must come together and fight hatred,” Harris said on X.
    


Former second gentleman Doug Emhoff: “The shocking murder of two young Israeli diplomats in DC is horrifying, heartbreaking and completely unacceptable. Jews must be able to gather without fear or violence. We will not be silent and we will never let antisemitic terror defeat us. May the memory of Yaron and Sarah be a blessing,” he said in a post on X.

            Yaron Lischinsky, one of the Israeli embassy staffers killed last night, dreamed of being a diplomat after studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, according to his former professor.
    


            “Yaron was an outstanding student and a wonderful person,” said Nissim Otmazgin, the Dean of Humanities at the university. “His dream was to become a diplomat. He was actually just starting his new career as a diplomat, he was murdered.”
    


            Otmazgin, who taught Lischinsky in three different courses related to Japanese studies, said he was “an excellent student” and “very much dedicated.” Otmazgin remembers him getting a perfect score on an honors seminar, a sign of how hard he worked.
    


            The professor said Lischinsky truly “became an Israeli” after moving from Germany.
    


            “In many ways, I think for me, he symbolizes the hope of Israel,” Otmazgin said. “Young people — idealistic — that are going abroad, studying about different cultures, and trying to do good for their country. So in this sense, it is not only a personal tragedy, it's also kind of public tragedy.”
    


            “He is the best that Israel can offer,” Otmazgin said.
    


            The United Arab Emirates has denounced the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, DC, last night.
    


                    “The UAE condemns the killing of employees at the Israeli embassy in Washington,” the state news agency WAM Thursday reported in a post on X.
                





            In 2020, the UAE and Israel established relations under the Abraham Accords Peace Agreement with the United States.
    


            Law enforcement are searching an address in Chicago that appears to be associated with the suspected shooter, CNN has observed.
    


            Many law enforcement vehicles were pulling up on the block to allow for others to park in front of the building. The scene remains very active. Currently, there are approximately twenty law enforcement vehicles on scene. Chicago police shut down the street.
    


            Law enforcement has not confirmed that the address is linked to the suspect but public records show it may be associated with him.
    


            The area is in the Albany Park neighborhood on Chicago's north side, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the city.
    


            Earlier on Thursday, Dan Bongino, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in a post on X that the shooting of two Israeli diplomats on Wednesday night “has the full attention of your FBI.”
    


                    “Targeted acts of anti-Semitic violence are typically carried out by spineless, gutless cowards. And the penalties will be harsh as we tighten up this investigation and run down any additional leads. I should have additional updates for you shortly as I head back to FBI HQ,” he said.
                





            The German-Israeli Society, an organization in Germany that promotes relations with Israel, said the Israeli embassy staffer who was killed in Washington, DC, was a founding member of its sister organization, and that he “will be greatly missed.”
    


                    “Yaron Lischinsky was a founding member of the Young Forum of the Israeli-German Society, our sister organization that connects young Israelis and Germans and initiates joint projects,” the German-Israeli Society said in a statement today.
                





            “In this role, he organized numerous political and cultural events in cooperation with the Young Forum of the German-Israeli Society and thus made a significant contribution to strengthening German-Israeli relations,” it said.
    


            Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told lawmakers in the Bundestag today that Lischinsky held both German and Israeli nationality.
    


                    The Society described Lischinsky as “an incredibly warm, intelligent, calm and interested person.” 
                





            He had a passion for photography, and “focused his lens on the special corners and details that others often missed.”
    


            New details continue to emerge about a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, that killed two young diplomats last night.
    


            The suspected shooter is in custody. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter waited for police to arrive before saying he “did it for Gaza.”
    


If you are just reading in, here's what you need to know about the shooting: 



CNN's Eugenia Yosef, Michael Schwartz, Nadeen Ebrahim, Catherine Nicholls, Lex Harvey, Diego Mendoza, Jessie Yeung, Teele Rebane, Isaac Yee, Samantha Waldenberg and Elise Hammond contributed reporting to this post.



            Jonathan Epstein, a witness to the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum, told CNN Thursday he initially thought the loud noises at the scene were construction and looked the shooter in the eyes.
    


                    “The event had just wrapped up. A couple of us were touring the galleries upstairs and out of nowhere, we hear a series of loud bangs, just ‘boom, boom, boom,' one after the other. And my friend was like ‘were those gunshots?' And I was like ‘no, no, no that was just construction we're fine,'” Epstein described on “CNN News Central.”
                





            He continued, “Then we went downstairs to the main lobby where the event was held. A man rushed in and said he had dislocated his shoulder, said there were indeed gunshots. Security at the event ushered us quickly back into a safe location behind the main room, and we were there for a few minutes.”
    


            Epstein said he thought it was a “random shooting” in the neighborhood at first. Then he heard a man yell “free Palestine,” in which he said he thought was a just a protester in the area.
    


                    “I had no idea that he was the shooter. I walk out. I see him yelling again. I see security right now, they run, grab him and take him outside and he is still yelling and had no idea he was the shooter we got pretty close I was ten feet away from him, I look him in the eyes and then I stepped back,” he said.
                





            Shooting victim Yaron Lischinsky, one of the Israeli Embassy staffers killed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night, held a German passport.
    


            Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told lawmakers in the German Bundestag on Thursday that Lischinsky was an Israeli diplomat and held German citizenship.
    


            “I think I speak for the whole House in saying that this has shaken us, that our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the murdered and the members of the Israeli foreign service,” said Wadephul, condemning the “insidious murder” of the couple.
    


            Israel's foreign ministry provided more details about the work of the two victims of the shooting in Washington, DC.
    


            Yaron Lischinsky, 30, was a research assistant in the political department at the embassy.
    


            Sarah Milgrim, 26, organized trips to Israel, according to a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry.
    


            The Embassy of Israel to the USA said in an earlier social media post that “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.”
    


            “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss,” the embassy said.
    


            American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said “our worst fears came true” following the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members at an event the committee hosted on Wednesday night.
    


                    “Last night, really our worst fears came true. This was an event we all look forward to every year that brings together AJC's young leaders,“ Deutch said on Thursday. “This year, the focus was on humanitarian diplomacy. It was on finding ways to work together in an interfaith way across the region to help bring peace.”
                





            He continued, “There were friends and allies of the Jewish community, people from across the diplomatic world. And all of the good feeling was shattered immediately after when these two, when these two beautiful young souls were taken by this murderer.”
    


            Deutch said he was very familiar with both of the victims, telling CNN's “This Morning” that “Yaron is an Israeli Jew. Sarah is an American Jew. Sarah was deeply involved with AJC. She's traveled with AJC. She cared deeply for our work in the diplomatic space. And she and Yaron had a beautiful relationship. It's a tragedy, of the worst magnitude that these beautiful young people were taken from us.”
    


            The former Florida congressman said, “this is a horrific reminder to the Jewish community in the world that antisemitism, often most times, is not violent until it becomes violent.”
    


            Deutch said the reaction to the shooting last night from the Trump administration and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has been strong, but that “everyone has a role to play.”
    


                    “But more than that, it's everyone across society. It's college professors and doctors and lawyers and store owners, all of them standing together saying they're not — we will not tolerate this kind of antisemitism and hatred that can lead to this kind of horrific violence. We have to come together to say that and to give those words real meaning. Everyone has a role to play,” he said.
                





            The Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, outside of which two Israeli embassy staff members were killed in a shooting on Wednesday night, expressed condolences and horror at the violence that took place after an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and horrified by the senseless violence outside the Museum this evening. Our condolences and heartfelt sympathies go to the victims and their families,” the museum said in a statement.
    


            The museum is in downtown Washington DC, several blocks north of the National Mall and near Judiciary Square.
    


            The Hebrew University of Jerusalem expressed “deep sorrow” Thursday over the killing of Israeli embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in Washington, DC.
    


            Lischinsky “was a graduate of the Hebrew University, having completed his degree in International Relations and Asian Studies in 2021,” the university said in a statement Thursday.
    


            “We share in the profound grief of their families and loved ones.”
    


            France's Interior Ministry will tighten security around symbolic Jewish sites throughout the country, following the shooting that happened just outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.
    


            Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau asked regional officials to “tighten security around symbolic sites and to contact representatives of the Jewish community,” according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, citing a comment from the minister's entourage on Thursday morning.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attack in Washington as antisemitic, adding that he extended “our thoughts to the families and loved ones of the victims” to Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
    


            “The murder of two members of the Israeli embassy near the Jewish Museum in Washington is an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity. Nothing can justify such violence,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar blamed an atmosphere of “antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement” for the killings of two staffers of Israel's embassy in Washington, DC.
    


            “There is a direct line connecting antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement to this murder,” Sa'ar said at a news conference on Thursday in Jerusalem. “This incitement is also done by leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe.”
    


            Sa'ar went on to say that there is a concern in European countries for security threats against Israeli missions abroad and the Jewish community. “What is (lacking) I feel is the connection between the atmosphere created – the specific words – and this kind of wave of antisemitism we are facing,” he said.
    


            His comments come amid a tense week in the country's diplomatic relations, as both the European Union and the United Kingdom announced measures distancing themselves from Israel.
    


            The UK paused trade negotiations and sanctioned West Bank settlers, as Britain's foreign minister slammed Israel's operation in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” Meanwhile, the EU announced that it would review its relationship with Israel, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic.”
    


            On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada threatened to take “concrete actions,” including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not stop its renewed military offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza.
    


            Since May 5, Israel has been conducting a new offensive in Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Monday that his country plans to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip.”
    


            IsraAID, an Israel-based non-governmental organization, said the event in Washington, DC, where two Israeli staff members were shot dead was focused on humanitarian aid for Gaza.
    


            The event, where IsraAID members were keynote speakers, “focused on bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israeli-Palestinian and regional collaboration,” the NGO said in a statement Thursday.
    


                    “We, and all the attendees, gathered in the interest of finding practical solutions to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and showing that working together is the only way forward for all the people in the region,” IsraAID said, adding that “the brutal and tragic irony that such an event – motivated by humanitarian principles – was targeted for more violence is heartbreaking.”
                





            On Wednesday, trucks  loaded with humanitarian aid began delivering the first stocks of food and supplies in Gaza, marking the first time any humanitarian supplies have entered the enclave since Israel imposed a complete blockade on the territory in early-March.
    


            The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Wednesday that the aid delivery was “nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza.”
    


            Eyewitnesses described to CNN the shock and confusion that unfolded at the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting an event, when a shooter outside the venue in Washington, DC, killed two staff members of the Israeli Embassy — a couple planning to get engaged.
    


            The event had just ended at around 9 p.m. when gunshots rang out, said attendee Sara Marinuzzi, 28.
    


            The shooting took place outside the building, killing the victims who Israeli officials later identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. They had been leaving an event when the gunman opened fire, police said.
    


            Then, attendees saw a man run into the museum. He seemed shaken, so many assumed he had been a bystander or eyewitness. Several asked if he was injured, and security guards offered him water. He didn't interact much with the other attendees, said 31-year-old attendee Yoni Kalin.
    


                    “I went up to him and asked if he was okay as he muttered ‘call the police' again and again. He said he was okay. Then I asked if he was shot, he said he wasn't,” said Paige Siegel, another attendee.
                





            Marinuzzi also described the man as asking security to call the police, and that he was “having erratic behavior.”
    


            It was only when police arrived, around 10 minutes later, that the man said he was responsible for the crime — stunning those around him. He said, “I did it, I did it for Gaza. Free Palestine!” Marinuzzi recalled.
    


            Siegel was shocked, too. “He was so shaken when I spoke to him that he seemed harmless,” she said.
    


            “It's horrible,” Kalin told CNN. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.”
    


            Police have since identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, 30, from Chicago, Illinois. Rodriguez was not previously known to police, who said they believed he was the sole shooter. As of late Wednesday night, he was being questioned by the FBI and DC police.
    


            Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said he is “very worried” about more attacks on diplomatic missions around the world following the killing of two embassy staffers in Washington, DC.
    


                    “I have been worried for the past few months that something like this would happen and it did, and the list of fallen foreign service members has grown today,” Sa'ar said, speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem on Thursday.
                





            He also said there have been a number of attacks and attempted attacks on Israeli missions around the world, many of which he says have not been reported.
    


            “There is no one week without a terror attacks or attempts (at) terror attacks around the world and usually more than one,” he said in response to a question from CNN.
    


            Sa'ar said he spoke with the father of one of the victims, Yaron Lischinsky, earlier Thursday.
    


                    “I told him that his son was a warrior on our diplomatic front that fell just like a soldier on the battlefield,” Sa'ar said.
                





            He also said he has been in touch with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Israel's Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has ordered the reinforcement of security at Israel's missions worldwide following the attack.
    


            In the early hours of Thursday morning in Washington, DC, investigations are underway into a shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers the night before. The suspect has been detained and identified, with US and Israeli officials condemning the attack.
    


Here's what we know:



The victims: The man and woman killed were identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. The victims were a young couple who planned to get engaged next week in Jerusalem, according to the Israeli ambassador to the UN. They had been leaving an event when the shooting occurred.
    


The attack: The gunman was seen pacing outside the Capital Jewish Museum ahead of the shooting, according to police. Then the gunman approached four people and opened fire with a handgun, killing two. He went inside the museum, where he was detained, police said. Eyewitnesses told CNN he had waited for police to arrive before saying he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Once in custody, he chanted: “Free, free Palestine.”
    


The suspect: Police named the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois. They believe he was the lone gunman and said there was no active threat remaining. He is now being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and the FBI.
    


The investigation: The FBI and DC police have launched their investigation, and the Israeli Embassy is working with law enforcement, authorities said.
    


Reactions: Officials in both the US and Israel have vehemently condemned the shooting and drawn links to antisemitism, describing it as an attack on the Jewish community.
    


            The alleged shooter who gunned down two Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” as he was being taken into custody, according to an eyewitness.
    


            Eyewitness Yoni Kalin, 31, was at the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday night, attending an event organized by the American Jewish Committee, when shots rang out.
    


            Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, which was organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza. Kalin added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event.
    


                    “At first I didn't recognize them as gunshots,” Kalin told CNN in a phone interview.
                





            Moments later a man entered the museum appearing to be a witness, according to Kalin. He recalled the man sitting in the museum but not interacting with many of the people present at the event.
    


            Ten minutes later, when police entered the building, the man appeared to confess to the shooting, telling officers, “I did this, I did this for Palestine,” according to Kalin.
    


            “It's horrible,” Kalin told CNN. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.”
    


            Kalin added that in the period between when the man walked in and before his arrest, people went up to him to offer him water and to check if he was ok.
    


                    “I'm still in shock,” Kalin told CNN. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn't get us where we need to be.”
                





            Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs identified the victims of Wednesday's shooting in Washington, DC as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim.
    


                    “We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington — Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a post to X on Thursday.






            “We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read.
    


            In a separate post, the Israeli Embassy to the US wrote, “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.”
    


                    “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.”
                





            Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the US, said the couple was about to be engaged.
    


            “A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” he said.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has ordered the reinforcement of security at Israel's missions worldwide following the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, DC on Wednesday.
    


            “My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
    


            “We are witnessing the terrible cost of antisemitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel,” said Netanyahu.
    


            US Attorney General Pam Bondi told Netanyahu that President Donald Trump is “personally involved in managing the response to the attack and that the United States will ensure the murderer is brought to justice,” according to the statement.
    


            She also asked Netanyahu to convey her condolences to the families of the young couple who were killed.
    


            Video obtained by CNN from an eyewitness appears to show the suspect in the deadly shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff yelling, “Free, free Palestine,” as he is taken into custody inside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night.
    


            Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith has identified the suspect in the shooting as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. She said at a news conference the attack is believed to have been carried out by just one person.
    


            The suspect was seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four people and shooting two of them, Smith said. The suspect then went inside the museum, where he was eventually detained.
    


            A separate eyewitness, Sara Marinuzzi, told CNN the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once he was inside the museum and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard him say “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.”
    


            Metadata from the video confirms it was taken on Wednesday night at the Capital Jewish Museum at 9:19 p.m.
    


            Israel's ambassador to the United Nations said his country's embassies are on “high alert” following the fatal shooting of two embassy staff members in Washington, DC on Wednesday.
    


            “It is a very difficult night for all of us here in the United States,” Danny Danon told CNN's MJ Lee.
    


                    “It was an attack against Israel, an attack against the Jewish community, but also an attack against the US itself,” Danon said.
                





            The two embassy staffers who were killed were a couple who planned to get engaged next week in Jerusalem, Danon said. “Unfortunately, that will not happen.”
    


            Danon said world leaders need to do more to stop antisemitic hate crimes.
    


                    “Many leaders worldwide, they condemn antisemitism, and they condemn hate crimes, but they don't do enough to enforce it. We expect actions, not only declarations.”
                





            President Donald Trump expressed his condolences to the victims' families, saying the shooting that killed two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, DC, was “based obviously on antisemitism.” He added: “Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”
    


            Other top US officials also condemned the shooting Wednesday night:
    


            Paige Siegel, an eyewitness on the scene after the shooting in Washington, DC that killed two Israeli Embassy staff members, told CNN she spoke to the suspected shooter before realizing he was the suspect.
    


            The suspect ran into the Capital Jewish Museum after the shooting, where he waited for police to arrive, according to police and multiple eyewitnesses.
    


                    “I went up to him and asked if he was okay as he muttered call the police again and again. He said he was okay. Then I asked if he was shot, he said he wasn't,” Siegel recalled.
                





            “He was so shaken when I spoke to him that he seemed harmless. Obviously I didn't know at the time,” she said.
    


            Siegel said that shortly thereafter, the police arrived and the suspect was apprehended while yelling “Free Palestine!”
    


            Siegel said she is still processing what happened.
    


                    “Here we are, a bunch of Jews lumped in one room for him to pick us off. The terrorist sat on a bench, amongst us,” she said.
                





            Jewish people “cannot allow fear to dictate how we're going to live our lives,” the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington said following Wednesday's fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff.
    


            “It was a young couple about to get engaged and spend the rest of their lives together,” Ron Halber told CNN's MJ Lee.
    


                    “And that some depraved individual thought that shooting down two innocent young Jewish people, Israelis in the middle of Washington DC, was somehow going to accomplish an objective 6,000 miles away is just horrible,” Halber said.
                





            Still, he said, “The Jewish people are resilient. The people of Israel are resilient.”
    


                    “We have to live proud, open, Jewish lives, and take necessary security precautions.”
                





            The suspect named after Wednesday night's deadly shooting is being interviewed by the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police along with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, according to Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino.
    


            Bongino said the shooting happened close to the FBI's Washington Field Office, and that FBI police officers responded immediately and rendered aid after the attack.
    


                    “Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” he wrote on X.
                





            The US Attorney's office is on scene while the FBI reviews evidence at the Washington Field Office, he added.
    


            Israeli officials expressed outrage and offered condolences following a shooting that killed two employees of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC on Wednesday night near the Capital Jewish Museum.
    


            The fatal shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday occurred on the same night as the American Jewish Committee was holding an event for young professionals.
    


            The sold-out “Young Diplomats Reception” is described as an event “bringing together Jewish young professionals (22-45) and the diplomatic community,” according to its Eventbrite page. The event was organized by ACCESS, the American Jewish Committee's division for young professionals.
    


            The two Israeli embassy staff members who were shot dead were leaving an event, according to Pamela A. Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            The theme of this year's Young Diplomats Reception was “turning pain into purpose,” and featured speakers from the Multifaith Alliance and IsraAID, according to the Eventbrite page.
    


                    “Hear from members of the Multifaith Alliance and IsraAID, as they delve into humanitarian diplomacy and how a coalition of organizations - from the region and for the region - are working together in response to humanitarian crises throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,” the page read.
                





            The event was scheduled from 6:30-9 p.m. ET.
    


            CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the event would have likely hosted people from many different embassies.
    


                    “It's sort of a way for young professionals in the foreign policy and foreign service space to get to know each other, so in many ways it was counter to the hate that would be experienced that evening in DC,” Kayyem told CNN's MJ Lee.
                





            “This was an event that was bringing lots of young people together whose countries probably disagree on things, to try to leave it to the next generation,” Kayyem said.
    


            The man accused of killing a young couple outside the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night “pretended to be a witness” and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming he “did it for Gaza,” eyewitness Sara Marinuzzi told CNN.
    


            Marinuzzi, 28, said gunshots rang out shortly after the event ended at 9 p.m.
    


                    “There were some more shots and then a guy came running into the center, and the security guards offered him water, trying to comfort him. He was kind of having erratic behavior. They figured he witnessed the shooting,” Marinuzzi said.
                





            The man asked security to call the police, Marinuzzi said. Once police arrived about 10 minutes later, Marinuzzi said the man took accountability for the crime, saying “I did it, I did it for Gaza. Free Palestine!”
    


            Details are emerging about the deadly shooting that killed two people near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night.
    


Here's how the attack unfolded:



            President Donald Trump, in his first comments on Wednesday night's shooting, sent his condolences to the families of the two Israeli Embassy staff members who were killed near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.
    


                    “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.
                





            US Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a news conference following a shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC, which killed two people, that she spoke with President Donald Trump “multiple times tonight.”
    


                    “On behalf of the president, his prayers are with all of us, all of the Jewish community, everyone in Washington, DC, state, local and federal agencies, and our great US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who will be prosecuting this case,” Bondi said.
                





            Bondi added that federal agencies will “work hand-in-hand” with DC authorities to do “everything we can to keep our citizens safe.”
    


            “We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” she said.
    


            Trump issued his own statement on Truth Social shortly after, sending his condolences to the families of the couple that was killed.
    


            The two people shot Wednesday night near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC were a “young couple about to be engaged,” according to Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the US.
    


                    “The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of ‘Free Palestine,' was a young couple about to be engaged. A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” Leiter said.
                





            The couple was attending an event at the museum, the ambassador said. When asked by CNN's Holmes Lybrand if the suspect registered for the event, Leiter said he didn't know.
    


            Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said that a suspect is in custody in connection with the shooting near Capital Jewish Museum that left two dead.
    


                    “The preliminary investigation indicates that both victims were exiting an event at the Capitol Jewish Museum located in the 500 block of Third Street Northwest when the shooting occurred,” Smith said. “We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody. Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum.”
                





            Smith said that the suspect, which she named as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, “approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire striking both of our decedents.”
    


            After the shooting, Smith said that the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.
    


            The suspect chanted “Free Free Palestine” while in custody, Smith said.
    


            The suspect, who was not previously known to police, identified where he discarded the weapon once in custody, Smith said. The weapon has been recovered, and “he implied that he committed the offense,” she added.
    


            Following a shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday that killed two people, Mayor Muriel Bowser reassured the community that “there is no active threat.”
    


            “I will say up front that there is no active threat in our community,” Bowser said at a news conference.
    


                    Bowser went on to share a message of unity, saying “We're going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate antisemitism.”
                





            Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with other officials, is giving an update to the shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum.
    


            Tal Naim Cohen, spokesperson at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, said two of the embassy's staff members were shot on Wednesday night “at close range” while attending a Jewish event at the Capital Jewish Museum in the city.
    


                    “We have full faith in law enforcement authorities on both the local and federal levels to apprehend the shooter and protect Israel's representatives and Jewish communities throughout the United States,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
                





            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post on Wednesday that “two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.”
    


                    “We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share. Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice,” Noem said.
                





            DC Police say they are investigating a shooting across the street from the FBI's Washington Field Office. The Capital Jewish Museum is also nearby. The Israeli Embassy is working with law enforcement.
    


            The Israeli ambassador was not involved in the incident and was not at the location when the shooting happened, an embassy spokesperson told CNN.
    


            Ted Deutch, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said his organization was hosting an event at the Capital Jewish Museum Wednesday evening.
    


                    “We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue,” Deutch said in a statement. “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”
                





            Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that she's at the scene of the shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum Wednesday night.
    

I am on the scene of the horrible shooting outside the Washington, DC Capital Jewish Museum with @USAttyPirro. Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more.


            Danny Danon, Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, reacted to the reports of the shooting on Wednesday, saying on X:
    


                    “The fatal shooting that took place outside the event that took place at the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. – in which Israeli embassy employees were also injured – is a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.”
                





            Officials from Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and other European nations have condemned the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum.

A federal judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs. It marks a setback to one of Trump's major campaign promises.

Leavitt used her press briefing to attack by name the federal judge who ruled that the White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries, calling Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston a “liberal activist” and accusing the jurist of threatening U.S. diplomatic relationships.

“Judge Brian Murphy is not the secretary of State. He is not the secretary of defense or the commander in chief. He is a district court judge in Massachusetts. He cannot control the foreign policy or the national security of the United States of America, and to suggest otherwise is being completely absurd,” Leavitt said.

The president will take part in a gathering in Calgary, Canada, from June 15 to June 17 with leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had spoken to Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice will prosecute the alleged gunman to the “fullest extent” of the law.

Leavitt said “hatred has no place in the United States of America” under Trump.

She said the entire White House staff was “praying for the victims' friends and families at this unimaginable time.”

Instead, Melania Trump said Thursday, she used artificial intelligence to generate a replica of her voice reading her memoir, “Melania.”

The 7-hour-long voiced read was created with technology from ElevenLabs, a startup that has helped other people mimic their own voices when medical issues rob them of their speech.

The company's technology also was used to make the audio behind AI robocalls imitating former President Joe Biden that misled voters during the 2024 election.

The first lady's embrace of AI for her book comes as her husband has said he wants to limit regulations on the technology that could hinder innovation. The president and first lady also recently signed the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including through AI deepfakes.

As House Republicans passed their multitrillion-dollar budget bill overnight, 562 state lawmakers signed a letter to Congressional leadership urging them not to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood and calling the organization “an integral and irreplaceable part of the health care system.”

“‘Defunding' Planned Parenthood blocks patients from getting the care they need and increases health care costs for everyone,” the letter said.

Anti-abortion groups have long taken aim at Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding through a mounting initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood.

The federal Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization's 2023 annual report. Contraceptive services and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections make up the vast majority of its medical care. It also performs more cancer screening and prevention procedures than abortions, according to the report.

That's according to an American official familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss an upcoming private diplomatic meeting.

Witkoff and the State Department's director of policy planning Michael Anton will attend Friday's talks in Rome that had been announced earlier by Oman's foreign minister whose country has been mediating the talks, the official said.

The talks, which will be the fifth round of direct and indirect discussions, are expected to be held at the Omani embassy in the Italian capital.

The U.S. Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and plans to stop making the coin when those run out, a Treasury official confirmed Thursday.

The move is expected to produce an immediate annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the news.

In February, President Trump announced he ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin.

Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

The five organizations that had grants terminated by the U.S. Department of Justice in April are suing the department and Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the cancellations unconstitutional and asking that the money be reinstated.

The lawsuit filed late Wednesday by the Vera Institute of Justice, the Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action, FORCE Detroit and Health Resources in Action, asks a federal judge to vacate the midstream grant cancellations.

They ask the court to award class status to the awardees for the more than 360 grants initially worth $820 million that were canceled last month, naming both the Office of Justice Programs and its acting agency head as additional defendants.

The federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump's executive order to shut down the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs.

U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump's goal to dismantle the department. It marks a setback to one of the Republican president's campaign promises.

The dinner Trump is hosting at his suburban Washington golf club is for top investors in a meme coin controlled by his family.

Sen Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, says the dinner means “in effect putting a for sale sign on the White House.”

“It's auctioning off access,” Blumenthal said on a press call.

The senator said those attending Thursday night's dinner don't have to file any federal paperwork — despite enriching the Trump Organization — because crypto currency isn't regulated like traditional campaign donations.

Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said during a contentious House hearing earlier this month, “Never in American history has a sitting president so blatantly violated the ethics laws.”

In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims and with the Israeli people over the attack.

The UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel in a U.S.-brokered deal in 2020, the first of the so-called Abraham Accords that Israel eventually concluded with four Arab nations.

Netanyahu “told the families that he shares in their deep sorrow, together with the entire Jewish People,” his office said in a statement.

The prime minister also spoke with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, his office said.

“It is just a horrific tragedy, an act of terror, and another way in which we have to recognize Jewish people all over the world are being singled out for these kind of horrible attacks,” U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said in an interview on Fox & Friends.

Huckabee went on to push back against critics of Israel's execution of the war in Gaza, blaming Hamas for the war dragging on.

“We've got a lot of ignorant, idiotic people who don't seem to understand the difference between right and wrong,” Huckabee said. “It shouldn't be that complicated.”

It seems like a triumph for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought mainstream acceptance: Top investors in one of President Trump's crypto projects invited to dine with him at his luxury golf club in Northern Virginia on the heels of the Senate advancing key pro-crypto legislation and while bitcoin prices soar.

But Thursday night's dinner for the 220 biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin has raised uncomfortable questions about potentially shadowy buyers using the anonymity of the internet to buy access to the president.

While Democrats charge that Trump is using the power of the presidency to boost profits for his family business, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts worry that the president's push into meme coins isn't helping their efforts to establish the credibility, stability and legitimacy they had thought his administration would bring to their businesses.

The president in his morning social media posting praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican leadership for getting his major tax bill through the lower chamber.

Now, he's pushing Senate Republicans to get moving and notch a political win on Democrats.

“it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!” Trump said. “There is no time to waste. The Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination.”

The group says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to one-third of its health centers closing.

Planned Parenthood said about 200 centers are at risk — most of them in states where abortion is legal. The nation's largest abortion provider also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening. State Medicaid money covers abortion in some states, but not others.

“We're in a fight for survival — not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,” Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the provision, saying in a statement, “Congress took a big step toward stopping taxpayer funding of the Big Abortion industry.”

The U.S. Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal.

The institute's acting president, George Moose, entered the organization's headquarters with private security and the institute's outside attorney for the first time since being escorted off the premises during the DOGE takeover. Moose and most of the institute's board were fired in March, part of the mass slashing of the federal workforce spearheaded by Musk.

The institute and many of its board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and stop DOGE from taking over its operations. U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell's opinion on Monday reversed DOGE's actions.

Speaking after a short examination of the headquarters, Moose said all appeared to be in order.

Republicans made one last round of revisions before the bill reached the House floor, boosting the state and local tax deduction to win over centrists and speeding up the work requirements in Medicaid to win over those who didn't believe the bill did enough to curb spending.

Here's a look at what's in the legislative package, which is expected to undergo more changes when it goes to the Senate:

▶ Read more about what's inside the bill

House Republicans stayed up all night to pass their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package, with Speaker Mike Johnson defying the skeptics and unifying his ranks to muscle Trump's priority bill to approval Thursday.

With last-minute concessions and stark warnings from Trump, the Republican holdouts largely dropped their opposition to salvage the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that's central to the GOP agenda. The House launched debate before midnight and by dawn the vote was called, 215-214, with Democrats staunchly opposed. It next goes to the Senate.

“To put it simply, this bill gets Americans back to winning again,” said Johnson, R-La.

The outcome caps an intense time on Capitol Hill, with days of private negotiations and public committee hearings, many happening back-to-back, around-the-clock. Republicans insisted their sprawling 1,000-page-plus package was what voters sent them to Congress — and Trump to the White House — to accomplish. They believe it will be “rocket fuel,” as one put it during debate, for the uneasy U.S. economy.

Following reports of deportations to South Sudan, the Trump administration said Wednesday it has deported eight migrants convicted of crimes in the United States.

South Sudanese residents on Wednesday weighed in on reports that the US apparently is deporting migrants to their country. If the deportations are confirmed, that means people from Vietnam, Cuba and elsewhere are being sent to a nation they have no link to, thousands of miles from where they want to be.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic African nation of South Sudan, a federal judge said Wednesday, hours after the Trump administration said it had expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes but refused to reveal where they would end up. The judge's statement was a notably strong rebuke to the government's deportation efforts. 

In an emergency hearing he called to address reports that immigrants had been sent to South Sudan, Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. Minutes before the hearing, administration officials accused “activist judges” of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.

“The department actions in this case are unquestionably in violation of this court's order,” Murphy said Wednesday, arguing that the deportees didn't have “meaningful opportunity” to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.

Government attorneys argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. They also pointed out that the judge had not specified the exact time needed between notice and deportation, leaving room for misunderstanding. 

The migrants' home countries — Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan — would not take them back, according to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spoke to reporters in Washington. He later said the migrants either came from countries that often do not take back all their deported citizens or had other situations that meant they could not be sent home.

“These represent the true national security threats,” Lyons said at a news conference. Behind him was a display of photos of men he said had been convicted of rape, homicide, armed robbery and other crimes. 

Administration officials, who have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants, made their displeasure clear Wednesday. 

President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “are working every single day to get these vicious criminals off of American streets — and while activist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. She pointed to the photographs and described them as “the monsters” that Murphy “is trying to protect.”

Homeland Security officials released few specific details about the deportation flight. They said it left Tuesday with eight people on board and said they remained in the department's custody Wednesday. Officials said they could not disclose the migrants' final destination because of “safety and operational security.”

The case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight is the latest flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president's policies. 

With Congress largely silent or supportive, opponents of Trump's agenda have filed hundreds of lawsuits and judges have issued dozens of orders against the administration. Immigration has been the most contentious issue. There was the mistaken deportation of an immigrant who was living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, as well as Trump's push to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court review.

The administration officials insisted that the deported men had received due process, but did not provide details. Immigration-rights attorneys argue they violated Murphy's order, first handed down in March, that says people must have a chance to argue that going somewhere outside their homeland would put them in danger before being deported, even if they've otherwise exhausted their legal appeals. 

“The government is still refusing to provide due process to our clients, which means they are not giving them notice of the country to which they're being deported, proper notice in a language that they understand, and not giving them a meaningful opportunity to claim fear based on those countries,” Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said outside court.

“These are countries that the State Department doesn't want Americans to travel to. They are categorically not safe,” she added.

In court, Realmuto asked the judge to return the individuals to the United States. “They are no less deserving of protection than any other human beings on this planet,” she said.

The government argued the interviews with the men over their fears could be done where they are currently being held and confirmed with Murphy that they can be arranged. Realmuto called this a “logistical nightmare” that penalizes the men because the government violated the judge's order. She said it would prove a challenge to get the men legal counsel and interpreters, an effort complicated by the time difference.

Murphy, who raised the prospect of criminal contempt for anyone “involved in an illegal deportation,” later Wednesday ordered the government conduct a new set of interviews with the migrants if an appropriate place with appropriate privacy can be found. He said the government was welcome to bring the migrants back, but did not order they do so.

On Twitter late Wednesday, DHS' McLaughlin called the order “deranged.”

Attorneys for the immigrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa.

The apparent removal of one man from the troubled Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said. 

A woman also reported that her husband from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote. 

Murphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would “clearly” violate his ruling.

South Sudan's police spokesperson, Maj. Gen. James Monday Enoka, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and “redeported to their correct country” if found not to be South Sudanese.

Edmund Yakani, executive director of the South Sudanese group Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, questioned why people convicted of crimes in the United States would be sent there. “Is South Sudan a land of less human who deserve to receive perpetrators of human rights violations? Without any public explanation?” he asked. 

Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The U.S. has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts. 

South Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top U.N. official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war. 

The State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says “significant human rights issues” include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.

The Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review. 

The U.S is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan's humanitarian aid programs, with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million.

The case for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was simple. He's the best player on an Oklahoma City Thunder team that had the best record this season and set a league mark for margin of victory. If that wasn't enough, he also won the scoring title.

The case for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was simple. He's the best player on an Oklahoma City Thunder team that had the best record this season and set a league mark for margin of victory. If that wasn't enough, he also won the scoring title.

That's an MVP year.

Gilgeous-Alexander was announced Wednesday as the NBA's Most Valuable Player, the Canadian's first time winning the award. It's now seven straight years that a player born outside the U.S. won MVP, extending the longest such streak in league history.

And when it happened, Gilgeous-Alexander said a life of moments — getting cut, traded, overlooked, celebrating, the wins, the good times — all flooded into his mind.

“I don't think there's enough emphasis on how much off the court influences on the court,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “And once I became better off the court my career started to skyrocket. It's no coincidence.”

It ultimately was a two-person race. Gilgeous-Alexander got 71 first-place votes and 29 second-place votes; Denver's Nikola Jokic got the other 29 first-place votes and the other 71 second-place votes.

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, getting 88 of the 100 possible third-place votes.

Gilgeous-Alexander — the No. 11 pick in the 2018 draft — averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game this season, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record. The Thunder outscored teams by 12.9 points per game, the biggest margin in league history.




He becomes the second Canadian to win MVP; Steve Nash won it twice.

“He set the foundation,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of Nash. “He was the first Canadian basketball player I knew of. And without seeing guys go to the NBA from Canada, it wouldn't have been as much of a dream as it was for us as kids growing up. So, to be in a conversation with a guy like that and what he has meant to not only basketball but to the country of Canada, it's special.”

And Gilgeous-Alexander is the first guard to win MVP since James Harden in 2018.

“His value is his confidence,” Oklahoma City's Kenrich Williams said of Gilgeous-Alexander, his Thunder teammate for the last five seasons. “His confidence that he has in himself and the confidence that he instills in every one of his teammates, including the coaches.”

Jokic — a winner of three of the last four MVP awards — was second, despite a season for the ages. He averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game, the first center to average a triple-double and the first player since all those stats were tracked to finish in the NBA's top three in all three of those categories.

It was the sixth instance of a player finishing a season averaging a triple-double — at least 10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds per game. Russell Westbrook did it four times and Oscar Robertson once, but only one of those triple-double seasons led to an MVP win.

“He's a special player,” Jokic said of Gilgeous-Alexander earlier this week when the Thunder eliminated the Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. “His shot selection, his shot capability ... he's always there. He's a special player.”

Antetokounmpo, who averaged 30.4 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, was third. He started this run of international players winning MVP; Antetokounmpo, of Greek and Nigerian descent, won in 2019 and 2020.

Jokic, a Serbian, won in 2021, 2022 and 2024. And Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, who was born in Cameroon but since became a U.S. citizen, won the award in 2023.

Now, it's Gilgeous-Alexander — a son of Ontario, where hockey reigns — carrying the MVP flag. He was fifth in the voting two years ago, second behind Jokic last year, and used being so close to the award as fuel this season.

“There are voters every year. That will never change,” Gilgeous-Alexander said on TNT during the broadcast when the results were revealed. “And last year, all it meant was that more people thought I shouldn't have won than should have won. This year I wanted to change the narrative and have it flipped. I think I did a good job of that.”

Boston's Jayson Tatum was fourth, Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James was sixth — the 20th time in his 22-year career that he got some MVP votes.

Detroit's Cade Cunningham and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards tied for seventh, Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth and three players — the Los Angeles Clippers' Harden, New York's Jalen Brunson and Cleveland's Evan Mobley — tied for 10th.

The MVP award, like most other NBA honors, was voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly before the start of the playoffs.

The other awards that were part of that voting process and have already been unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning coach of the year, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels winning most improved player, San Antonio's Stephon Castle winning rookie of the year, Cleveland's Evan Mobley winning defensive player of the year, New York's Jalen Brunson winning clutch player of the year and Boston's Payton Pritchard winning sixth man of the year.

Other awards announced by the league since the end of the regular season: Golden State's Stephen Curry won the Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year award, Warriors teammate Draymond Green won the hustle award, Oklahoma City's Sam Presti won executive of the year and Boston's Jrue Holiday won the sportsmanship award for the second time in his career as well as the league's social justice award.

The award came at a price for Gilgeous-Alexander, who is in line for an extension that will easily top $300 million and could even see him make about $1 million per regular-season game in 2030-31 and 2031-32.

He promised teammates watches if he won the MVP; those guys have those watches now, and they deserve all that and more, he said. 

“This is nothing compared to what they've been to me,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I would rather have the MVP over a Rolex every day of the week and without them, I wouldn't have the MVP.”

Senior advisor for ‘Make America Healthy Again' Calley Means discusses how the Health and Human Services Department is cutting some artificial dyes from the food supply on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

President Donald Trump's Make America Healthy Again Commission released its anticipated report assessing chronic diseases that have gripped U.S. youths in recent years, pinning blame for a spike in childhood issues on a host of variables stretching from ingesting foods with added chemicals to an increase in prescribing pharmaceuticals to young kids. 

""After a century of costly and ineffective approaches, the federal government will lead a coordinated transformation of our food, health, and scientific systems,"" the report, released Thursday and reviewed by Fox News Digital, outlined. ""This strategic realignment will ensure that all Americans—today and in the future—live longer, healthier lives, supported by systems that prioritize prevention, wellbeing, and resilience."" 

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. serves as chair of the commission and attended a call with the media earlier Thursday, when he explained that the report is a ""diagnosis"" of the state of U.S. health, and that the ""prescription"" for the ongoing issues will be released in 100 days at the end of August in the form of policy recommendations for the federal government. 

The report's findings include teenage depression nearly doubling from 2009 to 2019, more than one-in-five children over the age of 6 being considered obese, one-in-31 children diagnosed with autism by age 8 and childhood cancer spiking by 40% since 1975.  

TRUMP'S 'MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN' COMMISSION TO TARGET AUTISM, CHRONIC DISEASES

""Over 40% of the roughly 73 million children (aged 0-17) in the United States have at least one chronic health condition, according to the CDC, such as asthma, allergies, obesity, autoimmune diseases, or behavioral disorders,"" the report stated. ""Although estimates vary depending on the conditions included, all studies show an alarming increase over time.""

Chronic diseases have a chilling effect on national security, commission members said in a Thursday morning phone call with the media. Roughly 75% of America's youth aged 17–24 do not qualify to serve in the military due to obesity, asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases or behavioral disorders, they said. 

""We now have the most obese, depressed, disabled, medicated population in the history of the world, and we cannot keep going down the same road,"" Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary said in the phone call with the media. ""So this is an amazing day. I hope this marks the grand pivot from a system that is entirely reactionary to a system that will now be proactive.""

MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN: TIMELINE OF THE MAHA MOVEMENT

The report itself pointed to a handful of variables leading to what Kennedy and other Trump administration leaders called a ""chronic disease crisis,"" including a ""food system (that) is safe but could be healthier;"" exposure to environmental chemicals such as pesticides outside or microplastics in food consumed; as well as a culture shift that moved kids from playing outside to being glued to their phones or tablets. 

""American children are highly medicated — and it's not working,"" the report added of another variable compounding the chronic health issues. 

The report found that prescribing medication to children has skyrocketed in recent history, such as a 250% increase in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder prescriptions between 2006 and 2016 despite scientific evidence that the prescriptions did not ""improve outcomes long-term,"" as well as a 1,400% increase between 1987 and 2014 for antidepressant prescriptions for kids, and 800% increase in antipsychotic medications for children between 1993 and 2009.

""These time trends significantly outpace more moderate increases seen in other developed countries,"" the report found. ""Psychotropics for ADHD are one example, prescribed 2.5 times more in US than in British children, and 19 times more than in Japanese youth. The crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in children is therefore both empirically evident, and proportionally specific to American youth."" 

While the report detailed that fluoride, which is a water additive frequently used to protect teeth from decay and cavities, was found to have a ""statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children."" The EPA, the report said, is in the midst of reviewing fluoride data to potentially enact ""revisions to the federal drinking water standard.""

By 2022, more than 60% of Americans — more than 70% of those on public water systems — were consuming fluoridated water, the report said. 

A 2025 systematic review published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzing 74 high-quality studies, found a statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children. The EPA is currently conducting a review of additional research that will inform any potential revisions to the federal drinking water standard. 

FDA'S LATEST MAHA MOVE WOULD WIPE OUT KIDS' FLUORIDE PRESCRIPTIONS AS HEALTH RISK EVIDENCE MOUNTS

Director of the National Institutes of Health Jay Bhattacharya shared during the press call that the report underscores that America's next generation of children are less healthy than their parents and will subsequently live shorter lives if not addressed. 

""What the report says is that the next generation of children will live shorter lives than their parents,"" he said. ""For me as a parent, that is absolutely shocking. The implication is that whatever is happening to our kids, the food that they eat, the environmental exposures they face, the medicines that they take to address the fact that they're sick are not translating over into making them healthier. And in fact, they are less healthy than their parents were at the same age.""

The report found, ""Despite outspending peer nations by more than double per capita on healthcare, the United States ranks last in life expectancy among high-income countries — and suffers higher rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Today's children are the sickest generation in American history in terms of chronic disease and these preventable trends continue to worsen each year, posing a threat to our nation's health, economy, and military readiness.""

The Trump officials stressed on the call that America's food system is ""100% safe,"" but that it could be even healthier, such as shifting from ""ultraprocessed foods"" that contain added ""sugars, chemical additives, and saturated fats, while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables.""

DESANTIS SIGNS BILL BANNING FLUORIDE ADDITIVES IN FLORIDA PUBLIC WATER: 'HYDRATE, NOT MEDICATE'

Kennedy added that the ""holistic"" review of U.S. health as it relates to children includes promoting a strong economy, citing that ""weak economies kill people.""

The report ""represents an invitation to the American people and the American press to have a complex conversation about a nuanced subject, including that environmental policy, good economic policy and good public health policy are ultimately 100% aligned,"" Kennedy said on the press call. 

""The reason for that, particularly regarding public health, is that a strong economy is a social determinant of public health,"" he continued. ""Weak economies kill people. They make people sicker. Large public deaths make people sicker. These are all social determinants. And we learned during COVID that you can't isolate the economy from the public health policy.""

Trump signed an executive order in February establishing the commission, chaired by Kennedy and joined by other agency leaders such as EPA chief Lee Zeldin, USDA's Brooke Rollins and VA Secretary Doug Collins. The executive order directed the commission to release ""an assessment that summarizes what is known and what questions remain regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, and include international comparisons.""

The commission will release its next report advising on how to tackle chronic health issues in the next 100 days, which falls on Aug. 30.

Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke reports on the latest religious liberty case before the Supreme Court on 'Special Report.'

An evenly divided Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against a religious school that sought public funding from the state of Oklahoma. 

In a 4-4 vote, the justices upheld the Oklahoma State Supreme Court's decision that for St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma City to receive public funds would be unconstitutional. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had recused herself from the case. 

The court issued a one-sentence ruling upholding the lower court's decision, saying only: ""The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.""

Oklahoma has argued that providing state funds for a religious charter school violates the First Amendment.

The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board approved St. Isidore's contract request in June 2023, making them eligible to receive public funds. The school agreed that it would be free and open to all students ""as a traditional public school,"" and would comply with local, state and federal education laws.

But St. Isidore also indicated that the school ""fully embraces the teachings"" of the Catholic Church and participates ""in the evangelizing mission of the church.""

Its ability to receive state funding was later blocked by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that using the funds for a religious school was in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond sued to block the approval of the school's state charter, calling it an ""unlawful sponsorship"" of a sectarian institution, and ""a serious threat to the religious liberty of all four-million Oklahomans."" 

That argument was appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in October.

In more than two hours of wide-ranging oral arguments last month, justices appeared split along ideological lines over whether to allow St. Isidore to become the first religious charter school in the U.S. 

The justices focused on two questions during the oral arguments: First was whether charter schools should be treated as public schools, which are considered extensions of the state and therefore subject to the Establishment Cause and its ban establishing or endorsing a religion; or if the school should be considered a private entity or contractor, which was the argument made by St. Isidore.

The second question was whether Oklahoma's actions violated the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution, by placing what the school argues is an undue burden on its religious mission.

The decision comes as the Supreme Court's conservative majority has, in recent years, ruled in favor of allowing taxpayer funds to be allocated to some religious organizations to provide ""non-sectarian services"" such as adoption services or food banks.

In this case, the justices debated what limits on curriculum supervision and control would be placed on the religious charter school, if its contract with the state was allowed to move forward.

Justices Kentanji Brown Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kegan pressed attorneys for the school on how they would treat students with different religious backgrounds who might opt to attend.

There is no indication of how each justice ultimately voted.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republican leadership celebrated passing President Donald Trump's ‘one big, beautiful bill' on Thursday morning.

House Republicans took a victory lap Thursday morning after passing President Donald Trump's ""one big, beautiful bill."" 

""It's finally morning in America again,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed 215 to 214. All Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, voted against the bill. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., voted ""present.""

""Today, the House has passed generational, truly nation-shaping legislation to reduce spending and permanently lower taxes for families and job creators, secure the border, unleash American energy dominance, restore peace through strength and make government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans,"" Johnson added.

The bill is a victory for Trump and House Republicans, who overcame policy disagreements to deliver on Trump's key campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts and no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security. 

TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY

""We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation. We stand ready to continue our work together to deliver on the one big, beautiful bill, as President Trump named it himself. We're going to send that to his desk. We're going to get there by Independence Day, on July 4th, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,"" Johnson said. 

House leaders took turns Thursday thanking Republicans for rallying together to pass the bill.

""Democrats made it very clear they didn't want to have any part in helping get America back on track again, but we were never fettered when this bill could have failed 10 times over. We said we were going to get this done, and failure is not an option. And we meant it,"" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.

Trump celebrated his victory on Thursday in a Truth Social post. 

""Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time to waste,"" Trump wrote. 

The multitrillion-dollar bill includes provisions to advance Trump's ""America First"" agenda by lowering taxes, securing the border, increasing national defense, reforming Medicaid and slashing Biden-era energy policies. 

The bill aims to make a dent in the federal government's spending trajectory by cutting roughly $1.5 trillion in government spending elsewhere. The U.S. government is still more than $36 trillion in debt and has spent $1.05 trillion more than it has collected in the 2025 fiscal year, according to the Treasury Department.

""Take this as a lesson. Don't bet against the House Republicans. We've shown, time and time again, that we deliver for the American people, especially when it matters most. By taking hold of this historic opportunity, I truly believe we've unlocked the opportunities for generations to come,"" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said. 

Republicans on Thursday slammed their House Democratic colleagues for delaying the bill's passage — down to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' 30-minute ""magic minute"" before House votes.

""Democrats voted to put Americans last, and it's a shame. But thank God for House Republicans, and thank God for our president, Donald J. Trump,"" said GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich.

But the ""big, beautiful bill"" still has a big hurdle ahead. The Senate is tasked with passing its own version of the bill, and Republican leaders are hoping to send the bill to Trump's desk by the Fourth of July. 

Senate Republicans have already signaled they expect to make changes to the bill when it reaches the upper chamber, despite House GOP leaders publicly urging them to amend as little as possible.

A significant number of senators have voiced concern over the extent of Medicaid and SNAP cuts proposed by the House. Meanwhile, raising the SALT deduction cap could face resistance in the Senate, where no Republicans represent blue states — unlike in the House, where districts in New York and California are key to the GOP majority.

And Senate Democrats are already piling on the criticism of Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

""This is not one big, beautiful bill. It's ugly. There's nothing beautiful about stripping away people's healthcare, forcing kids to go hungry, denying communities the resources they need, and increasing poverty,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Thursday.

'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Matt Towery and Ari Fleischer discuss President Donald Trump's latest poll numbers.

Four months into his second tour of duty in the White House, President Donald Trump's approval ratings remain slightly underwater.

The president stands at 46% approval and 54% disapproval in a new national survey by Marquette Law School. And Trump is at 42% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll. 

Most, but not all, of the latest national surveys place the president's approval rating in negative territory, with a handful indicating Trump is above water.

Trump has aggressively asserted executive authority in his second term, overturning longstanding government policy and aiming to make major cuts to the federal workforce through an avalanche of sweeping and controversial executive orders and actions, with some aimed at addressing grievances he has held since his first term.

Trump started his second administration with poll numbers in positive territory, but his poll numbers started to slide soon after his late-January inauguration.

But two issues where the president remains at or above water in some surveys are border security and immigration, which were front and center in Trump's successful 2024 campaign to win back the White House.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING

Trump stands at 56% approval on border security and 50% approval on immigration in the Marquette Law School poll, which was conducted May 5-15.

But Trump's muscular moves on border security and immigration, which have sparked controversy and legal pushback, don't appear to be helping his overall approval ratings.

""Immigration is declining now as a salient issue,"" said Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll.

 (Fox News)

Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, said ""immigration and especially border security are beginning to lose steam as one of the top-three issues facing the country. Republicans still rate them fairly highly, but Democrats and independents, who had kind of joined the chorus in 2024, have moved on and in particular moved back to the economy as a focal point.""

Pointing to Trump, Shaw added that ""when you have success on an issue, it tends to move to the back burner.""

Contributing to the slide over the past couple of months in Trump's overall approval ratings was his performance on the economy and, in particular, inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former President Joe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.

Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.

But the markets have rebounded, thanks in part to a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff as Trump tapped the brakes on his controversial tariff implementation.

Trump stood at 37% approval on tariffs and 34% on inflation/cost of living in the Marquette Law School poll. And he stood at 39% on the economy and 33% on cost of living in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted May 16-18.

Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist and former RNC and Bush administration official, pointed to last year's election, saying, ""The main reason Trump won was to lower prices. Prices haven't lowered, and polls are reflecting that.""

""With the exception of gas prices, there hasn't been much of a reduction in prices,"" Shaw said.

""Prices haven't come down, and it's not clear that people will say the absence of inflation is an economic victory. They still feel that an appreciable portion of their money is going to pay for basic things,"" he added. ""What Trump is realizing is that prices have to come down for him to be able to declare success.""

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return.

A federal judge blocked President Donald Trump's administration from firing two Democratic members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board on Wednesday.

Trump fired all three Democratic members of the five-person board in February, resulting in two of them filing a lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton found that allowing unilateral firings would prevent the board from carrying out its purpose.

Walton wrote that allowing at-will removals would make the board ""beholden to the very authority it is supposed to oversee on behalf of Congress and the American people.""

The oversight board was initially created by Congress to ensure that federal counterterrorism policies were in line with privacy and civil liberties law.

""To hold otherwise would be to bless the President's obvious attempt to exercise power beyond that granted to him by the Constitution and shield the Executive Branch's counterterrorism actions from independent oversight, public scrutiny, and bipartisan congressional insight regarding those actions,"" Walton wrote.

Trump's firings left just one Republican on the board. The third Democratic member had just two days left in her term when she was removed, and she did not sue the administration.

The two plaintiffs, Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, argued in their lawsuit that members of the board cannot be fired without cause. Meanwhile, lawyers for Trump's administration argued that members of other congressionally created boards do have explicit job protections, and it would therefore be wrong for Walton to create such protections where they are absent.

""The Constitution gives President Trump the power to remove personnel who exercise his executive authority,"" White House spokesman Harrison Fields told the Associated Press. ""The Trump Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.""

The plaintiffs also argued that their firings left just one member on the board, a Republican, and that falls short of the quorum required for the board to function.

American tennis player Danielle Collins had some choice words for the cameraman during her Internationaux de Strasbourg match against Emma Raducanu on Wednesday afternoon.

Collins was in the middle of a changeover when she felt the cameraman's hovering was a bit too close for comfort in the middle of the third and defining set. She got off the bench and made the point clear.

""I need to get water. We're on a changeover. You don't need to be that close to me, and you don't need to be on top of Emma. It's wildly inappropriate,"" Collins said. ""It's not that difficult to give space.""

The camera was kept on Collins as she filled up her water bottle with Raducanu in the shot to the right.

Collins ended up winning the match 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, and is set to take on Anna Kalinskaya in the quarterfinals of the tournament.

Raducanu weighed in on what she heard from Collins during her outburst.

""I was standing up because I did not want to sit down in the third set because of my back,"" Raducanu said, via The Tennis Gazette. ""I was staying standing because it was a bit more comfortable, and then she came to fill her bottle up and was just saying how the cameraman was really close and felt a bit inappropriate, but that is all she was saying.""

When CNN's Jake Tapper went on his book tour, he probably did not expect it to turn into an apology tour instead. Yet that is what has happened as his media blitz has quickly given way to mea culpas. 

“Knowing what I know now, obviously I feel tremendous humility about my coverage,” Tapper confessed to Megyn Kelly when he joined her influential podcast to discuss the book he co-authored with Alex Thompson, a reporter for Axios, about the age-related decline of former President Joe Biden and its cover-up.

“That Lara Trump interview, for example — she saw something that I did not see at the time,” Tapper continued. “100%. And I own that.” Here, Tapper is referring to a 2020 interview he did with Lara Trump in which he accused her of ridiculing Biden's stutter at an event. She replied that she “had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter. I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline.”

“You are so amazing,” Tapper shot back. “‘A cognitive decline.'” The CNN anchor now says he apologized to Lara Trump “months ago.” He added, “But yeah, I mean, of course, I look back at my coverage with humility. And I wish I had covered the issues of age and acuity — but I wish I had covered them much more.”

The reappraisal of Biden's physical and mental abilities while in office is really primarily a media story. Yes, Biden was enabled by people around him, including his family and White House staff. They took steps to limit the exposure of his infirmities to Beltway elites and the general public. The former president himself was stubborn, an 82-year-old man clinging to a job he had been campaigning for since at least 1987, and asking voters to allow him to keep it past his 86th birthday.

But it was the task of the press to report facts that would help voters understand whether Biden was up to doing that highly coveted job. While voters came to doubt Biden's fitness to serve, according to numerous polls, there was little appetite for covering these stories outside of conservative media. (In giving him an award for his 2024 coverage of Biden, the White House Correspondents Association seemingly acknowledged Thompson was a rare exception to the rule.) 

The steady stream of new accounts examining Biden's limitations as president, including the Tapper-Thompson Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, contains revelatory details and interesting color. But they don't reach conclusions about Biden's condition that are markedly different from those most voters, including many rank-and-file Democrats, arrived at on their own simply by watching him. And they put the blame on Democratic politicians and Biden aides more than the media.

Reading the Washington Examiner would have helped voters gain insight into Biden's age problem years before the current flood of books only now being published after he left office. “Whatever their differences, the two front-runners in the Democratic presidential race, Joe Biden, born November 20, 1942, and Bernie Sanders, born September 8, 1941, share one common trait: They are too old to be president,” chief political correspondent Byron York wrote in April 2019. 

“And that fact is, Biden, now 77, has clearly slowed down,” York wrote in late July 2020. “He does not appear to be as vigorous as he was during his 44 years in the federal government. … At the moment, Biden is facing very little commentary and criticism about his age. There was more discussion of age when Republican John McCain, who would have been 72 had he been elected, ran in 2008, and when Republican Bob Dole, who would have been 73, ran in 1996. But Biden, who would be 78, attracts less talk.”

Editor-in-Chief Hugo Gurdon described Biden as “an old man in a new world” in March 2020. “The problem with bygone eras, however, is that they are bygone,” he wrote. “There is no going back. Biden is avowedly yesterday's man; his rhetoric is all about (dubious) past achievements.”

“President Joe Biden's great age and concomitant physical and mental decline have been subjects of intensifying contention since before Democrats first chose him as their leader in 2020,” Gurdon wrote in late 2023, nearly 190 days before Biden's catastrophic debate with President Donald Trump. “Back then, he was only — only! — 77 years old. Now, he is 81, and if he is reelected, he'll swear his oath of office at the age of 82. If he makes it through a second term, he'll quit the White House at 86.”

Gurdon added that Biden's “aides and first lady Jill Biden do their best to manage his schedule and lighten his load. They want to reduce his commitments, so he doesn't tire himself out, thereby cutting down on opportunities for him to embarrass himself and the rest of us at our choice of president.”

David Freddoso wrote for the Washington Examiner magazine in February 2024 about how some progressive Democrats saw Biden's deficits as an asset.  Their case was “that Biden does not matter. He might have the title of president, but it is the young, radical aides from the Obama era who are really running the country in his name.”

Megyn Kelly, her former colleagues at Fox News, and many others in conservative media raised similar questions about Biden. Only intermittently do they escape that bubble. 

“Could Democrats and their allies in America's newsrooms have nudged or even muscled Biden out of office?” Noah Rothman asked in National Review in September 2023. “A president who wants to remain president is extremely difficult to dislodge from office. But it's not impossible to imagine a popular groundswell in which the press, backed by supermajorities of Democrats, had successfully applied all its leverage with the aim of convincing Biden to bow out at the end of his first term.”

At the time, Rothman thought the Democrats' and the legacy media's moment had passed. But this exact scenario unfolded much as he described it in the aftermath of Biden's dreadful June 27, 2024, debate showing. That's when the press as a whole, without any “conservative” qualifier, turned sharply against Biden as it appeared he was not up to beating Trump a second time.

One issue was surely that Democratic sources were then willing to come out of the woodworks to talk about their own experiences with — or lack of unfiltered access to — Biden. Olivia Nuzzi's New York magazine piece came out seven days after the debate. There was clearly some reporting in the can. 

When the Wall Street Journal's Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes reported in early June 2024 that Biden was “slipping” behind closed doors — one of the White House's defenses of Biden was how sharp he was in private settings, conveniently outside the cameras' view — many of the on-the-record sources were Republicans and Democrats disputed the story. After the debate, some Democrats who had publicly pushed back began calling for Biden to reconsider his reelection campaign. 

Some outlets undoubtedly preferred to have concerns about Biden's age and capacity to run or serve come from Democrats rather than let Republicans repeat their familiar criticisms of “Sleepy Joe.” Man bites dog, Dems bite Biden. After the debate, more Democrats were willing to go on the record with these complaints, and it's likely that editors were more comfortable running what was still on background. 

“The editors who drove a lot of these coverage decisions will remain quiet and hidden,” Axios reporter Marc Caputo wrote on X. “They'll never fess up. They'll never look inward. They'll let the reporters take the criticism for the decisions they made.”

But that doesn't explain the near-uniformity of the coverage decisions, the eagerness to accept the White House's framing of age and decline stories by people who observed Biden more regularly than concerned voters did, or even confident proclamations that Biden was totally fine. The most famous example of the last phenomenon is MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, who was a congressman while Biden was still in the Senate. 

“This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever,” Scarborough asserted in March 2024, after calling the then-president “more than cogent.” The Morning Joe host finally admitted on Wednesday that he was “obviously wrong.” (Albeit with more caveats than he applied to his original statement.)

The obviousness is now being used to defend how Biden was covered. Mark Leibovich unloaded in the Atlantic about “why I think that the ‘cover-up' of Biden's ‘true condition' is beside the point — and why I'm not really vibing with the umbrage-mongering: It's pretty much impossible to ‘cover up' for something that is hiding in plain sight.”

“Democrats could trot out as many White House officials as they wanted to claim I was with the president just this morning, and he was sharp as a tack and running circles around staffers less than half his age,” he continued. “But whenever Biden was allowed to go out in public — a rarity, which itself was a red flag — the public's preexisting consensus about his infirmity was only reinforced.”

Journalistic problems with this take aside, Leibovich sang a different tune in 2023. “It's not just making an issue of Biden's age, it's lying,” he said on a PBS roundtable show. “It's saying he's senile, saying he's demented, saying he's out of it.” Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg responded, “Right. Mentally, he's quite acute.” Leibovich then replied, “It seems like it.”

Fast-forward to May 2025, and now Leibovich writes, “Biden was in no position to keep doing his job given his condition, which had been evident for years to most people paying even casual attention.”

Leibovich, nevertheless, highlights, however tendentiously, an important point: Biden has spoken on television and in public for decades. He was a two-term vice president who, before that, was a senator for 36 years. He was elected president on his third try. His diminishment as a communicator, at least, was obvious to anyone covering him. And Biden's public schedule both suggested that the White House was cognizant of that decline and that there was, as Tapper and Thompson write in their book, “a limit to the hours in which he could reliably function.”

There was nothing former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre or top advisers like Anita Dunn or $4 million man Michael Donilon could really say that would alter what voters — or journalists, for that matter — could see and hear for themselves.

A real test of whether anyone has learned anything will be how the larger media treats questions surrounding Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and transparency about his health while he was still president. Those questions should be handled sensitively, given the severity of Biden's condition, but they still need to be asked and answered forthrightly. 

So far, it has been a mixed bag: a number of nuanced interviews with urologists and other medical experts discussing the odds that Biden's cancer would have appeared so suddenly, but also an at least arguably disproportionate focus on what Trump is saying — almost always “without evidence” — about the matter. Some Democrats have urged that the discussion be “muted” as Biden recovers. But it is still early. 

DEMOCRATS SUGGEST A ‘PAUSE' IN BIDEN HEALTH TALK AFTER CANCER DIAGNOSIS 

“Alex and I are here to say the conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul searching, not just among me, but among the legacy media,” Tapper told Kelly.

She seemed skeptical. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The fate of the “one big beautiful” bill remains unclear as Freedom Caucus members hinge their support on whether the deal they made with President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday is cemented in the legislative text.

The manager's amendment, which allows for alterations to the bill, dropped a little before 9 p.m. Among the changes were a higher cap of $40,000 for the state and local tax deduction, a key demand of blue-state Republicans; Medicaid work requirements that begin Dec. 31, 2026, instead of 2029; and an earlier phase-out date for some of the Inflation Reduction Act energy credits. The latter two were sticking points for the Freedom Caucus.

The amendment also strikes language to sell federal lands in Nevada and Utah, changes “MAGA” savings accounts for children to “Trump accounts,” and removes a federal requirement that firearm suppressors must be registered.

Whether this is enough to sway fiscal hawks remains to be seen. They had emerged tight-lipped from a meeting at the White House after talks on how to move the bill forward fell apart overnight.

The Rules Committee has been debating the bill for nearly 20 hours as Democrats offer up hundreds of amendments on legislation that includes over $1.5 trillion in cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks. Over one hundred Democrats testified in front of the Rules Committee.

If it passes the Rules Committee, there will be two hours of debate on the House floor on the bill.

Neither Trump nor the holdouts met with reporters after the conclusion of the White House meeting. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it “was productive and moved the ball in the right direction.” 

“The President reiterated how critical it is for the country to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill as quickly as possible,” Leavitt said.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), who sits on the Rules Committee, wouldn't say if he would vote for the bill after receiving a deal from the White House, because he wanted to see everything they agreed to set in stone before making a decision.

“I'm not saying anything until I see it in writing,” Norman told reporters. “I'm not going to say, because things move around up here … one word could change this whole thing.”

“We're going to get back together once we see it in writing, all of us that you saw in here, do that, and make a call,” Norman added, referring to the caucus members.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), who were also at the White House meeting, were optimistic when they returned to Capitol Hill. They told reporters that they would be moving forward with the legislation and to expect a vote “tonight or tomorrow morning.” 

A whip notice sent out Wednesday night detailed that the House would proceed with a vote series later in the night or early Thursday morning, though no specific times have been provided.

“I think that all of our colleagues here will really like this final product, and I think we move forward,” Johnson said.

The speaker said there would be some “minor details” changed in the bill, which appears to be the case. Freedom Caucus members declined to share any changes they agreed to or whether they'd vote for the bill when exiting a meeting with Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) Wednesday evening.

Republicans are now aiming to have a vote on the package in the “wee hours,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) told reporters exiting the meeting. He said he is voting for the bill and approves of the “whole of government approach” the White House pitched.

Several of his colleagues left the Freedom Caucus meeting without providing details.

Reps. Eli Crane (R-AZ) and Keith Self (R-TX) said “no comment” when asked if they'd vote yes on the bill. Rep. Josh Brecheen (R-OK), who was one of four GOP lawmakers who held up the vote in the Budget Committee, quipped, “All you'll get from me is a long pause.” 

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), one of the most vocal fiscal hawks opposed to the bill text, was completely silent as he left the meeting. He wouldn't answer any questions from reporters related to his vote or the details of the White House deal.

While Freedom Caucus members were huddling, centrist GOP lawmakers met in the speaker's office to chat with Johnson. Main Street Caucus Chairman Dusty Johnson (R-SD) echoed the speaker, promising a “modest number of tweaks.”

TRUMP'S UNITY SPEECH DOESN'T SWAY SALT OR FREEDOM CAUCUS REPUBLICANS AT THE CAPITOL

“We are getting very close to a bill that is going to be able to garner the votes necessary for passage,” Dusty Johnson said. “We have every expectation. The speaker has every expectation that we will get there.”

“The president was incredibly helpful, and that meeting was incredible,” the South Dakota Republican added. “It was really productive and it had a material impact on moving the bill in the right direction.”

In an elaborate battle of Senate procedure, Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) set the stage for California‘s strict emissions standards to be repealed.

The gambit, which unfolded over five hours of voting on Wednesday night, required Thune to establish that Republicans have the authority to undo three environmental waivers granted to California at the end of the Biden administration.

But first, Republicans had to overcome a series of objections raised by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who accused Republicans of setting a filibuster-breaking precedent with their vote.

A vote for repeal would ignore the Government Accountability Office, which determined the waivers are not eligible under a fast-tracking process used to reverse regulations.

However, Republicans argued that the waiver was a peculiar circumstance that needed Senate clarification, and that the GAO had erred by weighing in.

In a 51-46 vote that fell along party lines, Republicans affirmed their ability to repeal the waivers, clearing the way for the first of three to be withdrawn on Thursday morning.

The floor vote reflected a carefully calibrated attempt not to challenge the parliamentarian directly, a prospect that initially prompted GOP concern. The parliamentarian said she would side with the GAO if asked for a ruling.

It also marked an early test of Thune's control of the floor since he became majority leader in January.

Democrats were ultimately unsuccessful as Schumer moved to recess or adjourn the chamber. In one convoluted exchange, he attempted to block Thune by raising a “point of order that points of order are not in order.”

Schumer relented shortly before 11 p.m., but not before warning that Democrats would take an expansive view of the filibuster-skirting Congressional Review Act when they returned to power.

“Make no mistake, Republicans have set a new precedent that will come back to haunt them and haunt this chamber,” Schumer said. “What goes around comes around.”

THUNE IGNORES PARLIAMENTARIAN TO TEE UP CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS VOTE

Thune rebutted Schumer in a Tuesday floor speech announcing the vote and again on Wednesday. In a Washington Examiner op-ed, Thune denied that Republicans were weakening the filibuster and accused the “audacious” GAO of improperly limiting Congress's power.

Both the Trump administration and the GOP-led House have interpreted the waivers as regulations eligible for repeal.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The suspected gunman accused of murdering two Israeli diplomats on Wednesday night allegedly chanted “free, free Palestine” while in the custody of law enforcement officials. The shooting occurred at an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.

A post shared by Jewish Lives Matter (@jewishlivesmatter)

While updating the media about the murders, Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith provided the name of the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, and chronicled the events leading up to the shooting. She said he shot at four people before killing the man and woman whose identities were not initially released, according to reports.

Early Thursday morning, the victims were identified as Israeli Embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.

“Prior to the shooting, a suspect was observed pacing outside of the museum,” Smith said. 

“The suspect chanted, ‘free, free Palestine,' while in custody. The suspect has been identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, Illinois,” Smith added.

She said the victims were about to be engaged, with the male victim recently purchasing a wedding ring and planning to propose during a visit to Jerusalem. 

“The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of ‘free Palestine' was a couple about to be engaged,” Smith said. 

Tal Naim Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said the victims were shot and killed “at close range,” the Times of Israel reported.

Attorney General Pam Bondi visited the crime scene shortly after the news of the murders. She and Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro detailed the incident at a press conference. Pirro will prosecute the case. Bondi condemned the act of violence. 

Bondi posted about the shooting on her X account and said she is praying for the victims. 

I am on the scene of the horrible shooting outside the Washington, DC Capital Jewish Museum with @USAttyPirro. Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more.

Earlier in the night, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also condemned the attack, calling it a “depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism” in a post on X.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) also commented about the attack, saying the “free Palestine” mantra is now associated with “terrorism.”

Starting with his claims of an “autism epidemic.”

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

Expressing concern can sometimes be a delicate endeavor. One can intend to be empathetic, but the target of concern hears only condescension and pity. So it is with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who recently talked about how much autistic children suffer. These poor kids, he said at a July 16 press conference, would never “pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use the toilet unassisted.” Listening to Kennedy, some parents of autistic children felt seen. “I found myself nodding along as Mr. Kennedy spoke about the grim realities of profound autism,” Emily May, whose daughter has limited verbal ability, wrote in The New York Times. But our guest this week, Eric Garcia, who attended the press conference, saw it differently. Such an intimate and detailed accounting of their failures, Garcia says, “almost bordered on pornography to me.”

Garcia, the author of We're Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation and a political reporter at the Independent, has watched as Kennedy's forceful entry into the autism debate has deepened confusion about the condition and opened up rifts in the autism community. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Garcia about myths spreading about autism under Kennedy. Yes, there's the one about how vaccines cause autism, which the scientific community has rejected. But there's also a more fundamental one that Kennedy references often: Is there, as he repeats, an “autism epidemic”? And if not, what explains the dramatic rise in reported cases of autism over the past few decades? Garcia also recounts his own story growing up autistic in the age of exploding diagnoses, and landing now in a moment where, for his job, he covers a health secretary's particular brand of concern.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is very concerned about autism. He has been for a couple of decades, since he first became convinced that mercury in vaccines made children autistic, which by the way, there is no credible evidence supporting this theory.

On April 16, now as head of Health and Human Services, RFK gave a press conference, and he described the tragedy of what he calls the autism “epidemic.”

For years, he has insisted there is an epidemic, even though there is a lot of debate among researchers about this—all of which he dismisses as “epidemic denial,” a term he repeated several times in that press conference.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: There are many, many other studies that affirm this, and instead of listening to this canard of epidemic denial, all you have to do is start reading a little science, because the answer is very clear, and this is catastrophic for our country.

Rosin: “Catastrophic,” he says, because families continue to suffer, because their child will never, as he put it, do many of the things that make life worth living.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.

There is a lot of confusion out there about autism—why it's increasing, if it's even increasing. And what even counts as autism? And I think it's fair to say that RFK's strong and public entry into this debate has not in any way helped to clear things up.

So we're gonna talk to someone who writes about autism and also covers politics for the U.K. paper the Independent, and is himself autistic: Eric Garcia, author of We're Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation.

Eric, welcome to the show.

Eric Garcia: Thank you.

Rosin: Eric, you covered that April 16 press conference that RFK held about autism. Was there anything in his statement that stuck out to you?

Garcia: Yeah, you know, there was obviously the whole thing, which is that “autism destroys families.”

RFK Jr.: This is an individual tragedy as well. Autism destroys families, and more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children.

Garcia: Saying that autism destroys children or destroys families is so corrosive, and it goes into the larger stereotype that people with disabilities are a burden.

RFK Jr.: These are kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.

Garcia: I hear him taking some of the most intimate and graphic details of autistic people's lives and using it as a pawn for spreading disinformation.

RFK Jr.: These are children who should not be—who should not be suffering like this. These are kids who, many of them were fully functional and regressed because of some environmental exposure into autism when they're 2 years old. And we have to recognize we are doing this to our children.

Garcia: And I see him also taking the real challenges that high-support-needs people [have] and making their lives seem like a tragedy rather than lives that are whole and worthy on their own. This isn't to say that they don't face significant challenges. They absolutely do, but exploiting their experiences in such a public way, in some ways, almost bordered on pornography to me.

Rosin: I want to get into RFK's actual ideas about autism. Let's start with the idea that there's an autism epidemic. This is something he's been saying for decades. It's a critical part of his argument. It's the assumption from which everything else flows: There is an epidemic, so we have to get to the root of it and do something about it. So I'm going to do something that's not that podcast friendly, which is look at what anybody listening to this podcast could do, which is Google the term increase in autism diagnoses, increase in autism, and you'll see—can you describe what you're looking at?

Garcia: Yeah, it's known kind of, like, as the hockey stick.

Rosin: Yeah.

Garcia: What you see is that over time, there was an increase in diagnoses. So it says that something like one in 10,000 kids in the past had an autism diagnosis. And then over time, that number just increases and increases, and it makes it look like, on a very surface level with a very surface-level understanding, that this is an epidemic.

Rosin: Right. And I want to pause here because I feel like this is very confusing to people. Anybody can Google these charts, and pretty much any year you start in—so there's a chart that shows California. You can start in the '40s and '50s. Basically, nobody has autism.

Garcia: Correct.

And then it's around the year 1990 when it starts to lift. And then you get to 2020, and it booms into the sky. Now, you can do this about Northern Ireland, California, Sweden—

Garcia: Oman, China.

Rosin: —Oman, China. I mean, basically everybody would look at these charts and hear RFK say there's an autism epidemic, and it makes some kind of sense. And I think it's really important to pause here because that's what a layperson who knows nothing would pick up.

Garcia: It totally makes sense that on the surface it looks like there's this spike. But you have to remember, of course, autism didn't get a separate diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 1980. It didn't get one. Then you got what was then called Asperger's syndrome, thanks to the research of Lorna Wing in the United Kingdom. Then in 1994, which was the year that my parents started screening me for things, you got I believe it was PDD-NOS, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. But, you know, it was this gradual improvement in and broadening of the spectrum. And then in 2013, what happened is the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the DSM, puts all of these diagnoses under one umbrella as autism spectrum disorder, and there are levels.

There's Level 1 autism, which is people who can speak in full sentences but might have difficulty with sensory processing or might have difficulty with social interaction. Then there's Level 2, where they might be able to speak in smaller sentences or smaller words. And then there's Level 3, which is where they need, you know, I think, the classic around-the-clock care that we typically associated with autism—and we still associate with autism. And we shouldn't erase those people. But I think that it's important to remember that the diagnostic criteria was changing at the time.

Rosin: Right, so all this broadening of the diagnostic criteria, all the stuff you're describing, that explains a lot of the sudden rise, what RFK is calling “the epidemic.”

Garcia: Yes. This was around the time that people with disabilities received more rights. The [Americans with Disabilities Act] was passed in 1990. And it's important to remember that even though autism wasn't really mentioned in the ADA, it was mentioned specifically in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and that just meant that you saw an increase in the number of children being served who had what we now consider autism spectrum disorder.

So it's kind of this strange marriage of the science improving and government policy causing a windfall. So it was easy, I think, for people to look at those numbers and say epidemic.

Rosin: Right. And the obvious question is why? Now, RFK seems pretty certain about what the cause is.

RFK Jr.: Within three weeks—and probably, we're hoping, in two weeks—we're going to announce a series of new studies to identify precisely what the environmental toxins are that are causing it. This has not been done before, and we're going to do it in a thorough and comprehensive way, and we're going to get back with an answer to the American people very, very quickly.

Rosin: By the way, Eric, it's been, like, two or three weeks, and that report never came out, at least not yet. But the important phrase to me in that is “precisely what environmental toxins are causing it,” not if environmental toxins are causing it but which ones. So what does he mean by that? He's basically concluded, despite this openness he has to doing research, that the cause of autism is environmental toxins. What is he referring to?

Garcia: This is something that's been talked about for a long time, which is that environmental toxins have contributed, if not play a major role, in the increase in autism rates.

And then the other major culprit is, of course, vaccinations, and particularly the MMR vaccination—the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. And that has been debunked multiple times. The guy who put out that study, Andrew Wakefield, had his medical license revoked in the United Kingdom, and the study that was put out in 1998 was retracted in 2010.

Rosin: Right. So we have pinned down what RFK believes: This is an environmental toxin. Let's get to the root of it.

Garcia: Correct.

Rosin: That's his belief, and he happens to be the secretary of the HHS, so his belief holds some weight right now. Now let's shift from what he believes to what the scientific consensus and the world is saying, versus what RFK is saying. When were you born?

Garcia: I was born in 1990.

Rosin: 1990. Okay. That's a critical year because it's around the period that everyone pinpoints to when autism starts to explode. What is your experience as a child, growing child of how people are talking about autism?

Garcia: This is really interesting. It's funny, the way that my mom says it is that—so we were living in Wisconsin at the time, and she read this ad on the paper for, like, free pre-K screenings. This is, like, in 1994 or '95. They couldn't pinpoint, but they said there was something “wrong” with me or there was something—like I wasn't hitting the marks.

But you have to remember, of course: There's always a lag in scientific understanding, like, when something is established, you know, officially versus when it enters our bloodstream, so to speak, or enters the zeitgeist.

So they didn't know, but they were like, Well, he's verbal. He could speak, so we don't know if that's autism, and things like that. And then what happened was we moved to Sacramento, and what happened, according to my mom, is that she's trying to get services, things like that. They say, He's fine. There's nothing wrong with him. It's weird—like, in Wisconsin, they're like, Something's, quote, unquote, “wrong.” And then in California it's, There's, quote, unquote, “nothing wrong with him.”

And then it just so happens that my dad's boss's wife happened to be the head of, like, special education for the entire region. So that got me, like, an in. And then what happened is afterward, we moved to San Antonio, Texas, and there was this one doctor who, I guess, had been researching autism for a while. And then they were like, Well, this is what it's called—this Asperger's syndrome.

And then, like, I started—and it's funny because, you know, when you hear this term Asperger's syndrome, it's like you can imagine the kind of jokes that are made on the playground at the time. And, you know, it was funny because my diagnostic journey kind of matched the science and the public understanding as it was coming.

[Music]

Rosin: So the scientific consensus and Eric's life seem to show that a major reason autism is, quote, “on the rise” is because of improved awareness and access to health care. But within the autism community, there is a lot less consensus about what RFK is saying and what should be done next. That's after the break.

[Break]

Rosin: RFK is not the only person, though, who believes that this isn't just about diagnoses.

Garcia: Correct.

Rosin: Right. So there are legitimate scientists who would say, Oh, it's not just a matter of: We're capturing more people. There is something going on. So I want to talk about that for a minute. Even RFK agrees that autism has a genetic component. Like, studies of identical twins have shown that they are more likely to both be autistic. What other factors have people found have contributed to autism since the 1990s?

Garcia: Yeah. There have been talks about how, like, you know, parents having children older is—

Rosin: Right, the age of fathers.

Garcia: The age of fathers is one of the things. There's talk about mutated sperm. You know, so there definitely is some discussion. And, you know, and I should note that the United States spends so much money on researching autism, and a large chunk of the projects the United States government and nonprofits fund are about biology.

Rosin: So what, in your mind, is the problem with RFK calling it an epidemic?

Garcia: The problem with RFK calling it an epidemic, in my opinion, is that it treats it like it's a crisis. It treats it as if it's something to be fixed or it's something to be mitigated and something to be stopped. And when we already spend so much time researching the biology and researching—and I'm not necessarily even opposed to researching biology. I think it could be worthwhile. I think it could lead to scientific breakthroughs. It could help with finding ways to treat co-occurring conditions, like epilepsy. A lot of autistic people die from epileptic seizures.

But, like, treating it as a crisis and treating it as something to be fixed or prevented is corrosive to a lot of families. It's corrosive to a lot of autistic people. It puts the blame back on parents, and it focuses more on fixing this issue rather than accommodating and giving services to autistic people when the pie is so scarce. You know, this is the same administration that is trying to cut Medicaid.

Rosin: Right. So when you are standing and listening to RFK say things like this, to you, the message is, Something about me needs to be fixed.

Garcia: Yes. And something about a large amount of people needs to be fixed, rather than, These are people who are human beings who need services and who need support and who need acceptance in the world.

Rosin: I want to talk about how RFK's statements have opened up and exposed certain rifts inside the world of autism. Recently, a mother of an autistic child, Emily May, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, which was called “Kennedy Described My Daughter's Reality.”

She writes, “When [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. said in a recent press briefing,” the same one we've been talking about, “that autistic children will ‘never pay taxes,' ‘never hold a job,' ‘never play baseball,' many people in the autism community reacted angrily.” Probably you did, Eric. “And yet I was transported back to the psychiatrist's office and her bleak prognosis that my child might never speak again. I found myself nodding along as Mr. Kennedy spoke about the grim realities of profound autism.”

Can you explain what this divide is about between, say, a community that you represent and this parent's community of children who she describes as profoundly autistic?

Garcia: Yeah. First off, I should say, and I want to be as careful as I can with this—I don't want to make too many people mad. It's important to remember that a lot of parents of high-support-needs autistic kids disagree with Emily, and a lot of people agree with her. In fact, Emily and I were DMing before that article came out. And, you know, the thing that I would say is that term, “profound autism,” that is an ongoing debate that's going on right now because The Lancet in 2021, 2022 put out a commission arguing that there needed to be a separate label called “profound autism” for those kind of, as I mentioned, Level 3 autistic people or what we would call high support needs. And their argument is that the diagnosis of the spectrum is too broad, and that creating the 2013 diagnosis of ASD erases the needs of some people, of those high-support-needs people, and folks like myself are occupying the conversation.

Rosin: Is that because you can speak for yourself, whereas a nonspeaking child cannot necessarily speak for themselves?

Garcia: Yeah, that's their argument.

Rosin: And so they feel like they've been made invisible now?

Garcia: They feel like they've been made invisible, and I think that they feel like, while we've been highlighting a lot of the accomplishments of people like myself, that we're ignoring their needs. And so there's this idea that there's a need to create a separate label, profound autism, and a lot of autistic self-advocates, including some nonspeaking autistic self-advocates, argue that this is that this would just add to stigma—and that by labeling someone as profoundly autistic, that would lower expectations and say that they would never be able to achieve all those things.

And the thing that I would say is that a lot of times, my overture—I'm not an activist; I'm a journalist; I'm a writer; I write about autism, but I don't advocate for a policy thing, but my overture—and my olive branch and my fig leaf is the people who are on the front lines, advocating for your kids, are those same speaking autistic advocates and those same self-advocates.

It's funny—when I was interviewing Julia Bascom, the former head of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, she has in her office one of the signs that they made for pushing back against the repeal of Obamacare, saying, “Please don't cut Medicaid so autistic people have to stop making phone calls.”

They are on the front lines this time to prevent the cuts to Medicaid that Republicans want to do, that RFK's administration—the Trump administration—wants to do, and House Speaker Mike Johnson wants to do, and Republicans in the House want to do.

Rosin: I see. So you're saying you, as a speaking autistic advocate or writer, are not making a distinction between high needs and not-high needs. You're just out there raising awareness for autism more broadly, whether it's for her kid, for yourself, for society just to generally understand autism.

Garcia: And I'll say this, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, and forgive me for being—I don't know how emotional I can be in this thing.

Rosin: As much as you want.

Garcia: Yeah. I think meeting other autistic people, including high-support-needs, nonspeaking autistic people, helped me learn about myself. You know, I think about how when nonspeaking autistic people for so long—they're diminished, and their voices are erased, and people write them off as not worthy or not valid. I'm reminded of when I was called a retard in elementary school.

And so what I would say to them is that, like, I don't know what it's like to be nonspeaking autistic, but I do know what it's like to be overwhelmed and overstimulated in a world that doesn't—you know, I didn't drive a car to get here, because I can't drive.

Some autistic people can drive, and God bless them. I just can't. It's overwhelming—sensory overload. And I guess what I just want to say is that I don't know exactly what it's like, but I've learned so much from your kids. I've learned so much, and I've learned how similar we are. And I've learned how, even though there are still very big differences, that they deserve to be treated [as] valid. And if I fought so hard to get my voice heard, my God, the reason why I try to interview nonspeaking—it is so important in all of my books and all of my writing to include nonspeaking voices, because, my God, I want their stories told and I want them to be heard.

Rosin: Isn't that what RFK wants? Like, what's wrong with his approach to nonspeaking autistic kids? Like, his bringing this to light? What's the difference between what you want and what he wants?

Garcia: I think what I want is, I think the difference—because, believe it or not, there is some overlap—is that he sees this as a tragedy to be fixed. I see these as people who deserve everything possible. We're probably always going to have autism, and we're always going to have autistic people with us.

So what do we do about it? How do we serve these people? How do we see them as full human beings who have needs and wants and concerns, and how do we fix the gaps so that the actually impairing and disabling parts of autism are addressed and mitigated? And how do we help them to live good and happy lives?

Rosin: Well, Eric, I feel like that is a beautiful place to end. I really appreciate you coming and talking to me about this.

Garcia: Hanna, I really appreciate you having me here. Thank you.

The Israeli leader and his allies bet everything on Trump. But he's just not that into them.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

The evening that Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris, Netanyahu land rejoiced. The news anchors on Channel 14, Israel's equivalent of Fox News, toasted Trump's victory live on air. Yinon Magal, the ultranationalist host of Israel's premier right-wing talk show, led his audience in a round of celebratory singing while Trump's face grinned on the screen behind them. Benjamin Netanyahu himself congratulated Trump on “history's greatest comeback.” The Israeli leader and his allies seemed certain that Trump's return to the White House heralded unconditional backing for their most fevered fantasies.

They were wrong. Last Friday, Trump wrapped up his tour of the Middle East, where he made deals and hobnobbed with America's top allies in the region—except one. Israel was not invited to the party and was barely acknowledged in the foreign-policy address that the president delivered in Saudi Arabia. The snub followed more substantive slights. In recent weeks, Trump has surprised Netanyahu by announcing new nuclear negotiations with Iran, halting America's campaign against the Houthis despite the terrorist group continuing to fire missiles at Israel, and going behind Israel's back to secure the release of the American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander from Gaza. “There's a great sense of unease here,” Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., said in an interview last week.

None of this should have been unexpected. Trump is famously mercurial and transactional, loyal only to his own self-interest. In his first term, as an unexpected outsider president, he needed international legitimacy and wins, and Israel gave him both in the form of the Abraham Accords. This time, Trump no longer needs legitimacy, and Israel's war in Gaza is getting in the way of other potential regional wins, such as expanding the accords. In addition, the previous Trump administration's Israel policy was significantly shaped by staff, and that staff has changed markedly with the introduction of an isolationist faction that seeks to extricate America from international commitments. Netanyahu put all of his chips on Trump nonetheless—a wager that now threatens to cost the Israeli prime minister the remnants of his legacy.

The legend of Benjamin Netanyahu was built on two myths. The first was that Netanyahu was the ultimate guarantor of Israeli security, a far-sighted hawk who, for all his faults, could be relied on to keep Israelis safe. For years, when asked how he'd like to be remembered, Netanyahu routinely responded, “As the protector of Israel,” both in Hebrew and English. “The Jewish nation has never excelled at foreseeing danger,” the prime minister told a talk show in 2014. “We were surprised again and again—and the last time was the most awful one. That won't happen under my leadership.” After Hamas inflicted the worst day of Jewish death since the Holocaust, Netanyahu's pose as “Mr. Security” was exposed as a self-flattering falsehood. But he still had one other myth to cling to: his reputation as a geopolitical genius.

Yair Rosenberg: Trump sides with the Israeli people against Netanyahu

In 2019, Netanyahu's reelection campaign festooned Israel with giant posters, each depicting the prime minister shaking hands with one of three world leaders: India's Narendra Modi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump. The banners were captioned with the words Another League. Unlike his small-time Israeli rivals, the placards implied, Netanyahu was a savvy statesman who punched above his weight on the international stage, thanks to his unaccented English oratory and ability to inveigle the world's most powerful people.

Israelis might not like him or trust him, Netanyahu's argument went, but they needed him. This line of thinking was so potent that it convinced not just Israelis, but some of Israel's Arab neighbors, who believed Netanyahu to be the gateway to influence in Washington. One incentive for Arab leaders to normalize ties with Israel, as with the Abraham Accords, was their belief that they could gain Trump's favor by linking up with his apparent ally.

Most of those campaign posters have not aged well. In the days following the October 7 attack, Putin made multiple public statements on the Gaza conflict, none of which explicitly condemned Hamas. Russia has since voted against Israel repeatedly at the United Nations. Netanyahu's image could have survived this hit if Trump hadn't dealt him a more serious and unexpected blow in recent weeks. The president has cut the Israelis out of regional decision making and reportedly kiboshed a plan to strike Iran's nuclear facilities. Though Trump has not compelled Israel to halt its war in Gaza as yet, he has begun pressing Netanyahu to provide humanitarian aid and conclude the conflict.

By revealing Netanyahu to be a bit player, rather than an elite operator, Trump has not just put the Israeli leader in his place. He has exploded Netanyahu's carefully cultivated political persona—an act as damaging to Netanyahu's standing as the Hamas attack on October 7. Worse than making Netanyahu look foolish, Trump has made him look irrelevant. He is not Trump's partner, but rather his mark. In Israeli parlance, the prime minister is a freier—a sucker.

The third-rate pro-government propagandists on Channel 14 might not have seen this coming, but Netanyahu should have. His dark worldview is premised on the pessimistic presumption that the world will turn on the Jews if given the chance, which is why the Israeli leader has long prized hard power over diplomatic understandings. Even if Trump wasn't such an unreliable figure, trusting him should have gone against all of Netanyahu's instincts.

Yair Rosenberg: The end of Netanyahu

He should have realized that in a competition for the affections of a strongman like Trump, Israel had little to offer. “We can't invest a trillion dollars in the American economy,” noted Oren, the former Israeli ambassador, “but there are some other people in this neighborhood who can.” Not only does Israel not have spare luxury jets lying around to fob off on the American president, but the country took nine years to retrofit and launch its own version of Air Force One, and the process was a national fiasco.

So long as Netanyahu refuses to go along with any of Trump's grand diplomatic initiatives, which might require him to end the Gaza war or entertain some semblance of Palestinian statehood, Israel has nothing to give Trump other than symbolic trinkets. But instead of recognizing the precariousness of his position, Netanyahu abandoned his characteristic caution, put his faith in Trump without a fallback, and is now left with nowhere else to turn.

British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was once said by his biographer to be “a master at disguising retreat as advance”—a passage that Richard Nixon underlined in his copy of the book. Like those men, Netanyahu is the consummate survivor, and he may yet manage to spin his latest predicament to his benefit. To write off the Israeli leader would be foolish, especially with new elections not required until late 2026.

But the body blows to Netanyahu's reputation should not be underestimated. His current coalition received just 48.4 percent of the vote in the last election and has been polling underwater since before October 7. More than 70 percent of Israelis want their prime minister to resign. Voters sometimes fall for myths, but eventually, like children, they outgrow them.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

House Republicans voted to advance a bill that would offer lavish tax cuts for the rich while slashing benefits for the poor.

House Republicans worked through the night to advance a massive piece of legislation that might, if enacted, carry out the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history.

That is not a side effect of the legislation, but its central purpose. The “big, beautiful bill” would pair huge cuts to food assistance and health insurance for low-income Americans with even larger tax cuts for affluent ones.

Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, warned that the bill's passage, by a 215–214 margin, would mark the moment the Republicans ensured the loss of their majority in the midterm elections. That may be so. But the Republicans have not pursued this bill for political reasons. They are employing a majority that they suspect is temporary to enact deep changes to the social compact.

The minority party always complains that the majority is “jamming through” major legislation, however deliberate the process may be. (During the year-long debate over the Affordable Care Act, Republicans farcically bemoaned the “rushed” process that consumed months of public hearings.) In this case, however, the indictment is undeniable. The House cemented the bill's majority support with a series of last-minute changes whose effects have not been digested. The Congressional Budget Office has not even had time to calculate how many millions of Americans would lose health insurance, nor by how many trillions of dollars the deficit would increase.

The heedlessness of the process is an indication of its underlying fanaticism. The members of the Republican majority are behaving not like traditional conservatives but like revolutionaries who, having seized power, believe they must smash up the old order as quickly as possible before the country recognizes what is happening.

House Republicans are fully aware of the political and economic risks of this endeavor. Cutting taxes for the affluent is unpopular, and cutting Medicaid is even more so. That is why, instead of proudly proclaiming what the bill will accomplish, they are pretending it will do neither. House Republicans spent months warning of the political dangers of cutting Medicaid, a program that many of their own constituents rely on. The party's response is to fall back on wordplay, pretending that their scheme of imposing complex work requirements, which are designed to cull eligible recipients who cannot navigate the paperwork burden, will not throw people off the program—when that is precisely the effect they are counting on to produce the necessary savings.

The less predictable dangers of their plan are macroeconomic. The bill spikes the deficit, largely because it devotes more money to lining the pockets of lawyers and CEOs than it saves by immiserating fast-food employees and ride-share drivers. Massive deficit spending is not always bad, and in some circumstances (emergencies, or recessions) it can be smart and responsible. In the middle of an economic expansion, with a large structural deficit already built into the budget, it is deeply irresponsible.

In recent years, deficit spending has been a political free ride. With interest rates high and rising, the situation has changed. Higher deficits oblige Washington to borrow more money, which can force it to pay investors higher interest rates to take on its debt, which in turn increases the deficit even more, as interest payments (now approaching $1 trillion a year) swell. The market could absorb a new equilibrium with a higher deficit, but that resolution is hardly assured. The compounding effect of higher debt leading to higher interest rates leading to higher debt can spin out of control.

House Republicans have made clear they are aware of both the political and the economic dangers of their plan, because in the recent past, they have repeatedly warned about both. Their willingness to take them on is a measure of their profound commitment.

And while the content of their beliefs can be questioned, the seriousness of their purpose cannot. Congressional Republicans are willing to endanger their hold on power to enact policy changes they believe in. And what they believe—what has been the party's core moral foundation for decades—is that the government takes too much from the rich, and gives too much to the poor.

But when you promise the world a revolutionary new product, it helps to have actually built one.

Sam Altman is done with keyboards and screens. All that swiping and typing and scrolling—too much potential friction between you and ChatGPT.

Earlier today, OpenAI announced its intentions to solve this apparent problem. The company is partnering with Jony Ive, the longtime head of design at Apple, who did pioneering work on products such as the iMac G3, the iPod, and, most famously, the iPhone. Together, Altman and Ive say they want to create hardware built specifically for AI software. Everyone, Altman suggested in a highly produced announcement video, could soon have access to a “team of geniuses”—presumably, ChatGPT-style assistants—on a “family of devices.” Such technology “deserves something much better” than today's laptops, he argued. What that will look like, exactly, he didn't say, and OpenAI declined my request for comment. But the firm will pay roughly $5 billion to acquire Io, Ive's start-up, to figure that “something much better” out as Ive takes on “deep design and creative responsibilities” across OpenAI. (Emerson Collective, the majority owner of The Atlantic, is an investor in both Io and OpenAI. And OpenAI entered a corporate partnership with The Atlantic last year.)

Read: The great AI lock-in has begun

Moving into hardware could become OpenAI's most technologically disruptive, and financially lucrative, expansion to date. AI assistants are supposed to help with everything, so it's only natural to try to replace the phones and computers that people do everything on. If the company is successful, within a decade you might be reading (or listening to) a ChatGPT-generated news roundup on an OpenAI device instead of reading an article on your iPhone, or asking the device to file your taxes instead of logging in to TurboTax.



In Altman's view, current devices offer only clunky ways to use AI products: You have to open an app or a website, upload the relevant information, continually prompt the AI bot, and then transfer any useful outputs elsewhere. In the promotional video, Ive agrees, suggesting that the era of personal computers and smartphones—a period that he helped define—needs a refresh: “It's just common sense to at least think, surely, there's something beyond these legacy products,” he tells Altman. Although OpenAI and Io have not specified what they are building, a number of wearable AI pins, smartglasses, and other devices announced over the past year have suggested a vision of an AI assistant always attached to your body—an “external brain,” as Altman called it today.



These products have, so far, uniformly flopped. As just one example, Humane, the maker of a $700 AI “pin” that attached to a user's clothing, shut down the poorly reviewed product less than a year after launch. Ive, in an interview today with Bloomberg, called these early AI gadgets “very poor products.” And Apple and OpenAI have had their own share of uninspiring, or even embarrassing, product releases. Still, if any pair has a shot at designing a legitimately useful AI device, it is likely the man who unleashed ChatGPT partnering with someone who led the design of the Apple smartphones, tablets, and laptops that have defined decades of American life and technology.



Certainly, a bespoke device would also rapidly accelerate OpenAI's commercial ambitions. The company, once a small research lab, is now valued at $300 billion and growing rapidly, and in March reported that half a billion people use ChatGPT each week. Already, OpenAI is angling to replace every major tech firm: ChatGPT is an internet search tool as powerful as Google, can help you shop online and remove the need to type into Amazon, can be your work software instead of the Microsoft Office suite. OpenAI is even reportedly building a social-media platform. For now, OpenAI relies on the smartphones and web browsers people use to access ChatGPT—products that are all made by business rivals. Altman is trying to cut out the middleman and condense digital life into a single, unified piece of hardware and software. The promise is this: Your whole life could be lived through such a device, turning OpenAI's products into a repository of uses and personal data that could be impossible to leave—just as, if everyone in your family has an iPhone, Macbook, and iCloud storage plan, switching to Android is deeply unpleasant and challenging.

Several other major tech firms are also trying to integrate generative AI into their legacy devices and software. Amazon has incorporated generative AI into the Alexa voice assistant, Google into its Android phones and search bar, and Apple into the iPhone. Meta has built an AI assistant into its apps and sells smartglasses. Products and platforms which disrupted work, social life, education, and more in the early 2000s are showing their age: Google has become crowded with search-optimized sites and AI-generated content that can make it harder for users to find good information; Amazon is filled with junk; Facebook is a cesspool; and the smartphone is commonly viewed as attention-sapping, if not outright brain-melting. Tech behemoths are jury-rigging AI features into their products to avoid being disrupted—but these rollouts, and Apple's in particular, have been disastrous, giving dangerous health advice, butchering news summaries, and generally crowding and slowing user experiences.



Almost 20 years ago, when Apple introduced the iPhone, Steve Jobs said in a now-famous speech that “every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.” Seeming to be in pursuit of similar magic, today's video announcing OpenAI's foray into hardware began with Altman saying, “I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely reimagine what it means to use a computer.” But Jobs had an actual product to share and sell. Altman, for now, is marketing his imagination.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

For years, Ezra Furman's music embraced protest and defiance. Now she's striking a different chord.

About two years ago, Ezra Furman gave up—first in her mind, and then, it seemed, in her body.

The 38-year-old singer was nearly two decades into a prolific rock-and-roll career. Her nervy, poetic sound had earned devoted fans and critical acclaim, plus a job soundtracking the Netflix TV show Sex Education. But her sixth solo album, 2022's All of Us Flames—an epic-scale protest album about surviving in a collapsing world—hadn't generated as much buzz as she'd hoped for, and she told me her label, Anti-, dropped her after its release. (Anti- did not respond to a request for comment.) She felt discouragement mounting, compounded by the stress of touring while raising a young son.

Then one day in April 2023, a stranger on the street pointed at Furman and laughed in her face. She knew why: Furman, a transgender woman, hadn't shaved that day. The cruelty was “comic,” Furman told me, like something that happens in a movie, but it also damaged what was left of her inner resolve. That afternoon, Furman wrote down a confession to herself: She wanted to end her music career.

The next day, she collapsed and went to the hospital. She reported tiredness and pain in her body; the doctors ran tests but couldn't figure out what was wrong. She was discharged the same day, and experienced debilitating fatigue that persisted acutely for months, forcing her to cancel a tour. The illness, still unexplained, sometimes slows her to this day.

Furman described these events to me while we were seated at the kitchen table in her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment. Wearing jeans and a colorfully striped blouse, she spoke haltingly, often taking long pauses to stare into the distance and hum along with the record playing in the background (Portishead's Dummy). Despite the resignation she felt that day in April, new songs started pouring out of her after the hospital. The resulting album, Goodbye Small Head, came out last week.

That album's existence might seem to suggest a success story, about an artist triumphing over adversity. But the tale Furman wanted to tell me—the theme that she kept returning to as we hung out in her house and then strolled around her neighborhood on a perfectly beautiful spring day—was mostly about feeling defeated. “I'm in a time of over-admitting how much everything hurts,” she said. “I'm leaning into every feeling, almost soaking it up.”

Furman is one of a kind: a trans, devoutly Jewish former rabbinical student who's written a book about Lou Reed and sings folk-punk songs in a mercurial tremble. Over nearly two decades, her music has evolved from scrappy college rock to expertly orchestrated art-pop. It's maintained an idiosyncratic spirit all along, combining references from across rock history—a Bob Dylan harmonica line here, a Cars synth line there—with lyrics that unspool in unsteady, careening cadences. Her claims to fame have had a fluky quality to them (“Take Off Your Sunglasses,” a 2008 track about depression and skiing, was a No. 1 hit in Austria). But to her fans, who testify under her social-media posts about how her work has become embedded in their life, she is one of rock's best-kept secrets.

Her trajectory has also, it's long seemed to me, been exemplary of a certain strain of Millennial idealism. When she founded her former band Ezra Furman and the Harpoons in 2006, as an undergraduate at Tufts University, her sound fit in with that era's boom for literary, openhearted indie acts in the vein of the Mountain Goats and Arcade Fire. She then publicly embraced queerness—identifying as bisexual, dressing femininely in public—around the same time that Laverne Cox featured on the cover of Time magazine and Target's sales racks started turning rainbow-themed during Pride month. “It felt like pure, weird synchronicity,” she said when I suggested she was part of an LGBTQ cultural wave in the 2010s. “Like I'm finally ready to start wearing these clothes in public and not just in my friends' bedrooms. And then it was like, trans people are in public. And I was like, What?”

When Donald Trump was elected for the first time, she doubled down on her long-standing penchant for socially conscientious lyricism, joining the burst of rock-and-roll #resistance that erupted in response to the president's agenda. She posted on social media about defending immigrants and women; onstage at Coachella in 2017, she called out Philip Anschutz, the businessman bankrolling that festival, for investing in oil exploration and donating to anti-LGBTQ causes. (“I support the rights of all people and oppose discrimination and intolerance against the LGBTQ community,” Anschutz said in a 2018 statement. “I regret if any money given to a charity for other purposes may have indirectly worked against these values.”) She also set about recording what she later called an “anti-fascist trilogy” of albums. The final installment in that project was All of Us Flames—a record that, as she told The Guardian, she wanted to be a “weapon of war,” striking against injustice and intolerance.

Now Trump is back in office and flirting openly with authoritarianism—but the defiant energy that swept the arts during his first administration seems dissipated and tentative. After years of gaining visibility and public sympathy, trans people find themselves undergoing concerted political assault: repealing their access to medications, bathrooms, and passports that accord with their gender identity. Goodbye Small Head isn't responding to these developments by rallying the troops or offering reassurance. It's a sumptuous shrug of an album, the sound of a onetime warrior owning up to weakness and burnout. “I'm really moving away from a sense of, like, There's things I want to be saying to the public and I want to carry certain flags,” Furman said. “There's a lot of fists in the air in our culture, and I'm a little fatigued in the arm area.”

Some of that fatigue can be traced back to an event in 2021 that, by all rights, was an occasion for pride. That's when Furman first posted on social media about being transgender—and revealed that she had a kid. Her coming-out wasn't a huge surprise to many of her followers, given that she'd long sung about the complexity of identity in ways that suggested she might be trans. (The title of her 2018 album was even titled Transangelic Exodus.) She finally made her transness explicit because, she told me, she figured that other queer people might be helped by her example. Certainly, she herself would have benefited from seeing a transgender mother in popular culture years earlier.

But her announcement reached more than just trans people, and more than just her fans. CNN and Fox News, who had never covered her music before, ran stories about her transition in the anodyne tone of everyday celebrity gossip. (One line from Fox News: “Furman's fans will also be pleased to know she signed off her Instagram post with a promise that new music is on the way.”) This meant that she was suddenly an object of consideration for all sorts of people she'd never intended to reach. Under Furman's coming-out post on her own Facebook page, one commenter wrote, “Why are you coming up on my timeline? I don't follow people with an agenda.” Others left harsher replies—accusing her of being a sinner, an attention whore, a mentally ill child abuser.

Furman had, it seemed, walked into a trap. “I didn't understand that I had created clickbait,” she told me. By the 2020s, visibility—that watchword of the movement for queer acceptance—was becoming freighted with new dangers. Backlash to trans rights had swollen into one of the animating causes of the Republican Party, whose leaders were evangelizing the notion that gender nonconformity was a social contagion that targeted children and threatened to undermine civilization itself. The news media and social-media algorithms seemed ready to capitalize on the way that the mere sight of a trans person in public life could incite controversy. Furman's post of self-expression wasn't just accidental clickbait; it was, to many onlookers, ragebait.

Furman read every hateful comment she received online. Initially, she tried to wave them off: “I'm like, Psh, okay, buddy. Wow, you're really out of touch, huh?” she said. “And actually, while I'm saying that, the poison is already sinking into me. And some child in me fully believes everything they just said.” The vitriol didn't harden her shell—it hurt her. The conventional wisdom to “shake it off” isn't working for her, she said. “I don't know what else to do except start crying.”

Reflecting back on that episode, and the way that anti-trans sentiment has only continued to build in American culture since then, Furman said she's been thinking about the roots of the hostility against people like her. “My life and my identity was known to all, including me, to be impossible or ridiculous,” she said. “Just like: A boy becomes a girl? This is not something that happens. I like to think of trans people as people who were shown a wall and saw a doorway, made a doorway. They just did something impossible.”

Read: The attack on trans rights won't end there

The impossible becoming possible is a hard thing to process—and easier to reject or mock than to understand. She mentioned the slogan “Facts don't care about your feelings,” popularized by the conservative pundit Ben Shapiro. “I think it's out of the same playbook of, like, Women's feelings are why they can't be serious, rational people.” (Which, she added, is ironic because “they're so emotional over there on the right.”) Furman described herself as a “defender of the irrational” in multiple spheres of life. Whether as an artist, a religious person, or a trans person, she's going out of her way to honor the importance of her inner life—her beliefs, her feelings, her desires—even when it's socially inconvenient to do so.

What she's realizing lately is how difficult that kind of life is to sustain. When the stranger on the street laughed at her in April 2023, it was a reminder that she couldn't just opt out of visibility. Every time Furman steps into public, she's opening herself up to judgment from society. If she stops putting care into her appearance—into passing as a cisgender woman, thereby avoiding drawing attention to her transness—she potentially becomes some “illegible, laughable thing” to others. She doesn't know exactly why she collapsed. But she suspects that it had something to do with the fact that being trans requires constant assertiveness, which is an exhausting posture to maintain, day after day, year after year. “Trans people just have to be strident personalities—we just all have to,” she said. “What if I don't keep feeling strident?”

After she got out of the hospital, Furman felt that she needed a reset. Though her previous two albums had been recorded in California, she booked a studio in her hometown of Chicago. She also called up Brian Deck, the producer who'd recorded two of the first Ezra and the Harpoons albums nearly 20 years ago. Deck is a veteran indie producer who has worked with the likes of Modest Mouse and Counting Crows, and he hadn't stayed in touch with Furman. He told me he was amazed to find that she was basically the same person she was as an undergrad: articulate, precise, “slightly socially awkward,” and possessing a “coarse blunt instrument” of a voice, rippling with vulnerability and angst.

This time, Furman was using that instrument differently. Furman's past few albums have had a rollicking, anthemic sound channeling Bruce Springsteen and the Clash. But Goodbye Small Head is swirling and atmospheric, with dark, catchy melodies that recall '90s trip-hop and alternative rock. “I think it's very beautiful,” Furman said, “and I never really felt like we made beautiful music before this.”

In one new song, called “Submission,” a beep that resembles the sound of an EKG machine plays on loop. “We're fucked,” Furman hisses. “It's a relief to say / We'll see no victory day.” The track, she wrote in the album's press notes, is about realizing that “long-suffering ‘good guys' have no chance against 21st-century forces of evil.”

In our interview, she told me she resisted finishing the song: “I was like, This can't be what I'm writing. I don't want to. This isn't what anyone needs to hear.” But as she endured painful procedures for facial-hair removal—which meant lying on a table as electrified needles were stuck in her skin—the lyrics kept popping into her head, forcing the song into existence. In moments like those, Furman thought of the line “No feeling is final,” by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. “What if we feel really bad?” Furman said. “What if it feels really, really bad and we just let it feel that bad? Or just for a moment, anyway. What's under there?”

The final song of Goodbye Small Head, “I Need the Angel,” is a garage-rock freak-out that sees Furman screaming for heavenly guidance. It's a cover of a song by Alex Walton, a 25-year-old trans musician who was once a fan of Furman's and struck up a friendship with her after the two exchanged messages online. When I spoke with Walton by videochat, she told me she was still processing the fact that her onetime role model—someone whose visibility as a trans person helped inspire her own career—had covered one of her songs. I asked her what Furman was like. “There's this unerring optimism in her that's infectious,” Walton replied.

This took me aback. In the four hours I'd spent with Furman, she'd been sardonically funny and a curious-minded conversationalist, but we'd mostly talked about the terrible state of the world and the music industry. Walton allowed that Furman could come off as pessimistic—her music conveys “never-ending struggle.” But beneath that, Walton said, Furman is motivated by a simple idea: “She wants to live.”

Goodbye Small Head does have flashes of resilience. In its one overt protest song, “A World of Love and Care,” Furman yowls, “Who gets left out of your dream of a good society?” The chorus seems designed to ring out at rallies and marches: “Dream better!” The track was a holdover from writing sessions during the first Trump administration, when Furman was working on that aforementioned anti-fascist trilogy. The original demo for the song was thrashing and punkish; the final version is built around pulsing cellos, making for a sound that's “gentle and threatening” at the same time, as Furman put it.

The rest of Goodbye Small Head, however, isn't serving up slogans or straightforwardly trying to change the world. The album mostly arose, she said, out of her dreamlike instincts. Furman compared songwriting to religious practices—such as the ones she herself keeps (saying blessings over a meal, observing strict rules of conduct on the Sabbath). “Why do I do these rituals?” she said. “Religious people do religious acts not for any utility. There's something sacred about behaving this particular way, and even if nobody knows I'm doing it.”

And yet Furman still clearly feels like her work has a concrete, real-life purpose. She likened herself to professional mourners mentioned in the Bible: women who wailed because it was their duty to help their community express and move past emotions that would otherwise be paralyzing. “We need the people who cry and clap their hands together and stomp their feet, because you need somebody to hold all that irrationality for you,” Furman said. “I do think this is my job.”

One of the GOP justices must have defected in a case about religious schools, but the Court didn't reveal who it was.

by  Ian Millhiser

Surprise!

The Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it is unable to decide a case asking it to force states to fund religious charter schools. The justices split 4-4 in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. That means that an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision holding that the state should not and cannot fund a Catholic charter school stands, and there can be no religious public schools — for now.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

At oral arguments in Oklahoma, this case appeared likely to be the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions mandating government funding of religious education. Most notably, in Carson v. Makin (2022), the Court held that states that offer private school tuition vouchers must allow those vouchers to be used to pay tuition at religious schools. 

Oklahoma involved a proposed charter school known as St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which hoped to become the first religious public school in the country. While Carson held that states that fund private education must include religious schools in that funding, charter schools are considered public under both Oklahoma and federal law. Both federal law and the laws of 46 states also require charter schools to be non-religious.

Though Thursday's non-decision in Oklahoma means that this long-standing regime guaranteeing public schools remain secular institutions is still in effect, it is far from clear whether this regime will last. Though Barrett, a Republican who voted in the majority in Carson, did not say why she recused herself from the Oklahoma case, USA Today notes she “is close friends with the Notre Dame Law School professor who was an early legal adviser to the Catholic Church in Oklahoma.” Before joining the bench, Barrett was a tenured professor at Notre Dame's law school.

It is likely that proponents of religious charter schools will simply try again to create such a school, this time without doing so in a way that causes Barrett to recuse. If Barrett is present for those future arguments and applies similar reasoning to the decision she joined in Carson, she could easily be the fifth vote for religious charter schools. 

The Court also did not reveal in its very brief order resolving the Oklahoma case how each justice voted, but based on their past decisions and their comments at oral arguments in Oklahoma, it is extremely likely that all of the Court's three Democrats voted against allowing religious public schools. That means one of the five Republicans who were not recused from this case, all of whom joined the majority in Carson, defected. Because none of the justices explained why they voted as they did in Oklahoma, we also do not know why this defection happened.

In any event, Thursday's non-decision means that the status quo remains in effect. Religious charter schools remain unlawful, for now. But it is far from clear whether they will remain so in the future.

﻿What wouldn't Jesus do?

by  Aja Romano

It's a provocative idea: that empathy — that is, putting yourself in another person's proverbial shoes, and feeling what they feel — is a sin. 

The Bible contains repeated invocations from Jesus to show deep empathy and compassion for others, including complete strangers. He's very clear on this point. Moreover, Christianity is built around a fundamental act of empathy so radical — Jesus dying for our sins — that it's difficult to spin as harmful. 

Yet as stunning as it may sound, “empathy is a sin” is a claim that's been growing in recent years across the Christian right. It was first articulated six years ago by controversial pastor and theologian Joe Rigney, now author of the recently published book, The Sin of Empathy, which has drawn plenty of debate among religious commentators. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

In this construction, empathy is a cudgel that progressives and liberals use to berate and/or guilt-trip Christians into showing empathy to the “wrong” people. 

Had it stayed within the realm of far-right evangelicals, we likely wouldn't be discussing this strange view of empathy at all. Yet we are living in an age when the Christian right has gained unprecedented power, both sociocultural and political. The increasing overlap between conservative culture and right-leaning tech spaces means that many disparate public figures are all drinking from the same well of ideas — and so a broader, secular version of the belief that empathy is a tool of manipulation has bubbled into the mainstream through influential figures like Elon Musk.

The proposition that too much empathy is a bad thing is far from an idea that belongs to the right. On Reddit, which tends to be relatively left-wing, one popular mantra is that you can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. That is, too much empathy for someone else can erode your own sense of self, leaving you codependent or open to emotional abuse and manipulation. 

That's a pretty standard part of most relationship and self-help advice — even from some Christian advice authors. But in recent months, the idea that empathy is inherently destructive has not only become a major source of debate among Christians, it's escaped containment and barreled into the mainstream by way of major media outlets, political figures, and influencers.

The conversation began with an incendiary 2019 essay by Rigney, then a longtime teacher and pastor at a Baptist seminary, in which he introduced “the enticing sin of empathy” and argued that Satan manipulates people through the intense cultural pressure to feel others' pain and suffering. 

Rigney's ideas were met with ideological pushback, with one Christian blogger saying it “may be the most unwise piece of pastoral theology I've seen in my lifetime.” As his essay incited national debate, Rigney himself grew more controversial, facing allegations of dismissing women and telling one now-former Black congregant at his Minneapolis church that “it wouldn't be sinful for him to own me & my family today.” (In an email to Vox, Rigney denied the congregant's version of events.) Rigney also has a longtime affiliation with Doug Wilson, the leader of the Reformed Christian Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. 

In practice, what Rigney is typically decrying is any empathy for a liberal perspective or for someone who's part of a marginalized community.

Now well-known for spreading Christian nationalism, and for allegedly fostering a culture of abuse (allegations he has denied), Wilson's infamy also comes from his co-authored 1996 essay “Southern Slavery: As It Was,” in which he claimed that “Slavery produced in the South a genuine affection between the races that we believe we can say has never existed in any nation before the War or since.” (“My defense of the South does not make me a racist,” Wilson said in 2003.) Rigney appeared on Wilson's 2019 podcast series Man Rampant to discuss empathy; their conversation quickly devolved into decrying fake rape allegations and musing that victims of police violence might have “deserved to be shot.” 

In an email, Rigney told me that both he and Wilson developed their similar views on empathy from the therapist and Rabbi Edwin Friedman, whose posthumously published 1999 book, A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix, has influenced not only family therapy but conservative church leadership and thought. In the book, Friedman argues that American society has devalued the self, leading to an emotional regression and a “low pain threshold.” Alongside this he compares “political correctness” to the Inquisition, and frames a “chronically anxious America” as one that is “organize[d] around its most dysfunctional elements,” in which leaders have difficulty making tough decisions. This correlation of emotional weakness with societal excess paved the way for Rigney to frame empathy itself as a dangerous weapon. 

Despite using the incendiary generalization, “empathy is sin,” Rigney told me that it is not all empathy that is sinful, but specifically “untethered empathy.” He describes this as “empathy that is detached or unmoored from reality, from what is good and right.” (An explanation that begs definitions for “reality,” “good,” and “right.”)

“Just as ‘the sin of anger' refers to unrighteous or ungoverned anger, so the sin of empathy refers to ungoverned, excessive, and untethered empathy,” Rigney told me. This kind of unrestrained empathy, he writes, is a recipe for cultural mayhem. 

In theory, Rigney argues that one should be “tethered” to God's will and not to Satan. In practice, what Rigney is typically decrying is any empathy for a liberal perspective or for someone who's part of a marginalized community. When I asked him for a general reconciliation of his views with the Golden Rule, he sent me a response in which he brought up trans identity in order to label it a “fantasy” that contradicts “God-given biological reality,” while misgendering a hypothetical trans person. 

Despite receiving firm pushback from most religious leaders (and indeed most people) who hear about it, Rigney's argument has been spreading through the Christian right at large. Last year, conservative personality and author Allie Stuckey published Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion, in which she argues that “toxic empathy is a dangerous guide for our decisions, behavior, and public policy” while condemning queer people and feminists. “Empathy almost needs to be struck from the Christian vocabulary,” Josh McPherson, host of the Christian-centered Stronger Man Nation podcast and an adherent of Wilson and Rigney's ideas, said in January, in a clip that garnered an outsize amount of attention relative to the podcast episode itself. 

That same month, Vice President JD Vance struck a nerve with a controversial appearance on Fox News in which he seemed to reference both the empathy conversation and the archaic Catholic concept of “ordo amoris,” meaning “the order of love.” As Vance put it, it's the idea that one's family should come before anyone else: “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country,” he said. “And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” In a follow-up on X, he posted, “the idea that there isn't a hierarchy of obligations violates basic common sense.” 

Vance's statements received backlash from many people, including both the late Pope Francis and then-future Pope Leo XIV — but the controversy just drove the idea further into the mainstream. As part of the odd crossover between far-right religion and online reactionaries, it picked up surprising alliances along the way, including evolutionary biologist turned far-right gadfly Gad Saad. In January, Saad, applying a survival-of-the-fittest approach to our emotions, argued against “suicidal empathy,” which he described as “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets.” (Who are the wrong targets according to Saad? Trans women and immigrants.)

In a February appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Elon Musk explicitly referenced Saad but went even further, stating, “The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy — the empathy exploit. They're exploiting a bug in Western civilization” — the “they” here being the left wing. “I think empathy is good,” Musk added, “but you need to think it through, and not just be programmed like a robot.” 

By March, mainstream media had noticed the conversation. David French had observed the “strange spectacle” of the Christian turn against empathy in a column for the New York Times. In April, a deep-dive in the Guardian followed. That same month, a broad-ranging conversation in the New Yorker with Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, led to interviewer Isaac Chotiner pressing him about why empathy is bad. The discussion, of deported Venezuelan immigrants wrongfully suspected of having gang tattoos, led to Mohler saying that “there's no reason anyone other than a gang member should have that tattoo.” (Among the tattoos wrongly flagged as gang symbols were the words “Mom” and “Dad” on the wrists of one detainee.)

The connective tissue across all these disparate anti-empathy voices is two-fold, according to Christian scholar Karen Swallow Prior. Prior, an anti-abortion ethicist and former longtime Liberty University professor, singled out the argument's outsize emphasis on attacking very small, very vulnerable groups — as well as the moment in which it's all happening.

“The entire discourse around empathy is backlash against those who are questioning the authority of those in power,” she told me, “not coincidentally emerging in a period where we have a rise in recognition of overly controlling and narcissistic leaders, both in and outside the church.” Those people “understand and appreciate empathy the least.”

“Trump made it okay to not be okay with culture,” Peter Bell, co-creator and producer of the Sons of Patriarchy podcast, which explores longstanding allegations of emotional and sexual abuse against Doug Wilson's Christ Church, told me. (Wilson has denied that the church has a culture of abuse or coercion.) “He made it kind of cool for Christians to be jerks,” Bell said. “He made the unspoken things spoken, the whispered things shouted out loud.”

Prior believes that the argument won't have a long shelf life because Rigney's idea is so convoluted. Yet she added that it's born out of toxic masculinity, in an age where stoicism, traditionally male-coded, is increasingly part of the regular cultural diet of men via figures like Jordan Peterson. That hypermasculinity goes hand in hand with evangelical culture, and with the ideas Rigney borrowed from Friedman about too many emotions being a weakness. In this framing, emotion becomes non-masculine by default — i.e., feminine.

“Everybody's supposed to have sympathy for the white male, but when you show empathy to anyone else, suddenly empathy is a sin.”

That leads us to the grimmest part of Rigney's “untethered empathy” claims: the way he explicitly genders it — and demonizes it — as feminine. Throughout his book, he argues that women are more empathetic than men, and that as a result, they are more prone to giving into it as a sin. It's an inherently misogynistic view that undermines women's decision-making and leadership abilities. 

Though Rigney pushed back against this characterization in an email to me, arguing that critics have distorted what he views as merely “gendered tendencies and susceptibility to particular temptations,” he also couldn't help reinforcing it. “[F]emale tendencies, like male tendencies, have particular dangers, temptations, and weaknesses,” he wrote. Women thus should recognize this and “take deliberate, Spirit-wrought action to resist the impulse to become a devouring HR department that wants to run the world.”

As Prior explains, though, Rigney's just fine with a mythic national human resources department, as long as it supports the status quo. “Everybody's supposed to have sympathy for the white male,” she said, “but when you show empathy to anyone else, suddenly empathy is a sin.”

What's heartening is that, whether they realize what kind of dangerous extremism undergirds it, most people aren't buying Rigney's “empathy is sin” claim. Across the nation, in response to Rigney's assertion, the catchphrase, “If empathy is a sin, then sin boldly” has arisen, as heard in pulpits, seen on church marquees, and worn on T-shirts — a reminder that it takes much more than the semantic whims of a few extremists to shake something most people hold in their hearts.

Now is a good time to think about tech training wheels.

by  Anna North and  Adam Clark Estes

This week, for the respective editions of their newsletters, Kids Today and User Friendly, senior correspondents Anna North and Adam Clark Estes have a chat about something that's occupying both of them as journalists and as parents of young kids: How AI will shape the lives of the next generation?

Anna North: Hi Adam! Excited to chat about AI and kids! In addition to reporting on kids for work, I also have a 7-year-old (who is home sick today and watching Amphibia right now, so might interrupt), and a 2-year-old (who is not currently home sick, yay!).

Adam Clark Estes: Hey Anna! My kid is not yet 2, but as they say, the days are long, but the years are short. I feel like I'll be meeting her AI friends in no time. 

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

Anna: Ha! So speaking of which, should we kick this off by talking a little bit about our hopes and fears for our kids growing up in the age of AI? 

I do feel like there's a lot to be hopeful about: I'm excited that my kids will grow up in a time when we can use AI to develop new drugs and decode elephant language (although maybe some of those AI tools are more properly called machine learning?). 

My biggest fear is that my kids won't see the point of learning certain skills, like writing and math, because AI can do those tasks for them. I certainly worry about AI taking jobs, too, but that's a ways away for my kids.

Adam: I'm actually not that worried about my kid having AI friends. She probably will! I just hope that she doesn't spend too much time with them or too much time with AI-powered technology in general. 

I hope we enter this new AI era together and learn how these tools can make our lives better, richer, and more interesting. It reminds me of how the internet came of age around the same time I did, but my parents seemed too afraid to figure it out at the time. I hope I can be brave. 

Anna: My dad was actually an internet early adopter, and so we did enter that era together, which was sweet. We used to go to Doctor Who chatrooms — I remember once listing “our” age as “43 and 12.” That was nice for me because 1) I learned to use a computer and 2) I learned to be curious and not fearful around new technologies. Except I am a little fearful around AI! Maybe I have to channel that spirit of curiosity a little more when I'm with my kids.

A friend of mine was telling me her district is rolling out AI tools potentially in kindergarten, so it starts young.

Adam: And I keep seeing ads for AI-equipped stuffed animals. AI is still such a buzzword, but I do think we're starting to see how it really will take over technology as we know it. I always say that it's just the next iteration of the software that's already in everything. So, of course, it's going to be in classrooms — not just for cheating purposes, either.

Anna: Cheating using AI is less of an issue for little kids because they're not doing much of their work on computers yet. The AI tools I've seen proposed for K-6 are like this AI-powered reading coach, which seems less vulnerable to cheating than, say, ChatGPT. I've definitely heard people say that AI could potentially offer more personalized tutoring one day, which could be positive since individual instruction is really beneficial, but public school classes are often too large to offer much of it. That idea doesn't freak me out too much, although, of course, there are questions around how reliable and accurate AI tools are.

My older kid is in first grade, and at his school, there's a lot of talk about the role of AI in math. The argument I've heard is very similar to what we were taught about calculators, honestly: that these tools will be able to do a lot of simple operations for us, so kids should be able to think intuitively about numbers.

I don't really think we'll return to oral exams, but we will have to reconsider what education looks like in a world that runs on AI.

Adam: I'm also curious about how AI simply changes how schools work. Like, if AI makes it too easy to cheat when essay-writing, what will teachers assign instead? And what will they grade? I don't really think we'll return to oral exams, but we will have to reconsider what education looks like in a world that runs on AI.

Anna: I do think there's a shift to more in-class tests and assignments, which can cause its own stress. I also wonder if there's just going to be a shift toward developing a different set of skills, if writing just becomes less important. We already see kids and young people consuming less text — I wouldn't be shocked if there was more emphasis in the coming years on oral presentation or audio and visual production skills. That bums me out as a writer, but maybe it's what Plato would've wanted? I do try to remember that people have always been skeptical of new technology (even written language), and some of the anxieties we're experiencing now are thousands of years old.

I wouldn't be shocked if there was more emphasis in the coming years on oral presentation or audio and visual production skills.

Adam: And some look like instant replays of anxieties from just a decade or two ago. Every time a new technology or medium comes along, there's a collective freakout that it's destroying the youth. This is just as true for social media as it was for TV, video games, comic books, and even radio. I think this will be true of AI in social settings, too. It's already possible to have an AI friend through apps like Replika or Kindroid. 

I wasn't kidding about the AI stuffed animals, either. There's one called Grok that's designed — by Grimes of all people — for ages 3 and up. Kids can ask it questions, and the AI will tell them things, like a futuristic Teddy Ruxpin, except Teddy Ruxpin had a cassette tape in his belly that parents could listen to and know what the stuffed bear would say. I have no idea what AI will be telling our kids!

I've seen people call this the end of the imaginary friend. I actually think it's just the beginning of something new. What that is, I can't imagine. At least not yet. 

Anna: It's funny to me because Teddy Ruxpin was famously creepy! The social/play aspect of AI is super-interesting. I'm not worried about AI killing imaginary friends — kids will make friends with a can of tomato paste, and I don't think you can destroy their social creativity that easily.

My biggest concern around AI friends right now is safety — there are already lawsuits alleging that chatbots nudged kids toward violence or self-harm. Do you know what guardrails there are in place? 

Adam: My general feeling about guardrails is that, no matter how many there are, technology finds a way to leap over them. YouTube, for instance, has long struggled with how to make sure parents can steer their children to safe, age-appropriate content, but kids inevitably find themselves sucked down a rabbit hole of uncanny algorithmically generated videos. Throwing an infinite supply of AI-generated content into the mix won't help, so I think parents will have to be vigilant about triple-checking what their kids are watching or playing with.

There was a Pew study earlier this year that said about a quarter of all teens had tried ChatGPT for schoolwork. That number had doubled in a year.

So if you assume that guardrails aren't there or won't work and that kids are going to try some kind of AI tool eventually, where does that leave parents? To be honest, I think we should all do what your dad did with you: Hang out in the proverbial chatrooms together. Talk to the chatbots together. Play with the AI toys together. Learn about this new technology along with your kids and help them learn when to put them away.

I think we should all do what your dad did with you: Hang out in the proverbial chatrooms together. Talk to the chatbots together. Play with the AI toys together.

Anna: I'm sure my dad will appreciate this endorsement of his parenting! You're not alone, though. Andrew Przybylski, an Oxford professor I think we've talked about who studies phones and kids, talks about introducing his children to smartphones the way you would teach a kid to ride a bike: It's a tool. It has hazards but also uses. It can be fun, and it's a basic part of life. Maybe the same is true of AI?

This conversation is sort of making me think I need to use AI more with my kids, which is not where I expected to end up. 

Adam: It's important to point out that we're mostly talking about generative AI here, and chatbots. There are also image and video generators. These all have obvious applications for kids in schools, for cheating and learning. But we haven't even gotten into what the next generation of AI will impact our kids' lives — things like AI agents that can use computers themselves or the much feared artificial general intelligence that can theoretically do anything. That future is a lot harder for me to comprehend right now.

Anna: Yeah, I think there's a lot about the next 10 or 15 years, both in AI and just in our kids' lives generally, that's hard to wrap one's head around. My husband and I always joke about our children going to college on the moon, but I think it's just a way of expressing the uncertainty that's always there when you try to project too far out.

Why the GOP put SALT on the table.

by  Sean Collins and  Devan Schwartz

House Republicans passed a major tax and spending bill early Thursday morning. The bill — which the Republican Party hopes to have signed by Memorial Day — is chock-full of President Donald Trump's legislative priorities, and has many provisions the GOP has long been agitating for. But it nevertheless was a struggle to get the bill to the House floor for a vote. One big reason was a tax provision known as SALT, the state and local tax deduction.

I asked Today, Explained's Devan Schwartz — who just produced an episode about this bill — to explain what SALT is, why it's important, and why it's roiled the GOP. Here's what he had to say:

What is SALT?

SALT is an acronym that stands for “state and local taxes” — it allows Americans to deduct some of what they pay, right now up to $10,000, in state and local taxes (like property taxes and sales taxes) from their federal taxes.

Once, there wasn't a cap to how much you could deduct, but that changed with Trump's tax cuts in 2017; those brought in the $10,000 cap.

Removing the SALT cap is seen as benefiting mostly wealthy earners in high-tax states like California or New York: people who might make $500,000 a year or $10 million a year and pay tens or hundreds of thousands in state and local taxes, the sort of people who don't take the standard deduction.

Why has a tax deduction caused such a stir this week?

The SALT cap hasn't been too popular with constituents in these high-tax states; they have been putting pressure on their lawmakers to make changes. 

Trump initially expressed support for those changes, and many House GOP lawmakers from blue states ran on making changes when Republicans got back in power. 

Now, House Republican lawmakers are in the middle of putting together a big spending and tax bill, and there was a push to get SALT changes in there. Those that ran on upping the SALT cap said, We're trying to get reelected in the next year, we need a win to go back to our voters with.

The GOP leadership in the House set up a somewhat arbitrary deadline to get the bill passed from the House to the Senate by Memorial Day — that's next week. 

That puts lawmakers in a time crunch, but there's also a numerical problem: The House GOP has very narrow margins. Depending on attendance, they can afford to lose roughly three votes on any one bill. 

That gives the blue-state GOP lawmakers who want to see changes to SALT a lot of power. If you're one of a small group, and you said, Hey, we're holdouts, we're not voting for this until you give us our SALT reform, you're sinking Trump's “big, beautiful bill.” And that's what happened this week.

That small group of lawmakers got their way, right?

Yes. The final details could still change, but a deal was made to raise the cap.

Which set off other small groups of lawmakers who want their priorities fulfilled in the bill, and yesterday's scramble by the White House to try to get everyone in line.

Right. Trump's stance throughout this has been, stop whining. Don't grandstand. It's more important to get a deal done. So if you don't get a SALT increase, tough luck. If they get their SALT increase, but you don't get your thing, tough luck.

The Senate hasn't even weighed in on the bill yet, so we're a long way from getting changes to SALT enshrined in law. But at this point, what should we take away from the SALT saga?

SALT is inherently interesting because it's a microcosm of the fragile political process in Congress at this time in which we often see parties with tiny minorities. Congressional leadership is more centralized than ever, but at the same time, small groups of people can really gum up the works. 

It also shows how complex the Republican coalition is — the fight over SALT is really a battle between lawmakers from high-income states and those from lower-income states. We've seen pro-SALT lawmakers make the claim that their states' tax base makes up a disproportionate amount of revenues, and that their constituents deserve a break because of that. 

And smaller states or states with lower incomes might say, in response, we have our own needs, and we provide a lot, from farming to the numbers that power our GOP coalition. 

I wouldn't say that the fight over SALT is a fight for the soul of the Republican Party, but it's definitely a factional fight for power.

And overall, it really shows how hard it is to actually legislate right now, in a divided Republican caucus, in a divided America.

The GOP remains a conspiracy to steal from the poor and give to the rich.

by  Dylan Matthews

Politics, you will notice, has gotten extremely weird.

To some degree, of course, this is Donald Trump's fault. No other president has seen the first part of their term defined by a fight over whether the federal government can send people living in the US to a prison in El Salvador with no due process. No other modern president has decided to ignore decades of settled economic and political wisdom and institute the biggest tariffs since the Hoover administration. No other president has waged war against the entire foundation of American science. 

Some weirdness is also the fault of Covid. The pandemic introduced a slew of policies that proved divisive, from mask mandates to vaccine mandates to funding for “gain of function” research to school closures. None of these were polarizing topics in 2019 because they either had never happened before or were too obscure for most people to care. And though we're a few years past the worst days of the pandemic, the appointment of anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary shows just how central many of these topics remain.

It's this context that has made Congress's debate over a multitrillion-dollar reconciliation bill, passed by the House of Representatives in the early morning hours of Thursday, May 22, so fascinating. The bill's ultimate contents are still evolving, and the Republican-led Senate will have to weigh in, but the broad outlines are simple: trillions in tax cuts, tilted to the wealthy; hundreds of billions in spending cuts, particularly to programs for the poor like Medicaid and food stamps; over a hundred billion dollars in increased spending for defense.

I know of no better summary of its effects than the above chart from the Urban Institute, which shows that it would make poor Americans earning less than $10,000 dramatically worse off (reducing their income by 14.9 percent) while affluent households earning over $200,000 would thrive.

So, all in all, a terrible bill. But whatever else that proposal is, it's startlingly normal for Republican politics. It represents ideas that have defined the Republican party and its economic and budgetary priorities since 1980, and which the party has strongly held to even in the face of Trump's total takeover. The Republican Party stands for lower taxes, especially on the rich; lower spending on programs for the poor; and big spending on defense. That's what Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich, Paul Ryan, and other figures who defined the party have all stood for, for nearly half a century now.

The extreme weirdness of national politics has led to a temptation to see a new Republican Party just over the horizon, defined by rejecting its tax-cutting and program-slashing tradition. This is stoked by strategic leaks that Trump might be open to a higher tax rate on the richest Americans; by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) condemning Medicaid cuts; by party figures like Vice President JD Vance suggesting a break from the party's hawkish foreign policy.

But the composition of the reconciliation bill suggests that when it comes to bread-and-butter economic issues, this is mostly a mirage. The essential Republican message may become blurred around the edges, the way that George W. Bush messed with it by expanding Medicare or his father did by accepting a small tax hike. But the deviations are swamped by the continuity. It's not, in the ludicrous phrasing of Steve Bannon, a “workers' party.”

Congressional Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have brought back normal politics, and for them that means one thing: redistributing income upward.

This essential pattern of Republicans standing for across-the-board tax cuts and cuts to safety net programs has not always been the norm. Nothing in politics is truly permanent. As late as Richard Nixon, Republican presidents would propose ideas like a guaranteed minimum income and universal health coverage while actually raising taxes on the rich.

The ground shifted in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a small group of policy entrepreneurs in Washington centered on Congress member Jack Kemp (R-NY) began promoting across-the-board cuts to individual income tax rates as a solution to stagflation (the combination of slow growth and high inflation then characterizing the economy). In her history of this moment, Starving the Beast, sociologist Monica Prasad notes that major business lobbies at the time opposed this move. Their priority was corporate rate cuts and a balanced budget, and they saw individual cuts as a threat to both.

Kemp and his allies, including soon-to-be-President Reagan, overcame corporate skepticism for one simple reason: The cuts were popular, and the public mood was becoming strongly anti-tax. At this point in time, the thresholds for tax rates were not indexed for inflation, which meant that more and more middle-class people were being pushed into higher and higher tax brackets every year without actually becoming richer as inflation worsened. These pressures had forced even Democrat Jimmy Carter to sign tax cuts in 1978, and they only built as inflation rose still further.

Tax Reform Act of 1969 — signed by Richard Nixon, cracked down on foundations, extended a temporary across-the-board income tax hike to fund the war in Vietnam, and created the Alternative Minimum Tax, meant to target high-earners claiming many deductions and credits. On net, substantially raised taxes on the rich while cutting them for the poor.

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 — signed by Ronald Reagan, across-the-board cut in tax rates for individuals, with top rate falling from 70 percent to 50 percent. Tax thresholds now indexed for inflation. Businesses allowed to deduct expenses at an accelerated pace.

Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 — also signed by Reagan, undid most of the 1981 cuts to corporate taxes, but crucially kept the cuts on individuals in place.

Tax Reform Act of 1986 — bipartisan legislation signed by Reagan that eliminated many deductions and credits and simplified the individual income tax to only two brackets (15 percent and 28 percent).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 — signed by George H.W. Bush, added a 31 percent bracket on the rich to raise revenue on top of the 1986 law. Bill Clinton would add 36 percent and 39.6 percent rates in 1993.

Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 — signed by Bill Clinton but championed by Republicans in Congress, created a $500 child tax credit and cut the capital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent.

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 — signed by George W. Bush, slashed individual rates across the board, with the top rate falling from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, and gradually eliminated the estate tax. Initially set to expire in 2010. Extended temporarily by Barack Obama in 2010 as part of an economic stimulus deal, and then in 2012 permanently, but only for couples earning under $450,000.

Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 — signed by George W. Bush, cut taxes on dividend and interest income, and limited the Alternative Minimum Tax's effects. Set to expire in 2010, like the 2001 cuts; largely expired under the 2012 Obama deal.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — signed by Donald Trump, cut individual rates with the top rate falling from 39.6 percent to 37 percent; doubled the standard deduction and consolidated personal and dependent exemptions into a larger child tax credit; dramatically cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. While some cuts, like the corporate rate cut, were permanent, most of the bill is set to expire at the end of 2025.

At the same time, Reagan and his team in the early 1980s were convinced that the US needed a major military buildout to counteract what they claimed had been a Soviet buildout in the 1970s. That led to a big increase in defense spending, from 6.6 percent of GDP in 1981 to 7.6 percent in 1985; at today's size of the US economy, an equivalent increase would be about $290 billion more per year.

To pay for at least some of this, Reagan's first reconciliation bill included sweeping cuts to safety net programs, notably including Medicaid, food stamps, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). This, too, fit well with Reagan's image. He had campaigned hard against establishing Medicare in the 1960s, and denunciations of “welfare queens” had been a prominent theme in his ultimately failed 1976 campaign for the presidency. This wasn't the most popular part of the Reagan brand (he denounced “welfare queens” while trying to win the Republican primary, not the general), but it reflected both his genuine beliefs and the twin pressures of the tax cuts and defense buildout on the budget.

This combination of policies was a profound break from the Nixon/Gerald Ford years, when tax cuts were not seriously considered, the priority with the Soviets was detente and arms control, and safety net programs were largely protected. And, sure enough, some Republicans continued to push back against the new regime. Sen. Bob Dole (R-KS) successfully fought to limit food stamps cuts; congressional Republicans worked with Democrats to expand Medicaid throughout the 1980s over Reagan's objections; most infamously, George H.W. Bush signed a bill adding a new 31 percent tax bracket for rich Americans in 1990, violating his pledge not to raise taxes.

But for the most part, the pattern established by Reagan has persisted ever since, and deviations — like Bush's tax hike, which contributed to his loss in 1992 — are remembered more as cautionary tales than examples to emulate.

Look at the Contract With America, the Republicans' platform during their successful 1994 bid to retake the House for the first time in over 40 years. It included tax cuts (like introducing a child tax credit and lower capital gains rates) and cuts to welfare and other safety net programs. While Bill Clinton was able to tamp down these demands somewhat, all became law in one form or another.

A few years later, George W. Bush began his first term with sweeping across-the-board tax cuts, and his second with a failed effort to slash Social Security spending in favor of individual accounts. In the Obama years, congressional Republicans, led by Paul Ryan, coalesced around plans for yet more across-the-board tax cuts and sweeping cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other safety net programs. Under Trump, Ryan was able to pass the former, though his attempts at the latter through Obamacare repeal failed.

Occasionally, a Republican politician will gesture at trying to break with this orthodoxy, and is invariably greeted with intrigued attention from the press. With George W. Bush in 2000, it was called “compassionate conservatism.” With Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty in 2005, it was “Sam's Club Republicanism.” With then-Sen. Marco Rubio and his allies in the press circa 2014, it was “reform conservatism.” 

These days the preferred term for Sen. Josh Hawley and Vice President JD Vance seems to be “national conservative,” which, like the Sam's Club and Reformocons before, purports to reject the tax-cutting orthodoxy of past Republicans in favor of a more communitarian vision — very little of which, of course, appears to have made its way into the budget bill. All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again.

But through each of these much-hyped fads, Normal Republicanism on the budget has survived more or less unchanged. The legacy of compassionate conservatism is a prescription drug benefit in Medicare administered by private insurers; the legacy of reform conservatism is mostly increasing the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 in 2017. These are slight ripples in a pattern that has been remarkably persistent.

The 2025 reconciliation package is a perfect illustration of these dynamics. Per a helpful tally by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the centerpiece of the legislation is the extension and expansion of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The cuts here will cost over $4.1 trillion over a decade. Remarkably, some of the cuts aren't even made permanent, but temporarily extended again, to artificially make the cost look lower than it is; if they're extended still further, the total cost of the TCJA extensions would be more like $4.8 trillion. While some last-minute tweaks before its passage on Thursday haven't yet been scored, the overall picture won't change.

These are tax cuts overwhelmingly tilted at the top. $1.4 trillion goes to repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax, which exists to prevent high-earners from taking excessive deductions; $2.2 trillion goes to cutting rates, including the top rate, which disproportionately helps the rich. The pass-through deduction, which arbitrarily lets some business owners exclude 20 percent of their profit from taxation, is extended and also expanded to 23 percent for no apparent reason, for a mere $820 billion. The Tax Policy Center has estimated that extending the TCJA increases incomes for the top 1 percent by an average of 3.7 percent, which swamps the 0.6 percent increase that the poorest fifth of Americans would get.

On top of this, the House Ways and Means Committee has thrown a potpourri of assorted other tax cuts: through 2028, for instance, tips, overtime income, and car loan interests would be tax-free, and senior citizens would get bigger standard deductions. The spending spree isn't limited to taxes, either. There's $144 billion from the Armed Services Committee, focused on shipbuilding ($32 billion) and “air superiority and missile defense” ($30 billion), and $67 billion for border security, including about $50 billion for Trump's long-promised wall.

The gross cost of all these giveaways hits around $5 trillion, before even considering the possibility that giveaways like the tips and overtime tax cuts are made permanent. But the net cost of the package, and impact on the deficit is “only” about $3.3 trillion, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 

What makes up the difference? $698 billion comes from cuts to Medicaid; including other cuts to Affordable Care Act subsidies, the bill will deprive about 10 million people of health insurance. $559 billion comes from undoing most of the Inflation Reduction Act's credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. $350 billion comes from cuts to education, heavily focused on student loan programs and subsidies meant to make them more affordable for borrowers. $267 billion comes from food stamps, slashing the program by about 30 percent overall.

There's a lot to say about this set of priorities. The Medicaid and food stamp cuts target the most vulnerable Americans and, combined with the tax cuts for the wealthy, amount to extreme upward redistribution. The Inflation Reduction Act cuts will likely substantially increase energy prices for most Americans, while substantially increasing emissions. I know of no serious economist who thinks that many of the most expensive provisions in the bill, like deductibility of overtime income or the pass-through business deduction, are effective ways to boost economic growth.

But, at a moment where so many assumptions about politics have been overturned, the plan is not surprising. This is not a radically different Republican Party newly attuned to the interests of the working class. It's not a party whose tax-cutting passions have been tempered now that their president is imposing new taxes left and right on foreign imports in the form of tariffs (and which will be borne disproportionately by lower-income Americans). It's not a party reflecting the fact that Medicaid recipients narrowly voted for Trump over Kamala Harris in 2024.

It's just the normal Reagan-Gingrich-Bush-Ryan Republican Party, same as it's ever been.

Why, then, are people so eager to hear that the Republican Party has changed? Part of it might be the simple fact that voters have had trouble accepting that a political party could actually be like this. 

When Priorities USA, a Democratic super-PAC in the 2012 election, told a focus group that Mitt Romney wanted to slash Medicare while cutting taxes on the rich, “the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing,” per reporter Robert Draper. 

It does sound vaguely ridiculous: It defies common sense that cutting taxes on the wealthy and funding it with spending cuts on programs for poor and working people would ever be a compelling political message, perhaps outside the extreme inflationary environment of the 1970s that birthed Reagan's presidency.

But ridiculous or not, that's the world we have. The Republican Party's budgetary views simply have not changed. They want to blow up the deficit with massive tax cuts tilted toward the rich and pay for a fraction of the cost by slashing programs for the poor. It's really that simple. It may not be exciting or brand new. But it's normal Republican policymaking, and it's back with a vengeance.

Trump is promising tax cuts and a new golden age. Here's what's really inside it.

by  Andrew Prokop

Editor's note, May 22, 8:30 am ET: The House passed a version of Trump's bill early Thursday morning. It now goes to the Senate, where Republicans say they want more changes to the bill. This story was originally published on Monday.

President Donald Trump's second term has so far been dominated by his aggressive use of executive power — but now, he's finally trying to get something through Congress.

This week, Republicans in the House of Representatives will attempt to pass what Trump has deemed the “one big, beautiful bill.” It is the centerpiece — really, the only major piece — of Trump's legislative agenda. He's trying to stuff everything he wants into this, in hopes of ramming it through both the House and Senate on a party line vote. 

Trump wants a few main things from the bill. First is preventing the “Trump tax cuts” he passed back in 2017 from expiring at the end of the year. Second is passing, in some form, a bunch of new tax breaks he promised during the campaign, such as “no tax on tips.” Third is spending a bunch more money on immigration enforcement and the military. Fourth is an increase in the debt ceiling (the limit on new debt the government can issue, which Congress periodically has to agree to raise).

All this is quite expensive, so how will Republicans pay for it? Mostly, they won't: The vast majority of it will be unpaid for and just increase the debt, while other costs will be hidden with gimmicks. But the House GOP has proposed paying for some with deep cuts to Medicaid, clean energy, student loans, and food stamps, among other areas.

The problem is that Republicans have narrow majorities in both chambers and deep disagreements on policy. Fiscal hawks are demanding deeper spending cuts. Some Republicans have complained about the Medicaid cuts; others dislike the clean energy cuts. One key group is demanding the rollback of a Trump tax hike that mostly hit affluent people in blue states back in 2017 — an expensive change that would blow up the bill's budget math.

So right now, the big, beautiful bill is a big, ugly mess. But even if Republicans resolve their differences and pass something, it may not get much prettier. Trump is proceeding as if we're still in the low-inflation, low interest-rate environment of the 2010s. But things are different now, and running up the deficit yet again may have some painful economic consequences.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

Let's walk through what's in the House version of the bill, starting with the big things Trump and Republicans want.

In his first year as president in 2017, Trump's major legislative accomplishment was his tax bill that lowered rates for most people. To make that bill look less costly, Republicans used the time-honored trick of setting those new lower tax rates to expire eventually — at the end of 2025. 

So if Congress does nothing, most Americans' income taxes would increase next year. Because this would be quite unpopular, the political world believes this extension is by far the most likely provision to make it into the final bill. It's a “must pass.”

Policy-wise, keeping these lower tax rates in place is nothing new, it just continues the (irresponsible) status quo. From a budgetary perspective, though, it's by far the most expensive thing in the bill — it would increase the deficit by about $4 trillion over the next decade. 

During the campaign, Trump promised to do various nice-sounding things, including ending taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security income. House Republicans' bill tries to at least somewhat make good on these promises, adding new tax deductions for tipped income and overtime income, and a higher standard deduction for seniors.

But because these are expensive, the GOP is playing even more blatant games with the budget math than usual: They're setting these new tax breaks to expire at the end of 2028. Basically, Trump is creating a huge budget mess for his successor to clean up (as a Simpsons episode predicted he would back in 2000).

There's one more twist here. Trump funded the old 2017 tax bill in part by hiking taxes on affluent blue-state people, by sharply limiting the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. House Republicans from New York and California have long loathed this policy and they're pushing hard to roll it back as much as they can. The problem is that doing so is very expensive, so GOP leaders are resisting.

Then there's Trump's new spending priorities: immigration and military spending. Trump wants about $50 billion for his border wall and other border facilities, and billions more for US Customs and Border Protection. He also wants money for his planned “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, shipbuilding, munitions, and other military priorities.

The debt ceiling is the legal limit on new debt the US government can issue; every few years we get close to hitting it, and Congress has to raise it — or else risk an economic crisis if we do hit it. This typically leads to bipartisan negotiations, posturing, and in some cases high-stakes political showdowns. 

Trump is not interested in dealing with Democrats on this, so he's just throwing it in this bill. (Doing this adds another element of urgency to try to force squabbling Republicans to unite: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the debt ceiling must be raised by mid-July.)

Over the next decade, extending the old Trump tax cuts would cost about $4 trillion. Plus, his new tax breaks (for four years) and his military and border spending, would cost another $1 trillion — so the cost of the bill is about $5 trillion.

Most of this, again, just won't be paid for. But Republicans are proposing some spending cuts to pay for some of it — a little less than half. Their top targets are Medicaid, clean energy, student loans, and food stamps.

The House GOP proposed new Medicaid policies that, in practice, would amount to steep cuts and make more than 7 million people uninsured, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

These policies include work requirements for Medicaid recipients (who aren't seniors, pregnant, disabled, or caregivers). They also include several other new requirements for paperwork and eligibility checks. Critics say that these added hurdles will inevitably result in many rightfully qualifying recipients losing their coverage — and argue that that is likely the point.

The bill also would punish states that use their own money to fund health coverage for unauthorized immigrants by cutting their federal Medicaid funds. (Fourteen mostly blue states and the District of Columbia currently fund coverage for children even if they are undocumented.) 

The House bill would roll back many of the new tax credits that the Biden administration created for clean energy, including credits for electric vehicles, clean power production, energy efficiency, and even nuclear power. Critics say this could badly hurt or even decimate a booming industry, and that it would hurt the fight against climate change by marking low or zero-carbon energy more expensive.

The bill also overhauls the student loan program, creating bigger and costlier requirements for repayment of loans, limiting future loan availability, and ending certain loan or repayment programs.

Finally, the House GOP is also proposing deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps. It would require states to start paying a share of the program's costs — between 5 percent and 25 percent, depending on their payment error rates. It would also expand work requirements, already in place for many recipients, to 55- to 64-year-olds.

Many of these cuts are controversial, even among some Republicans, and it's unclear which will make it into the final version of the bill. But currently, House GOP fiscal hawks are saying all this isn't enough, and they're demanding even steeper cuts, saying it would be completely irresponsible to add so much to the deficit otherwise.

While many of the cuts they're proposing would target the most vulnerable and seem cruel, they have a point about the deficit. Trump and GOP leaders are proceeding as if conditions are similar to 2017 — a time when interest rates were low, inflation was low, and Trump could pass a big deficit-increasing tax cut bill with few negative economic consequences. And indeed, both parties have tuned out warnings about the deficit and debt for years.

But conditions have changed. The US just went through a period of its highest inflation in decades. Interest rates remain high, in an attempt to prevent such inflation from roaring back. US Treasury bond rates are also high, which many interpret as signaling investors are concerned about the budget deficit. Years of big spending are adding up, and interest payments on the debt are rising.

All that is to say that a big budget-busting bill could be much more damaging to the economy than it was in 2017. And yet Republicans appear to be going full steam ahead anyway. It remains to be seen whether they can actually come to an agreement and pass a bill — but even if they do pull it off, they should be wary of getting what they wish for.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","BYD overtakes Tesla in Europe for the first time. That's more bad news for Elon Musk.","https://www.businessinsider.com/byd-tesla-sales-europe-elon-musk-ev-china-2025-5","Thu, 22 May 2025 10:11:00 GMT","

BYD just scored a major win against Tesla in one of its biggest markets.

The Chinese electric vehicle giant outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as Elon Musk's automaker saw its sales collapse amid furious backlash over its CEO's politics.

BYD sold 7,230 battery-electric vehicles in April, compared to 7,165 for Tesla, according to JATO Dynamics data.

It's a major milestone for the Chinese brand, and suggests BYD has taken advantage of Tesla's alarming decline in Europe.

ƒNew Tesla registrations dropped nearly 50% in April compared to the same month last year, while BYD sales surged 169% over the same period, per JATO Dynamics data.

BYD outsold Tesla without even taking hybrid sales into account. The Chinese carmaker sold 12,525 vehicles last month, meaning its total sales comfortably outstripped Tesla, which only sells battery-powered EVs.

Tesla has taken a battering this year in Europe, its third-largest market after the US and China. The automaker's European sales were down 30% in the first three months of 2025, according to JATO Dynamics, despite EV sales rising overall.

The automaker has faced a wave of backlash over CEO Musk's role in the Trump administration and endorsement of German far-right party AfD.

In an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Musk denied Tesla was facing a sales slump. That was despite Tesla reporting its weakest quarter for deliveries since 2022 last month as it retooled factories for the launch of its updated Model Y.

""Europe is our weakest market. We're strong everywhere else. Sales are doing well at this point, we don't anticipate any meaningful sales shortfall,"" said Musk.

By contrast, BYD is racing to launch new models as it seeks to capitalize on its explosive growth in Europe.

The Chinese brand unveiled the Dolphin Surf, the European version of its cheap Seagull EV, on Wednesday.

The compact hatchback will go on sale in 15 European markets in June, with prices starting at 23,000 euros ($26,000) — about $19,000 less than Tesla's cheapest model.

Having challenged Tesla in China, BYD is eyeing aggressive expansion overseas. The EV giant sold 79,000 vehicles outside China last month, nearly double the total in April 2024.

A new North Korean naval destroyer was badly damaged during a botched shipyard launch that caused part of its hull to be ""crushed,"" Pyongyang state media reported.

The Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday morning local time that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was attending the ceremony at the Chongjin shipyard when the ""serious accident"" occurred.

Blaming ""inexperienced command and operational carelessness,"" KCNA wrote that the stern of the 5,000-ton ship started sliding down a ramp too early and that a flatcar meant to support its weight didn't move with the vessel.

The report said this caused the ship to lose balance, leaving ""some sections of the warship's bottom crushed"" while the rest of the ship was stuck.

According to KCNA, Kim blasted the disastrous launch, saying it was ""out of the bounds of possibility and could not be tolerated.""

He also called the launch a ""serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility, and unscientific empiricism,"" state media wrote.

It reported that Kim censured the officials responsible for the ship and its launch, including the country's munitions department and ship designers, and said their mistakes would be ""dealt with"" at a party meeting next month.

The North Korean leader was further cited as saying that the mishap ""brought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse in a moment.""

The failed launch is a blow to Kim's military agenda, given his emphasis over the past two years on building up North Korea's maritime forces.

""A new historic time is coming before our naval forces,"" Kim said during a 2023 speech, declaring North Korea would focus on capabilities for projecting naval power beyond its own waters.

The same year, Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile submarine, the Hero Kim Kun Ok, which is a redesigned Soviet model equipped to fire cruise missiles.

Last month, North Korea launched the largest warship it had ever built, a 5,000-ton ""multipurpose"" destroyer, which it said was a new class of armed vessel.

That was at Nampo, a different shipyard. But its tonnage could indicate that the vessel that failed to launch on Wednesday was in the same class. State media didn't provide further details about the damaged ship at Chongjin.

In March, North Korea said it was also building its first nuclear-powered submarine.

President Donald Trump's signature tax bill narrowly passed the House Thursday morning, advancing a sprawling multi-trillion dollar package that would avert a year-end tax increase at the expense of adding to the US debt burden.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where groups of Republicans are pressing for extensive change. Lawmakers plan to vote on approval by August. The bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the US debt ceiling, which the Treasury Department forecasts could otherwise force a default as soon as August or September, adding urgency to the timeline.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Lightspeed Commerce Inc. was the worst performer on the S&P/TSX Composite Index Thursday after the point-of-sale operator reported a $556 million impairment charge amid economic uncertainty for small retailers.

The Montreal-based company's earnings were largely in line with analyst estimates for the fourth quarter ended March 31. But Lightspeed also wrote down its goodwill after its net assets exceeded its March 31 market capitalization of C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion). Revenue during the 2025 fiscal year reached nearly $1.1 billion, up 18% from the previous year and a milestone for the company.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

Anthropic, the Amazon-backed OpenAI rival, on Thursday launched its most powerful group of artificial intelligence models yet: Claude 4.

The company said the two models, called Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, are defining a ""new standard"" when it comes to AI agents and ""can analyze thousands of data sources, execute long-running tasks, write human-quality content, and perform complex actions,"" per a release.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI research executives, launched its Claude chatbot in March 2023. since then, it's been part of the increasingly heated AI arms race taking place between startups and tech giants alike, a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade. 

Companies in seemingly every industry are rushing to add AI-powered chatbots and agents to avoid being left behind by competitors.

Anthropic stopped investing in chatbots at the end of last year and has instead focused on improving Claude's ability to do complex tasks like research and coding, even writing whole code bases, according to Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer. 

He also acknowledged that ""the more complex the task is, the more risk there is that the model is going to kind of go off the rails ... and we're really focused on addressing that so that people can really delegate a lot of work at once to our models.""

""We've been training these models since last year and really anticipating them,"" Kaplan said in an interview. ""I think these models are much, much stronger as agents and as coders. It was definitely a struggle internally just because some of the new infrastructure we were using to train these models... made it very down-to-the-wire for the teams in terms of getting everything up and running.""

Kaplan added that once they tried to get the model testers to switch back off of the new models because they needed to iterate on them, no one wanted to give up access.

Anthropic said Claude Opus 4 was the ""best coding model in the world"" and could autonomously work for nearly a full corporate workday — seven hours.

Both models can search the web to complete tasks on a user's behalf and alternate between reasoning and tool use, according to Anthropic. The company also said that when given access to local files, they can extract and save ""key facts to maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time.""

""I do a lot of writing with Claude, and I think prior to Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, I was mostly using the models as a thinking partner, but still doing most of the writing myself,"" Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, said in an interview. ""And they've crossed this threshold where now most of my writing is actually ... Opus mostly, and it now is unrecognizable from my writing.""

Krieger added, ""I love that we're kind of pushing the frontier on two sides. Like one is the coding piece and agentic behavior overall, and that's powering a lot of these coding startups. ... But then also, we're pushing the frontier on how these models can actually learn from and then be a really useful writing partner, too.""

Anthropic's annualized revenue reached $2 billion in the first quarter, the company confirmed last week, more than doubling from a $1 billion rate in the prior period. Revenue chief Kate Jensen said in a recent interview with CNBC that the number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually with Anthropic jumped eightfold from a year ago.

Wall Street continues to pour money into AI startups like Anthropic: The company received a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit line last week to amp up its liquidity in an ever-expanding — and expensive — AI competition.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives came together early Thursday to pass President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" tax bill out of the chamber on a narrow vote.

Every Democrat on the floor voted no, as did Republican Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, voted present. The final vote tally was 215-214.

The passage was a major victory for Republican leaders, who spent the past two months crafting the bill and the past two days making last-minute changes to it. 

The more than 1,000 pages of legislation and 42 pages of amendments are a case study in how to win over both moderates and hard-line conservatives.

House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, said he wishes that the bill had gone further on tax cuts, but that the caucus ""did what we could.""

""I was the last vote [cast], and I wasn't going to take the bill down,"" he told NBC News.

Trump praised Speaker Mike Johnson and House GOP leadership after the bill passed and thanked ""every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill!""

""Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!"" the president wrote Thursday morning on Truth Social. ""There is no time to waste.""

Johnson aims to get the package to Trump's desk by July 4. ""Today proves that we can do that and we will do that,"" the speaker said.

On Wall Street, however, investors were not as enthusiastic about the tax cut package as Republicans in Washington were.

Major indexes fell Wednesday, as analysts and corporate leaders worried that Trump's expensive spending bill will lead to exploding federal deficits and weaker long-term fiscal health for the nation. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond yield hit 5.09%.

Democrats, likewise, are vehemently opposed to the bill's steep cuts to the social safety net in order to pay for some of the tax cuts Trump promised on the campaign trail last year.

An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the bill were to become law, ""in general, resources would decrease for households in the lowest decile (tenth) of the income distribution, whereas resources would increase for households in the highest decile.""

The package still faces a complicated path through the Senate, however.

The upper chamber will consider the legislation under a set of rules called budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass instead of the typical 60 votes required to move bills through the Senate.

Nonetheless, several Republican senators have already said they will require significant changes to the bill before agreeing to vote for it. 

The final version of the bill that passed Thursday contained scores of amendments, designed to give each of the competing factions within the House GOP conference a win.

For example, a timeline for imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients was moved up by two years, to the end of 2026 — a victory for conservatives.

But the amendments also contained a fourfold increase in the cap on deductions that federal income tax filers can claim for state and local taxes they paid. 

The maximum SALT deduction increases from its current level of $10,000 to $40,000, for taxpayers reporting less than $500,000 in income.

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who was a firm holdout on the bill until it included the SALT cap increase, called the legislation ""vital to really kick-start our economy and give folks certainty in the marketplace.""

""The fact is, we delivered on something, this is a big promise that I made to my district, that I would fight tooth and nail and I would never support a tax bill that didn't adequately lift the cap on SALT, and that's what we delivered here today,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" after the vote.

Ahead of the vote, the House Rules Committee convened for 21 straight hours of debate and amendments in order to meet Johnson's self-imposed Memorial Day deadline for passing the bill.

The broader bill seeks to deliver on Trump's key campaign promises, and includes provisions to make permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Thursday to reinstate more than 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees.

""The Department must be able to carry out its functions and its obligations,"" as well as ""other relevant statutes as mandated by Congress,"" U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston wrote in the preliminary injunction.

The Department of Education announced a reduction in force on March 11 that would have gutted the agency's staff by a half.

Two days later, 21 states — including Michigan, Nevada and New York — filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its staff cuts at the Education Department.

After President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 20 aimed at dismantling the Education Department, more parties sued to save the agency, including the American Federation of Teachers.

In the injunction on Thursday, the judge pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of 12 offices tasked with the enforcement of civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race and disability.

The entire team that supervises the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was also eliminated, the judge said. (Around 17 million families apply for college aid each year using the form, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.)

""This is good news for students,"" said James Kvaal, who served as U.S. undersecretary of education for former President Joe Biden. ""Colleges are already warning that these mass layoffs put financial aid at risk, and millions of borrowers need help avoiding loan default later this year.""

Thursday's ruling also seemed to block the Trump administration's goal of transferring the country's $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to the Small Business Administration from the Education Department, said Kantrowitz.

Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the decision.

""Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,"" Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC.

She added that the Trump administration would be challenging the ruling on an emergency basis.

Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day U.S. Department of Education in 1979. Since then, the agency has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

A woman was shot and wounded at CIA headquarters after crashing into a gate there early Thursday morning, NBC News reported.

The woman has been preliminarily identified as 27-year-old Monia Spadaro, two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the incident told NBC.

The officials are investigating whether Spadaro was intoxicated during the incident on CIA property in Langley, Virginia. She is being treated for the gunshot wounds, the officials said, NBC reported.

Spadaro was found guilty in 2021 on a charge of driving while intoxicated, filings in Arlington General District Court show. Her sentence of 180 days in jail was suspended, according to the court filings.

The CIA earlier said, ""There was a security incident that law enforcement responded to outside CIA Headquarters.""

""The main gate is currently closed, employees should seek alternative routes. Additional details will be made available as appropriate,"" a spokesperson for the agency told CNBC.

The spokesperson declined CNBC's requests for additional information.

The shooting incident took place hours after officials said two Israeli Embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were shot and killed outside D.C.'s Capital Jewish Museum.

There is no evidence that the two incidents are linked.

Fairfax County Police told NBC that they responded around 4 a.m. ET to the 900 block of Dolley Madison Boulevard to help the CIA with traffic control following the latest shooting.

There are currently no road closures, the police department said.

The CIA headquarters building, known since 1999 as the George Bush Center for Intelligence, has seen violence before.

In January 1993, Mir Aimal Kansi killed two CIA employees and wounded three others in front of the building. And in March, a man engaged in an hourslong standoff with law enforcement outside the headquarters before surrendering.

In this article

Solar stocks plunged Thursday after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits.

Residential solar installer Sunrun plummeted more than 35%. The legislation ends tax credits for installers like Sunrun that lease equipment to customers.

The GOP bill is a ""worse than feared"" scenario for clean energy, as it takes a ""sledgehammer"" to the Inflation Reduction Act, Jefferies analysts led by Julien Dumoulin-Smith told clients in a note.

Some 70% of the rooftop solar industry now uses lease arrangements, making the bill disastrous for companies like Sunrun, Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha told clients.

Enphase and SolarEdge sank about 16% and 24%, respectively, as sales of their inverters would take a hit from lower demand for rooftop solar.

The bill also ends the investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after the legislation is enacted or enter service after Dec. 31, 2028. Those credits have played a key role in the rapid expansion of utility-scale solar projects in the U.S.

Solar stocks exposed to the utility sector tumbled, with Array falling more than 13% and Nextracker down more than 6%. Array and Nextracker make devices that allow solar panels to track the position of the sun.

First Solar, however, fell just over 3% as the bill left the manufacturing tax credit relatively unscathed. First Solar is the biggest producer of solar panels in the U.S. with a large domestic manufacturing footprint.

""Manufacturing subsidies do not appear to have been touched – good news for FSLR,"" Osha said. While the bill is bad for solar, Jefferies expects the Senate to make changes to the legislation.

U.S. President Donald Trump has never been the one to hold back an opinion.

""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,"" Trump said on a trip to Qatar last week, referring to a conversation he had with Apple's chief executive about the company's decision to move iPhone manufacturing from China to India, rather than the United States.

""I don't want you building in India,"" Trump said he told Cook, after news emerged of Apple's decision to ramp up production in India with the aim of making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the next few years, and reduce reliance on China, where around 90% of its flagship smartphone is currently assembled.

While India has certainly emerged as a significant, albeit nascent, hub for electronics assembly, the path to it becoming a clear-cut alternative to China isn't a guaranteed outcome, despite U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.

Geopolitical upheavals appear to be one of the many such hurdles for India, as well as businesses eyeing the country.

For Apple, moving manufacturing to the United States, instead of India, from China still remains within the realm of possibilities, even if improbable for the company.

If Apple were to move final assembly to the United States, iPhone costs could increase by 25% due to higher U.S. labor costs, according to analysts from Bank of America. However, that assumes subcomponents, like cameras, are still partly assembled outside the U.S.

To put that into context, the base model for iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $1,199 to buy outright, with $125.90 added in local taxes in Louisiana, for instance. Final assembly and testing in the U.S. would simply add $160 to the consumer's bill.

Meanwhile, the jobs at stake are performed by 1.4 million people employed by Apple's suppliers overseas.

Could Trump and his backers believe that the additional costs might be worth paying if many thousands of jobs are created in the U.S.?

""If Apple does move final assembly to the U.S., it would need tariff waivers on components/sub-assemblies manufactured globally to make the manufacturing shifts viable,"" BofA's Wamsi Mohan said in a note to clients.

While technically possible, Mohan views moving the entire iPhone supply chain to the U.S. as a ""much bigger undertaking"" that would ""likely take many years, if even possible,"" and does not expect near-term manufacturing shifts to the U.S. unless tariff policies become permanent.

The core challenge for India extends beyond just attracting companies.

""Supply chain and manufacturing, these things take a long time to establish,"" said Nick McConway, head of Asia ex-Japan equity at Amundi Asset Management. ""We saw that with Vietnam, who had to put huge investment into infrastructure. The lights have to stay on, the roads have to be there, the trucks have to get there in time.""

""I think India is only at the very early stage of developing these types of globally facing manufacturing capacities,"" McConway added.

The fund manager also highlighted that while labor costs can be low in India, it doesn't mean savings for companies moving their manufacturing base to India.

""While your labour costs can be low, your unit labour cost is not because the productivity is no good,"" McConway said.

Meanwhile, for the U.S., this productivity gap can offset the advantages of cheaper labor, making it difficult for India to compete effectively on a global scale for high-value manufacturing. Apple has also made significant progress in automating several roles in its final assembly line, reducing the number of people required by more than 50% since the process began.

And even if India wins a larger share of Apple's iPhone assembly business, the benefits for the country are likely to be minimal, according to one analyst.

""Today, India earns just $30 per iPhone, much of which is given back to Apple as subsidy under the [Production Linked Incentive] scheme,"" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of think tank Global Trade Research Initiative.

Srivastava, a former trade negotiator for India, took a protectionist approach and suggested that New Delhi's reduction of tariffs on smartphone components at the behest of Apple could hurt domestic efforts to build a local component ecosystem.

""If Apple's assembly moves out, India will be forced to stop propping up shallow assembly lines and instead invest in deeper manufacturing—chips, displays, batteries, and beyond.""

In the end, it might not even be Trump's push to reshore manufacturing back to the U.S. that devoid India of foreign investment. The country might just have work harder to attract investors.

— CNBC's Michael Bloom and Arjun Kharpal contributed reporting.

India's market is one of the best long-term plays, analysts say. As the ""sell U.S."" narrative picks up steam amid U.S. tariff turbulence and concerns over the country's mounting fiscal deficit, emerging markets have gained traction as an attractive alternative for investors. Among emerging markets, Malcolm Dorson, head of the active investment team at Global X ETFs, believes India offers the best long-term growth play, a sentiment echoed by Mohit Mirpuri, equity fund manager at SGMC Capital, who said that theme is anchored in India's domestic demand.

India is hoping for a full exemption from the U.S.' ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The duties on the South Asian country come in at 26%, and officials are seeking to strike a deal with the U.S. to do away with the tariffs completely, according to CNBC TV18. However, India is reluctant to let goods like agriculture and dairy be imported, which is likely proving to be a roadblock in the negotiations, said former Indian Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation Jayant Dasgupta. That said, India's large domestic economy and low dependence on imports could shield it from the impact of tariffs, according to a Moody's Ratings report released May 21.

Britain and the U.S. are working together to preserve the India-Pakistan ceasefire. ""Confidence-building measures"" and dialogues are on the table, U.K. Foreign Minister David Lammy said on Saturday. India on May 6 said its armed forces had conducted strikes against Pakistan and what it calls Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting ""terrorist infrastructure."" The operation follows a militant attack last month in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.

Indian stocks have declined over the past week by more than 1.5% so far. The Nifty 50 index has risen by 3.65% this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield has ticked slightly lower to 6.22%, down by 2 basis points over the past week.

On CNBC TV this week, Lavina Quadros, managing director of equities research at Jefferies India, said India's defense sector has ""come a long way"" in the last ten years, since the government pushed to reduce such imports to 30% from 70%. Investor confidence in Indian defense firms has also been boosted because domestic air defense systems, for instance, have successfully intercepted foreign drones. But execution of orders remains a key concern for investors.

Meanwhile, Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of the Indian Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, noted that the global supply chain will likely look different by 2030 — and India intends to play a key role in it. The country is already ""a very important part of the global services supply chain,"" a fact neglected by many, and will now focus on efforts in manufacturing, especially in the electronics and metals, Sanyal added. Even if the U.S. wants to reindustrialize itself, the country will still have to rely on others for materials, and that presents an opportunity for India, Sanyal said.

In a vote early Thursday, House members approved President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" tax bill, including a new savings account for children with a one-time deposit of $1,000 from the federal government.

Under the proposal, ""Trump Accounts"" — previously known as ""Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement"" or ""MAGA Accounts"" — can later be used for education expenses or credentials, the down payment on a first home or as capital to start a small business.  

The final version of the bill that House Republicans passed Thursday could still face pushback in the Senate.

If the bill passes as drafted, parents will be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year and the balance will be invested in a diversified fund that tracks a U.S.-stock index.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who spearheaded the effort, said the accounts give children ""the miracle of the compound growth, the ability to accumulate wealth, which is transformational.""

Not unlike a 529 college savings plan, the Trump Account has a tax incentive to getting a jump start on saving. Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate.

""This isn't all that different from the tax treatment you would get from a typical brokerage account,"" said Sam Taube, NerdWallet's lead investing writer.

Other similar options already exist. Custodial brokerage accounts — often called a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) account — also allow parents to transfer bank deposits, stocks, bonds and mutual funds to minors. But in that case, investment income, including dividends and interest, could be subject to a ""kiddie tax"" charged to the parents at their rate.

With 529 accounts, alternatively, earnings grow on a tax-advantaged basis, and when a child withdraws the money, it is tax-free if the funds are used for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board.

""We continue to believe that 529 plans provide tremendous benefits as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle for American families, with a proven nearly 30-year track record,"" said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation, a nonprofit that provides public policy support for 529 plans.

Although there are more limitations on what 529 funds can be applied to compared to Trump Accounts, restrictions have loosened in recent years to include continuing education classes, apprenticeship programs and student loan payments.

Plus, 529 accounts have much higher contribution limits. This year, individuals can gift up to $19,000, or up to $38,000 if you're married and file taxes jointly, per child without those contributions counting toward your lifetime gift tax exemption.

""For most parents, like myself with teens, the 529 college savings plan is superior if you're focused on paying for higher education because of the federal tax-free growth,"" said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California.

""Also, now, the 529 is becoming more flexible with its' ability to have unused funds rolled into a Roth IRA in the future for retirement,"" said Sun, a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. 

As of 2024, families can roll over unused 529 funds to the account beneficiary's Roth individual retirement account, without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements.

Experts say the biggest benefit of Trump Accounts is the seed money for all children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, funded by the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements and everyone is eligible, as long as the child is a U.S. citizen, and both parents have Social Security numbers.

Although some states, including Connecticut and Colorado, already offer a type of ""baby bonds"" program for parents, the Trump Accounts — along with a bigger child tax credit proposed in the budget bill — ""could certainly help a lot of families at a lot of different income levels,"" said NerdWallet's Taube.

Further, these accounts are not mutually exclusive from other tax-advantaged accounts, like 529 plans, he added, ""so parents could take advantage of both.""

Still, for parents weighing their options for early investment vehicles, ""my recommendation would be, if you're focused on college savings, talk to an advisor and start with the 529 plan first,"" Sun said.

A sell-off in global bonds is accelerating as Moody's downgrade of U.S. credit rating and President Donald Trump's tax bill has brought to fore investors' fiscal concerns globally.

Events such as credit rating downgrades or budgets that risk expanding deficits tend to bring fiscal concerns front and center of investors' minds, forcing them to reprice long-end risk, said Rong Ren Goh, Portfolio Manager, Fixed Income, Eastspring Investments.

While Trump was unable to sway GOP dissenters to support his broad tax bill that could drive U.S. debt higher by a projected $3 trillion to $5 trillion, it appears to have triggered a global bond rout.

""Markets do not find Trump's ""big, beautiful tax bill"" beautiful at all,"" said Vishnu Varathan, a managing director at Mizuho Securities. ""USTs were beaten up in an ugly sell-off.""

The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield broke above the key 5% mark for the second straight day, breaching the level last reached in November 2023. It is currently holding at 5.088%. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has climbed over 15 basis points since the start of the week.

The sell-off in Treasurys comes on the back of the exodus in American assets in April, and is largely owed to investors' declining confidence in U.S. assets, said market watchers.

When investors dumped U.S. Treasuries last month, they turned to bonds in Japan and Germany. This time, the Treasury sell-off is accompanied by investors exiting bonds across several major markets.

The sell-off in long-duration bonds in each market has been driven by distinct factors, with the common thread being a growing unease with worsening fiscal trajectories. ""These concerns are prompting a reassessment of the term premium required to hold longer-dated bonds,"" said Goh.

Japan's 40-year government bond yield hit a record high of 3.689% Thursday. The country's 30-year government bond yield has also been hovering near all-time highs at 3.187%.

The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond has climbed 9 basis points to 1.57% so far this week.

The rapid steepening of Japan's government bond yield curve is owed to several reasons, but the key one is structural. Japanese life insurance companies, who used to buy long-term bonds in droves to comply with certain solvency regulations are no longer doing that, as they have largely met the regulatory criteria, according to Bank of America.

Additionally, the Bank of Japan's inclination to tighten its monetary policy, which collides with the Asian nation's fiscal woes, also have a hand in fueling the bond sell-off, said Varathan.

The sell-off in Japanese government bonds poses a bigger problem for U.S. sovereign debt. ""By making Japanese assets an attractive alternative for local investors, it encourages further divestment from the U.S.,"" George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank's global head of FX strategy wrote in a note.

German government bonds — known as bunds — are also being dumped. Yield on 30-year German debt are up over 12 basis points, while the 10-year yield is up over 6 basis points.

""The removal of the German debt brake in tandem with continental re-armament, alluding to an end of Europe's pro-austerity bias and a revival of regional growth prospects were, arguably, the catalyst for the process [bond sell-off],"" said Philip McNicholas, Asia strategist of the global macro fixed income team at Robeco.

German bunds are also pressured by wider deficits, which are likely to be structural, Mizuho Securities' Varathan said. 

The 30-year Europe government bond yields have climbed over 12 basis points this week, and the 10-year yields are up about 7 basis points.

""Investors don't really have much love for long duration bonds right now,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers told CNBC.

Concerns about global inflation are also a ""killer"" for longer bonds, said Sosnick, adding that shorter duration bonds are typically influenced by central bank policy, while longer duration debt is influenced more by investor expectations about the future of the economy.

Bonds in some emerging market have bucked the wider trend though, with their yields dropping.

India and China's 10-year bond yields have slipped, largely as they are more domestically-oriented markets, and in part because of their capital controls, said McNicholas.

India's 10-year government bond yield inched lower by about 2 basis points since Monday, while China's 10-year yield also slipped marginally.

""Foreign investors and global factors are far less relevant determinants for their respective yield curves,"" he said.

Washington's protectionist trade policies are posing a ""real challenge"" to European nations as they seek to raise their security contributions, according to Barclays CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan.

""I think Europe has a real challenge in adjusting to tariffs. It's got to find space, fiscal space, to increase defense spending, and it's got to look at consolidation in financial institutions, in within its market,"" the executive told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Thursday. 

The European Union currently faces a 25% U.S. import tariff on its steel, aluminum and cars and was in April struck with an additional 20% ""reciprocal"" levy under the White House's fresh wide-spanning trade policies. The latter duty has been temporarily reduced to 10% during a 90-day reprieve that expires in July, paving the way for Washington and the 27-member European bloc to join the negotiations table for a more favorable trade agreement.

A deal has yet to be struck, with markets mired in uncertainty and with concerns mounting over the EU's economic growth outlook and potential inflationary and recessionary risks in the world's largest economy. The trade developments affecting the two historically allied nations have cast a shadow on the EU's efforts to overhaul its fiscal policies and galvanize defense spending under the bloc's ""ReArm Europe Plan.""

The volatility has encumbered companies that seek to understand the impact of tariffs and regulation on their business model, Barclays' Venkatakrishnan said.

""You can look at the companies that have withdrawn earnings guidance over the year, and those are the industries that are more deeply affected. And there, they might decide — not now, but over time — that there needs to be further consolidation or further rewiring of their business models,"" he said. ""And then activity will increase, and we can help them. And then there are others who are ... taking advantage of the relative calm to continue to expand their businesses.""

British bank Barclays has had a notable presence stateside since absorbing the investment banking and capital markets businesses of collapsed Wall Street titan Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion. The lender is navigating calmer seas at home, after Trump unveiled the broad outline of a U.S.-U.K. trade deal earlier this month and Britain scored another major win earlier this week through an agreement to reset its relationship with the EU after departing the bloc in 2020.

Still, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour administration must battle the dragon of surging inflation and public skepticism over Finance Minister Rachel Reeves' planned tax increases.

A vocal Reeves supporter, Venkatakrishnan on Thursday said the current government remains ""absolutely"" on track with its economic steps and outlined the hurdles before the British economy:

""We're not seeing consumer distress. We're in fact, seeing conduit continued consumer strength, but it's coming because of people managing their balances and their finances prudently. So economizing. The job market is still strong,"" he said.

""But, as you see, even in the last couple of days, people are worried about inflation. People are worried about cost, whether it's winter fuel bills or whether it's more generalized inflation from tariffs, and the only real answer to that is growth.""

It's one bad headline after another coming from the White House these days. Just as the tariff-related turmoil rocking markets subsided — and only temporarily, since the clock is still ticking on the pause on ""reciprocal tariffs"" — fears of ballooning U.S. debt are sparking another broad sell-off in markets. This time, investors are wary because President Donald Trump's tax bill is projected to add $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the U.S. debt, reported Reuters, citing nonpartisan analysts.

A fiscally challenged U.S. means investors will demand higher returns to hold the country's debt. Indeed, Treasury yields jumped Wednesday. The 30-year Treasury bond yield crossed the 5% level for the second time this week and the 10-year traded at 4.61%, the highest since February. While rising yields mean bond prices drop, they also promise higher returns at potentially lower risks, dulling the allure of stocks.

Under pressure from spiking Treasury yields — which mean elevated borrowing costs for companies and consumers — U.S. markets sold off Wednesday, a sharp reversal from the rally beginning May 12 which gave the S&P 500 a six-day win streak. Unlike tariffs, which Trump seems to be able to conjure or dismiss unilaterally at a wave of his hand, a tax bill needs to pass through the different layers of the government and be agreed on by fractious politicians. It's hard to imagine a ""Trump put"" happening here.

Sell-off in U.S. marketsU.S. markets tumbled Wednesday on worries over the country's deteriorating fiscal health. The S&P 500 lost 1.61%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.91% and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 1.41%. Treasury yields spiked, with the 30-year yield hitting 5.085%, the highest since October 2023, while the 10-year yield traded at 4.607%, a level not seen since February.

Threat of U.S. debt widening The U.S. debt-and-deficit situation is bad and facing real prospects of getting worse, triggering a high-profile credit rating downgrade from Moody's and another selling stampede in stocks and bonds, writes CNBC's Jeff Cox. If U.S. President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" spending bill passes, there are concerns the U.S. deficit could widen even more and keep Treasury yields high.

Bitcoin surpasses previous highBitcoin prices popped 3.2% during Asia trading hours to hit a new high of $111,416, according to Coin Metrics, breaking its January record. Elsewhere in markets, Asia-Pacific markets fell Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech index, which comprises the 30 largest Hong Kong-listed technology companies, declined around 1.4%. That's despite shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng surging roughly 6.6% Thursday following upbeat earnings and stronger-than-expected guidance for the second quarter, which prompted analysts to grow more optimistic on its stock.

OpenAI snaps up Jony Ive's startupOpenAI said in a blog post Wednesday that it's buying former Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive's artificial intelligence devices startup io for about $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal. OpenAI said it's paying $5 billion in the transaction, as it already owns 23% of the company. The deal brings OpenAI into the world of hardware, and underscores the growing sense in Silicon Valley that smart AI assistants could upend the gadget world.

U.S. chip export controls a 'failure': Nvidia CEONvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Wednesday said at an AI trade show in Taiwan that U.S. chip export controls are a ""failure"" and warned that the restrictions are doing more damage to American business than to China. Huang added that the policies have cut the AI chip leader's China market share from 95% to 50% and motivated Beijing to make its own chips faster.

Here's why the gulf carrier is confident in working with the embattled American aircraft manufacturer.

Emerging markets said to see the next bull run as the 'sell U.S.' narrative gains ground

Emerging markets stocks are in the spotlight again as the ""sell U.S."" narrative gained fresh momentum, following Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.

""Weaker U.S. dollar, U.S. bond yield top, China economic recovery … nothing will work better than emerging market stocks,"" Bank of America's team, led by investment strategist Michael Hartnett, said in a note. 

Similarly, JPMorgan upgraded emerging market equities from neutral to overweight on Monday, citing thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations.

Erosion of confidence in U.S. assets, with a sell-off in U.S. Treasurys, equities and greenback, has fueled the bullishness for emerging markets.

Replacing Nvidia is a tall order. While Chinese competitors are years behind the company's cutting-edge technology, many analysts and insiders warn they are catching up, thanks to U.S. export restrictions.

U.S. chip restrictions on the sale of advanced semiconductor technology, especially those used in artificial intelligence, have been rolled out over several years, with the initial aim of curbing China's military advancement and protecting US dominance in the AI industry.

However, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, U.S. semiconductor export controls on China have been ""a failure,"" causing more harm to American businesses than to China.

While the goals of cutting back the Chinese military's access to advanced U.S. technology and maintaining U.S. leadership in AI appear to have had some success on paper, loopholes and existing semiconductor stockpiles in China have complicated these aims, said Ray Wang, an independent tech and chip analyst with a focus on U.S.-China competition.

""That's partly why we are seeing a closing of the gap between Chinese and U.S. AI capabilities,"" added Wang.

Leaders of Nvidia and other American chip designers have long lobbied against chip controls as they worry about losing lucrative business deals. Huang said at the annual Computex technology trade show in Taipei that Nvidia's GPU market share in China fell to 50% from 95% over the past four years.

Indeed, chip experts say that the curbs create more harm than good for the U.S.

""The effects of the controls are twofold. They have the impact of reducing the ability of U.S. companies to access the China market and, in turn, have accelerated the efforts of the domestic industry to pursue greater innovation,"" said Paul Triolo, Partner and Senior VP for China at DGA Group.

""You create competitors to your leading companies at the same time you're cutting them off from a massive market in China,"" he added.

While Washington's most comprehensive export controls were passed during former U.S. President Joe Biden's term in the White House, curbs on Huawei and SMIC, China's largest chipmaker, go back to Donald Trump's first term in office.

On April 15, Nvidia disclosed that new controls, which restricted sales of its H20 graphics processing units to China, had led to a $5.5 billion charge against its revenue.

The restrictions are expected to be a boon for the demand and development of local Nvidia alternatives like Huawei, which is working on its own AI chips. They also come against the background of Beijing mobilizing billions as part of its chip self-sufficiency campaign. 

""The bottom line is, the controls have incentivized China to become self-sufficient across these supply chains in a way they never would have contemplated before,"" Triolo said. 

Chinese AI-related achievements, such as DeepSeek's R1 model and news of Huawei chip progress, have led observers to question the effectiveness of chip controls. 

According Wang, the independent analyst, China's semiconductor and AI space has seen an acceleration of startups, market opportunities, and AI talent alongside the restrictions, which has clearly resulted in domestic innovations. 

""I think the arguments that export controls accelerate innovation is quite valid,"" Wang said. 

Nivida's Haung also noted these trends in April, telling lawmakers in Washington that the country has made enormous progress in the last several years and is right behind the U.S. 

Nvidia's H20 chip was designed specifically to comply with existing chip controls prior to the clampdown on exports.

""We are not just talking about one export control, we are talking about a series of export controls that originate from all the way back in 2019,"" said Wang, noting that the evolving policies have had a couple of different objectives. 

Meanwhile, in what DGA's Triolo calls a ""moving of the goalposts,"" it seems that the aims of the restrictions have shifted to an intention to slow down and contain Chinese AI and semiconductor developments. 

""The continued expansion of the controls, and the lack of an articulation of what the clear end game here is, has really created a lot of issues, and created a lot of collateral damage,"" Trilio said, adding that it has led more people to question the policy. 

In a statement earlier this month, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a U.S. think tank which has received funding from various technology companies, said in a post that ""the Biden administration's export control policy for AI chips has largely been a failure since day one. Yet, year after year, it has doubled down, attempting to plug various loopholes.""

""While [the U.S. government] is certainly right to prevent U.S. companies from selling advanced AI technology to the Chinese military, cutting U.S. companies off from the entire commercial Chinese market is a cure worse than the disease,"" Stephen Ezell of ITIF told CNBC in an email.

""U.S. export controls have cost NVIDIA at least $15 billion in sales, and those are revenues the company needs to be able to earn to invest in future generations of innovation.""

Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Paul Triolo, partner and senior VP for China at DGA Group.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin continued its rally on Thursday, hitting a new record high above $111,000.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $111,529.78, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $111,886.41.

Unlike the rocket rallies to new records long-time bitcoin observers are used to, it's been a slower-than-usual climb for the cryptocurrency, driven by increasing institutional ownership of the digital asset and corporate adoption of it. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has highlighted alternative stores of value like bitcoin, have been key catalysts.

Bitcoin's move has been ""driven by a mix of positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers,"" James Butterfill, head of research for crypto-focused asset manager CoinShares, told CNBC by email.

The price rise in world's largest cryptocurrency is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities Wednesday, driven by a spike in Treasury yields that continued to pressure stock futures Thursday morning.

Bitcoin has typically correlated with equity markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The diverging movements of bitcoin and stocks could be the result of investors looking for alternative stores of value.

Bitcoin is now up more than 18% this year. Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong and steady inflows, with just two days of outflows so far in May, according to SoSoValue. And since the beginning of the year, the number of bitcoin held by public companies has grown 31% to about $349 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. That comprises 15% of the total bitcoin supply.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto czar David Sacks have pushed forward a pro-crypto agenda in the U.S., which has helped support the market.

This week, the Senate voted to advance the first crypto legislation, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Trump has said he wants to see crypto regulation on his desk and ready to sign by August before Congress goes into recess. Also this week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, which advocates have praised as a watershed moment for the crypto industry.

Adding to upbeat news for crypto, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.

The famous pizzas from Laszlo Hanyecz's May 22, 2010 Bitcoin Pizza Day purchase

For bitcoin users, May 22 – known as Bitcoin Pizza Day – is a day for feasting.

Today, bitcoin fans around the world are savoring pizza to celebrate Bitcoin developer and miner Laszlo Hanyecz's famous pizza order on May 22, 2010. On this day 15 years ago, Hanyecz paid another early bitcoin adopter 10,000 BTC in exchange for two large Papa John's pizzas. This marked the first real world purchase of any good with the cryptocurrency, which was barely a year old at the time.

Laszlo Hanyecz's original Bitcoin Pizza Day post on May 18, 2010. His request was fulfilled by ... More another Bitcointalk users four days later.

Bitcoiners observe this greasy, bitcoin-themed simulacrum of Thanksgiving with commiseration as much as celebration, because those 10,000 BTC are now worth more than $1 billion.

But what most people don't realize is that Hanyecz may have spent as much as 79,000 BTC on follow-on pizza purchases that year, a sum that would be worth more than $8.7 billion today. And what is also lost in the gobsmacked reactions to the billion-dollar forfeit is the question: how did Hanyecz acquire all this bitcoin in the first place?

When I interviewed Hanyecz back in 2019, he mentioned that he spent nearly 100,000 BTC on pizza in 2010. He didn't think anything of the trades at the time.

After all, bitcoin was next to worthless then. Hanyecz noted that Bitcointalk, the popular forum focused on discussions about bitcoin that Hanyecz used to facilitate the original Bitcoin Pizza Day purchas, was full of users giving away bitcoin to newcomers by the hundreds or thousands.

Laszlo isn't bitter about the ordeal. He described it as though he “was winning the internet that day” because his “hobby bought [him] dinner.”

In fact, he was so pleased by the trade that he kept the offer open from May 22 until August 4, 2010, after which point he posted on Bitcointalk, saying, ""I can't afford to keep doing it since I can't [mine]



In the same post, he thanked “everyone who bought [him] pizza already,” so ostensibly he made additional pizza purchases between the May and August window.

Fast forward four years, Hanyecz wrote about his erstwhile bitcoin fortune in another post. “I spent it all on pizza,” he said, with a link to the bitcoin address listed in his first ever Bitcointalk post to prove it.

The wallet shows that Laszlo sent over 79,000 BTC from the day it was created on April 10, 2010 through August 4, 2010, the day he closed his open offer to trade bitcoin for pizza. The wallet now ironically holds only enough to purchase a large pizza with the current BTC-USD rate, and it was effectively drained of its last significant bitcoin holdings in June 2011. The wallet's total outflows amount to a little over 81,432 BTC.

In 2009 and 2010, Bitcoin's block reward was 50 BTC per block (plus transaction fees), and since bitcoin blocks are mined every ten minutes on average, this means that Hanyecz's 81,432 BTC fortune represented roughly 1.5% of all mined coins at the time. So how did he amass this stash?

Hanyecz was a prolific developer in Bitcoin's early days. Not only did he design Bitcoin's first MacOS client, but he also was the first person – beside Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – to discover that bitcoin miners could generate new coins with graphics cards.

Hanyecz advertised his discovery in May 2010. Before this, bitcoin miners used their laptop or desktop computer processing unit to mine bitcoin. But GPUs upgraded them with 10 times more computing power to generate new bitcoin.

The discovery opened the floodgates, and the computing power that secured the bitcoin network increased 1,300-fold by the end of 2010. Ironically, the increase in competition is the very reason that Hanyecz could no longer generate “thousands of coins a day” as he opined in the August 2010 Bitcointalk post.

Bitcoin's hashrate exploded following Bitcoin Pizza Day legend Laszlo Hanyecz's discovery of GPU ... More bitcoin mining.

With Pandora's box opened, Hanyecz's discovery also elicited a polite reprimand from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. As detailed by Nathaniel Popper in his book Digital Gold, “Satoshi had mixed feelings” about this early introduction of GPU mining, which the Bitcoin creator seemed to have anticipated.

Satoshi emailed the following to Laszlo:

And with that, we're left with a burning question: Did Hanyecz divest himself of his bitcoin fortune as a form of absolution for hastening Bitcoin's mining centralization?

Only Hanyecz knows the answer, but he's unlikely to tell it since he rarely (if ever) gives interviews anymore. After all, why should he when the topic at hand – Bitcoin Pizza Day – is a constant reminder that he traded a future, multi-billion dollar fortune for mediocre pizza?","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

It's not an official holiday – yet – but for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts “Bitcoin Pizza Day” is still special. Thursday marks the 15th anniversary of the first known use of cryptocurrency to buy real-world goods.

The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John's pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they're worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices. 

Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it's giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world. 

Here's the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:

The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency's still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn't rely on a third party – like a government or financial institution – for transactions.

Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to “mine” bitcoin more effectively. 

Central to bitcoin's technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what's known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining. 

In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.

In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.

“I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,” Hanyecz wrote.

Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.

“So nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I'm offering too low?” he wrote.

But the next day, Hanyecz said he'd successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John's pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, “Digital Gold.”

“A great milestone reached,” said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz. 

It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.

By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.

“I mean people can say I'm stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,” Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. “I don't think anyone could have known it would take off like this.”

Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.

“It made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,” Hanyecz said on the television show “60 minutes.”

Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.

After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of “digital gold,” or a way to store value.

Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.

Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning — a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.

The skalds of Bitcoin Twitter have sung of the historic moment, the “first real world purchase” with bitcoin, and pundits have etched the story into the internet's memory with headlines about the infamous Bitcoin Pizza Purchase, now dearly valued at more than $1 billion.

But what if I told you that Hanyecz spent nearly 10 times more bitcoin following the historic purchase? And, what if I told you that perhaps Hanyecz did so as ostensible penance for his much more consequential contribution to Bitcoin in its uncertain infancy?

The penumbra of Hanyecz's Pizza Day purchase has overshadowed his two seminal contributions to Bitcoin's early technical development.

This post originally appeared on Blockspace Media, where Colin Harper is editor-in-chief. 

The first of these came on April 19, 2010, just days after Hanyecz registered for Bitcointalk, a forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto that was (and still is) a watering hole for Bitcoin's techie intelligentsia. Hanyecz created the first MacOS client for Bitcoin Core, the original and still-dominant software implementation for the nodes that underpin the Bitcoin network.

Satoshi originally coded Bitcoin for Windows and Linux, but Hanyecz's innovation enabled MacOS devices to run the software too. His contribution laid the foundation for all MacOS-enabled bitcoin wallets and applications that would follow it.

But arguably greater than this was Hanyecz's discovery that he could mine bitcoin with his computer's graphics card (GPU). Until this point, early adopters used their computer processing units (CPUs) to mine bitcoin, and since GPUs are orders of magnitude more powerful than CPUs for the task, this innovation propelled bitcoin mining forward much faster than Satoshi expected.

“Updated Mac OS X binary…It will use your GPU to generate bitcoins. This works really well if you have a good GPU like an NVIDIA 8800 or something like that,” Hanyecz wrote in a May 10, 2010 Bitcointalk post.

The discovery ignited Bitcoin's first digital gold rush. Bitcoin's total hashrate exploded upward by 130,000% by the end of the year, and for the first time, bitcoin miners began constructing small-scale mining farms. These setups – slapped together in basements and attics, garages and sheds – were the prototypes for the industrial-scale bitcoin mining farms that dominate the Bitcoin network today.

Hanyecz's invention was so consequential that it earned him a virtual drop in from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. And it's possible that the conversation that followed may have inspired Hanyecz's famous Pizza Day purchase.

“A big attraction to new users is that anyone with a computer can generate some free coins,” Satoshi wrote to Hanyecz. “GPUs would prematurely limit the incentive to only those with high-end GPU hardware. It's inevitable that GPU compute clusters will eventually hog all the generated coins, but I don't want to hasten that day.”

In a 2019 interview for Bitcoin Magazine, Hanyecz told me that he “stopped advertising [GPU mining] after that.”

“I was like, ‘Man, I feel like I crapped up your project. Sorry, dude.' He was concerned that some people might be discouraged because they can't mine a block with a CPU,” Hanyecz said.

Perhaps this conversation spurred Hanyecz to offer 10,000 BTC for two large Papa John's pizzas on that fateful day in May 15 years ago. In fact, he made the offer more than once. During the 2019 interview, Hanyecz told me that he spent nearly 100,000 BTC in the year that followed.

“I spent [all my bitcoin] on pizza long ago,” Hanyecz wrote in a February 2014 Bitcointalk post. “Other than a little bit of single digit change, I spent everything I mined. As you all know, the difficulty rises to adjust to hashing power, so eventually the mining wasn't worth it for me.”

Looking at a Bitcoin address Hanyecz listed on his first Bitcointalk post, Hanyecz received and spent 81,432 BTC from this address from April to November 2010. This sum would be worth just over $8.6 billion today.

There's no way to verify if Hanyecz spent all of this on pizza, other goods, or if he simply gave bitcoin away to new Bitcointalk members, a common practice back then when bitcoin was close-to worthless. But he did mention in his original thread for the pizza purchase that it was “an open offer,” although he reneged on this in August saying, “I can't really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore. Thanks to everyone who bought me pizza already.”

The original purchase, let alone the recurring ones that apparently occurred after, would be enough to keep any sane person awake at night as bitcoin marches above $100,000. But in 2019 at least, Hanyecz stomached the ordeal with good humor. As he saw it, he committed culinary alchemy, transmuting his electricity and computing power into a cheap dinner. He had no idea that bitcoin would command the price it does today, so the transaction was a victory in his book.

“A trade happens because both parties think they're getting a good deal,” he said. “I felt like I was beating the internet, getting free food. I was like, ‘Man, I got these GPUs linked together, now I'm going to mine twice as fast. I'm just going to be eating free food; I'll never have to buy food again..."" ""I mean, I coded this thing and mined bitcoin and I felt like I was winning the internet that day. I got pizza for contributing to an open-source project. Usually hobbies are a time sink and money sink, and in this case, my hobby bought me dinner.”

Ethereum price found support at $2,440 and started a fresh increase. ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,650 resistance zone.

Ethereum Price Could Gain Strength

Ethereum price remained in a range above $2,350 while Bitcoin traded to a new all-time high. ETH bulls were active near the $2,440 zone. A low was formed at $2,442 and the price started a fresh increase.

There was a move above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low.

On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,620 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance.

An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,920 resistance zone or even $3,000 in the near term.

Another Drop In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone and the trend line.

A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

Ethereum (ETH) saw a 2% gain in the early Asian session on Thursday, recovering the $2,500 key level after whales stepped on the gas with their buying pressure.

Ethereum's supply on exchanges extended its decline to 18.73 million ETH on Wednesday, indicating sustained spot market buying pressure. Since the metric began a downtrend on April 24, more than 1 million ETH have left exchanges to private wallets for potential long-term holding. As a result, ETH's supply on exchanges has reached its lowest level since August 2024.

The reduced exchange supply partly explains why ETH's price has maintained an upward trajectory since the same date.

Similar to previous weeks, whales with a balance of 10K-100K continued leading the buying activity, growing their holdings by a net of 670K ETH in the past nine days. However, smaller holders have been distributing, with their total balance declining by 110K ETH during the same period.

Despite dominant spot buying pressure, ETH continues to move range-bound near the $2,500 mark. ETH Futures Bubble Maps show increased trading volume whenever prices move below or above $2,500, making it a critical level that could define the top altcoin's next major trend.

Meanwhile, search interest for Ethereum has picked up pace again near the 60-point mark, up from 45 on May 17 but down from the 100-point level seen during the May 8 - 9 rally. This indicates that intense retail excitement isn't leading ETH's price, leaving room for a more robust price growth.

Ethereum experienced $106.52 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long and short positions is $56.20 million and $50.32 million, respectively.

After closing near $2,500 on Tuesday, ETH briefly surged above $2,600 on Wednesday but saw a rejection just below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The top altcoin is up 2% at the time of writing as bulls look to maintain a firm move above the $2,500 level.

ETH needs a high volume move above the $2,850 resistance or below the $2,260 - $2,100 range to establish its next direction. A move above $2,850 could see ETH rally toward the $3,250 resistance, while a breakdown below $2,100 could send its price to the $1,688 support.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued its horizontal trend near the overbought region line, indicating slight weakness in the bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is testing its moving average line as its histogram bars are about to flip negative. A successful cross below will signal rising downward pressure.

Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts are celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day with a banger. BTC made a new all-time high on Wednesday and has entered price discovery mode. The OG cryptocurrency is trading above $110,000 for the first time ever.

Ripple's (XRP) price accelerates the uptrend to around $2.43 at the time of writing on Thursday, propelled by improving sentiment in the broader crypto market after Bitcoin (BTC) rapidly rallied to new all-time highs at approximately $111,880.

The Graph (GRT) plans to adopt the Chainlink (LINK) interoperability standard (CCIP) to enable GRT transfers across three ecosystems. A successful deployment of GRT bridges across Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Solana (SOL) will significantly expand its cross-chain functionality. 

Cryptocurrencies broadly extend gains on Thursday, propelled by Bitcoin's (BTC) surge to new all-time highs at around $111,880. Meanwhile, altcoins continue to gain strength, with Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) sliding to approximately 63.84%, buoyed by significant rallies in meme coins such as Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT).

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes at around $103,000 when writing on Friday, after facing multiple rejections at the key $105,000 resistance level throughout the week.

Hovering above the pivotal 26 EMA, which is currently serving as its main support level, XRP is indicating an impending breakout. XRP is currently coiling for a possible move driven by technical consolidation after a comparatively quiet correction phase. The price has remained stable above the $2.30 mark. 

The convergence of the main moving averages, especially the 26, 50 and 100 EMAs that are starting to tighten, is the most important finding on the chart. This squeeze pattern frequently precedes volatility surges, which are characterized by a sharp price swing as compressed momentum finds direction. 

If buying pressure returns, the likelihood of an upward breakout is higher as long as XRP remains above these levels. Although currently muted, volume lends credence to the compression narrative. XRP has a history of exhibiting explosive behavior after low-volume plateaus close to important technical thresholds. 

Since the RSI is close to 60, there is still space for the asset to rise without going into overbought territory right away. Latent bullish energy waiting for a catalyst is indicated by this technical setup. XRP is currently recovering from a multi-month downward trend, and its recent breakout above that structure earlier this month has not been disproven from a wider market structure standpoint. 

A continuation rally could be in the works based on the current price action, which points to a sound retest of support. If volume validates the breakout and XRP closes above the $2.50 resistance, a move toward $2.80-$3.00 may occur quickly. In contrast, a loss of the 26 EMA would raise the risk of a decline to the 100 EMA, which is located around $2.26. 

As the long consolidation comes to an end and a new bullish leg begins, Ethereum has formally broken out of its descending trendline. Beyond simply being a technical milestone, this breakout could serve as the basis for Ethereum's long-awaited reversal and a push toward the crucial $3,000 mark. The 200 EMA, which has served as a solid support and launching pad for the current move, was touched and bounced off by ETH at the pivotal moment.

Its importance as a psychological and technical floor, which bulls successfully defended in the face of wider market hesitancy, is confirmed by the response from this level. A distinct close above the upper trendline has now validated the breakout from the short-term descending wedge pattern, which was characterized by several weeks of lower highs. In bullish times, this pattern frequently serves as a continuation structure, and ETH's follow-through has reinforced that assertion.

No, Bitcoin Price Is Not Overheated Yet, Bullish Data Emerge On-chain

ByGodfrey Benjamin





The move gains weight when the volume stays constant during a breakout. Further upward movement is still possible, particularly in a breakout scenario, even though the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving toward overbought territory. Now, the main resistance to keep an eye on is just below the psychological $3,000 level close to the $2,800 zone.

This move could draw in sidelined buyers and start a new round of bullish activity if Ethereum can keep up the momentum and clear this region with increasing volume. Ethereum's technicals are pointing in the direction of a sustained increase. A bullish outlook is well supported by the clean breakout setup bounce from the 200 EMA and descending trendline break. The level of $3,000 is now firmly on the horizon, and ETH may soon enter its next significant push if market conditions continue to be favorable.

With the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) progressively approaching the longer-term 200 EMA, Shiba Inu is displaying early indications of a possible golden cross formation. Although this crossover is typically interpreted in technical analysis as a bullish signal, SHIB's future is far from assured. In terms of price, SHIB has been comparatively steady in recent sessions, circling around the 100 EMA just above important support levels.

The token is forming a base once more in anticipation of a catalyst that will push it higher following its previous unsuccessful breakout attempt above the 200 EMA. An impending momentum shift may be signaled by the 50 EMA's current proximity to the price action, but this needs to be confirmed. Nonetheless, the obvious drop in trading volume is among the most obvious warning signs.

Weak volume, combined with a golden cross, frequently causes a false breakout or rapid reversals. This setup could easily fade away before reaching full crossover status if there is not much buying pressure. In recent days, Shiba Inu has experienced a significant increase in both inflow and outflow on-chain. Inflows from large holders have increased by more than 1100% in the last week, while outflow activity has also increased significantly.

This implies that whales are paying more attention, though not necessarily in a positive way. Instead of accumulation, the opposing flows suggest redistribution or strategic repositioning. Now everyone's watching to see if the 50 EMA can continue to close the 200 EMA gap and set off a golden cross. SHIB is still in a speculative zone until volume is confirmed and price action stays above important EMAs. Traders should proceed cautiously and wait for confirmation in the volume and market structure before committing to bullish wagers.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high this week, briefly surging to $110,000 after the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill in the US Senate fueled optimism for regulatory clarity under President Donald Trump.

The milestone comes amid renewed investor confidence in digital assets, with the broader crypto market, including Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP), showing signs of volatility following the news. While Bitcoin led the charge, altcoins have yet to confirm whether they'll follow BTC's breakout or continue lagging behind.

Bitcoin has surged past the upper trendline of its multimonth descending channel — a classic bull flag — to reclaim the $110,000 level. Historically, such breakouts have preceded massive rallies, and the current setup projects a potential price target near $152,000, based on the height of the flagpole.

The weekly relative strength index (RSI) sits just below 70, not yet overbought, giving bulls more runway. The 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) also continues to hold as solid dynamic support near $82,000. With increasing volume, the breakout appears to have technical strength.

Ethereum has bounced nearly 50% from its local bottom and now approaches a decisive resistance near $2,950, which coincides with the lower trendline of its long-term ascending channel. This region also aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level from its $4,800 peak.

A confirmed breakout above this zone would open the path to the channel's upper trendline near $4,800, reinforcing a broader bullish thesis. However, the weekly RSI still hovers around neutral levels, suggesting ETH needs strong momentum to push through this supply zone.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum flash bullish patterns, XRP paints a starkly different technical picture. The token has likely formed a cup-and-handle top, a bearish reversal setup that threatens a retest of key support near $1.10, roughly the level of its 200-week EMA.

After failing to flip the $2.80 resistance into support, XRP/USD has traced a rounded top with lower highs, weakening its market structure. The declining RSI reinforces this view, and a breakdown below $2.00 could trigger a deeper decline.

Bitcoin surged to a fresh all-time high above $111,000 on Wednesday, as institutional inflows and macroeconomic tailwinds continued to fuel investor appetite for the world's largest crypto.

The rally, which has seen Bitcoin gain more than 18% since the start of May, was underpinned by steady demand for U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. 

Net inflows into the products have surpassed $2.8 billion this month, lifting total ETF holdings to over $122 billion, according to eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson.

“Bitcoin's surge to an all-time high of $111,000 stems from multiple catalysts,” Hobson told Decrypt. “Institutional inflows, particularly through U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, have pumped billions into the market, while the April halving has tightened supply.”

Analysts say macro conditions have also played a role, including growing liquidity, a weakening U.S. dollar, and renewed geopolitical uncertainty.

Still, attention is beginning to shift toward whether the latest breakout could set the stage for renewed strength in altcoins, which have largely underperformed in the current cycle.

“Alt season will kick off when two key events align,” Hobson said. “Quantitative easing must begin, injecting more liquidity into the system, and Bitcoin dominance needs to hit around 70%.” 

Bitcoin dominance, a measure of the asset's market share, currently hovers near 61%, according to CoinGecko.

Mena Theodorou, co-founder of Australian exchange Coinstash, said a broader altcoin rally remains unlikely in the near term, citing the ongoing price discovery phase in Bitcoin.

“As Bitcoin continues into price discovery, it tends to absorb much of the market's liquidity,” he told Decrypt. “We're more likely to see strength appear in select altcoins and sectors, rather than a broad-based rally.”

Despite Ethereum's sluggish performance, newer tokens such as Solana and Sui have outpaced it, with investors rotating into platforms offering scalability and developer traction.

“Bitcoin's driving the market narrative,” Hobson said. “It's the Bitcoin show until the alt season kicks in.”

Bitcoin and altcoins continued soaring on Thursday, even as the US stock market downturn continued.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to a record high of $111,860, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to $3.5 trillion. In contrast, the Dow opened lower by around 100 points, adding to Wednesday's 816 point drop. 

Bitcoin and altcoins are climbing after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency regulation focused on stablecoins.

The legislation requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100 percent reserve backing with high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. It also mandates monthly disclosures detailing reserve composition.

Other provisions include federal and state oversight. Stablecoin issuers with assets above 10 billion dollars will be regulated at the federal level, while states will oversee smaller issuers with less than 10 billion dollars in assets.

The passage of the GENIUS Act is significant, as it helps safeguard the crypto industry, especially following the collapse of Terra in 2022 and other major failures, like FTX. It also provides long-awaited legal clarity.

Bitcoin and altcoins are rising because investors see BTC as a safe haven asset after Moody's downgraded the US credit rating. 

The safe-haven appeal has pushed investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have added over $4.2 billion in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $43 billion.

In its statement, Moody's pointed to the rising US debt and interest payments and the policies in Washington. 

For example, the House of Representatives passed the “big, beautiful bill” that will add around $3.8 trillion in additional debt, according to some estimates.

The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, including deductions on tips and overtime pay. It also expands the child tax credit and includes a new senior tax relief of 4,000 dollars.

Fears over the rising U.S. debt and deficit have led investors to pull back from U.S. assets, especially equities. The U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to 99.6, while bond yields have surged. The 30-year yield rose to 5.1 percent, and the 10-year climbed to 4.6 percent.

Bitcoin's breakout is also supported by technical indicators. On the daily chart, it has formed a cup and handle pattern while narrowly avoiding a death cross. A death cross occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross while trending downward. This same setup nearly played out in August last year but was avoided.

The cup pattern has a depth of about 30 percent. Measuring that distance from the breakout level suggests potential gains toward 141,000 dollars.

FIFA, football's global governing body, plans to use Avalanche's network to power its own dedicated layer-1 blockchain.



The FIFA Blockchain is an Avalanche L1, a customizable blockchain that uses Avalanche's technology (also previously known as a subnet). The news comes as the Avalanche network recently went through its major Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at attracting new developers and encouraging them to create customized L1s.



Thursday's announcement is not FIFA's first foray into the world of blockchain and crypto. In 2022, the football body released a non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Algorand blockchain ahead of the Qatar World Cup. FIFA also teased this change in April, noting that it would shift its collection to an EVM-compatible blockchain while continuing to pursue Web3 initiatives.



The NFT craze, which saw large institutions and corporations jumping into the trend, has now mostly vanished after the brutal crypto winter that dampened industry sentiment for several painful years. However, a large entity such as FIFA's continued focus on blockchain likely signals that the use case for the technology hasn't died down, and big enterprises are still looking to dabble in the industry.



“Avalanche is designed for enterprises and organizations looking to build custom, high-performance blockchain solutions,” said John Nahas, chief business officer at Ava Labs, in a press release shared with CoinDesk . “FIFA's decision to launch its L1 on Avalanche is a testament to our technology's ability to support global-scale applications with speed, flexibility, and security.”



While FIFA currently only has a World Cup NFT collection and a digital collectibles marketplace, it did not share what else it is planning to release on its new blockchain.

 Jeremy Jordan-Jones was charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank and identity theft. 

A US grand jury has indicted the founder of blockchain startup Amalgam Capital Ventures over allegations he defrauded investors out of over $1 million with a fake blockchain.

Jeremy Jordan-Jones was arrested and indicted on May 21 and charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank, and aggravated identity theft, the Department of Justice said on May 21.  

Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton claimed Jordan-Jones “touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup,” but alleged that, in reality, the “company was a sham, and investors' funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.”

FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia alleged that Jordan-Jones defrauded investors of more than 1 million dollars through “misrepresentations of his purported company's capabilities, partnerships, and investment intentions.”

Raia claimed the Amalgam founder's “blatant lies” funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims.

According to an indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court, from January 2021 to November 2022, Jordan-Jones deceived investors and financial institutions using fabricated documents, fake sports partnerships, and misleading claims, ultimately misappropriating over $1 million for personal use.

Amalgam claimed to offer point-of-sale systems and blockchain-based payment and security solutions, the filing states.

The indictment alleged the firm had “no operable products, few, if any, customers, and zero legitimate business partnerships.”

The filing alleged that instead of channeling the funds into tech development and crypto exchange listings as promised, Jordan-Jones spent the money on luxury vehicles, high-end vacations, clothing and fancy restaurants in Miami. 

Jordan-Jones was also accused of submitting a fake bank statement claiming Amalgam held over $18 million in order to secure a company credit card, but prosecutors claimed there were no funds in the bank account and it had been closed in late 2021. 

Wire fraud and security fraud carry potential penalties of up to 20 years in prison per count, while making false statements to a bank carries up to 30 years.

Jordan-Jones was also charged with one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.

The government is seeking forfeiture of any property or money traceable to the fraud, including substitute assets if the original funds are unavailable.

The service aims to enhance payments with tokenised deposits for swift transactions

HSBC said its tokenised deposit programme can convert traditional bank deposits into digital tokens on a blockchain platform. As a result, payments through the service have the potential to cost less and take less time than traditional banking systems, according to Lewis Sun, HSBC's global head of domestic and emerging payments for global payments solutions.

The tokenised deposit infrastructure would enable corporate clients to make real-time Hong Kong and US dollar payments and transfer between HSBC Hong Kong wallets 24 hours a day, HSBC said.

The application was currently limited to use in Hong Kong and would expand to Asian and European markets in the second half of the year, it said.

“Tokenised deposits, when supported by regulated financial institutions, can offer a safe and fully compliant approach to improving payments and cash management for [companies],” Sun said.

 Crypto and art NFTs can help investors protect their purchasing power from ongoing fiat currency debasement, according to Raoul Pal. 

Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.

“You don't own enough crypto. When you do, you don't own enough NFT's, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.

NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.

“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.

Art NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.

Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  

Some digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs. Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, auctioned his “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” NFT artwork for a record-breaking $69 million in March 2021.

Meanwhile, the largest NFT collections continue to lack upside momentum, unable to recover toward their 2021 highs.

CryptoPunks, the largest NFT collection by market capitalization, is currently trading at a floor price of 46 Ether (ETH), 59% down from its peak of 113.9 ETH, recorded on Oct. 9, 2021, NFTpricefloor data shows.

Despite the temporary lack of interest, NFTs could be poised to see more momentum after the profits from Bitcoin's (BTC) cycle top start rotating into other digital assets.

“That likely puts the peak of the NFT market in Q1 2026, but don't expect a repeat of the 21/22 euphoria that we saw in NFTs,” according to Yehudah Petscher, strategist at CryptoSlam NFT data platform and SlamAI.

“We're likely an entire cycle away from NFTs having a parabolic run,” Petscher told Cointelegraph, adding:

However, the previous NFT bull market was driven largely by metaverse speculation and wealthy traders, Petscher noted — factors that are mostly absent in the current cycle.

FIFA, football's global governing body, plans to use Avalanche's network to power its own dedicated layer-1 blockchain.



The FIFA Blockchain is an Avalanche L1, a customizable blockchain that uses Avalanche's technology (also previously known as a subnet). The news comes as the Avalanche network recently went through its major Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at attracting new developers and encouraging them to create customized L1s.



Thursday's announcement is not FIFA's first foray into the world of blockchain and crypto. In 2022, the football body released a non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Algorand blockchain ahead of the Qatar World Cup. FIFA also teased this change in April, noting that it would shift its collection to an EVM-compatible blockchain while continuing to pursue Web3 initiatives.



The NFT craze, which saw large institutions and corporations jumping into the trend, has now mostly vanished after the brutal crypto winter that dampened industry sentiment for several painful years. However, a large entity such as FIFA's continued focus on blockchain likely signals that the use case for the technology hasn't died down, and big enterprises are still looking to dabble in the industry.



“Avalanche is designed for enterprises and organizations looking to build custom, high-performance blockchain solutions,” said John Nahas, chief business officer at Ava Labs, in a press release shared with CoinDesk . “FIFA's decision to launch its L1 on Avalanche is a testament to our technology's ability to support global-scale applications with speed, flexibility, and security.”



While FIFA currently only has a World Cup NFT collection and a digital collectibles marketplace, it did not share what else it is planning to release on its new blockchain.

 FIFA is migrating its NFT marketplace and collection to a new Avalanche-powered layer-1 blockchain built for digital fan experiences. 

The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has selected Avalanche to power its dedicated blockchain network for non-fungible tokens and digital fan engagement, the organization announced on May 22.

FIFA's layer-1 (L1) blockchain will be powered by the Avalanche network's scalability-focused infrastructure for the association's five billion fans worldwide.

The move comes nearly a month after FIFA announced its initial plans to launch a new network for its blockchain-based collectibles. AvaCloud's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility will enable smoother integration with decentralized wallets and applications.

The move will enable FIFA to deliver “unique digital collectibles and immersive fan experiences, powered by the speed, scalability, and EVM compatibility,” according to Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect.

“The decision was based on a rigorous analysis of key factors including performance, security, transaction fees, customizability, and scalability,” Abbate stated in a May 22 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

As part of the rollout, FIFA will migrate its NFT marketplace and NFT collection, FIFA Collect, to the new Avalanche-powered FIFA Blockchain.

FIFA added that “future plans and business cases are planned but not yet publicly disclosed.”

Following the migration, external Algorand-based wallets such as Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Instead, users will be able to connect to FIFA Collect via MetaMask or other EVM wallets that support WalletConnect.

FIFA launched its NFT collection ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia in collaboration with blockchain firm Modex.

In November 2024, FIFA partnered with blockchain gaming studio Mythical Games to launch FIFA Rivals, a free-to-play soccer game for iOS and Android.

FIFA is moving its digital collectibles platform to Avalanche, choosing the layer-1 blockchain to run a new network aimed at engaging its global fan base of nearly five billion.

The football governing body confirmed on Thursday that its NFT platform, FIFA Collect, will begin migrating to the Avalanche-powered infrastructure, replacing the existing setup built on Algorand. Once complete, wallets like MetaMask and others using WalletConnect will be supported, while Algorand-based options such as Pera and Defly will no longer work.

The decision follows last month's announcement that FIFA would launch a dedicated blockchain for NFTs and digital fan engagement. The new platform will use AvaCloud, a service offering Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to ease integration with decentralized apps and wallets.

“The selection process weighed factors like performance, cost, and customizability,” said Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect, in a statement.

FIFA's pivot also reflects a deeper push into Web3, with the organization hinting at future use cases that remain under wraps for now.

FIFA first launched its NFT collection ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, in partnership with Modex. In a separate deal last year, FIFA also teamed up with Mythical Games to develop FIFA Rivals, a free-to-play mobile football game.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino also floated the idea of launching a digital “FIFA coin” during the White House Crypto Summit hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the global football body's clearest hint yet at a possible foray into crypto.

No technical roadmap or timeline was shared, but the comments suggest FIFA is actively exploring blockchain as a tool to connect with fans and create new revenue streams ahead of the 2026 World Cup, set to be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

Asda Faces ICO Complaint After “Unlawful” Facial Recognition Trial


                                                                                Tom Quinn

“Asda's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling,” said Madeleine Stone, Big Brother Watch.

                                                01.17pm


Privacy campaigners have filed a legal complaint with the UK's Information Commissioner, arguing that retail giant Asda's use of live facial recognition cameras in its supermarkets is “unlawful”.

The legal complaint from rights group Big Brother Watch claims that Asda “is infringing the data rights” of shoppers following a trial of live facial recognition in five Greater Manchester stores, and is calling on the Commissioner to halt the retailer's use of the technology.

According to Big Brother Watch's complaint, Asda's use of the controversial technology is placing shoppers' data at a high degree of risk, arguing that such biometric surveillance poses significant risks to customers' fundamental right to privacy. 

The privacy NGO said that with under the system, supermarket staff can add individuals to a facial recognition watchlist, marking them as a “person of interest”, although it claims shoppers are not informed when their facial biometric data, similar to the data held on modern passports, is stored or added to the supermarket's watchlist.

Big Brother Watch further alleged that the supermarket uses the biometric profiles of certain shoppers to create an alert if they enter a store and shares these profiles, along with allegations of unwanted conduct, between stores, however, staff do not provide or receive photos from the police.

In trialling the tech, Asda is the first UK-wide supermarket to install live facial recognition, with Big Brother Watch warning that if rolled out to more of its UK stores, Asda's facial recognition tech could have a profound impact on the data rights of tens of millions of people.

“Asda's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling, and risks violating the privacy rights of thousands of people,” said Madeleine Stone, senior advocacy officer at Big Brother Watch.

“Facial recognition surveillance turns shoppers into suspects by subjecting customers browsing the supermarket aisles to a series of invasive biometric identity checks.

“Asda should abandon this trial and the government must urgently step in to prevent the unchecked spread of this invasive technology.”

Setting out to warn Asda's customers of what it called an attempt to “roll back their privacy”, Big Brother Watch has sent the world's largest digital ad van to tour the five stores using facial recognition.

However, in response, Asda said that the technology was only being implemented for a limited period in its Greater Manchester stores, with an Asda spokesperson telling DIGIT: “Like all retailers, our stores are subject to unprecedented levels of retail crime and on average four Asda colleagues were assaulted at work every day last year. 

“We have launched this trial in five stores for a limited period to assess how it can keep colleagues and customers safe.

“This trial uses Asda's existing CCTV system and fully complies with all data protection regulations.”

It's not the first time that Asda has clashed with the privacy NGO over this issue. 

In 2019, the retailer denied using facial recognition cameras at its Preston store, insisting that the tech was only being used to improve CCTV quality and deter thieves without logging any personal information from customers. 

Six years later, this latest trial hit headlines last April with Asda reportedly being swamped by more than 5,400 complaints in what Big Brother said was a backlash from the public for using intrusive surveillance technology, a claim that the retailer roundly rejected, saying it had only received 89 emails about the trial through its official channels.

The price of bitcoin surged past $110,000 for the first time.

Bitcoin surged to a record high on Thursday, vaulting more than 3% in early trading and hurtling past $110,000 for the first time.

The price of bitcoin stood at $111,385 on Thursday, extending a sharp rise that stretches back to the November election of President Donald Trump, a cryptocurrency supporter and investor.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, jumped 6%. The $TRUMP memecoin, a crypto coin launched by the president in January, increased nearly 6%.

A surge in the value of some cryptocurrencies in recent days followed a Senate vote to advance the GENIUS Act, an industry-backed bill that aims to regulate some digital currency.

The measure establishes rules targeting stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset, often the U.S. dollar.

If enacted, the bill could allow such crypto coins to become a mainstream tool for digital payments and other financial instruments, setting the stage for an influx of investment in digital currency.

Critics say the measure fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns exemplified by Trump, and it risks endangering consumers and the wider economy with a weak set of restrictions.

Trump, who also backs a cryptocurrency firm World Liberty Financial, has denied any wrongdoing involving his crypto ventures.

The record high for bitcoin also coincides with a spike in Treasury yields amid deficit concerns centered on a domestic policy bill passed by the U.S. House on Thursday.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday found the tax policies backed by Trump would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt. The finding comes days after a U.S. credit downgrade at Moody's in part due to the country's deficit.

Higher yields increase the cost of U.S. borrowing and add strain to the nation's finances. In theory, investors may seek out alternatives to the U.S. dollar as debt yields face upward pressure.

Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, attributed the recent rise in the price of bitcoin to both industry regulation and bond market fears.

“​​I suspect it's a mix of regulatory adoption and fear for the dollar given the expectation of high government spending,” Armour said.

The price of bitcoin has surged about 40% since the presidential election. Over that period, the S&P 500 has declined 2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 3%.

In July, Trump told the audience at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville, Tennessee, that he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet.""

Trump promised to weaken federal oversight of cryptocurrency and establish the federal government's first strategic bitcoin reserve.

In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing the reserve of digital currencies, saying the move would position the U.S. “as a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.”

On Thursday, Trump is set to attend a gala with hundreds of top investors in his memecoin, which an announcement described as an “intimate private dinner.”

The move elicited concern among some critics as a possible means of exchanging access to the president for financial gain.

 Crypto and art NFTs can help investors protect their purchasing power from ongoing fiat currency debasement, according to Raoul Pal. 

Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.

“You don't own enough crypto. When you do, you don't own enough NFT's, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.

NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.

“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.

Art NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.

Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  

Some digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs. Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, auctioned his “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” NFT artwork for a record-breaking $69 million in March 2021.

Meanwhile, the largest NFT collections continue to lack upside momentum, unable to recover toward their 2021 highs.

CryptoPunks, the largest NFT collection by market capitalization, is currently trading at a floor price of 46 Ether (ETH), 59% down from its peak of 113.9 ETH, recorded on Oct. 9, 2021, NFTpricefloor data shows.

Despite the temporary lack of interest, NFTs could be poised to see more momentum after the profits from Bitcoin's (BTC) cycle top start rotating into other digital assets.

“That likely puts the peak of the NFT market in Q1 2026, but don't expect a repeat of the 21/22 euphoria that we saw in NFTs,” according to Yehudah Petscher, strategist at CryptoSlam NFT data platform and SlamAI.

“We're likely an entire cycle away from NFTs having a parabolic run,” Petscher told Cointelegraph, adding:

However, the previous NFT bull market was driven largely by metaverse speculation and wealthy traders, Petscher noted — factors that are mostly absent in the current cycle.

Blockchain Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC) Appoints Technology Visionary James R. Owens to BDIC Board of Advisors

HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blockchain Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC), first to market providing decentralized deposit insurance for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, proudly announces an appointment to the BDIC Board of Advisors, James R. Owens.

""BDIC's decentralized insurance protocol isn't just filling a gap in the market—it's creating the critical infrastructure layer that cryptocurrency needs to achieve mainstream adoption,"" said Owens, the new BDIC Board member.


Co-Founder Paul Kohli of BDIC Hong Kong celebrated the news stating, “James will play a critical role in advising BDIC on its technical strategy, specifically in the areas of exchange and wallet connectivity, as well as innovations in smart contract architecture bringing his experience and industry knowledge to the team,” Kohli continued. “This has been a multi-year working relationship that is coming to fruition as part of our go to market strategy which includes bringing high caliber human capital to BDIC to execute on implementation. Having a tech industry leader like James working with the CTO, CISO and tech department going forward is a great advantage for BDIC Insurance.”




GLOBAL TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE



With a career spanning over four decades in software engineering, telecommunications and data science, James R. Owens brings unparalleled technical expertise to BDIC. A dual-discipline graduate in Microbiology and Computer Science from UMASS in 1978 (conferred in 1983) Owens was quickly recruited by Microsoft's programming division and in 1983, he joined Microsoft as a contracted developer. Owens simultaneously consulted for IBM and other tech giants going forward and has not relented, establishing himself as a versatile force in early computing innovation and visionary to this day.




In 1991, Owens founded Webstar Technology Group, Inc., a company that revolutionized data transmission in the cable television industry by developing COAX software — an early system capable of compressing video and television signals without quality loss, enabling multi-frequency carriage across limited bandwidth infrastructure. His subsidiary, Centaflix, was acquired just 10 months after launch and now forms the backbone of streaming infrastructure used by platforms like Netflix.




Beyond media, Owens made his mark in hospitality tech, deploying check-in systems for Best Western and IHG hotels. In 2014, he launched Softtech, a data compression firm that evolved into early AI development by 2015. Owens successfully took Webstar Technology Group, Inc. public, listing the company under ticker WBSR on OTC markets before transitioning leadership in early 2024.




VISIONARY PERSPECTIVE



Owens will provide strategic technical oversight on BDIC's decentralized smart contract infrastructure and advise on exchange and wallet integrations for insurance protocols. While his current consulting contracts include work on compression technology in AC/DC electrical systems for sustainable energy and secure architecture design for satellite companies, Owens has also been working on cyber-wallet data transfer protocols the last two years with providers in PanAsia and Latin America.




“BDIC's approach to blockchain insurance infrastructure represents the most advanced application of distributed ledger technology I've seen in the financial sector. Their proprietary risk assessment algorithms combine traditional actuarial science with blockchain-native analytics in a way that creates true innovation,” said Owens. “I'm particularly impressed by how their smart contract architecture solves the oracle problem that has plagued similar projects, creating a seamless claims verification system that maintains both security and efficiency,” stated Owens when asked about the technical build.




DIGITAL CURRENCY ADOPTION: BDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE



“James is a true pioneer in software systems that scale globally, a major asset to BDIC,” said Founder and CEO Jeffrey A. Glusman. “His deep technical knowledge in both compression and streaming tech, coupled with his foresight in blockchain and AI, align perfectly with our mission to create a safe, global infrastructure for cryptocurrency adoption through the incorporation of the BDIC deposit insurance platform.” Glusman continued, “Following our announcement of 3PointOLabs last month focusing on our brand efforts, it was time to put the spotlight on our technical team as we will be announcing major collaborations in coming weeks.”




Owens' appointment further reinforces BDIC's vision to normalize cryptocurrency use through decentralized insurance technology that can scale securely with mass adoption. His guidance will be instrumental as BDIC prepares for the next phase of development internationally, including the expansion of its coverage tiers, exchange partnerships, technological advances in wallet security.




""After four decades in technology development, I've learned to recognize transformative platforms when I see them. BDIC's decentralized insurance protocol isn't just filling a gap in the market—it's creating the critical infrastructure layer that cryptocurrency needs to achieve mainstream adoption,” said Owens. “Their wallet integration system maintains security while simplifying the user experience, making insurance accessible to both institutional and retail participants. I'm excited to help BDIC scale this technology globally, as it represents the missing piece that will allow digital assets to fulfill their revolutionary potential.""

FIFA, football's global governing body, plans to use Avalanche's network to power its own dedicated layer-1 blockchain.



The FIFA Blockchain is an Avalanche L1, a customizable blockchain that uses Avalanche's technology (also previously known as a subnet). The news comes as the Avalanche network recently went through its major Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at attracting new developers and encouraging them to create customized L1s.



Thursday's announcement is not FIFA's first foray into the world of blockchain and crypto. In 2022, the football body released a non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Algorand blockchain ahead of the Qatar World Cup. FIFA also teased this change in April, noting that it would shift its collection to an EVM-compatible blockchain while continuing to pursue Web3 initiatives.



The NFT craze, which saw large institutions and corporations jumping into the trend, has now mostly vanished after the brutal crypto winter that dampened industry sentiment for several painful years. However, a large entity such as FIFA's continued focus on blockchain likely signals that the use case for the technology hasn't died down, and big enterprises are still looking to dabble in the industry.



“Avalanche is designed for enterprises and organizations looking to build custom, high-performance blockchain solutions,” said John Nahas, chief business officer at Ava Labs, in a press release shared with CoinDesk . “FIFA's decision to launch its L1 on Avalanche is a testament to our technology's ability to support global-scale applications with speed, flexibility, and security.”



While FIFA currently only has a World Cup NFT collection and a digital collectibles marketplace, it did not share what else it is planning to release on its new blockchain.

Bitcoin rose to its highest level on record on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high from January, as risk sentiment continues to improve after last month's tariff-induced selloff.

The world's largest cryptocurrency touched a high of $109,760.08, and was last up 1.1% at $108,117.

Its ascent was driven by a combination of factors including easing trade tension between the United States and China and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt which has prompted investors to seek alternative investment sources to the dollar.

“Now that January's high has been surpassed – and the 50 percent upside from April's lows has been achieved – bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset trading platform Nexo, said in an emailed comment.

Bitcoin at times trades in a similar fashion to tech stocks and other assets that rise in value when investor sentiment is high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 30% from its early April low.

That has also coincided with continued weakness in the dollar, a further boost for bitcoin's exchange rate against the U.S. currency.

Crypto market participants often point to increased involvement from traditional financial firms as reasons for its gains. This week they have referenced JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, who said the bank will let clients buy bitcoin. Earlier this month, crypto exchange Coinbase was added to the S&P 500 index. Coinbase said on Monday the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a probe into a recent data breach at the company.

“We're still in year four of the bitcoin price cycle – the year after the bitcoin halving when miner rewards are slashed in half – which historically means its best days are still ahead of it and – while macro uncertainty and the threat of further volatility remains, a target of $150,000 in 2025 is still very much on the cards,” Trenchev said.

Meanwhile, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, surprisingly did not rise in tandem with bitcoin. It was last down 0.5% at $2,513. ","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","cryptocurrency"

Cetus Protocol, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity provider on the Sui network, has been drained of $223 million worth of tokens in an apparent hack, according to Cetus Protocol on X.

The protocol added that $162 million of the stolen funds had been ""paused"" and it is working with the Sui Foundation to recover the remainder of the funds.

The wallet tied to the Cetus Protocol exploit — 0xe28b50 — currently holds over 12.9 million SUI, valued at approximately $54 million at current prices.

On-chain data shows the address has a net worth exceeding 32.9 million SUI (approximately $137 million), suggesting the attacker may have already bridged or swapped funds through multiple paths.

The wallet remains active at the time of publishing and is likely in the process of obfuscating funds. This confirms the scale of the exploit and further pressures Sui's DeFi infrastructure, as major token pools and pairs remain drained.

The Cetus team has paused the smart contracts and is actively investigating, it said in an X post. According to early analysis, the attacker used spoof tokens like BULLA to exploit broken price curves and reserve calculations. 

They then added near-zero liquidity to manipulate internal LP state and repeatedly removed real assets like SUI and USDC without depositing anything meaningful.

Seems like all @CetusProtocol LP were drainedLooking into tx, the likely exploit path was:1. Swap in spoof token (e.g. BULLA → SUI), taking advantage of miscalculated price curve or broken reserve math.2. Add liquidity with a near-zero amount, to manipulate internal LP… pic.twitter.com/FtpYRSpwWW

Cetus confirmed the incident on X, saying the contract has been paused “for safety” and that a detailed statement will follow. 

Binance founder CZ said the exchange's team has reached out to Sui to offer help,.

CETUS is down 40% in the past few hours, while Sui-based memecoins like BULLA and MOJO have dropped over 90%.

A single trader has opened a massive $1.1 billion notional long position on bitcoin (BTC) using 40x leverage on the onchain decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid, a rare instance of a ten-figure position being open entirely on a blockchain-based platform.

The trade is tied to wallet address “0x507,” belonging to pseudonymous trader “James Wynn” on the platform.

Lookonchain data shows the position was opened at an entry price of $108,084, with a liquidation level just under $103,640 — meaning if BTC drops to that price, the position could be wiped out. The trade is sitting on over $40 million in unrealized profit as of early Thursday.

Bitcoin just broke through $111,900!Top trader @JamesWynnReal's 40x leveraged long position of 10,200 $BTC($1.14B) is now sitting on an unrealized profit of over $39M!https://t.co/Xy0EC0h5Cw pic.twitter.com/5UlbeiA984

Wynn closed 540 BTC (~$60M) in European morning hours to lock in a $1.5 million profit. Notably, his past three exits were followed by sharp BTC pullbacks and traders may want to watch for a repeat, Lookonchain said.

Hyperliquid is built on its own high-performance layer 1 blockchain, HyperEVM, and offers features typically reserved for centralized platforms, like real-time order books, deep liquidity, and near-zero gas fees.

Its consensus mechanism, HyperBFT, reportedly handles over 200,000 transactions per second, allowing traders to execute quickly and transparently.

Unlike centralized exchanges that require KYC or restrict access, Hyperliquid allows anyone with a wallet to trade permissionlessly. The platform has rapidly gained popularity for its speed and capital efficiency, and this billion-dollar position may serve as a signal to other large players exploring onchain execution.

In many ways, it also marks a new phase of capital migration from centralized finance to decentralized finance (DeFi) — one where whales, not just retail, are willing to place big bets outside the traditional system.

Hyperliquid's HYPE is up 15% in the past 24 hours as demand for the token increased.

 Sui-based DEX Cetus has been hit by an apparent hack, with onchain data showing rapid asset drainage despite the team portraying the incident as a “bug.” 

Update (May 22, 2025, 1:27 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add further data and statements by Hacken.

Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets.  

Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. 

The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction. A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company's Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia.

Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, a significant increase over the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol.

Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation.

Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price.

Knock-on effects have already become apparent, with the Sui-based money market, Scallop, halting all borrowing on its protocol. The protocol said in an X post that a further announcement would be made when operations resume, but assured users that funds are safe.

Outside Cetus, LBTC appears to have gained over 4% in value over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap data. Others, such as Axol (AXOL), have not been as fortunate, with CoinMarketCap data showing a loss of nearly 99.5%.

The alleged exploiter's address contains nearly $52 million of Sui (SUI) tokens, $4.9 million of Haedal Staked SUI (HASUI), over $19.5 million of Toilet (TOILET), nearly $19.5 million of wrapped USDt (USDT) and many other assets. 

The official Cetus X profile confirmed that an incident on the protocol was detected, and the smart contract was paused for safety. It added that an investigation was ongoing.

However, blockchain analysts and compliance firms are raising concerns about the project's transparency. A representative from AMLBot told Cointelegraph:

The AMLBot representative — referring to statements made by Cetus team members on Discord — further explained that while the Cetus team “is calling this incident ‘just a bug,' — the timing raises questions.”

Onchain data service Onchain Lens stated in an X post that “the attacker gained control of all SUI-denominated pools, exploiting over $200M, and has also started moving $USDC.”

 FIFA is migrating its NFT marketplace and collection to a new Avalanche-powered layer-1 blockchain built for digital fan experiences. 

The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has selected Avalanche to power its dedicated blockchain network for non-fungible tokens and digital fan engagement, the organization announced on May 22.

FIFA's layer-1 (L1) blockchain will be powered by the Avalanche network's scalability-focused infrastructure for the association's five billion fans worldwide.

The move comes nearly a month after FIFA announced its initial plans to launch a new network for its blockchain-based collectibles. AvaCloud's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility will enable smoother integration with decentralized wallets and applications.

The move will enable FIFA to deliver “unique digital collectibles and immersive fan experiences, powered by the speed, scalability, and EVM compatibility,” according to Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect.

“The decision was based on a rigorous analysis of key factors including performance, security, transaction fees, customizability, and scalability,” Abbate stated in a May 22 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

FIFA added that “future plans and business cases are planned but not yet publicly disclosed.”

Following the migration, external Algorand-based wallets such as Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Instead, users will be able to connect to FIFA Collect via MetaMask or other EVM wallets that support WalletConnect.

FIFA launched its NFT collection ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia in collaboration with blockchain firm Modex.

In November 2024, FIFA partnered with blockchain gaming studio Mythical Games to launch FIFA Rivals, a free-to-play soccer game for iOS and Android.

 ChatGPT can help build AI agents that trade crypto, but success depends on the strategy, risk management and market execution, not ChatGPT alone. 

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn't need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That's where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.

These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world's most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. 

But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.

ChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT's language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”

These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.

Some traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.

Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.

However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn't respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.

Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.

Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it's possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.

Here is ChatGPT's response:

These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.

AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:

AI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.

Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.

Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.

A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.

ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.

ChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).

Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.

Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.

ChatGPT's cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.

ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.

As AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.

Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.

Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.

Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.

Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.

Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.

Some of the early hominins evidently went island hopping.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

During the glacial period that chilled the Earth 140,000 years ago, sea levels in the Indonesian region of Sundaland were low enough for present-day islands to tower like mountain ranges with a lowland savannah stretching between them. It was an expanse of mostly dry grasslands with strips of forest edging the rivers, and animals like crocodiles, river sharks, elephants, hippos, rhinos, and carnivorous lizards flourished in the region. 

Sundaland was also a paradise for early humans. Long thought to have been isolated on the island of Java, two fossil fragments of a Homo erectus skull—which surfaced with recent ocean dredging in preparation for the construction of an artificial island—revealed that this hominin species migrated and spread throughout the islands when they could still walk over bridges of land. 

Homo erectus was first discovered in Java (and was known as “Java Man” until the species was officially renamed), but sossilized remains had never before been found on the seafloor between what are now the islands of Java, Bali, Sumatra and Borneo. Now that examples have been dredged up, however, Harold Berghuis—an archaeologist from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, who led the investigation —thinks Homo erectus took advantage of the now-drowned land, and likely settled near the riverbanks in the region.

“Under the relatively dry Middle Pleistocene climate of eastern Java, herds of herbivores and groups of hominins on the lowland plains were probably dependent on large perennial rivers, providing drinking water and terrestrial as well as aquatic food sources,” Berghuis said in a study recently published in Quaternary Environments and Humans. 

These human ancestors would have had plenty to take advantage of near these ancient rivers. Trees bore fruit all year, and the ancient hominins would have been able to gather edible plants in addition to catching fish and shellfish. They may have even used mussel shells as tools—the oldest known evidence of them being used for that purpose—and engraved some of them (the most ancient human engravings have been found on shells that previously turned up in Java). The new findings show that they also hunted river turtles and terrestrial animals. Bones of river turtles and bovine ancestors showed cut marks and breakages that suggested the consumption of both meat and bone marrow.

More modern human species on the Asian mainland (such as Denisovans and Neanderthals) were already known to have hunted bovids, and while no evidence for this had been found on Java, the presence of these seafloor fossils could mean that hunting methods were transferred from one species to the other. There may have even been interbreeding. Land exposed by diminished sea levels also meant that animal species from the mainland—like the extinct Asian hippo and the endangered (but still-extant) Komodo dragon—could spread to the Indonesian islands.

Homo erectus marked a significant shift in human evolution—they were the earliest hominids to bear more of a resemblance to modern humans, with larger bodies, longer legs, and shorter arms relative to their torso. More muscle mass meant that they could walk and run faster than earlier hominins, and were likely more adept hunters. An increase in body size is also associated with an increase in brain size, and skulls tell us that their brains were over 50% larger than those of early Australopithecus species (though the human brain would eventually evolve to be 40% larger than that by the time Homo sapiens appeared). 

“The late Middle Pleistocene age of the site is of great interest in terms of hominin evolution, as this period is characterized by a great morphological diversity and mobility of hominin populations in the region,” Berghuis and his team said.

When sea levels rose, the land bridges between the islands of Sundaland were submerged, but this dredging has given us an unprecedented window into the life of Homo erectus in Indonesia.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

Garfield might be the most iconic orange tabby around, but Hollywood has seen quite a few leading cats of the same color—Heathcliff, Oliver, Hiyao Miyazaki's adorably terrifying Catbus from My Neighbor Totoro, and Morris from those retro cat food commercials all come to mind. Like most celebrities, they have so far refused to give up their most guarded beauty secret—how did they get those fabulous golden auburn coats?

Hiroyuki Sasaki—a cat enthusiast and geneticist at Kyushu University in Japan—was determined to identify the elusive gene that carries the orange mutation in Felis silvestris catus (the domesticated cat). He and his research team analyzed DNA in skin tissue from cats with and without orange fur, and found a mutation to the ARHGAP36 gene. This was a type of deletion mutation, meaning that a segment of a gene is missing. In orange cats, the missing segment is located on an intron, or noncoding region, of the ARHGAP36 gene, which is also in neuroendocrine tissues (especially the hypothalamus), adrenal glands, and pituitary glands.

The location of the mutation on this particular gene also explains why there are so many more male orange cats than female ones. ARHGAP36 is known as X-linked, meaning that it is located on the X chromosome. In female cats (and all female mammals), one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is randomly switched off in a process known as X chromosome inactivation, so even if the mutation is present, it is unlikely that it will be expressed by every cell and appear as an even (or even semi-even) orange coat. To be orange, a female cat must have the orange gene on both X chromosomes, so no matter which one is deleted, the orange gene still dominates.

Male cats, on the other hand, only have one X chromosome, and are therefore much more likely to evenly express that mutation. 

Whether orange or not, all fur pigmentation genes are X-linked. Calico and tortoiseshell coats also come from different combinations of activated X chromosomes—both with and without the deletion that results in orange—which explains why most of them are female.  For this to happen to a male cat, there would have to be two X chromosomes present next to the Y chromosome in order for random inactivation to result in mottled fur.

Sasaki and his team found that ARHGAP36 was most active in melanocytes (cells in the skin which produce pigment) found in the orange patches of calicos and tortoiseshells. Genes promoting melanogenesis, or the production of melanin in melanocytes, suppress ARHGAP36 and are upregulated in brown, black, and gray patches. These colors are associated with the black or brown pigment known as eumelanin, which is also the most common form of melanin.

Sasaki believes that when a mutated ARHGAP36 is expressed as orange fur in cats, the missing part of the gene would have suppressed orange coloration had it been present. In cats, mutated ARHGAP36 was shown to suppress other genes involved in the production of eumelanin so that it could instead produce a different type of melanin called pheomelanin, which is the reddish-yellow pigment in orange fur. Found only in mammals and birds, pheomelanin is also behind red hair in humans and flashy red feathers in some bird species.

It seems that high ARHGAP36 activity is, in general, associated with reduced activity in genes involved with the production of eumelanin. Sasaki is convinced that this gene's takeover may somehow shift pigment production to pheomelanin instead—though, how exactly it pulls this off is still unknown. And because ARHGAP36 also has significant importance in the brain, there is even speculation as to whether there are true associations between fur color and personality (the confirmation of which could either prove or silence all the orange cat memes out there).

“Although it is not fully understood how the identified deletion switches the pigment species, the variation likely dominates the cat population with orange coat color,” the researchers wrote.

Somewhere, Garfield is smugly beaming next to a tray of lasagna.

The path toward our mind-machine merger never has never seemed clearer.

Here's what you'll learn about when you read this story:

Two very different types of “computers” dominate the world today. The first is the type you're likely reading this article on—machines powered by transistors and silicon that make our modern society possible. Then, there's the biological type of computer that's been a couple billion years in the making—the human brain, which has neurons and a cerebral cortex instead of transistors and a motherboard. 

These are two wildly different architectures with totally different capabilities—the human brain somehow achieves a level of consciousness unseen elsewhere in nature (or the observable universe, for that matter), but computers can do calculating tasks many times faster than our minds could ever fathom. So, it should come as no surprise that since the very origins of computing, scientists and engineers have pondered whether these two disparate “computers” could one day merge together. 

Well, apparently, that time is now. Cortical Labs, an Australia-based company, announced earlier this year that it had successfully developed the world's first “biological computer,” which it calls the CL-1. Fusing human brain cells with silicon hardware, Cortical Labs says the CL-1 is an ideal tool for science and medical research, meaning that this thing isn't going to be siding onto your desktop and delivering a 120 frames-per-second gaming experience. Instead, this $35,000 computer—which will be widely available later this year—could make medical testing and other scientific trials easier, as scientists can essentially test would-be drugs on this ‘body in a box' biological computer. 

“The large majority of drugs for neurological and psychiatric diseases that enter clinical trial testing fail, because there's so much more nuance when it comes to the brain—but you can actually see that nuance when you test with these tools,” Brett Kagan, Cortical Labs' Chief Scientific Officer, told New Atlas back in March. “Our hope is that we're able to replace significant areas of animal testing with this. Animal testing is unfortunately still necessary, but I think there are a lot of cases where it can be replaced and that's an ethically good thing.”

Kagan was directly involved in the development of CL-1's predecessor, DishBrain, which grabbed headlines back in 2022 for successfully playing a game of Pong (the results of which were published in the journal Neuron). As Kagan explained at the time, DishBrain played Pong quite unlike a human brain, and instead described the neurons as sort of experiencing its surroundings as if it was the Pong paddle itself. 

However, this dawning era of neurons-on-a-chip computing brings up a sticky question: Could we be possibly subjecting a type of sentience to a “life” of abject misery or, at the very least, boredom? Back in 2022, Kagan said that his team was working closely with bioethicists to answer this question, and clearly came to the conclusion that this wasn't a concern—at least, not yet. 

Speaking with Live Science, a stem cell research unaffiliated with Cortical Labs came to a similar conclusion, and Suhas Kumar from Sandia National Laboratories also told Popular Mechanics back in 2022 that the simplicity of this setup means the neurons are simply responding to a stimulus. However, seeing as this is just a first step into the broader world of neuromorphic computing, the relative simplicity of CL-1 could get dizzyingly complex pretty quick. 

The Cortical Labs team argues that Synthetic Biological Intelligence, or SBI, is “inherently more natural than AI” because it uses materials more akin to the human brain. As the technology progresses, this could produce results similar to that of a human mind, blurring the lines between the world's two greatest computers even further.

Astronomers have observed a massive and extremely active barred spiral galaxy in the early Universe and found that it has important similarities and differences with modern galaxies. This improves our understanding of how barred spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way Galaxy, grow and evolve.

Some spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, exhibit a straight bar inside the spiral pattern. This bar structure helps channel gas towards the center of the galaxy where it can be used to form new stars. But why bars form in only about half of spiral galaxies, and how they influence the evolution of the galaxy are unanswered questions.

To study the evolution of spiral galaxies in the early Universe, researchers led by Shuo Huang, a project researcher at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and Nagoya University, used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope to observe a massive barred spiral galaxy known as J0107a that existed 11.1 billion years ago. Located in the constellation Cetus, J0107a is a ""monster"" galaxy, meaning a galaxy growing rapidly in the early Universe by forming many new stars. Because they are located far away, it has been difficult to see the detailed structure of monster galaxies and determine what is driving this vigorous star formation. Recently the improved resolution provided by the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed spirals and even bars in some of the monster galaxies. J0107a is the earliest and most massive barred spiral galaxy known to date, so it is the best target for studying the evolution of barred spiral galaxies in the early Universe.

The team found that in J0107a the distribution and motion of gas in the bar is similar to modern galaxies. But compared to modern galaxies, the concentrations of gas are several times higher and the speed of the gas flow is faster, reaching several hundred kilometers per second. Astronomers believe that this massive influx of gas to the center will fuel signification additional star formation, helping to drive the evolution of this monster galaxy. This is the first time these features have been observed, and they were not predicted by theoretical or simulation models.

Huang comments, ""We expect that the detailed information about the distribution and movement of gas gained through these observations will provide important clues for exploring not only the origins of the diversity of galaxies, but also the formation and evolution of more normal barred spiral galaxies.""

Throwing a little heat on your meal might be an effective strategy for cutting back on calories, according to a new study led by researchers at Penn State.

Scientists at the University's Sensory Evaluation Center examined how increasing ""oral burn"" -- the spicy taste from ingredients like chili pepper -- affects how much food people consume during a meal. The findings, available online now and slated to publish in the October issue of the journal Food Quality and Preference, suggest that making the meal slightly spicier led participants to eat less, consuming fewer calories.

""We know from previous studies that when people slow down, they eat significantly less,"" said Paige Cunningham, a postdoctoral researcher and lead author on the study who earned her doctorate in nutritional sciences from Penn State in 2023. ""We suspected that making a meal spicier might slow people down. We thought, let's test, under controlled experimental conditions in the lab, if adding a small amount of spice, but not so much that the meal is inedible, will make people eat slower and therefore eat less.""

The researchers found that increasing spiciness slightly using dried chili pepper slowed down eating and reduced the amount of food and energy consumed at a meal, all without negatively affecting the palatability of the dish.

""This points to added chilies as a potential strategy for reducing the risk of energy overconsumption,"" said John Hayes, Penn State professor of food science and corresponding author on the paper. ""While portion control wasn't the explicit goal of this study, our results suggest this might work. Next time you're looking to eat a little less, try adding a blast of chilies, as it may slow you down and help you eat less.""

The team conducted three related experiments in a total of 130 adults who were served one of two lunch meals -- beef chili or chicken tikka masala -- in one of two versions: mild or spicy. The spiciness level was controlled by carefully varying the ratio of hot versus sweet paprika added to the dishes to vary the heat while keeping chili flavor constant.

The researchers then recorded participants on high-definition video while they ate their meals to monitor their eating behaviors. From the videos, Hayes' team measured the amount of food and water consumed, meal duration, eating speed of grams per minute, bite rate, bite size, and collected ratings on appetite, liking and spiciness before and after the meal.

""Formulating the recipes took a long time for the chicken tikka,"" Cunningham said. ""It took so many rounds of testing that my lab mates were sick of it. But science is about trial and error. I'd make a recipe, see how far I could push the spiciness, and we'd taste it. We did that until we reached a level where palatability was matched even when spiciness increased.""

The study suggests the reduction in intake is driven by changes in oral processing behaviors, she explained. Specifically, participants ate the spicier meals more slowly. She explained that a slower eating rate often means food is in the mouth longer, which can help signal fullness and lead to eating less. Other studies that slow eating rate by manipulating texture have shown similar effects, she said.

""What's critical here is that the reduction in intake occurred without negatively impacting how much participants liked the food,"" Hayes said.

He added that water intake didn't differ significantly between spicy and mild meals, suggesting that one seemingly obvious explanation, that people drank more water and filled up faster, was not the primary reason people ate less.

""This is why we need to do empirical studies of behavior, because what you might intuitively expect is often not the case,"" he said.

Hayes also noted that appetite ratings made before and after the meals were similar, suggesting participants still felt full after the spicy meal, despite eating less of it. Looking ahead, the team is now focused on understanding how oral burn can impact other eating behaviors, like snacking.

Isaiah Smith, a Penn State undergraduate from West Chester, also contributed to this work as part of an Undergraduate Research Internship Program from the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium. This work was supported by a gift from the McCormick Science Institute and federal appropriations under the Hatch Act from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Metrics details

Acute inflammation, characterized by a rapid influx of neutrophils, is a protective response that can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases when left unresolved. We previously showed that secretion of LTB4-containing exosomes via nuclear envelope-derived multivesicular bodies is required for effective neutrophil infiltration during inflammation. Here we report that the co-secretion of these exosomes with nuclear DNA facilitates the resolution of the neutrophil infiltrate in a mouse skin model of sterile inflammation. Activated neutrophils exhibit rapid and repetitive DNA secretion as they migrate directionally using a mechanism distinct from suicidal neutrophil extracellular trap release and cell death. Packaging of DNA in the lumen of nuclear envelope-multivesicular bodies is mediated by lamin B receptor and chromatin decondensation. These findings advance our understanding of neutrophil functions during inflammation and the physiological relevance of DNA secretion.

Bird-flu vaccines for cattle could reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus.Credit: Dmitriy Shironosov/Alamy

Researchers have developed the first mRNA bird-flu vaccine for cattle. Early results suggest that the vaccine triggers a strong immune response to the virus, and curbs infection in calves given milk from H5N1-infected cows — a suspected route of transmission among cattle. A widely-used vaccine for livestock could reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission of a virus that poses a “real pandemic threat”, says virologist and study co-author Scott Hensley. He and his team are working on further trials in adult lactating cows.

Molecules in blood and urine can reveal how much of a person's diet comes from ultra-processed foods — industrially manufactured items that often contain ingredients such as additives and emulsifiers. These measurements provide a way to track consumption of such foods that doesn't rely on self-reporting — and would be useful for investigating links to diseases such as diabetes and cancer.

Researchers have created a machine-learning tool that can predict, to some extent, who might be at high risk for developing postpartum depression. The tool was trained and validated with data from more than 29,000 people who gave birth in the United States. Of the people that the model flagged as having a high risk of postpartum depression, 30% went on to develop the condition. “Even some degree of prediction can be helpful because we simply don't have the resources to give everyone the follow-up care that we wish we could as far as postpartum mental health,” says psychiatrist Roy Perlis.

Research organizations in the United States are locked in a court battle with the administration of US president Donald Trump over its plan to cap payments for indirect costs. This funding has typically topped up research grants by up to 70% to cover expenses such as electricity and IT — an amount that was already insufficient in some cases to cover the real cost of doing research, say observers. The US National Science Foundation (NSF) has temporarily paused a move to cap overhead payments on new research grants at 15%. A coalition of 13 US universities and 3 academic associations are seeking to stop the policy, alleging that there are several restrictions on the NSF's ability to change overhead rates abruptly or unilaterally.

Almost half of the scientists who responded to a survey have experienced the ‘Gollum effect' — possessive behaviours, attempts to undermine others, and efforts to restrict access to data, resources or opportunities from other scientists. Of those affected, nearly half said that the perpetrator was a high-profile researcher, and one-third said it was their own supervisor. These gatekeeping behaviours “damage careers, particularly of early-career and marginalized researchers”, says study author Jose Valdez. “Most alarming was that nearly one in five of those affected left academia or science entirely.”

When Nature reporter Ewen Callaway tried making a protein using an artificial-intelligence (AI) protein language model, it didn't change the world: the molecule probably couldn't be made in the laboratory, let alone do anything useful. But a new generation of AI tools offers new hope to dabblers in computational biology. These tools take instructions in plain language and turn them into proteins and other molecules, including potential drugs. The models also allow researchers to ‘talk' to cells in ordinary English to decipher their inner workings and glean other biological insights.

In her new book Monopolizing Knowledge, historian of science and technology Jessica Ratcliff documents how manuscripts and specimens gathered by the East India Company formed the foundation of modern science in the United Kingdom. These included “many accumulated through organized looting and plunder”, notes sociologist Zaheer Baber in his review. These items were eventually donated or sold to museums — a colonial legacy that leaves these institutions with a “huge dilemma”, writes Ratcliff.

As a new professor, marketing scholar Lan Nguyen Chaplin felt bruised by the scattershot negativity in anonymous student evaluations. With experience, she came to realize that “the same qualities that made me some students' ‘best professor' were exactly what others found ‘annoying' or made my class ‘a waste of time'”, she writes. “The evaluations were as much about students' diverse preferences and expectations as about me.” Now she focuses on the feedback about her work as an educator, and treats comments about her voice, clothing and facial expressions as “noise”.

Every day is tea day in my house, but I'm still delighted to be celebrating International Tea Day. The time seems right to remind you of chemist Michelle Francl's secret to a great cup of tea: a pinch of salt. Last year, she divulged that sodium ions block the taste receptors in our mouths so the drink tastes less bitter. Her other top tips: pre-warm the pot, use loose tea and give it a constant stir — all will help extract more caffeine and antioxidants. Whatever you do (and I can't imagine that you would) — never make tea in the microwave. “You end up getting tea scum forming on the surface, and that scum contains some of the antioxidants and taste compounds,” says Francl.

While I sit frozen with indecision, salt shaker poised above my cuppa, why not send me your feedback on this newsletter? Your e-mails are always welcome at briefing@nature.com.

Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) used artificial intelligence from Meta's Llama model to comb through and analyze emails from federal workers.

Materials viewed by WIRED show that DOGE affiliates within the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) tested and used Meta's Llama 2 model to review and classify responses from federal workers to the infamous “Fork in the Road” email that was sent across the government in late January.

The email offered deferred resignation to anyone opposed to changes the Trump administration was making to its federal workforce, including an enforced return to office policy, downsizing, and a requirement to be “loyal.” To leave their position, recipients merely needed to reply with the word “resign.” This email closely mirrored one that Musk sent to Twitter employees shortly after he took over the company in 2022.

Records show Llama was deployed to sort through email responses from federal workers to determine how many accepted the offer. The model appears to have run locally, according to materials viewed by WIRED, meaning it's unlikely to have sent data over the internet.

Meta and OPM did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared alongside other Silicon Valley tech leaders like Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at Trump's inauguration in January, but little has been publicly known about his company's tech being used in government. Because of Llama's open-source nature, the tool can easily be used by the government to support Musk's goals without the company's explicit consent.

Soon after Trump took office in January, DOGE operatives burrowed into OPM, an independent agency that essentially serves as human resources for the entire federal government. The new administration's first big goal for the agency was to create a government-wide email service, according to current and former OPM employees. Riccardo Biasini, a former Tesla engineer, was involved in building the infrastructure for the service that would send out the original “Fork in the Road” email, according to material viewed by WIRED and reviewed by two government tech workers.

In late February, weeks after the Fork email, OPM sent out another request to all government workers and asked them to submit five bullet points outlining what they accomplished each week. These emails threw a number of agencies into chaos, with workers unsure how to manage email responses that had to be mindful of security clearances and sensitive information. (Adding to the confusion, it has been reported that some workers who turned on read receipts say they found that the responses weren't actually being opened.) In February, NBC News reported that these emails were expected to go into an AI system for analysis. While the materials seen by WIRED do not explicitly show DOGE affiliates analyzing these weekly “five points” emails with Meta's Llama models, the way they did with the Fork emails, it wouldn't be difficult for them to do so, two federal workers tell WIRED.

“We don't know for sure,” says one federal worker on whether DOGE used Meta's Llama to review the “five points” emails. “Though if they were smart they'd reuse their code.”

DOGE did not appear to use Musk's own AI model, Grok, when it set out to build the government-wide email system in the first few weeks of the Trump administration. At the time, Grok was a proprietary model belonging to xAI and access to its API was limited. But earlier this week, Microsoft announced that it would begin hosting xAi's Grok 3 models as options in its Azure AI Foundry, making the xAI models more accessible in Microsoft environments like the one used at OPM. This potentially, should they want it, would enable Grok as an option as an AI system going forward. In February, Palantir struck a deal to include Grok as an AI option in the company's software, which is frequently used in government.

Over the last few months, DOGE has rolled out and used a variety of AI-based tools at government agencies. In March, WIRED reported that the US Army was using a tool called “CamoGPT” to remove DEI-related language from training materials. The General Services Administration rolled out “GSAi” earlier this year, a chatbot aimed at boosting overall agency productivity. OPM has also accessed software called AutoRIF that could assist in the mass firing of federal workers.

For two days, Akasha Song had been riding in the passenger seat of a dusty Fiat truck through the desert-like shrublands of northeastern Brazil. The region, known as the caatinga, gets so hot and dry during much of the year that Brazilians sometimes call it the portaria do inferno, or “gatehouse of hell.” At the wheel was a man Akasha had met just the previous morning who spoke almost no English.

Akasha, a well-built 43-year-old American dressed in Lululemon athletic wear with a shaved head, a wild Rick Rubin–white beard, and big blue eyes, was delighted by all of it. He'd spent most of the drive listening to Phil Collins, the Brazilian singer Zeca Baleiro, or whatever else the driver—let's call him José, though that's not his real name—put on the truck's sound system. Akasha loved watching the sandy hills and towns roll by and stopping to eat at roadside restaurants. He approached all travel with a kind of childlike glee, but this trip in April of 2021 had a special purpose: Akasha believed José was taking him to a farm where he grew a tree called jurema preta, whose inner root bark is known for its high concentrations of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.

DMT is a powerful psychedelic compound, capable of inducing brief, mind-blowing trips to otherwise inaccessible states of consciousness, or even, some of its users believe, other planes of reality. For Akasha, the substance was both his holy sacrament and his flagship product. He had spent half a decade setting up secret labs across the western US to turn imported jurema tree bark (which is legal) into DMT (which is not). Under his secret online handle, Shimshai, he'd sold tens of millions of doses to customers on the dark web in packaging emblazoned with his logo: a human with their eyes closed in bliss and a swirl of rainbow colors flowing out of their open cranium. Now Akasha had come to Brazil to find this mind-opening drug's ultimate source.

As the two men drove on, the landscape slowly changed from desert to subtropical forest. Late in the afternoon, José finally pulled over. He announced that they had arrived. The two men got out of the truck, and Akasha followed José off the road, over a wire fence, and into the woods. José stopped and gestured. “Jurema,” he said.

Akasha, confused, asked José which tree he meant. Where was the farm they had driven 14 hours to reach?

“All of it,” José responded.

Only then did Akasha realize: Every single one of the trees that filled the endless wild forest around him—with their short, gnarled trunks and fernlike leaves—held his key ingredient. From every pound of bark, his labs could produce hundreds of doses of DMT.

The inner root bark of jurema preta trees contains especially high concentrations of DMT.

In that moment, Akasha says, he felt like he had just become the Pablo Escobar of psychedelics. “Holy shit,” he thought. “That is a lot of DMT.”

Today, thinking back to that turning point in his rise and fall as a hallucinogens kingpin, Akasha wishes he could say that he saw in that Brazilian forest the potential to heal the trauma of entire human populations or build a network of psychic touchpoints with other dimensions.

“But I didn't,” Akasha says. “I saw billions of dollars.”

The first time you smoke, vape, or intravenously inject a few dozen milligrams of DMT—sometimes called “dreams,” “deems,” or “spice” (yes, that's a Dune reference)—you can expect the next few minutes of your life to be unlike any you have experienced. In his book The Spirit Molecule, about the first modern study that administered DMT to humans, the psychiatrist Rick Strassman uses a TV metaphor to distinguish the drug's effects from those of other psychoactive substances. “Rather than merely adjusting the brightness, contrast, and color of the previous program,” he writes, “we have changed the channel.”

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

In online forum dispatches and descriptions to medical researchers, DMT users describe three fundamental levels of trip, depending on the size of your dose and how completely your mind is prepared to embrace its effects. First comes what some DMT adherents call the “waiting room”: A wall of interlacing fractal images fills your vision, even when you close your eyes. You may hear things that aren't there or be filled with inexplicable euphoria or fear.

At the next level, this geometry folds out into three-dimensional space, and you might find yourself transported to the moon, a castle, a beach, inside a pyramid, or into a pulsating Russian bathhouse roughly the size of a womb, to name a few examples. You may “be” in this place and in your physical location at the same time, or inhabit this new destination so fully that you leave your body behind altogether.

In this other place—which many DMT users describe as another dimension—you're likely to encounter “entities.” Elves, insectoids, reptilians, aliens, gods, and clowns are all common. One DMT test subject reported being attended to by a hyperintelligent 3-foot-tall Gumby. These beings may shun you, communicate with you, eviscerate and eat you, perform live surgical experiments on you, envelop you in love and sexual pleasure, or any combination of the above.

DMT web forums are filled with debates about whether these entities are mere mental representations or objectively exist as nonhuman life forms. At least one Reddit thread raises the question of whether having sex with entities counts as cheating on one's partner. (Another Reddit post complains that the entities won't stop masturbating while the user is trying to have a conversation with God.)

At the third, rarer level of trip, DMT psychonauts describe transcendent conditions like oneness with the universe, becoming God, embracing death, or an infinite void. In some cases, people report passing entire lifetimes in these other realms or states of being.

Back here on Earth, though, it's all over in less than 20 minutes. Some DMT fans call it “the businessman  's trip,” because the drug's most dramatic psychedelic effects fit easily within a lunch break. DMT is in fact the active ingredient in ayahuasca, the better-known psychoactive brew used in South American spiritual ceremonies, whose effects last as long as eight hours. Without the compounds in ayahuasca that slow the breakdown of DMT in your body—or the ones that notoriously make ayahuasca drinkers vomit—the substance flashes through the brain at turbo speed.

In spite of that brevity, some preliminary research suggests DMT can have long-lasting psychological and even therapeutic effects. While some medical experts warn that DMT can exacerbate certain mental health conditions, one 25-person drug company study from 2022 showed that 40 percent of clinically depressed test subjects given DMT were fully in remission six months after one or two doses. And though some users report terrifying, even traumatizing experiences, others say their quick, ultra-intense trips help them reconsider emotional problems, work through past trauma, or experience glimpses of the divine or moments of self-annihilation that reduce their fear of death.

For all those otherworldly effects, finding DMT in the everyday world is surprisingly easy. It exists in small quantities in every human nervous system, where its purpose isn't fully understood. (Some studies suggest it may play a role in dreaming.) It grows naturally not just in jurema preta, the organism from which it's most easily extracted, but also in plenty of other species, from the leaves of citrus plants to the internal organs of rabbits.

One of the most psychoactive substances humans have ever ingested, in other words, is already everywhere around and inside us. All it takes to unlock DMT's full, transcendental potential is someone willing to carry out a simple chemical extraction—and violate Title 21, section 841 of the US legal code.

For about seven years, for a very large number of Americans, that someone was Shimshai. To his friends, he was Akasha Song. To the federal agents hunting him, he was ultimately better known by his legal name, Joseph Clements.

Of his first time smoking DMT, Akasha Song says, “I can just remember falling in love immediately.”

Before Akasha Song discovered DMT, Joseph Clements discovered LSD. In 1992, when he was 14, a friend gave him a tab of acid at their high school near Houston, Texas. He took it, went home, and had the most profound conversation of his life to that point with his father, who he says somehow didn't detect that his teenage son was on drugs.

“Who am I? Why am I here?” he remembers asking his dad and himself. “It was the first time these fundamental questions had ever hit me.”

For much of the rest of his teens, Clements would drop acid about once a month. He'd go out with his friends, talk, listen to music, and watch them get drunk. Often he was the only one tripping. He loved the depth—the sense of telepathy, even—that LSD brought to his otherwise mundane teen social life. “All that square, normal stuff, I would do that on acid,” he says. “And I did that just my whole damn childhood.” He kept a small, blank business card and drew a mark on it every time he tripped. By the time he lost the card, he says, it was full on both sides.

If not for acid, Clements would have had a typical Texas upbringing. He loved BMX biking and going to church. He was named after his father, Joseph Carmichael Clements, who had been an engineer at Texas Instruments and was a Catholic. His mother, who worked in the oil and gas industry, was a Baptist. They divorced when he was 6. He went to Sunday services at both churches and joined Methodist and Lutheran youth groups, too. He thought, from his limited view of the world, that he was exploring the full multiplicity of religious experience.

Around 10th grade, Clements stopped caring about school. He was also diagnosed with ADHD before anyone else he knew. When he got in trouble for disrupting class or ignoring his homework assignments, his father would unfailingly defend him, often blaming his disorder. Eventually, Clements remembers, the school's teachers and administrators were so scared of his father's interventions that he felt almost immune from consequences—a sense of invincibility that would stay with him, to some degree, for the rest of his life.

Indeed, it stuck with Clements even as the years that followed became far more difficult. In his late teens, he says, he began to realize that his father had sexually abused him when he was younger. The memories had always been there, he says, but he had never allowed himself to confront the resentment he felt. He broke ties with his dad, choosing to live with his mother instead, and wouldn't speak with his father again until the elder Joseph Clements was dying of liver failure decades later.

After high school, he found a job in a restaurant and got married to a woman working as a waitress there, and they had a son. Soon, he says, he discovered that his wife was addicted to opioids and was selling their belongings to pay for her habit. They split up.

A natural salesman with “the gift of gab,” as his mother puts it, Clements found work selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door, building websites, and making deals for billboard advertising in malls. He was also charged with multiple incidents of marijuana possession and two DUIs, one of which happened while he was on probation, leading to a six-month sentence in prison.

While he was there, his estranged wife died of a drug overdose. Their son, 6 years old at the time, was the one who found her body.

Clements moved on and straightened out his life. His son, who had been living with relatives until he was out of prison, moved back in with him. He remarried, had a daughter, and stopped using drugs other than marijuana, which he and his second wife were careful to budget for. He built a successful career running marketing for multiple local businesses, or in some cases consulting for entrepreneurs. He preached Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad wealth gospel, which involves creating businesses that run themselves to attain financial independence. He settled into the mainstream Texas culture of, as he describes it, “drinking and getting fat and working and cussing.”

Then on New Year's Eve of 2012, when he was 34, Clements went to a concert by the String Cheese Incident, and his life truly began.

That night, at a performance by the jam band that one of his wife's friends had invited him to attend near Denver, Colorado, Clements dropped acid for the first time in well over a decade. He found himself in a crowd of thousands of like-minded people of all ages, dancing, wearing strange clothes, looking beautiful, singing, several of them twirling balls of fire, many also clearly tripping. He immediately felt that these were “my people”—that he had found the community he had been seeking since his first hit of LSD 20 years earlier. His life back in Texas seemed tragically empty by comparison.

Seven humanoids made of light were gathered around him. He realized, as he looked up at them, that they were somehow everyone he had even known.

When he got home to Houston, he told his wife he wanted to quit his job, sell everything they owned, and move to Colorado. She responded to this apparent midlife crisis by leaving him and taking their daughter. He would fight for custody, unsuccessfully, for years to come.

Clements grieved the breakdown of his family. But his String Cheese Incident rebirth was not a passing whim. He began to prepare to move to Colorado with his son and to seek out a similar community—hippies, for lack of a better term—in Houston. He walked away from his career and began traveling nonstop to music festivals from Michigan to Costa Rica, occasionally with his son in tow, taking LSD, mushrooms, and any other psychedelic on offer.

As Clements reinvented himself, he says he could no longer stand to share his father's name. So he picked a new one, inspired by the Akashic records, a supposed ethereal compendium of all life experiences, past and present, that clairvoyants in 19th-century Europe said they could tap into.

It was also around this time that Akasha Song discovered DMT. A friend from the festival scene gave him a small capsule of what he called “dreams.” Akasha looked up the drug online and read that a single dose was equivalent to 300 hits of acid—an exaggeration, but one that got his attention.

Sitting on the floor of his home in Houston one evening, Akasha placed a pinch of the pale yellow crystals, which gave off a kind of perfumed new-shoe smell, onto the ash left behind in his weed pipe. He lit it and took his first hit. Akasha's vision dissolved into “platonic shapes,” as he puts it, the geometric waiting room that initially beckons to DMT users. That was the extent of his first trip. As alien as DMT's effects were, he says he felt like he was entering a comfortable, natural mental state, exactly where he was supposed to be. “I just remember falling in love immediately,” he says.

Over the next months, Akasha smoked DMT dozens of times. Describing the details of those escalating trips, for Akasha, is difficult. As its nickname suggests, DMT's effects are a bit like a dream: As vivid as its reality feels in the moment, for many users its sensations fade upon returning to the material world. But he retains a strong memory of one DMT journey in particular, the one he considers the pinnacle of all his psychedelic travels.

That one climactic trip, Akasha says, began with a feeling that he had fallen and hit his head. When he came to, he was lying on his back in an endless void and seven humanoids made of light were gathered around him. He realized, as he looked up at them, that they were somehow everyone he had ever known.

One of them lifted him into a sitting position and gestured out at the void, which Akasha now saw was filled with infinite other groups of light-entities encircling infinite other people, each of them either waking or falling asleep. The differences in their states of awareness created a sine wave that Akasha could feel stretching out trillions of miles. The exclamations of those waking up combined into a resonant “music of epiphany,” as Akasha heard it.

At that point, Akasha says, he began to understand that his physical life on Earth was a dream and that it was fading. He felt a pang of sadness that he would soon forget his mother, his children, and everyone he had ever loved. The entities seemed to sense his wish to keep dreaming. They laid him back down and, as the trip subsided, he returned to his body.

For days afterward, Akasha was reluctant to speak to anyone, still convinced that the people around him were characters being performed by the entities he had met—that he'd seen the reality underlying human experience and his entire waking life was a dream. On some level, he says, he has never stopped believing it.

Akasha had heard that it was possible—relatively easy, even—to make DMT, a notion that struck him as almost miraculous. A friend told him that a woman they knew who sold tie-dyed T-shirts at music festivals was familiar with the process. When Akasha asked her, she invited him to her house on the outskirts of Houston the next day. The moment he arrived, she sat him down on her living-room couch, handed him a pipe, and told him to smoke a dose—perhaps to make sure he wasn't a cop. As he returned to reality, he saw that she had already set out the precursor ingredients of DMT in front of him: lye, the solvent naphtha, and powdered jurema bark.

A mason jar filled with the precursors for DMT that Akasha Song was making in a tent at a music festival.

She walked Akasha through the process of DMT extraction, which he carefully wrote down in his journal: Mix lye with hot water in a mason jar. Add the bark powder, which turns into DMT-laden sludge. Pour in the naphtha and stir. When a yellow-tinged solution separates from the jurema sludge below, draw it off with a turkey baster, squirt it into a baking pan, then put it in the freezer. The crystals that form at the bottom, ready to smoke as soon as the last solvent evaporates, will be DMT.

Akasha's tutor gifted him a kilo of bark to get him started. He and a friend immediately drove to Ace Hardware, bought naphtha and lye, and followed the process Akasha had just been taught. They smoked the results the next day, reveling in the magic of DIY psychedelic alchemy. Then they drove around town, selling their DMT to friends, instantly making back the money they'd spent at the hardware store as well as a small profit. “It was the most amazing thing,” says Akasha. “I had figured out how to make my most valued possession in the world.”

By December of 2013, Akasha had followed through on his plan to sell everything he owned and move to Colorado. He couch surfed for a while, briefly joined a cult on a ranch, then moved in with a group that lived in a geodesic dome in the mountains. His son was with him at times or else lived with Akasha's mother. Throughout, Akasha made DMT in mason jars and sold it to meditation circles and at music festivals, using whatever freezer was at hand to crystallize his solutions and sourcing bark from a website in the Netherlands that his DMT tutor had told him about. (The bark itself wasn't illegal to buy or ship, he learned, because it can be used in non-psychedelic products like cosmetics.) No one in Akasha's circles ever referred to DMT as a “drug.” It was “medicine”—and he was the medicine man. At times, Akasha's new vocation could also make him tens of thousands of dollars in a week.

In 2015, Akasha moved in with a group of friends in a house beside a reservoir in Nederland, a small town half an hour's drive from Boulder through a winding mountain pass. He acquired a ring-tailed lemur as a “service animal.” The little black and white primate, whom Akasha named Oliver, would swing through the rafters of the house, play with Akasha and his friends in the snow-covered aspen trees in their front yard, or sit on his shoulder when he went into town or to parties in Boulder, boosting Akasha's local celebrity.

“He was this big, shiny person with a lot of energy,” says one friend who asked me to call him Coinflip, because he'd decided based on a coin flip to partner with Akasha and sell DMT at music festivals. “He was just very inspired, with his big-ass eyes wide open.”

Akasha, like his customers, strongly believed in the mind-opening value of DMT. He also understood on some level that he was a drug dealer and that continuing this new career entailed serious legal risk. A conviction for DMT possession or sale in the US carries years in prison for the amounts he was extracting, as much as decades for higher weights. But would cops, or even the feds, actually know what this sand-colored substance was if they saw it? Would they actually care about his seemingly benign hallucinogen? Within Akasha's community, there was a mantra that he heard again and again: “The medicine is protecting you.” Higher powers, he came to feel, would safeguard him in his spiritual mission. That same sense of invincibility he'd felt since childhood, despite all evidence to the contrary, now echoed in his mind—and pushed him to scale his ambitions ever larger.

Selling DMT at music festivals provided a decent living, but it was kind of a drag. Most people still didn't know what this three-letter substance was, so Akasha would often have to enter vacuum-cleaner salesman mode to make a deal: He'd offer a prospective customer a sample, they'd smoke it in front of him, and he'd wait 15 or 20 minutes for them to return from their trip and become conscious enough to actually buy a gram for $100.

By 2015, Akasha had heard about a better venue for drug sales: the dark web. He checked out a site called AlphaBay, which had become one of the top markets, and found that there didn't seem to be much competition to sell DMT. With very little thought, he opened a vendor account for himself with the handle “Shimshai,” the name of an ayahuascarian he'd met in Costa Rica. He initially listed a few different quantities for sale on the market, just to see if anyone would bite. The next day, he was surprised to see he had made three sales, despite having no reviews or reputation of any kind as an online vendor. He scrambled to find mylar bags, bubble wrap, envelopes, and postage, then shipped off his product using a fake return address. The next day he had six orders. The day after that, 10, then 15. “And it just kept growing,” Akasha says.

Within three weeks, to Akasha's amazement, Shimshai was up to 40 orders a day. Though most were for a single gram of DMT priced at $70 in crypto, the sales added up to thousands of dollars in daily revenue, nearly equaling what he had made selling in person.

“This is a lot of money, and this is easy,” Akasha thought. “So let's do it proper.”

One of Shimshai's vendor profiles on a dark-web drug market.

He was done with mason jars. Akasha bought four 35-gallon plastic barrels and put them in the garage of the shared house in Nederland. Around each one, he affixed an electric drum heater—a device that fits around a barrel like a corset. To mix his ingredients, he used an electric drill with a paint stirrer attachment. He'd pour the yellowish top solution into 5-gallon buckets and put them in a freezer he'd bought at Walmart. In about 10 days, he could produce more than a kilogram of DMT—tens of thousands of doses—which he stored in a Tupperware container.

Producing DMT as a cottage industry had its complications. Akasha's process produced gallons of waste—used solvent and highly alkaline, lye-infused bark sludge. At times he'd return the naphtha to the paint shop or hardware store where he'd bought it, but other times he'd dispose of it at a sewage plant. The sludge he'd dump in the woods, trying not to think about it too much. “Like a vegan who does cocaine,” Akasha says, “I just didn't check in with myself about it.”

Akasha knew that his money, too, was toxic. He had read about dark-web moguls whose crypto profits had been traced back to them on the bitcoin blockchain. So Akasha created a convoluted laundering setup designed to get around US laws requiring crypto exchanges to know the identities of their customers. He had a Canadian friend sign up on his behalf for an exchange that didn't require personal information from non-US citizens. Plenty of other friends were interested in getting into crypto, too, and Akasha would offer to sell them his coins for cash. “They had no idea they were buying tens of thousands of dollars of bitcoin that came straight from the darknet,” Akasha says.

By this time, Akasha had found a contact willing to sell him jurema bark in bulk. But when he asked for a thousand pounds of it, his source suddenly tried to raise the price. So Akasha performed a reverse image search on a product shot of the powdered bark that his source had sent him. He immediately found the website of a seller in Mexico that the friend had been buying from. Soon Akasha had cut out the middleman and was having the shipments sent to friends under fake names.

As online orders climbed toward 100 a day, Akasha turned a guest bedroom of his house into a shipping-and-receiving hub and started hiring his housemates to do the endless work of preparing packages, measuring out DMT, sealing it, bagging it, and putting it in the mail. Postage became a serious headache: Akasha was afraid that a single person buying too many priority stamps from a single post office would raise suspicions. So he paid a rotating crew of housemates to make a circuit of local towns, buying stamps from each one and dropping off a few packages at different mailboxes.

Some dark-web drug vendors selling more recognizable wares would triple-vacuum-seal their products to conceal their smell or hide them in disguised packaging, like putting a bag of psychedelic mushrooms into a box of beef stroganoff Hamburger Helper so that it looked like an ingredient. Shimshai didn't bother with any of that: Given DMT's relative obscurity, he figured bubble wrap and a mailer envelope was enough to avoid law enforcement's attention. Inside those layers, Akasha would put his product in a mylar bag marked with the rainbow-mind logo he designed himself.

Positive reviews flowed in, bolstering Shimshai's reputation. “Out of the park,” one customer would later write. “Always the best, don't look elsewhere, A++ in every category !” “Perfect transaction, thanks Shimshai!” “Literally sent by the gods.”

By now Akasha had recruited his entire household to keep up with the grind. But ultimately he would trust only one associate to share in managing the online Shimshai persona: his old DMT-selling festival partner Coinflip. As the business boomed, Akasha and Coinflip would eventually do the daily work together of copying sales from the dark web into spreadsheets, responding to customers' questions, and resolving their complaints—though it was still always Akasha who controlled the keys to the bitcoin funds flowing into the Shimshai wallet and paid everyone else, including Coinflip.

As the months went by and Shimshai's profile grew on the dark web, so too did the secrecy of that name in Akasha's everyday life. “Even my closest friends didn't know it,” Akasha says. Only Coinflip did. Soon, the two men came to see the pseudonym as almost taboo. They stopped saying it out loud, even to one another, even when they were alone.

In early 2017, Akasha was waiting in line at a music venue in Boulder when the doorman struck up a conversation with him. He told Akasha he'd have let him in for free—that what Akasha was doing “up in the mountains” was “changing the world for the better.” Akasha immediately left the venue, went home, and started making plans to leave Colorado. This was not the aura of local celebrity he was looking for.

Over the next few days, he told his housemates they were done. He packed his DMT-making equipment into a trailer, hitched it to his Land Rover, and drove to Austin. His son, now a young teenager, came with him. (His lemur, Oliver, did not: As Akasha tells it, a small child had approached the prosimian in a parking lot and got a paw to the face. The local news reported it instead as a bite. Oliver was taken by the local police and ended up at a refuge in Florida.)

From Craigslist, Akasha rented a huge, three-story house on South Austin's Convict Hill with giant oak trees in the back yard, a view of the city from his bedroom's balcony, the sun streaming into its windows from three directions, and gallery lighting for his growing art collection. He spent another $50,000 refurbishing his Land Rover. Akasha Song, once a homeless hippie, had come up in the world. Or as he puts it, “I went bougie as hell.”

The Austin house had a two-car garage with plenty of space for Akasha's DMT setup. Shimshai was now receiving as many as 200 orders a day, often adding up to $15,000 in daily sales, more money than Akasha had seen before in his life. (The podcaster Joe Rogan would also singlehandedly spike Shimshai's sales by the hundreds every time he mentioned DMT on his show.) But Akasha was now working alone. By the time he had production in his garage going again, he had a backlog of more than a thousand orders. He was working 12-hour days to stir, decant, freeze, scrape, buy stamps, package, ship, and manage his online profile. “I was running and gunning,” Akasha says. “I could not make enough.”

Akasha began hiring friends from the local music scene to take on the work. As soon as anyone heard what he did, he says, they wanted in. “They'd feel honored,” Akasha says. “They had never even seen that much DMT, and they were just so captivated by the idea of it.” But he rarely kept employees long. As soon as he could see that someone was doing the math of how much money he was making, he would unceremoniously let them go.

Almost without noticing, Akasha had let go of his “medicine man” role and its spiritual motivations. “All of a sudden I could have everything that I wanted, whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted,” he says. But Shimshai's reviews kept calling his product life-changing. Friends still told him he was “doing God's work.”

Then, in early July of 2017, Akasha found that AlphaBay was mysteriously offline for more than a week. The Wall Street Journal soon broke the news that the site had been taken down by an international law enforcement operation and that its creator and administrator, a French-Canadian man named Alexandre Cazes, had been found dead in a Bangkok jail cell. Akasha saw his business evaporate before his eyes—including $32,000 he had stored in his AlphaBay account—just as he was growing accustomed to the wealth it was creating. “I'm not a hippie anymore,” he thought. “I'm used to this lifestyle. I need money.”

For a moment, he panicked. Then his fear subsided, and he got to work launching Shimshai accounts on all of the remaining dark-web markets, sites with names like Hansa, Wall Street Market, and Dream Market. AlphaBay's refugee customers, too, began to flow to these new drug-buying havens, and Akasha found that his orders crept up again in the days that followed.

By the middle of July, Hansa too was down: It had been the target of an operation by Dutch law enforcement. By all appearances, though, Akasha's luck had held, and he escaped the dragnet. Through the dark-web tumult, demand for DMT never waned. Within a few weeks, Shimshai's orders had returned to their previous record. And Akasha was already thinking about how to level up again.

Chunks of Akasha Song's DMT crystals, each one equivalent to hundreds or even thousands of doses.

After the string of market busts, Akasha was restless and paranoid about keeping his DMT production in one place for too long. After years in Colorado, summer back in Texas, too, had felt unbearably hot. So he and his son began scrolling around Google Earth for a new home, and settled on Lake Tahoe.

They rented a house on the north shore of the lake with a backyard patio surrounded by redwood trees stretching into Tahoe National Forest. The landlord let Akasha pay the rent in bitcoin. This time he brought Coinflip and another friend with him to live and work in the house from the start. They set up DMT production in the garage at more than twice the scale of the lab in Colorado, ultimately expanding to 10 of the same 35-gallon barrels. Two competent lieutenants were now taking much of the work off Akasha's hands, and he could settle into a lifestyle befitting the crypto millions rolling in.

Akasha and his son spent their days hiking, rock climbing, slacklining, and water-skiing in the ultra-clear lake, riding his new $150,000 G-Wagon to any of three ski resorts within a 20-minute drive, or partying with the locals—who all seemed to be rich, retired, and not very interested in how anyone had made their money. When someone did ask, Akasha would simply answer “bitcoin,” which was enough to end the conversation (and which, he points out, was technically true).

Akasha spent his millions as fast as they arrived. His new chemistry setup could manufacture enough product fast enough that sometimes, between batches, he left his friends to ship out the group's stock of DMT while he traveled the world for weeks at a time. He flew to Vietnam and Thailand, where he ran through Shimshai's orders on his laptop while getting a massage in the Phi Phi Islands. He took his son snowboarding in Switzerland and scuba diving in Maui.

On another trip to the Hawaiian Islands, Akasha was showering in a waterfall, exhausted after hiking a 13-mile trail through a jungle valley on Kauai, when a young, naked woman with brown hair and dark green eyes emerged from the trees and handed him a tamarind. The woman was named Joules—“like the energy unit”—and she invited Akasha to a communal dinner she was serving on the beach. He learned that she lived with a group of hippies in the woods, grew her own food, hunted and killed wild pigs and goats with snare traps and rocks, and mostly hadn't worn clothes for the last year. From then on, Akasha's new long-term goal was to move to Hawaii.

During this new jet-set phase, Akasha says, he was at one point stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents in the San Francisco airport on his way home from the Philippines. They confiscated his electronics without explanation. Akasha was terrified that his charmed life was over. But he had enabled full-disk encryption on his laptop, and his phone offered it by default. The agents let him go, and he never got any hint that they had found anything incriminating on his devices. His sense of invincibility intact, he and his friends got back to work.

Akasha now began to imagine a future in which he could remove himself entirely from the production and sale of DMT and run his operation from afar like a true kingpin. Tahoe was lovely, but inconspicuously obtaining large volumes of naphtha and priority stamps was tough so far from a city. So he started periodically returning to Colorado to build the perfect DMT lab that would allow him to enact his exit strategy and realize his new dream of living in Hawaii.

He started renting a house in Jamestown, just northwest of Boulder, with an enormous garage fitted with more electric power, water, and drainage than he'd ever found before—he assumed it was from a previous cannabis-growing operation. At a festival in Idaho a few years earlier, Akasha had met a chemist who recrystallized minerals and made Eastern medicine tinctures in his own lab. Now Akasha paid him a five-figure fee for advice on his DMT operation.

Why, the chemist immediately asked, was Akasha siphoning off solvent and throwing it away when he could simply use a distiller to vaporize the naphtha and recondense it in another vat, ready to use again? Akasha's days of hunting for hundreds of gallons of solvent and then searching again for places to dump it were over. He bought an industrial-grade distiller with a glass window on the condenser and delighted in watching the clean naphtha rain down inside it, ready to use again.

That distillation process would leave behind a cake of DMT at the bottom of the distiller with only a small residue of solvent. The chemist introduced Akasha to a method for shortcutting hours of further drying with a piece of lab equipment called a Büchner funnel—a kind of tapered cup with a micron filter at the bottom over a glass flask. With some suction applied to a side hole in the flask, Akasha could pull most of the remaining solvent out through the filter, leaving the crystals behind. Akasha eventually spent around $150,000 implementing the chemist's recommendations and also upgrading his lab with his own innovations, like an automated stirring system that switched on electric drills to stir all the mixing tanks simultaneously.

When the chemist visited, he would give Akasha detailed specifications about pressure and temperature settings and suggest Akasha write them down. “Grab a notebook,” he'd tell Akasha. “I'm not going to answer your questions on the phone later.”

But Akasha somehow remembered it all, he says. “No one ever does that,” the chemist, who asked not to be identified, remembers thinking, impressed by Akasha's rare combination of an engineer's intelligence and a drug dealer's appetite for risk. “He's really smart, and he has the balls to do this shit. This dude is something else.”

A distiller filled with DMT solution inside of one of Akasha Song's labs.

At its peak, Akasha's new and improved lab would produce a 5-kilo glass carboy of DMT every three days—as much as a million doses a month.

By 2018, too, he had found a source for jurema bark who would deliver thousands of pounds of it to him in person—Akasha never figured out who he got it from—avoiding the risk of having it shipped through the mail. Around the same time, a friend of Akasha's with a marijuana growing business asked if he could buy in to the DMT operation. Akasha worked out a deal in which this new partner would fully take over production and sales, and they would move the entire lab into a barn the partner owned on a 40-acre ranch in Evergreen, Colorado. Akasha believed he had fulfilled the Rich Dad, Poor Dad ideal: He could now fully extract himself from the daily grind of his own businesses while still pulling in profits. It was time to move to Hawaii.

Akasha and Coinflip rented a house on a bluff in Maui, three doors down from the home of the actor Owen Wilson. Akasha and his son would swim with dolphins and sea turtles and catch lobster in the warm water just beyond their front yard. Looking for a clean source of income, they had the idea of starting a motorcycle rental company. They never got it off the ground but nonetheless filled the driveway with seven motorcycles, along with Akasha's G-Wagon, shipped from the mainland. Akasha himself bought a gleaming white Harley-Davidson Road King.

While Coinflip handled the Shimshai account, Akasha did little other than collect bitcoin and pay everyone their share. For once, there was no DMT production at this new house, so Akasha felt free for the first time to host massive parties, inviting the entire neighborhood over for taco Tuesdays and spending tens of thousands of dollars on sound systems and DJ equipment. He felt he had finally obtained the life he wanted: the money and the total freedom of a hands-off psychedelics kingpin in paradise.

Then one afternoon Akasha saw that his phone had six missed calls from his partner back in Colorado, the one now running his DMT production. Annoyed at the interruption, he didn't call back. Then came a text message with a link to what appeared to be a local news story.

Akasha tapped the link and found a live video of a huge barn fire in Evergreen. Shot from a circling helicopter, the videostream showed 25 firefighters working to extinguish flames rising into the sky from the burning building, surrounded by pines and snow.

“Oh fuck,” Akasha said slowly to himself. His lab had just exploded.

Naphtha fumes are flammable. When Akasha was running his own lab, he'd cover his mixing barrels with lids that had a hole in the center, just big enough to accommodate the stirring end of a drill, but not the drill itself. In their postmortem of the catastrophe, Akasha and Coinflip determined that their partner in Evergreen had instead created a new setup with plastic tarps cinched down over the mixing vats—and the automated stirring drills inside. When those drills had activated on the day of the blast, one of their motors had created a spark.

The lab tech running production at the time had been just a few feet away from the vat that ignited. He saw a 14-foot-tall pillar of flame shoot up, slamming the tarp into the ceiling with a crack. As he looked for a fire extinguisher, the wood rafters of the barn were already alight. He realized the blaze was out of control, scrambled to pull propane tanks out of the barn that he feared would explode and kill firefighters, then fled.

The ensuing inferno was hot enough that any evidence of the lab's purpose seemed to have burned away. Police searched the house on the same property the next day, but the lab tech had managed to move their stockpile of jurema bark. No one was immediately charged. For months to come, Akasha and Coinflip came to believe that perhaps the cops had hit a dead end. Akasha gave his Evergreen partner $10,000 to get a lawyer, then cut ties with him.

Still, Akasha's days as a hands-off drug boss in Hawaii were over. He knew he needed to either retire from the business altogether or double down. There was never really any question. He made plans with Coinflip to rebuild Shimshai's DMT production pipeline from a new lab near Portland, across the Washington border, an area far from Evergreen where they had friends.

For the next months, Coinflip ran the new Washington lab while Akasha continued his dream life on Maui. At one party there, he ran into Joules, the woman he'd met under a waterfall in Kauai a couple of years earlier. She had left behind her hippie community in the jungle—and was now wearing clothes. He invited her to his house the next day and later took her for a ride on his motorcycle.

“That was the moment I fell in love with him,” she says. “Just holding on to him, riding through the most beautiful landscape in our country, and him just tilting his head and talking to me over his shoulder and telling me all about his life.” But not his life as Shimshai.

Joules never went home. She was fascinated by Akasha's preternatural confidence, his wealth, and his wide-eyed appetite for adventure. “He lives in a way I had never experienced with anyone else,” she says. “He just wanted everything, now. The biggest, the best, the wildest, the craziest.”

Around the same time, an old contact had reached out to ask Akasha if he could buy DMT from him wholesale. To Akasha's amazement, this buyer wanted entire kilograms of DMT at a time. To help Coinflip manage that level of production, he'd need to fly back to Portland.

It had only been days since he and Joules reconnected. They weren't yet officially a couple and had yet to kiss or even hold hands. But he decided to invite her to come along. Sitting in his Maui house, he turned to her and asked, “Do you know what I do for a living?”

Akasha Song and his then-girlfriend, Joules, in Kalalau Valley, Kauai.

Joules joined Akasha on the mainland, unconcerned about—or even intrigued by—what she was learning of his dark-web business. “The way that he said it so confidently, as if he had nothing to fear, was kind of calming,” she remembers. “He has a very playful way of talking about serious things that's very disarming.”

In reality, Akasha's business was barreling into another crisis. Not long after the wholesale DMT operation got started, law enforcement seized a 3-kilo shipment in the mail. Akasha and Coinflip now not only owed their wholesale customer close to $60,000 but had to reckon with the possibility that the feds could tie them to a shipment of serious weight.

For Akasha, it was time for a strategic pause. For Coinflip, it was time to get out. In fact, since the lab explosion, he'd become spooked enough by Akasha's taste for risk that he decided to walk away entirely. “It was really great, and then it was really not OK anymore,” Coinflip says. “Bad things started happening, the greed took over, and I had to cut him off.”

Joules helped Akasha pack up his Washington lab equipment and put it into storage, then move out of his Maui house. He temporarily shut down his Shimshai accounts. For the months to come, Akasha told Joules, they'd voyage across Europe in what he described to her as a grand tour. In fact, he was trying to disappear. They flew to Istanbul, then traveled to Vienna, then Barcelona, crossing borders by land whenever possible to lessen their paper trail. Along the way, they stayed in five-star hotels and ate in Michelin-starred restaurants.

After nearly two months, though, Akasha had gotten no hint that international law enforcement was tracking him. So he decided to get back to work. He and Joules flew to the US, took his lab equipment out of storage, and drove with it in a trailer to Colorado. He reopened his Shimshai accounts, then reconnected with his wholesale customer, apologized for ghosting him, and rebuilt his lab in the basement of a house in the town of Morrison. With the help of old friends, he spent the next months making enough DMT to cover the kilos lost in the seizure.

Akasha was surprised, not long after, to get an invitation to meet contacts of his wholesale buyer in person. He declined to describe the details of that meeting or who exactly was there. But he came to believe that the actual customers of the DMT he'd been producing wholesale had been a group he calls “the Family,” an LSD cartel whose history stretches back to the original experiments with acid that first introduced psychedelics to America in the 1950s.

Akasha says that in his meeting with these mysterious new associates, they offered to buy as much DMT as he could produce for the foreseeable future at a rate of $20,000 a kilo.

“Any amount? Fuck,” he says he responded. “I can make a lot.”

“Every time I go to the grocery store, the front parking spot's empty,” Akasha Song says. “And that happens to me in every situation.”

Soon Akasha was selling 10 kilos a month to his wholesale buyer in addition to all his dark-web sales—far more total DMT than he ever put into the world before. He and Joules moved to a house on a 26-acre ranch back in Evergreen, with a creek flowing through it, elk and bears that would wander across the property, and a cavernous garage where he could set up a new lab. Joules helped him with production for a time. When the toxic chemicals got to her, she switched to shipping work. He hired more staff and added another lab in Texas in an attempt to decentralize production and shipping and make his operations harder to track. But he was never again as hands-off as he'd been in Hawaii.

In 2019, Dream Market shut down and German police seized the servers of Wall Street Market, which had been operating out of a Cold War–era bunker near the border with Luxembourg. Now Akasha no longer panicked about market takedowns. Instead, he set up Shimshai accounts on more than a dozen smaller markets across the dark web, a collection of sites that together produced as many sales as ever but were far harder for law enforcement to track.

In early 2020, Akasha heard through friends about more troubling news: His partner with the burned-down barn had been criminally charged. The rumor, at least, was that police had learned Akasha's name, too—whether from clues at the crime scene or from his partner in Evergreen. Coinflip reached out to Akasha, to whom he had otherwise stopped speaking, and they met at a restaurant. Coinflip warned Akasha to “just stop, bro”—to give up his DMT operation and go legit before the feds caught up with him. But nothing Akasha's old friend said could persuade Akasha to relinquish his empire. “I was drunk on money,” he says.

When Covid lockdowns hit, Akasha's wholesale arrangement abruptly ended. Whatever venues the people he called the Family had used to move his DMT had been shut down, they told him. Their sales had dried up. Akasha lost a major source of revenue, but he preferred the dark web's far higher margins anyway. By this time, DMT powder and DMT vape pens were still Shimshai's biggest products, but he also sold changa—herbs laced with DMT—LSD, MDMA, and mushrooms.

Then in 2021 came another problem, one that threatened Shimshai's operation at a more fundamental level: His bark source texted Akasha without explanation to say he was out of the business. Then he disappeared.

Without this key ingredient, Shimshai's production was paralyzed. Akasha began frantically searching for a new source. At one point, he simply googled “jurema.” The results showed a town in the northeast of Brazil with that very name. A bit more reading confirmed his guess: This was indeed a place where DMT literally grew on trees. He knew no one in Brazil and spoke no Portuguese. On a wild impulse, he bought a plane ticket to Rio De Janeiro.

When Akasha arrived in Brazil, he struck up a conversation with the Russian owner of the hostel he was staying at, asking him who might sell jurema preta. The hostel owner showed him an app called Mercado Libre, a kind of Brazilian eBay, where vendors were offering the bark to domestic customers. Akasha asked him to put in an order on one of those vendor pages, then used his account to message the seller and ask to meet. A few days later, he and a new associate, José, stepped out of a Fiat truck and into a forest of gnarled jurema.

A jurema tree in the Brazilian town of Jurema.

José walked with him through the trees to a shack where pounds and pounds of jurema inner root bark were laid out to dry on tarps the size of a living room floor. Some workers were feeding strips of it into a grinder. Elsewhere, workers were bagging the powder up for José to take back to the coastal city of Salvador.

Akasha and José negotiated a price of $26 per kilo, including shipping, compared to the $100 per kilo Akasha had been paying his source in Colorado. Then he shocked José by ordering a thousand kilos on the spot.

Before his flight home, he saw the full haul, ready to be shipped: 40 boxes of powdered bark, weighing more than a ton in total. He had only been in Brazil for 10 days, and he now had a direct connection to all the DMT-producing plant life he could ever need.

“He was just living this untouchable lifestyle. To be fair, he is one of the luckiest people I've ever met. But luck runs out.”

For the next year, as Shimshai sold DMT at a new, fatter profit margin, Akasha and Joules lived larger than ever. They moved again and again, always to bigger, nicer houses, eventually ending up in a multimillion-dollar home near the main street of Boulder, right at the foothills of the Flatiron mountains. Joules got used to demanding granite countertops and walk-in closets. “I went through a crazy metamorphosis,” she says, “from dirty hippie to well-kept queen.”

Akasha picked out dresses for Joules and Louis Vuitton jackets for himself. In spite of pandemic restrictions, they traveled almost nonstop. At one point she told him she had never eaten actual Mexican tacos, and he booked them next-day flights to Puerto Vallarta so she could try the tacos al pastor at his favorite taco stand. They paid bands to play at their home and threw enormous parties, sometimes so out of control that they resorted to hiring security to man the door.

Just as Akasha was hitting the zenith of his DMT production and profits—he now had so much access to jurema bark that he even resold it online at a markup—he was also restlessly looking for his next hustle. He dreamed of moving production to Peru or Brazil, countries where jurema was ubiquitous and he could legally set up giant labs.

Pallets of jurema bark, powdered and shredded, in a storage room at one of Akasha Song's production facilities.

Yet he'd begun to fear, at the same time, that the dark web's days were numbered as a venue for drug sales. A collection of federal agents known as Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement, or JCODE, had announced sweeping arrests of dozens of dark-web vendors in 2019 and 2020 without ever spelling out how their targets were identified. Akasha didn't sell opioids. But he was haunted by a mental image of these agents in a room somewhere working feverishly to track down people like him.

Somehow, all of this led Akasha to adopt his most brazen business model yet. If he was going to smuggle DMT into the US from a lab in Peru or Brazil, he began to think, why not just become an outright drug smuggler?

He had made connections in Amsterdam and began to query them about buying drugs wholesale there, in person. Soon he and some friends were simply flying back and forth to the Netherlands to buy kilos of ketamine, making around $100,000 with every trip. The first visit happened to coincide with a wine festival, so Akasha came up with the idea of dissolving the ketamine he purchased in water, hiding it in wine bottles, then decanting and dehydrating it once he'd got it across US borders.

He says he and his friends successfully pulled off more than a half dozen of these runs to Europe and back and were never caught. Any vestige of Akasha's original mission to become the Johnny Appleseed of DMT had disappeared. Now he was, instead, a fully diversified drug dealer.

Joules could sense that Akasha was feeling the risks of his profession more than ever: She says he sometimes seemed uncharacteristically anxious or slept badly, and they began to lose friends who could feel the danger Akasha was courting.

“I think everyone could see the roller coaster coming to an end,” Joules says. “He was just living this untouchable lifestyle. To be fair, he is one of the luckiest people I've ever met. But luck runs out.”

One day in April of 2022, not long after Akasha and Joules had returned to Boulder from a trip to Europe, he got a text message from his cousin who lived just outside Houston. “Hey! FedEx just left a bunch of boxes outside,” she wrote. “From Brazil.”

The shipment contained nearly 200 kilos of jurema tree bark from José—nine heavy boxes sitting at his cousin's front door. She and Akasha had an arrangement: He paid her to serve as a shipping point for the bark, which would then be picked up by another person and taken to a sprawling production lab in a garage across the city. But this particular shipment was unexpected. José had sent it as a freebie after Akasha complained about sloppy packaging on previous bark orders and threatened to switch to a new source in Peru. Usually he had José ship to a fake name. But this unsolicited package was addressed to “Akasha, Raw Brazil Cosmetics.”

“Wow,” Akasha texted back. “What a freaking surprise.”

An evidence photo of the phone of Akasha Song's cousin, showing a picture of bags of powdered jurema bark that had been delivered to her doorstep.

He called his “cook” in Houston, a man who goes by the name Blake Puzzles—the same friend who had first taken him to the String Cheese Incident concert near Denver that had changed the course of his life a decade earlier, now a member of the Shimshai operation. Puzzles got in his van, a Japanese-import Nissan Homy, and drove over to make the pickup.

When he arrived at the cousin's house, Puzzles noticed that a black Dodge Caravan was parked on the street nearby with one wheel up on the curb, which struck him as a bit strange. Feeling nervous, he moved quickly to pack the bark boxes into his van and drove off, heading for the lab.

A few minutes later, Puzzles noticed not one but two Chevy Tahoes in the rearview mirror. They seemed to be following him. Spooked, he pulled into the parking lot of a grocery store. His van was immediately surrounded by at least a dozen vehicles, out of which emerged local police and an even more alarming badge: Department of Homeland Security. They cuffed Puzzles, took his phone, drove him to an unmarked building, and left him in a cinder-block room with a two-way mirror.

The entire delivery and pickup, Puzzles and Akasha would later learn, had been a sting. Federal investigators had intercepted the jurema bark boxes on their way from Brazil, delivered them to Akasha's cousin, and then paid her a visit in which they strongly suggested she cooperate with them to avoid prosecution. All but one of the boxes Puzzles had picked up were in fact full of sand they'd swapped out for the bark. He'd been watched since he left his home.

In that cinder-block room, Puzzles was questioned by a Homeland Security agent. When the agent asked Puzzles if he knew who “Akasha” was, he answered that Akasha was a blonde girl who'd flashed him after a show he played with his band at a music venue a few days prior. As Puzzles told it, Akasha had then texted him to ask that he pick up some boxes for her. He'd agreed, naturally, in the hopes of getting laid.

The agent suggested to him that this story was, in fact, bullshit. He offered Puzzles a chance to cooperate. Puzzles responded that he didn't know what the agent was talking about. After what felt like an hour, he was released. He ran several miles back to his van in the midst of a rainstorm and drove to a friend's house.

As Puzzles' arrest and interrogation unfolded, meanwhile, Akasha had gotten a phone call from his cousin. She asked him why cops had swarmed her home. Akasha, rattled, insisted that the bark he'd shipped to her was legal. It was just what he did with it that was illegal. “What the hell you think I've been doing for my whole life, the last, like, 10 years?” he told her on the phone. “You know what I do.”

In fact, agents were still there, in his cousin's home, listening in on the call, which she had made at their instruction.

Akasha told his cousin not to talk to the cops—not knowing she already had—and promised to pay for her lawyer. He advised her to delete every communication they had ever had. Then he hurriedly put Shimshai into “vacation mode” across all the dark web markets. “We are closed,” he later wrote on the profile pages. “Hurry and leave before the AI gets you.”

Soon after, he got a call from Puzzles, who had ridden his bicycle to a Verizon store to get a new phone and to have the phone carrier remotely wipe the one seized by the feds. Both men were deeply anxious, in damage control mode. But it was just bark, after all, wasn't it? Not actual DMT. And maybe, they told each other, the agents had bought Puzzles' story.

They had not bought it. In reality, they had been closing in on Akasha for years.

Homeland Security, court documents would later show, had first learned the name Shimshai in a tip shared with the agency in 2017. The source, who has never been revealed, went as far as linking that secret handle to a PO Box in Nederland, Colorado, which was connected to the address where Akasha, his housemates, and Oliver the ring-tailed lemur had lived.

For the department, an upstart DMT dealer was less of a priority than the dark web's purveyors of cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. But after that tip, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) created an alert for the name Akasha Song. Four years later, in the fall of 2021, when José mistakenly shipped a kilogram of bark from Brazil to a customer in Brooklyn with Akasha's phone number on it, the alert was triggered—just as it would be again six months later when José sent the shipment to Akasha's cousin.

Those alerts were enough to persuade Kevin Vassighi, an investigator who had joined HSI's Denver field office in 2020, to check out Shimshai's accounts on the dark web. Vassighi, a central-casting federal agent with a square jaw, square shoulders, and a high-and-tight haircut, was surprised by the variety and scale of Shimshai's psychedelic sales. He noted that the dealer sometimes used the avatar of Rafiki, the monkey from The Lion King, and connected that image with local news articles about Akasha's lemur. Vassighi was particularly disturbed to see Shimshai offering DMT vape pens. Vapes, in Vassighi's mind, were for teenagers. “That indicated to me that he was selling to a more youthful audience,” Vassighi says. “We're trying to protect kids.”

A cryptocurrency tracing chart used as evidence to support Akasha Song's criminal charges.

By the spring of 2022, HSI was tracking the location of Akasha's phone, following him as he drove his new Tesla around Boulder, and watching his home from a camera on a nearby telephone pole. Agents had dug through Akasha's trash and found Shimshai's trademark DMT packaging, the logo of a head with a rainbow pouring out of it. And despite Akasha's alleged attempts at money laundering, they had traced his cryptocurrency to show what they believed to be transactions indirectly flowing into Akasha's account on the crypto payment service BitPay from half a dozen dark-web markets.

“He has a crunchy vibe. He has a lot of money. He doesn't seem to go to work,” Vassighi recalls thinking. “A lot of stuff was pointing us in the direction of Joseph Clements”—enough that by June of that year they'd obtained a warrant to search his home.

When Akasha heard the banging on the door, he was just sitting down in his bedroom to eat some pad thai and watch Netflix. He and Joules had been fighting, so she was decompressing alone upstairs. She ran down to the first floor to see who was making such a commotion.

By then, Akasha had a sense of exactly who had come knocking. He looked over to the couch and considered the two long, flat safes under it: One was full of money. The other was full of drugs. He grabbed the one full of drugs and quickly ran into the unfinished space over the garage. He hurriedly hid the safe under the insulation there. Inside was changa, DMT powder and vape pens, ketamine, LSD, MDMA, and mushrooms.

A box of Shimshai's DMT vape cartridges.

Then he went back to his bedroom, picked up his takeout container of pad thai, and began to slowly walk down the stairs, trying to affect the attitude of a fully unbothered, innocent person. On some level, he felt, his invincibility might still be intact. Maybe, even now, the medicine was protecting him.

He came to the front door and found several rifles pointed at him by men in masks and camouflage. They cuffed him, dragged him outside, and put him in the grass. Joules and a housemate who sometimes worked in Akasha's DMT operation were already laid out on the other side of the yard. Akasha says he caught Joules' eyes from across the lawn, trying to silently signal to her with his expression not to talk to the agents.

The agents and police searched the house for hours. Once the initial entry team had swept the building for anyone still hiding, Vassighi came in to join the search, looking over the interior of Akasha's home appraisingly. “It was definitely on the nicer end of narcotics houses I've entered,” Vassighi says, before adding disdainfully that it “smelled like hippies lived there.”

After scouring the home and seizing all of Akasha's electronic devices—somehow, amazingly, agents never found the stash of drugs Akasha had hidden—Vassighi took each member of the household into a bedroom for questioning, one by one. Joules refused to talk without a lawyer present and was released. Akasha's housemate, on the other hand, spent around 30 minutes in the room with the interrogators. Joules and Akasha would later learn he had told them virtually everything he knew.

Akasha, when it was his turn, also demanded a lawyer. So Vassighi and his fellow agents piled their suspect into an SUV, with Vassighi up front. Throughout, Akasha had maintained a serene calm and was now even ready to joke with his captors. “How about you guys let me out,” he told Vassighi with his usual wide-eyed grin, “and you'll never hear from me again.”

“You're not getting out of this car,” Vassighi says he responded.

As they drove toward the jail, though, Vassighi says he felt he should keep Akasha talking. He knew he couldn't ask Akasha about anything illegal after he had invoked his Miranda rights. But he still tried to make conversation.

“Hey man,” he asked, thinking of a genuine question that had been in his head since he first entered Akasha's house. “Where's the lemur?”

Akasha was denied bail. Prosecutors pointed out that he'd traveled to 15 countries in just the last five years and was sure to flee the US if he wasn't held in custody. They were right. “If they had given me a bond,” Akasha says, “I would have definitely left.”

He settled into life behind bars. He says his cellmate, for a time, was a biker gang leader named Havoc who had, on the outside, enjoyed mixing DMT with meth, and so took Akasha under his wing. Others would later pay Akasha as much as $100 an hour for offline lessons in using the dark web and cryptocurrency.

Akasha faced felony charges of conspiracy to possess, manufacture, and distribute an illegal drug—specifically about 300 kilos of a Schedule I controlled substance. That was the total weight of the two shipments of bark intercepted by authorities, which was described in the criminal complaint against Akasha as simply “unprocessed DMT.” Akasha learned that, legal though jurema bark may be, this particular quantity of it had been made illegal by his intent to manufacture it into DMT. If convicted of all the charges, Akasha could spend as much as 40 years in prison.

On his attorney's advice, Akasha decided to accept a plea agreement. He says prosecutors floated the possibility of a shorter sentence in exchange for information on his customers, partners, suppliers, or staff, but he refused. Vassighi contends there was little the government didn't already know.

After Akasha had been in jail for six months, awaiting sentencing, his attorney made the argument that likely saved him from spending the rest of his life behind bars: Jurema bark might contain DMT, his lawyer told the court and prosecutors, but was not itself DMT. The real weight of controlled substance in those 300 kilograms ought to be whatever small amount of actual N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Akasha planned to extract.

The Drug Enforcement Administration did its own test to determine what the actual percentage of DMT in Akasha's jurema bark had been. The answer: less than 1 percent. (Akasha privately scoffed that his labs could have gotten much more than that out of the bark, but he didn't argue.) Suddenly the weight of illegal drugs at the core of his indictment dropped from around 300 kilos to roughly 3.

Even after that stunning win, Akasha might still have faced decades in prison. But he'd had another incredible stroke of good fortune: The state of Colorado, where Akasha was being tried, had just voted to decriminalize a broad swath of psychedelics, including psilocybin, mescaline—and DMT. For so many years of his career as a drug dealer, he'd been told the medicine was protected by a higher power. Now, with a kind of uncanny timing, it actually was.

By the day of Akasha's sentencing in February of 2023, the substance he'd been convicted of manufacturing and selling was no longer a crime to use or own in his home state. Technically, that change didn't apply to selling and shouldn't have made any difference to Akasha's federal case. In reality, he says, it entirely changed the tone of both the prosecution and the judge in the hearing that determined his fate.

He was given 24 months, a third of which he'd already served. After another eight months, he was out on probation. Even Akasha himself couldn't believe his luck.

If Akasha Song could go back in time and do it all again, he says, he would.

In February of this year, about 18 months after his release from prison, I meet Akasha Song in a house just down the street from the one where he was arrested. All of the money from his time as a DMT kingpin was spent or seized, so Akasha has mostly been living with his mom in Texas or in an RV since he got out. But he has received permission from his probation officer to meet me here in Boulder, in his natural habitat, where he's staying with a wealthy friend and supporter—a fan of DMT with psychedelic paintings and 5-foot-tall crystals positioned throughout the house. It's just after 7 pm when we sit down together at the kitchen counter, and the sun has set behind the mountains.

“I'm not going to die and go to hell or die and go to heaven. It's a play. It's just God having a good time being everything.”

We talk through his biography, including episodes I thought might be too sensitive to speak about on the phone, from his father's abuse, to his first wife's death, to his second wife leaving him with their daughter, to his time in prison. After five years together, he and Joules have broken up too. Joules told me that, after Akasha's arrest, she found out she was pregnant. Alone and terrified about the future, she had an abortion that he didn't learn about until later. He has yet to forgive her.

He shares each of these chapters in his life story with the same open, cheerful equanimity. I point out that it all seems to contradict his notion of himself as invincible, the sense of spiritual protection he has maintained in his role as medicine man. In reality, he's had a pretty rough life.

He disagrees. “Every time I go to the grocery store, the front parking spot's empty,” Akasha says, grinning. “And that happens to me in every situation. Right before I get sentenced, they change the law. What the fuck?” If he could go back in time and do it all again, he says, he would.

I ask him where he thinks that inhumanly optimistic outlook comes from, and he answers that it was part of the lesson of his psychedelic experiences—particularly the breakthrough DMT trip in which the light-based entities invited him to wake up from the dream of his life. That helped embolden him to take ever-greater risks, he says. “I'm not going to die and go to hell or die and go to heaven,” he says. “It's a play. It's just God having a good time being everything.”

As Akasha explains this to me, I nod along despite having very little idea what he's talking about. But he later sends me a YouTube link to an excerpt of a 1969 lecture by Alan Watts, the British writer focused on Eastern philosophy, mysticism, and psychedelics. In the clip, Watts poses a thought experiment: Imagine that you are God and can experience whatever you'd like. After several lifetimes of pure pleasure and wish fulfillment, maybe you would choose to have more adventurous dreams, less and less in your own control, an infinite number of times.

“Finally you would dream where you are now,” Watts says. “You would dream the dream of living the life you are actually living today. That would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices you would have. Of playing that you weren't God.”

This is, in fact, what Akasha means by the name he chose for himself, he tells me in his friend's kitchen: the notion that he and his many DMT customers and his abusive father and Homeland Security Investigations agent Kevin Vassighi and you and I are all facets of God, pretending we are not. That idea, revealed to him by his own homemade N,N,dimethyltryptamine coursing through his brain, changed everything for him. “It helped me just play,” he says. “And that made life so much richer.”

“Even before I had the money, even if I never had the money,” Akasha tells me, smiling, staring at me with the wide, blue eyes of a true believer, “I was free.”

The possibility that data could be inadvertently exposed in a misconfigured or otherwise unsecured database is a longtime privacy nightmare that has been difficult to fully address. But the new discovery of a massive trove of 184 million records—including Apple, Facebook, and Google logins and credentials for accounts connected to multiple governments—underscores the risks of recklessly compiling sensitive information in a repository that could become a single point of failure.

In early May, longtime data-breach hunter and security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered an exposed Elastic database containing 184,162,718 records across more than 47 GB of data. Typically, Fowler says, he is able to gather clues about who controls an exposed database from its contents—details about the organization, data related to its customers or employees, or other indicators that suggest why the data is being collected. This database, however, didn't include any clues about who owns the data or where it may have been gathered from.

The sheer range and massive scope of the login details, which include accounts connected to a large array of digital services, indicate that the data is some sort of compilation, possibly kept by researchers investigating a data breach or other cybercriminal activity or owned directly by attackers and stolen by infostealer malware.

“This is probably one of the weirdest ones I've found in many years,” Fowler says. “As far as the risk factor here, this is way bigger than most of the stuff I find, because this is direct access into individual accounts. This is a cybercriminal's dream working list.”

Each record included an ID tag for the type of account, a URL for each website or service, and then usernames and plaintext passwords. Fowler notes that the password field was called “Senha,” the Portuguese word for password.

In a sample of 10,000 records analyzed by Fowler, there were 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. That sample—just a tiny fraction of the total exposure—also included Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitter, WordPress, and Yahoo logins, among many others. A keyword search of the sample by Fowler returned 187 instances of the word “bank” and 57 of “wallet.”

Fowler, who did not download the data, says he contacted a sample of the exposed email addresses and heard back from some that they were genuine accounts.

Aside from individuals, the exposed data also presented potential national security risks, Fowler says. In the 10,000 sample records there were 220 email addresses with .gov domains. These were linked to at least 29 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom.

While Fowler could not identify who had put the database together or where the login details originally came from, he reported the data exposure to World Host Group, the hosting company it was linked to. Access to the database was quickly shut down, Fowler says, although World Host Group did not respond to the researcher until after it was contacted by WIRED.

Seb de Lemos, CEO of World Host Group, tells WIRED in a statement that the company operates systems for more than 2 million websites. The database Fowler found, though, is “an unmanaged server” hosted on World Host Group's infrastructure and fully controlled by a customer.

“It appears a fraudulent user signed up and uploaded illegal content to their server,” de Lemos wrote in the statement. “The system has since been shut down. Our legal team is reviewing any information we have that might be relevant for law enforcement.”

De Lemos says that the company is in touch with Fowler and has made improvements to its reporting system. “Whilst we cannot share customer-specific details with WIRED, we will fully cooperate with the appropriate law enforcement authorities and, where appropriate, share all relevant customer data with them.”

Though the database has now been secured—and ultimately taken down entirely—it is not clear whether anyone other than Fowler accessed the trove while it was still live. As with any exposed database, the concern is that sensitive data could be stolen and abused. And in this case, there is a particularly urgent risk of logins being exploited in fraud, to steal additional information, or even to breach other organizations.

Fowler says that while he does not know for certain, he suspects that the data was compiled by attackers using an infostealer.

“It is highly possible that this was a cybercriminal,” he says. “It's the only thing that makes sense, because I can't think of any other way you would get that many logins and passwords from so many services all around the world.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Who's to Blame When AI Agents Screw Up?","https://www.wired.com/story/ai-agents-legal-liability-issues/","Thu, 22 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Over the past year, veteran software engineer Jay Prakash Thakur has spent his nights and weekends prototyping AI agents that could, in the near future, order meals and engineer mobile apps almost entirely on their own. His agents, while surprisingly capable, have also exposed new legal questions that await companies trying to capitalize on Silicon Valley's hottest new technology.

Agents are AI programs that can act mostly independently, allowing companies to automate tasks such as answering customer questions or paying invoices. While ChatGPT and similar chatbots can draft emails or analyze bills upon request, Microsoft and other tech giants expect that agents will tackle more complex functions—and most importantly, do it with little human oversight.

The tech industry's most ambitious plans involve multi-agent systems, with dozens of agents someday teaming up to replace entire workforces. For companies, the benefit is clear: saving on time and labor costs. Already, demand for the technology is rising. Tech market researcher Gartner estimates that agentic AI will resolve 80 percent of common customer service queries by 2029. Fiverr, a service where businesses can book freelance coders, reports that searches for “ai agent” have surged 18,347 percent in recent months.

Thakur, a mostly self-taught coder living in California, wanted to be at the forefront of the emerging field. His day job at Microsoft isn't related to agents, but he has been tinkering with AutoGen, Microsoft's open source software for building agents, since he worked at Amazon back in 2024. Thakur says he has developed multi-agent prototypes using AutoGen with just a dash of programming. Last week, Amazon rolled out a similar agent development tool called Strands; Google offers what it calls an Agent Development Kit.

Because agents are meant to act autonomously, the question of who bears responsibility when their errors cause financial damage has been Thakur's biggest concern. Assigning blame when agents from different companies miscommunicate within a single, large system could become contentious, he believes. He compared the challenge of reviewing error logs from various agents to reconstructing a conversation based on different people's notes. “It's often impossible to pinpoint responsibility,” Thakur says.

Joseph Fireman, senior legal counsel at OpenAI, said on stage at a recent legal conference hosted by the Media Law Resource Center in San Francisco that aggrieved parties tend to go after those with the deepest pockets. That means companies like his will need to be prepared to take some responsibility when agents cause harm—even when a kid messing around with an agent might be to blame. (If that person were at fault, they likely wouldn't be a worthwhile target moneywise, the thinking goes). “I don't think anybody is hoping to get through to the consumer sitting in their mom's basement on the computer,” Fireman said. The insurance industry has begun rolling out coverage for AI chatbot issues to help companies cover the costs of mishaps.

Thakur's experiments have involved him stringing together agents in systems that require as little human intervention as possible. One project he pursued was replacing fellow software developers with two agents. One was trained to search for specialized tools needed for making apps, and the other summarized their usage policies. In the future, a third agent could use the identified tools and follow the summarized policies to develop an entirely new app, Thakur says.

When Thakur put his prototype to the test, a search agent found a tool that, according to the website, “supports unlimited requests per minute for enterprise users"" (meaning high-paying clients can rely on it as much as they want). But in trying to distill the key information, the summarization agent dropped the crucial qualification of ""per minute for enterprise users.” It erroneously told the coding agent, which did not qualify as an enterprise user, that it could write a program that made unlimited requests to the outside service. Because this was a test, there was no harm done. If it had happened in real life, the truncated guidance could have led to the entire system unexpectedly breaking down.

Thakur also pursued a more complicated project. He developed an ordering system for a futuristic restaurant that could accept custom orders across cuisines. Users could type out their desires—“burgers and fries”—to a chatbot. An AI agent could then research an appropriate price and translate the order into a recipe. It could then pass off the instructions to a cast of robots with differing culinary expertise. Thakur doesn't actually have a commercial kitchen, let alone a single robot, but he developed a simulation to identify pitfalls.

Nine out of 10 times, all went well. Then, there were the cases where “I want onion rings” became “extra onions.” Or requests such as “extra naan” were ignored. Errors tended to appear most often when Thakur tried to jam through orders with more than five items. A worst-case scenario, if this happened in real life, would be misserving someone with a food allergy.

In another prototype Thakur has tried, a shopping comparison agent meant to help users find the best deal came back with a bargain offer from one ecommerce website but incorrectly linked to a product page on a different website, which had a higher price. If the agent were designed to automatically make purchases, a customer would have ended up overspending, Thakur says.

More familiar AI programs such as ChatGPT already make costly errors. Last year, a coupon inadvertently invented by an airline AI chatbot was held to be legally binding. This month, chatbot developer Anthropic had to apologize to a judge for a sloppy AI-generated citation in a court filing. Single-agent systems can also go wrong. Naveen Chatlapalli, a software developer helping companies with agents, says he's seen an HR agent approve leave requests it should have denied and a notetaker agent send sensitive information from meetings to the wrong department. With relatively straightforward programs like these, it's easy to diagnose what went wrong and introduce more human oversight.

Even Thakur's more complex restaurant snafus could be resolved by simply having the customer confirm that the cooking agent has the order correct. But that undermines the principle of limiting human involvement. “We want to save time for our customers,” Thakur says. “That's where it's still making mistakes.” And as far as identifying the origin of any issues that arise, an agent that interprets an order wrong can be as much at fault as a cooking agent that fails to recognize flaws in the request, Thakur says.

A leading hope among developers is that a “judge” agent can start to reign over these systems and identify and remedy errors before they snowball. They are meant to act as the manager that figures out the customer meant onion rings, not extra onions. Mark Kashef, a freelancer on Fiverr who runs an AI strategy company called Prompt Advisers, worries that companies are starting to overengineer early systems with an unnecessary number of agents—no different than bloating inside a human bureaucracy. This month, Kashef told an African government seeking his advice to focus on developing a single agent that could save it the most time.

But as the tech industry pursues more elaborate AI systems, someone will have to settle who pays when a customer demands a refund for a botched food order or sues over a more significant misfire. During the recent legal conference in San Francisco, OpenAI's Fireman and other attorneys said existing laws would hold users who issue orders to agents somewhat responsible for the actions of those agents—especially when the users were warned of the agents' actions and limitations.

Legal experts have suggested that people who wish to use agentic systems sign contracts that push responsibility onto the companies supplying the technology. Of course, ordinary consumers can't force giant companies to agree to these terms. If anything, some users may rely on agents to review legalese for them. “There will be interesting questions about whether agents can bypass privacy policies and terms of service” on behalf of users, Rebecca Jacobs, associate general counsel at Anthropic, said at the conference.

Dazza Greenwood, an attorney who has been researching the legal risks of agents, encourages caution. “If you have a 10 percent error rate with ‘add onions,' that to me is nowhere near release,” he says. “Work your systems out so that you're not inflicting harm on people to start with.”

The reality is that users can't kick up their feet and leave it all to the agents just yet.

Politico became one of the first newsrooms last year to win a union contract that included rules on how the media outlet can deploy artificial intelligence. The PEN Guild, which represents Politico and its sister publication, environment and energy site E&E News, is now gearing up for another first. The union's members allege that the AI provisions in their contract have been violated, and they're preparing for a groundbreaking legal dispute with management. The outcome could set a precedent for how much input journalists ultimately have over how AI is used in their newsrooms.

Last year, Politico began publishing AI-generated live news summaries during big political events like the Democratic National Convention and the US vice presidential debates. This March, it debuted a suite of AI tools called Policy Intelligence Assistance for paying subscribers, which were built in partnership with the Y Combinator-backed startup Capitol AI. Politico executive Rachel Loeffler described the initiative at the time as “seamlessly integrating generative AI with our unmatched policy expertise.”

Politico union members, however, allege these tools violated their contract in several ways, and are taking the dispute to arbitration this July. “The company is required to give us 60 days notice of any use of new technology that will materially and substantively impact bargaining unit job duties,” says PEN union chair and E&E public health reporter Ariel Wittenberg. The union claims that it was given neither notice nor an opportunity to bargain in good faith over Politico's AI rollout, and that the tools do work that would ordinarily be done by human staff.

“This isn't just a contract dispute, it's a test of whether journalists have a say in how AI is used in our work. With no federal rules in place, union contracts remain one of the only enforceable frameworks for AI accountability on a national scale,” says Newsguild president Jon Schleuss. (PEN Guild is a unit within Newsguild, one of the most prominent unions for journalists.)

Politico says the publication “takes the obligations under its collective bargaining agreement seriously,” and “will continue to honor those obligations while also rapidly embracing transformative technologies such as AI that will revolutionize how our audience consumes news and information,” according to spokesperson Heather Riley.

Politico's contract stipulates that the publication needs to use AI in a manner that follows the company's standards of journalistic ethics. “We're not against AI, but it should be held to the same ethical and style standards as our political journalists,” says Arianna Skibell, the union's vice chair for contract enforcement, who writes Politico's energy industry newsletter. Some union members question whether there's always appropriate human oversight over the AI content Politico publishes.

In one case, an AI-generated live summary used language around immigration that human writers are not permitted to use, publishing phrases like “criminal migrants” as it covered the vice presidential debates.

“There were also factual errors that the AI inserted that night,” alleges Skibell. For example, she says, the AI credited actions taken by the Biden Administration as things Kamala Harris did. That post was later swapped for replacements without the errors, according to screenshots reviewed by WIRED. “At Politico, you can't just wholly take down articles written by human reporters without going through a series of approvals, all the way up to newsroom leadership. That did not happen for the AI live summaries,” Wittenberg claims. (Politico did not comment on the specifics of the union's allegations.)

Union members say they believe the AI-generated posts were handled in a way that violates Politico's correction and takedown policies. They also allege that one of Politico's paid premium AI tools for generating policy reports has spewed out incorrect information in the past. Politico's human reporters broke the news in 2022 that the Supreme Court had voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, but a report on abortion rights generated by the Policy Intelligence Assistance tool in March 2025 was written as though the constitutional right was still in effect.

Politico's experiments with AI are not unique in the journalism industry. The publication's parent company, German media conglomerate Axel Springer, is one of a number of news giants that have entered into multiyear licensing deals with OpenAI, including Vox Media, The Atlantic, and WIRED's parent company Condé Nast.

Artificial intelligence tools have been leveraged by journalists to produce award-winning work. Two recent Pulitzer prize winners, for example, disclosed using machine learning and AI in their reporting process. In other cases, though, AI features have gone awry, like when tech news site CNET published error-addled AI-generated articles that were deemed a “journalistic disaster” by The Washington Post.

As media companies race to integrate even more powerful and pervasive AI tools into newsrooms, sometimes in direct collaboration with tech companies, the writers and reporters on staff frequently have little say over how the technology is adopted. Politico's fight could help change that by setting a precedent across the industry. “AI decisions have been few and far between,” says labor lawyer Alek Felstiner. “That would magnify the importance of an arbitrator's decision beyond what it would normally carry, because it's going to be one of the first observed on a critical issue.”

Although this is the first clash of its kind in digital media, the entertainment industry has fought similar battles in recent years as creatives chafed against certain types of AI usage. In 2023, two of Hollywood's biggest unions—the Screen Actor's Guild and the Writer's Guild of America West—won hotly contested contracts that included AI protections. This week, SAG-AFTRA filed an unfair labor practice charge against a production company associated with the video game Fortnite for using an AI-generated replica of late actor James Earl Jones' Darth Vader voice.

“We do remain hopeful that we can come to some kind of agreement,” says Skibell. “But we're also ready for a fight.”

Dyson has an extensive catalog of vacuums. The company's ecosystem is so vast that it's divided into sub-models (like the V-series, Detect, Ball Animal, and more), each tailored to specific cleaning needs. Now, the Dyson universe is officially expanding with the debut of a new model, the PencilVac—Dyson's slimmest and most powerful cordless vacuum to date.

For such a slender vacuum, Dyson managed to squeeze in a ton of noteworthy features. The PencilVac comes with redesigned cleaner heads, the fastest and smallest motor yet, and a new filtration system. It's also the first cordless vacuum that connects to the MyDyson companion app, giving you access to additional settings and alerts on your phone. It's currently available in Japan and will expand to Korea next. It won't be available in the US until next year, and pricing information was not available as of press time.

Here's everything you need to know.

At first glance, the PencilVac looks super similar to the Omni-Glide: It's slim, lightweight, cordless, and has brush bars on both sides. And that's not a coincidence. While this isn't the second-generation Omni-Glide (the original is no longer sold through Dyson and tough to find at third-party retailers), the PencilVac does take its place as the new slender, omnidirectional vacuum in the company's lineup.

To demonstrate just how thin the PencilVac is, we'll have to break it down into measurements. The handle itself is 38 mm, while the cleaner head flattens to 95 mm. So, it's designed to access tight gaps and under low furniture. To help achieve this, Dyson nixed its cyclone technology, which means there's no longer a clunky mechanism sitting at the top of the vacuum.

In other models, the cyclones are located above the dustbin, where they use centrifugal force to separate dust and debris into the bin while allowing clean air to flow through the motors and filters. The technology not only replaces the need for vacuum bags and traditional filters but also helps to capture more microscopic dust. The PencilVac, on the other hand, features a new two-stage linear dust-separation system.

“This works by funneling the air and dust into a small-diameter tube, which maintains a high velocity as it travels over a fine stainless-steel mesh. This high-velocity airflow scrubs the mesh clean as it separates the dirt entering the bin, so only fine particles are let through and onto the pleated PTFE filter,” Sam Cole, design manager at Dyson, told WIRED.

As the dust is separated into the bin, it's automatically compressed within the bin to maximize capacity. Technically, the bin has a volume of 0.08 L, but Dyson says it can hold five times more than that thanks to the air-compressing technology. With this redesigned bin comes a new ejection system that empties the dirt and wipes the bin clean simultaneously. It's easily removable too, so you can clean it whenever needed.

But what ultimately allows for such a slim profile is the new motor. The PencilVac comes equipped with a new Hyperdymium 104k motor, which is built on the same one found in the company's hair tools: the Supersonic r hair dryer (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and the Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends). With a diameter of 28 mm, it's now the smallest and fastest motor the company offers.

It has a spin speed of up to 140,000 revolutions per minute with a suction power of 55 air watts (AW). That means its motor spins slightly faster than the Gen 5 Detect, the current top-of-the-line cordless vacuum in Dyson's lineup, which has a spin speed 135,000 RPM. However, the Gen 5 Detect does have significantly more powerful suction at 262 AW.

Attached to the PencilVac are four conical brush bars called Fluffycones. With two brush bars on each side, the front cone rotates in one direction while the rear brush goes the opposite way. The four bars jut out at the sides too; that way, it cleans in all directions with every pass on the floor.

It also shoots out green lasers from both the front and back of the cleaner head to illuminate dust, making it easier to spot particles that aren't as visible to the naked eye. But unlike Dyson's Detect line, which also includes lasers, it doesn't have a piezo sensor, which is what allows that specific lineup of vacuums to automatically increase suction power based on what it's picking up.

In addition to dust and debris, this vacuum is ideal for picking up hair. The nylon bristles are angled to ensure that strands migrate to the side of the cleaner head rather than getting wrapped around or tangled in the brush bar. So, you don't have to pull the hair out or resort to cutting it off with scissors.

As mentioned earlier, you can also connect it to the MyDyson app. This provides step-by-step guidance on how to care for the vacuum while also giving you access to additional settings and maintenance alerts in real time.

I had a chance to see and test out the PencilVac during an in-person media briefing at Dyson's SoHo store location in New York City and was surprised at just how much the redesigned build makes a difference. Without a dustbin on top, it feels less top-heavy and unwieldy, which will certainly make a difference for longer cleaning sessions. There's no trigger either, which makes it that much more comfortable to use. Instead, Dyson integrated an LCD screen on the handle that displays cleaning modes and run time.

I used it to clean up a small mess of Cheerios, cookie crumbs, and hair in only a few seconds, as all four brush bars worked simultaneously to pick everything up quickly. I'm a huge fan of the LEDs on both sides, because it means I can spend less time flipping the vacuum around to beam light on certain spots the way I do with my V12 Detect (8/10, WIRED Recommends).

As with all of Dyson's cordless vacuums, it converts into a hand vac. Each PencilVac comes with a rotating combination crevice tool for cleaning in between areas and conical hair screw tool for cleaning couches and mattresses. The slimmer, longer build makes it better for reaching higher and lower spots, but it's also easier to use one-handed.

I was excited to see that it comes with a floor dock instead of a mount. The vacuum and accessories conveniently attach to the dock magnetically, so it's easy to grab and put back. The entire setup looks super neat, too. And it's a far better alternative to having to whip out the power tools to drill the mount on the wall.

My only gripe is battery life, which makes sense for such a small vacuum. Dyson claims up to 30 minutes in Eco mode, which minimizes suction to optimize run time. This means that in Medium or Boost mode, it's even less. You can, however, purchase an extra battery pack and swap it out so that it's technically always charged.

Based on the dustbin capacity and run time, this is definitely a vacuum designed for smaller homes and spaces that consist mainly of hardwood floors. For options that better fit your cleaning needs, I suggest checking out our guide to the Best Dyson Vacuums. Regardless, I hope this marks the start of a new era of dainty vacuums for Dyson—free of chonky dustbins, cyclones, and motors.

During its inaugural developer conference Thursday, Anthropic launched two new AI models that the startup claims are among the industry's best, at least in terms of how they score on popular benchmarks. 

Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, part of Anthropic's new family of models, Claude 4, can analyze large data sets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. Both models were tuned to perform well on programming tasks, Anthropic says, making them well-suited for writing and editing code. 

Both paying users and users of the company's free chatbot apps will get access to Sonnet 4 but only paying users will get access to Opus 4. For Anthropic's API, via Amazon's Bedrock platform and Google's Vertex AI, Opus 4 will be priced at $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output) and Sonnet 4 at $3/$15 per million tokens (input/output).

Tokens are the raw bits of data that AI models work with, with a million tokens being equivalent to about 750,000 words — roughly 163,000 words longer than “War and Peace.”

Anthropic's Claude 4 models arrive as the company looks to substantially grow revenue. Reportedly, the outfit, founded by ex-OpenAI researchers, aims to notch $12 billion in earnings in 2027, up from a projected $2.2 billion this year. Anthropic recently closed a $2.5 billion credit facility and raised billions of dollars from Amazon and other investors in anticipation of the rising costs associated with developing frontier models.

Rivals haven't made it easy to maintain pole position in the AI race. While Anthropic launched a new flagship AI model earlier this year, Claude Sonnet 3.7, alongside an agentic coding tool called Claude Code, competitors including OpenAI and Google have raced to outdo the company with powerful models and dev tooling of their own. 

Anthropic is playing for keeps with Claude 4. 

The more capable of the two models introduced today, Opus 4, can maintain “focused effort” across many steps in a workflow, Anthropic says. Meanwhile, Sonnet 4 — designed as a “drop-in replacement” for Sonnet 3.7 — improves in coding and math compared to Anthropic's previous models and more precisely follows instructions, according to the company. 

The Claude 4 family is also less likely than Sonnet 3.7 to engage in “reward hacking,” claims Anthropic. Reward hacking, also known as specification gaming, is a behavior where models take shortcuts and loopholes to complete tasks.

To be clear, these improvements haven't yielded the world's best models by every benchmark. For example, while Opus 4 beats Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's o3 and GPT-4.1 on SWE-bench Verified, which is designed to evaluate a model's coding abilities, it can't surpass o3 on the multimodal evaluation MMMU or GPQA Diamond, a set of PhD-level biology-, physics-, and chemistry-related questions.

Still, Anthropic is releasing Opus 4 under stricter safeguards, including beefed-up harmful content detectors and cybersecurity defenses. The company claims its internal testing found that Opus 4 may “substantially increase” the ability of someone with a STEM background to obtain, produce, or deploy chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, reaching Anthropic's “ASL-3” model specification.

Both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are “hybrid” models, Anthropic says — capable of near-instant responses and extended thinking for deeper reasoning (to the extent AI can “reason” and “think” as humans understand these concepts). With reasoning mode switched on, the models can take more time to consider possible solutions to a given problem before answering.

As the models reason, they'll show a “user-friendly” summary of their thought process, Anthropic says. Why not show the whole thing? Partially to protect Anthropic's “competitive advantages,” the company admits in a draft blog post provided to TechCrunch.

Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 can use multiple tools, like search engines, in parallel, and alternate between reasoning and tools to improve the quality of their answers. They can also extract and save facts in “memory” to handle tasks more reliably, building what Anthropic describes as “tacit knowledge” over time.

To make the models more programmer-friendly, Anthropic is rolling out upgrades to the aforementioned Claude Code. Claude Code, which lets developers run specific tasks through Anthropic's models directly from a terminal, now integrates with IDEs and offers an SDK that lets devs connect it with third-party applications.

The Claude Code SDK, announced earlier this week, enables running Claude Code as a sub-process on supported operating systems, providing a way to build AI-powered coding assistants and tools that leverage Claude models' capabilities.

Anthropic has released Claude Code extensions and connectors for Microsoft's VS Code, JetBrains, and GitHub. The GitHub connector allows developers to tag Claude Code to respond to reviewer feedback, as well as to attempt to fix errors in — or otherwise modify — code.

AI models still struggle to code quality software. Code-generating AI tends to introduce security vulnerabilities and errors, owing to weaknesses in areas like the ability to understand programming logic. Yet their promise to boost coding productivity is pushing companies — and developers — to rapidly adopt them.

Anthropic, acutely aware of this, is promising more frequent model updates.

“We're […] shifting to more frequent model updates, delivering a steady stream of improvements that bring breakthrough capabilities to customers faster,” wrote the startup in its draft post. “This approach keeps you at the cutting edge as we continuously refine and enhance our models.”

The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared SpaceX to perform the ninth test flight of its Starship rocket system, following back-to-back explosions earlier this year.

The agency said Thursday it is “expanding the size of hazard areas both in the U.S. and other countries” for the flight based on an updated safety analysis provided by SpaceX. The Starship vehicle mishaps from Flights 7 and 8 caused a greater probability of failure of the vehicle and, therefore, a larger hazard area. Hazard areas are, essentially, temporary no-fly zones the FAA establishes when the potential for impact with debris exists. 

The new hazard area drawn up by the FAA covers around 1,600 nautical miles running eastward from Texas and through the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos, where debris from the previous two test flights landed. That's roughly double the size of the hazard area the FAA used for the most recent Starship test flight in March.

The FAA said it is also requiring SpaceX perform the test flight during “non-peak” travel periods, after the previous two Starship mishaps forced the agency to divert dozens of domestic and international flights.

SpaceX has been testing its Starship system for two years now from the launch complex the company built in southern Texas. CEO Elon Musk has claimed the ultimate purpose of the system is to send people to Mars, but the short-term aim for Starship is to allow SpaceX to launch even more of its Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth. SpaceX also says it will use Starship “to provide greater mission capability to NASA and the Department of Defense.”

To date, SpaceX has used its workhorse Falcon 9 to launch Starlink satellites. In fact, most Falcon 9 launches these days are all about Starlink. 

But while Starlink has already become an internet provider in high demand, it's possible there could be an even greater need for launch capacity as the Trump administration reportedly pushes other countries to adopt the service as leverage in its myriad trade wars. 

Musk has also placed members of his Department of Government Efficiency who are reportedly helping the agency test Starlink terminals as a potential solution for the FAA's trouble with the current air traffic control system.

As rumored, OpenAI is expanding its ambitious Stargate data center project to the Middle East. 

On Thursday, the company announced Stargate UAE, which will bring a 1GW data center cluster to Abu Dhabi. OpenAI expects 200MW will go live in 2026, developed with partners including G42, Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco, and SoftBank. 

In a blog post, OpenAI claims that Stargate UAE has the potential to provide AI infrastructure and compute capacity within a 2,000-mile radius.

“This is […] the first partnership under OpenAI for Countries⁠, our new global initiative to help interested governments build sovereign AI capability in coordination with the U.S. government,” writes OpenAI. “Under the partnership, the UAE will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide — giving people across the country the ability to access OpenAI's technology.”

The unveiling of Stargate UAE comes the same week as billionaire Elon Musk said his AI company, xAI, would build the world's first “gigawatt” AI training cluster.

Signal said today that it is updating its Windows app to prevent the system from capturing screenshots, thereby protecting the content that is on display.

The company said that this new “screen security” setting is enabled by default on Windows 11. Signal said that this new feature is designed to protect users' privacy from Microsoft's Recall feature, which was announced last year. Recall captures screenshots of the system continuously to remember all of your activities, so you can scroll back in time to remember what you were looking at.

While the company paused the rollout of the feature last year after backlash, Microsoft started testing it again in April through the Windows Preview Channel. Microsoft has made the feature opt-in and has also added a way to pause it anytime. Signal said that despite these changes, the feature still captures content that may be sensitive.

Signal said that when you are trying to take a screenshot with the new screen security setting enabled, you will just get a blank screen.

The company also warned that when the setting is enabled, some functions, such as screen readers, might not work as intended. You can turn off the setting through Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen security.

The app will show you a warning when you are trying to disable this option, and you will have to click on Confirm to complete the action. This is to prevent you from accidentally turning the feature off while trying to adjust other settings.

“We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn't have to implement a ‘one weird trick' in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools,” Signal said in a blog post.

We got interested in this problem when we saw how often small documentation slip-ups can snowball into huge financial, legal, and even life-threatening outcomes. Sometimes it's just a mistyped medication time or a missing discharge note - basic stuff - but when you're dealing with claims and regulatory rules, a minor error can trigger an automatic denial. Wrong copy-pasting on a discharge note will be uncovered by the insurance provider and will cost stressful appeal. By the time an overworked clinical or compliance team discovers it, it's usually too late to just fix it. Our own experiences hit close to home: Dmitry's family member faced grave consequences from a misread lab result, and Sergey comes from a full medical family that's battled these issues up close.Here's our demo if you'd be interested to take a look - https://www.loom.com/share/add16021bb29432eba7f3254dd5e9a75Our solution is a set of AI agents that plug directly into a clinic or hospital EHR/EMR system. As clinicians go about their daily routines, WorkDone continuously monitors the records. If it spots something that looks off-like a missing signature or a suspicious timestamp- it asks the responsible staff member to double-check and correct it on the spot. We want to prevent errors from becoming big headaches and wasted hours down the road. Technically, this involves running a secure event listener on top of EHR APIs and applying a group of coordinated AI agents that's been loaded with clinical protocols, payor rules, and finetuned on historical claim denials and regulatory guidelines. The moment the model flags a potential error, an agent nudges the user to clarify or confirm. If it's a genuine mistake, we request correction approval from the provider and fix it right away and store an audit trail for compliance. We are extending the approach to finding conflicting medication or prescribed treatments.What's different about our approach from AI tools for hospital revenue management is this focus on near-real-time intervention. Most tools detect errors after the claim has already been submitted, so compliance teams end up firefighting. We think the best place to fix something is in the flow of work itself. 
One common question about the use of AI in the medical/health field is: what if the AI hallucinates or gets something wrong? In our case, since the tool is flagging possible errors and its primary effect is to get extra human review, there's no impact on anything health-critical like treatments. Rather the risk is that too many false positives could waste staff members' valuable time. For pilots, we are starting with read-only mode in which we use API only to retrieve the data, and we are able to see that the QA we built into the agent orchestration layer does a pretty good job for spotting common documentation mistakes even in lengthy charts (for instance, multi-day hospital stay).We're in the early stages of refining our system, and we'd love feedback from the community. If you have ideas on integrating with EHRs, experiences with compliance tools, or just general insights about working in healthcare environments, we're all ears. We're also on the lookout for early users - particularly rehabs, small clinics and hospitals - willing to give our AI a try and tell us where it needs improvement.Thanks for reading, and let us know what you think!

To start, we integrate with Kipu and Athena, just happened that our first clients are rehabs and clinics that use these 2.Good point on the desire to stay in HR for the review workflow, this is our vision that could be achieved with widgets in specific EHRs but this is down the road. Once mistake is identified, we notify clinical professionals via standard communication like emails and also keep a dashboard with the list of 'topics' inside our portal.

1. How often is the cause of a denied insurance claim a documentation error vs an intentional denial from an insurance company (either an automated system or medical reviewer)?2. This feels very conceptually similar to an AI review bot, but the threshold for false positives feels higher. What does the process look like for double checking a false positive in the agent orchestration layer?

1. It really depends on the clinical specialty, but the average is around 25% (e.g. 250M claims denied a year because of documentation mistakes). We work with rehabs where this ratio is above 50%2. It's triple checking -tun the analysis twice and then verify the conclusion, 3+ separate agent calls

We spent six months reporting an unprecedented look at AI's energy demand . Here are a few things I learned.

This week, we published Power Hungry, a package all about AI and energy. At the center of this package is the most comprehensive look yet at AI's growing power demand, if I do say so myself. 

This data-heavy story is the result of over six months of reporting by me and my colleague James O'Donnell (and the work of many others on our team). Over that time, with the help of leading researchers, we quantified the energy and emissions impacts of individual queries to AI models and tallied what it all adds up to, both right now and for the years ahead. 

There's a lot of data to dig through, and I hope you'll take the time to explore the whole story. But in the meantime, here are three of my biggest takeaways from working on this project. 

If you've heard estimates of AI's toll, it's probably a single number associated with a query, likely to OpenAI's ChatGPT. One popular estimate is that writing an email with ChatGPT uses 500 milliliters (or roughly a bottle) of water. But as we started reporting, I was surprised to learn just how much the details of a query can affect its energy demand. No two queries are the same—for several reasons, including their complexity and the particulars of the model being queried.

Here's how MIT Technology Review waded through a mess of data and hidden variables to calculate the individual and collective energy demand from AI.

One key caveat here is that we don't know much about “closed source” models—for these, companies hold back the details of how they work. (OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are examples.) Instead, we worked with researchers who measured the energy it takes to run open-source AI models, for which the source code is publicly available. 

But using open-source models, it's possible to directly measure the energy used to respond to a query rather than just guess. We worked with researchers who generated text, images, and video and measured the energy required for the chips the models are based on to perform the task.  

Even just within the text responses, there was a pretty large range of energy needs. A complicated travel itinerary consumed nearly 10 times as much energy as a simple request for a few jokes, for example. An even bigger difference comes from the size of the model used. Larger models with more parameters used up to 70 times more energy than smaller ones for the same prompts. 

As you might imagine, there's also a big difference between text, images, or video. Videos generally took hundreds of times more energy to generate than text responses. 

As the resident climate reporter on this project, I was excited to take the expected energy toll and translate it into an expected emissions burden. 

Powering a data center with a nuclear reactor or a whole bunch of solar panels and batteries will not affect our planet the same way as burning mountains of coal. To quantify this idea, we used a figure called carbon intensity, a measure of how dirty a unit of electricity is on a given grid. 

We found that the same exact query, with the same exact energy demand, will have a very different climate impact depending on what the data center is powered by, and that depends on the location and the time of day. For example, querying a data center in West Virginia could cause nearly twice the emissions of querying one in California, according to calculations based on average data from 2024.

This point shows why it matters where tech giants are building data centers, what the grid looks like in their chosen locations, and how that might change with more demand from the new infrastructure. 

Our reporting resulted in estimates that are some of the most specific and comprehensive out there. But ultimately, we still have no idea what many of the biggest, most influential models are adding up to in terms of energy and emissions. None of the companies we reached out to were willing to provide numbers during our reporting. Not one.

Adding up our estimates can only go so far, in part because AI is increasingly everywhere. While today you might generally have to go to a dedicated site and type in questions, in the future AI could be stitched into the fabric of our interactions with technology. (See my colleague Will Douglas Heaven's new story on Google's I/O showcase: “By putting AI into everything, Google wants to make it invisible.”)

AI could be one of the major forces that shape our society, our work, and our power grid. Knowing more about its consequences could be crucial to planning our future. 

To dig into our reporting, give the main story a read. And if you're looking for more details on how we came up with our numbers, you can check out this behind-the-scenes piece.

There are also some great related stories in this package, including one from James Temple on the data center boom in the Nevada desert, one from David Rotman about how AI's rise could entrench natural gas, and one from Will Douglas Heaven on a few technical innovations that could help make AI more efficient. Oh, and I also have a piece on why nuclear isn't the easy answer some think it is.

North Korea attempted to launch a new 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday, but the ship suffered a “major accident,” according to state media outlet KCNA, which reports the hull has been damaged. And North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is not happy about it, to say the least.

KCNA reports that Kim called the incident a “serious accident and criminal act caused by sheer carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism which should never occur and could not be tolerated.”

North Korea didn't release photos of the warship or the accident, but South Korean military sources who spoke with that country's Yonhap news outlet said that it appeared the ship “remains partially capsized on the sea.”

“Due to inexperienced command and operational carelessness in the course of the launch, the launch slide of the stern departed first and stranded as the bogie failed to move in parallel, holes made at some sections of the warship's bottom disrupted its balance, and the bow failed to leave the slipway, leading to a serious accident,” KCNA said.

As the Wall Street Journal notes, much of North Korea's naval fleet dates to the era of the Soviet Union, which ceased to exist in 1991. The North Korean military is trying to modernize, successfully launching the Choe Hyon class of guided missile destroyers in April. But Wednesday's failure will be a setback both practically and for morale in a country where military propaganda is vital to compensate for a lack of material progress.

The state media outlet placed blame for Wednesday's ship mishap on a number of different agencies, including the Munitions Industry Department of the WPK Central Committee, the Mechanical Institute of the State Academy of Sciences, and the Central Ship Design Institute. KCNA also blamed Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang, which is where many of North Korea's nuclear scientists are trained.

North Korea is a nuclear power, and the 41-year-old dictator of the country was said to have a strangely warm relationship to President Donald Trump during the American leader's first term. Trump apparently empathized with Kim because the North Korean dictator inherited his role at 27 years old, the same age Trump went off on his own after inheriting millions from his own father.

But North Korea hasn't been in the headlines here in the U.S. nearly as much as during Trump's first term, perhaps because the president is no longer antagonizing Kim with taunts of “little rocket man” and is instead focused on the dismantling of the American government. Trump has been pushing to get his tax bill through Congress, which passed the House on Thursday morning with a narrow vote of 215-214 and is poised to be a huge handout to the wealthiest Americans while slashing funding for Medicaid and food stamps.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reports that North Korea launched several cruise missiles into the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan) on Thursday morning after the failed ship launch, according to Yonhap. It was the first major missile test since May 8.

AI gadgets are back, baby! Or that's what Jony Ive and Sam Altman hope. Well, they may not really hope they're back as much as they hope they're not completely and utterly cooked. ICYMI, Ive and OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, announced in a post-Google I/O keynote bombshell that they are teaming up under a new company called, “io” to make, um… something? Whatever it is, it's apparently worth $6.5 billion of OpenAI's cold, hard AI revolution money.

We truly, genuinely, do not know what the two are making together outside of the fact that it's going to be a piece of hardware (or potentially many), and it will be centered on AI (duh). But just because we can't answer the burning question of what this thing is yet doesn't mean we don't have some clues. For your speculative pleasure, I've gone ahead and aggregated the best hints we have so far, Pepe Silvia-style, to bring us at least one baby step closer to hazarding a guess. Here are the tastiest “phone-killing” AI gadget rumors we have so far.

Lots of the best hints about what we can expect come from a Wall Street Journal report published on Wednesday. According to the report, Altman gave the OpenAI staff a preview of devices in the pipeline and offered a little insight into what they may be like.

Two key elements, according to the WSJ report, are that the gadget will be “fully aware” of a user's “surroundings and life.” That obviously doesn't offer a ton in terms of what shape the form factor will take, but it does point toward the ultimate product having sensors—a camera, microphone, maybe some sort of computer vision? Again, it's hard to say, but to be “aware,” the AI device is going to need some of that stuff. And that's not just me guessing on that front…

Another detail from WSJ is that the gadget will be “unobtrusive,” which could refer, at least in part, to Ive's trademark minimalist aesthetic, but likely hints at a more key aspect of its design—no screen. The screenless aspect seems to be corroborated by an inside scoop from Ming-Chi Kuo, a longtime technology analyst and credible tech rumor source. In a post on X, Kuo writes, “It will have cameras and microphones for environmental detection, with no display functionality.”

That's not surprising given that Ive has gone on record previously talking about how he doesn't exactly love what the iPhone has become since he helped pioneer it with Steve Jobs back in the day. Whether a screenless AI device can actually succeed where others like Humane's Ai Pin failed is a big question, but Ive and Altman seem to be willing to give the idea another go.

My industry research indicates the following regarding the new AI hardware device from Jony Ive's collaboration with OpenAI:1. Mass production is expected to start in 2027.2. Assembly and shipping will occur outside China to reduce geopolitical risks, with Vietnam currently the… pic.twitter.com/5IELYEjNyV

— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) May 22, 2025



One of the strangest details that hit me while sorting through the drip is how Altman is referring to the duo's hardware. According to WSJ, Altman referred to the device as a “companion.” That could really mean anything, but to me, when I see “companion,” my mind gravitates less to a wearable and more to… a robot? I'm not the only one looking in that direction, either. Altman has at least given some indication in the past that he wants to make a “really cute” computer, and this would seem to be a perfect opportunity to do just that.

I hear what Jony Ive and Sam Altman are building is a small robot. A really cute one.@kscalelabs has a really cute one, a little dude about a foot high.

I already gave the founders my credit card so I could be first to get it. $1,000. https://t.co/qeVjSl6VLo

— Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) May 21, 2025



Another interesting bit from Kuo's “industry research” is that the device may ultimately not compute entirely on its own. Kuo writes that “it is expected to connect to smartphones and PCs, utilizing their computing and display capabilities.” If you ask me, that's a bit of a cop-out in terms of being screenless and nowhere near as quirky as the Humane AI Pin's projection interface, but probably a smart idea in the long term for making something that's, uh, functional. There's a lot we can guess at with this nugget, but my brain skates to some kind of agentic AI—think a connective “companion” that you carry around to do computer stuff for you. A thing that connects to the thing to make things less annoying! Sounds convoluted but potentially useful?

One of the most confusing bits of messaging is on the wearable front. Making an AI wearable has proved difficult, if the Ai Pin is any indication, but according to Kuo, there could be a wearable aspect to it. “One of the intended use cases is wearing the device around the neck,” writes Kuo. That seems to contradict some of the initial rumblings from the WSJ, however. According to the WSJ, the device will be “able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.”

Pocket and desk? That doesn't really sound wearable-esque to me, but I guess the answer could be somewhere in between. There are already some AI devices out there—like this AI pendant—that are intended to be worn around your neck, so the idea wouldn't be totally novel, but something tells me Ive and Altman are looking to iterate on existing form factors for AI gadgets. And wearables? So passé.

Google's annual I/O developer conference is back! On May 20 and May 21, the tech giant is expected to drop a boatload of news and updates on everything from Gemini AI to Android 16 to Android XR, its newest platform for augmented and mixed reality headsets and smart glasses. There will be so much AI shoved into every service and device, you might get a headache trying to keep up with the blitz of news.

Lucky for you, Gizmodo is here to help you make sense of it all by sifting through the hours of keynotes and developer sessions to bring you what really matters. As we've been doing since Gizmodo was founded over 20 years ago, we won't be holding back on calling a spade a spade. Senior Consumer Tech Editor Raymond Wong will be on the ground at Google's Mountain View, Calif.-based HQ reporting on everything he can get his hands on.

Keep this page bookmarked Tuesday and Wednesday as Raymond, Senior Writer James Pero, and Consumer Tech Reporter Kyle Barr cut through all the AI noise. We promise we won't use Gemini to live blog for us.

There's something about how… normal Google Beam is that makes it not as mind-blowing as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, it's very high-tech wizardry that captures multiple streams of 2D video and then stitches them into a glasses-free 3D version of a person. As I wrote in my hands-on below:

“Maybe that's a blessing in disguise—there's no shock factor (not for me, at least), which means the Beam/Starline technology has done its job (mostly) getting out of the way to allow for genuine communication.”

—Raymond Wong 

Google Beam Hands-On: The Most Lifelike 3D Video Calling That Didn't Totally Blow Me Away

Google I/O Day 2 is… kind of a ghost town this year. Either everyone is really fatigued from all the AI announcements Google made during its keynote yesterday or attendee numbers are much lower this year? This press room was packed yesterday—today, like four people showed up. I'm the only one inside right now. I can't tell if that's sad or whether I should be sad that I bothered coming in. To be fair, I had to charge up my MacBook Air… —Raymond Wong

Google's new Veo 3 video generator is now available via preview, and people are naturally putting the model to the test. The results are pretty wild, about as wild as OpenAI's Sora at first glance. Now, what exactly people are going to use Veo 3 for is a different question entirely, but I don't really love this example of someone faking a Twitch stream of Fortnite. —James Pero

Listen, I don't dislike AI on principle. There are tons of things that I think it can, and will, do well. I want agentic AI to order my Uber, or do my taxes, or I don't know, streamline the labyrinthine advertisement that is now web search. One thing I do not want AI to do, however, is make movies.

As much as I think tools like Google Flow, which it describes as an AI filmmaker, are a technical feat, I'm not ready to see human creativity take a backseat. My advice? Don't put down the camera quite yet, I think filmmaking the old-school way is here to stay. —James Pero

Google Can't Turn You Into a Filmmaker, but It Can Make Half-Assing It a Lot Easier

I swear I'm not trying to be annoying. But I am very frustrated that Google keeps giving press—or is it just me?!—like less than two minutes to demo its new AI products. Yesterday, I had 90 seconds to try out Gemini on prototype Android XR smart glasses. Minutes ago, I went to try Google Beam, the company's video calling TV hardware that replicates caller and receiver in glasses-free 3D as if they're sitting right in front of you. I sat down, a nice guy named Jerome reached out with his hands and spoke for a few seconds, and then quickly told me that was it. I barely got in a word. I'm writing up my thoughts based on my ridiculously short demo. Check back in a few. —Raymond Wong

I just tried Google Beam, which was actually the older Project Starline setup. It was my first time checking it out. I had like a minute to chat before the guy on the other end was like ""unfortunately we have a set time and this has been great.""

I'm going to say something controversial: Google Glass was not a hit. For anyone that might be unaware of the Google Glass legacy, that's obviously a joke, seeing as how the gadget spawned one of the most memorable pejoratives in consumer tech history; Glasshole.

When the pair of smart glasses launched back in 2013, it was a different world for one, but according to the glasses' creator Sergey Brin, some, um, missteps were also made.

“I definitely feel like I made a lot of mistakes with Google Glass, I'll be honest,” Brin said in a fireside chat during Google's I/O conference yesterday.

“I just didn't know anything about consumer electronic supply chains, really, and how hard it would be to build that and have it at a reasonable price point and managing all the manufacturing and so forth,” he continued.

That admission, however honest, probably doesn't do much to quell the sting Brin must feel seeing the category ascend via Google, Meta, and, sometime soon, maybe Apple and Samsung. Sorry, Sergey, sometimes things just happen too fast, too soon. —James Pero

As Gizmodo's Senior Editor, Consumer Tech, Ray Wong, explained, we did not get a lot of time with Google's XR glasses. We did, however, have enough time to take a little video of what they look like, what we actually got to see, and what the experience of getting to see them was like. Spoiler alert: This video is about as long as the demo Ray got. —James Pero

I wish I was making this stuff up, but chaos seems to follow me at all tech events. After waiting an hour to try out Google's hyped-up Android XR smart glasses for five minutes, I was actually given a three-minute demo, where I actually had 90 seconds to use Gemini in an extremely controlled environment. And actually, if you watch the video in my hands-on write-up below, you'll see that I spent even less time with it because Gemini fumbled a few times in the beginning. Oof. I really hope there's another chance to try them again because it was just too rushed. I think it might be the most rushed product demo I've ever had in my life, and I've been covering new gadgets for the past 15 years. —Raymond Wong

I Waited One Hour to Try Google's Android XR Smart Glasses and Only Had 90 Seconds With Them

Google, a company valued at $2 trillion, seemingly brought one pair of Android XR smart glasses for press to demo… and one pair of Samsung's Project Moohan mixed reality headset running the same augmented reality platform. I'm told the wait is 1 hour to try either device for 5 minutes. Of course, I'm going to try out the smart glasses. But if I want to demo Moohan, I need to get back in line and wait all over again. This is madness! —Raymond Wong

Talk about a loooooong keynote. Total duration: 1 hour and 55 minutes, and then Sundar Pichai walked off stage. What do you make of all the AI announcements? Let's hang in the comments! I'm headed over to a demo area to try out a pair of Android XR smart glasses. I can't lie, even though the video stream from the live demo lagged for a good portion, I'm hyped! It really feels like Google is finally delivering on Google Glass over a decade later. Shoulda had Google co-founder Sergey Brin jump out of a helicopter and land on stage again, though. —Raymond Wong

Pieces of Project Astra, Google's computer vision-based UI, are winding up in various different products, it seems, and not all of them are geared toward smart glasses specifically.

One of the most exciting updates to Astra is “computer control,” which allows one to do a lot more on their devices with computer vision alone. For instance, you could just point your phone at an object (say, a bike) and then ask Astra to search for the bike, find some brakes for it, and then even pull up a YouTube tutorial on how to fix it—all without typing anything into your phone. —James Pero

Google's Project Astra May Revolutionize Smart Glasses—but Not Today

Shopping bots aren't just for scalpers anymore. Google is putting the power of automated consumerism in your hands with its new AI shopping tool. There are some pretty wild ideas here, too, including a virtual shopping avatar that's supposed to represent your own body—the idea is you can make it try on clothes to see how they fit. How all that works in practice is TBD, but if you're ready for a full AI shopping experience, you've finally got it.

For the whole story, check out our story from Gizmodo's Senior Editor, Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong. —James Pero

Google's Solution to Terrible Online Shopping Is Having an AI Bot Buy Stuff on Your Behalf

I got what I wanted. Google showed off what its Android XR tech can bring to smart glasses. In a live demo, Google showcased how a pair of unspecified smart glasses did a few of the things that I've been waiting to do, including projecting live navigation and remembering objects in your environment—basically the stuff that it pitched with Project Astra last year, but in a glasses form factor.

There's still a lot that needs to happen, both hardware and software-wise, before you can walk around wearing glasses that actually do all those things, but it was exciting to see that Google is making progress in that direction. It's worth noting that not all of the demos went off smoothly—there was lots of stutter in the live translation demo—but I guess props to them for giving it a go.

When we'll actually get to walk around wearing functional smart glasses with some kind of optical passthrough or virtual display is anyone's guess, but the race is certainly heating up. —James Pero

Google's SynthID has been around for nearly three years, but it's been largely kept out of the public eye. The system disturbs AI-generated images, video, or audio with an invisible, undetectable watermark that can be observed with Google DeepMind's proprietary tool. At I/O, Google said it was working with both Nvidia and GetReal to introduce the same watermarking technique with those companies' AI image generators. Users may be able to detect these watermarks themselves, even if only part of the media was modified with AI. Early testers are getting access to it “today,” but hopefully more people can access it at a later date from labs.google/synthid. —Kyle Barr

This keynote has been going on for 1.5 hours now. Do I run to the restroom now or wait? But how much longer until it ends??? Can we petiton to Sundar Pichai to make these keynotes shorter or at least have an intermission?

Update: I ran for it right near the end before Android XR news hit. I almost made it… —Raymond Wong

Google's new video generator Veo, is getting a big upgrade that includes sound generation, and it's not just dialogue. Veo 3 can also generate sound effects and music. In a demo, Google showed off an animated forest scene that includes all three—dialogue, sound effects, and video. The length of clips, I assume, will be short at first, but the results look pretty sophisticated if the demo is to be believed. —James Pero

If you pay for a Google One subscription, you'll start to see Gemini in your Google Chrome browser (and—judging by this developer conference—everywhere else) later this week. This will appear as the sparkle icon at the top of your browser app. You can use this to bring up a prompt box to ask a question about the current page you're browsing, such as if you want to consolidate a number of user reviews for a local campsite. —Kyle Barr

Google's high-tech video conferencing tech, now called Beam, looks impressive. You can make eye contact! It feels like the person in the screen is right in front of you! It's glasses-free 3D! Come back down to Earth, buddy—it's not coming out as a consumer product. Commercial first with partners like HP. Time to apply for a new job? —Raymond Wong

Google doesn't want Search to be tied to your browser or apps anymore. Search Live is akin to the video and audio comprehension capabilities of Gemini Live, but with the added benefit of getting quick answers based on sites from around the web. Google showed how Search Live could comprehend queries about at-home science experiments and bring in answers from sites like Quora or YouTube. —Kyle Barr

Google is getting deep into augmented reality with Android XR—its operating system built specifically for AR glasses and VR headsets. Google showed us how users may be able to see a holographic live Google Maps view directly on their glasses or set up calendar events, all without needing to touch a single screen. This uses Gemini AI to comprehend your voice prompts and follow through on your instructions. Google doesn't have its own device to share at I/O, but it's planning to work with companies like XReal and Samsung to craft new devices across both AR and VR. —Kyle Barr

With Gemini AI, Android XR Smart Glasses May Prosper Where Google Glass Flopped

Google's Wants You to Pay $250 for a God-Tier Subscription to AI

I know how much you all love subscriptions! Google does too, apparently, and is now offering a $250 per month AI bundle that groups some of its most advanced AI services. Subscribing to Google AI Ultra will get you:

I'm not sure who needs all of this, but maybe there are more AI superusers than I thought. —James Pero

Google CEO Sundar Pichai was keen to claim that users are big, big fans of AI overviews in Google Search results. If there wasn't already enough AI on your search bar, Google will now stick an entire “AI Mode” tab on your search bar next to the Google Lens button. This encompasses the Gemini 2.5 model. This opens up an entirely new UI for searching via a prompt with a chatbot. After you input your rambling search query, it will bring up an assortment of short-form textual answers, links, and even a Google Maps widget, depending on what you were looking for.

AI Mode should be available starting today. Google said AI Mode pulls together information from the web alongside its other data, like weather or academic research through Google Scholar. It should also eventually encompass your “personal context,” which will be available later this summer. Eventually, Google will add more AI Mode capabilities directly to AI Overviews. —Kyle Barr

Get your butt over to Gizmodo.com's home page because the Google I/O news embargo just lifted. We've got a bunch of stories, including this one about Google partnering up with Xreal for a new pair of “optical see-through” (OST) smart glasses called Project Aura. The smart glasses run Android XR and are powered by a Qualcomm chip. You can see three cameras. Wireless, these are not—you'll need to tether to a phone or other device.

Update: Little scoop: I've confirmed that Project Aura has a 70-degree field of view, which is way wider than the One Pro's FOV, which is 57 degrees. —Raymond Wong

Google Taps Xreal for ‘Optical See-Through' Smart Glasses That Could Beat Meta's Orion AR Glasses

Google's DeepMind CEO showed off the updated version of Project Astra running on a phone and drove home how its “personal, proactive, and powerful” AI features are the groundwork for a “universal assistant” that truly understands and works on your behalf. If you think Gemini is a fad, it's time to get familiar with it because it's not going anywhere. —Raymond Wong

Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro is its “most advanced model yet,” and comes with “enhanced reasoning,” better coding ability, and can even create interactive simulations. You can try it now via Google AI Studio. —James Pero

There are two major types of transformer AI used today. One is the LLM, AKA large language models, and diffusion models—which are mostly used for image generation. The Gemini Diffusion model blurs the lines of these types of models. Google said its new research model can iterate on a solution quickly and correct itself while generating an answer. For math or coding prompts, Gemini Diffusion can potentially output an entire response much faster than a typical chatbot. Unlike a traditional LLM model, which may take a few seconds to answer a question, Gemini Diffusion can create a response to a complex math equation in the blink of an eye and still share the steps it took to reach its conclusion. —Kyle Barr

New Gemini 2.5 Flash and Gemini Pro models are incoming and, naturally, Google says both are faster and more sophisticated across the board.

One of the improvements for Gemini 2.5 Flash is even more inflection when speaking. Unfortunately for my ears, Google demoed the new Flash speaking in a whisper that sent chills down my spine. —James Pero

Is anybody keeping track of how many times Google execs have said “Gemini” and “AI” so far? Oops, I think I'm already drunk, and we're only 20 minutes in. —Raymond Wong

Google's Project Astra is supposed to be getting much better at avoiding hallucinations, AKA when the AI makes stuff up. Project Astra's vision and audio comprehension capabilities are supposed to be far better at knowing when you're trying to trick it. In a video, Google showed how its Gemini Live AI wouldn't buy your bullshit if you tell it that a garbage truck is a convertible, a lamppost is a skyscraper, or your shadow is some stalker. This should hopefully mean the AI doesn't confidently lie to you as well.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, “Gemini is really good at telling you when you're wrong.” These enhanced features should be rolling out today for Gemini app on iOS and Android. —Kyle Barr

Like pretty much every other AI player, Google is pursuing agentic AI in a big way. I'd prepare for a lot more talk about how Gemini can take tasks off your hands as the keynote progresses. —James Pero

Google has finally moved Project Starline—its futuristic video-calling machine—into a commercial project called Google Beam. According to Pichai, Google Beam can take a 2D image and transform it into a 3D one, and will also incorporate live translate. —James Pero

Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, says Google is shipping at a relentless pace, and to be honest, I tend to agree. There are tons of Gemini models out there already, even though it's only been out for two years.

Probably my favorite milestone, though, is that it has now completed Pokémon Blue, earning all 8 badges according to Pichai. —James Pero

Buckle up, kiddos, it's I/O time. Methinks there will be a lot to get to, so you may want to grab a snack now. —James Pero

Counting down until the keynote… only a few more minutes to go. The DJ just said AI is changing music and how it's made. But don't forget that we're all here… in person. Will we all be wearing Android XR smart glasses next year? Mixed reality headsets? —Raymond Wong

Fun fact: I haven't attended Google I/O in person since before Covid-19. The Wi-Fi is definitely stronger and more stable now. It's so great to be back and covering for Gizmodo. Dream job, unlocked! —Raymond Wong

Mini breakfast burritos… bagels… but these bagels can't compare to real Made In New York City bagels with that authentic NY water 😏 —Raymond Wong

I've arrived at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., where the Google I/O keynote is taking place in 40 minutes. Seats are filling up. But first, must go check out the breakfast situation because my tummy is growling… —Raymond Wong

Google I/O attendees get a special tote bag, a metal water bottle, a cap, and a cute sheet of stickers. I always end up donating this stuff to Goodwill during the holidays. A guy living in NYC with two cats only has so much room for tote bags and water bottles… Would be cool to do giveaway. Leave a comment to let us know if you'd be into that and I can pester top brass to make it happen 🤪 —Raymond Wong

In 13 hours, Google will blitz everyone with Gemini AI, Gemini AI, and tons more Gemini AI. Who's ready for… Gemini AI? —Raymond Wong

Picked up my #GoogleIO press badge. Still doesn't feel real that I'm reppin' @Gizmodo. Someone pinch me! Anyway, follow us on Instagram where I'm doing a takeover of Stories, read our live blog, and check out our coverage starting tomorrow. Yeeeeeeeeeee! pic.twitter.com/crnnr3Gtg7

Google is very obviously inching toward the release of some kind of smart glasses product for the first time since (gulp) Google Glass, and if I were a betting man, I'd say this one will have a much warmer reception than its forebearer. I'm not saying Google can snatch the crown from Meta and its Ray-Ban smart glasses right out of the gate, but if it plays its cards right, it could capitalize on the integration with its other hardware (hello, Pixel devices) in a big way. Meta may finally have a real competitor on its hands.

ICYMI: Here's Google's President of the Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat, teasing some kind of smart glasses device in a recorded demo last week. —James Pero

Google Is Gunning for Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses

 

Hi folks, I'm James Pero, Gizmodo's new Senior Writer. There's a lot we have to get to with Google I/O, so I'll keep this introduction short.

I like long walks on the beach, the wind in my nonexistent hair, and I'm really, really, looking forward to bringing you even more of the spicy, insightful, and entertaining coverage on consumer tech that Gizmodo is known for.

I'm starting my tenure here out hot with Google I/O, so make sure you check back here throughout the week to get those sweet, sweet blogs and commentary from me and Gizmodo's Senior Consumer Tech Editor Raymond Wong. —James Pero

Hey everyone! Raymond Wong, senior editor in charge of Gizmodo's consumer tech team, here! Landed in San Francisco (the sunrise was *chef's kiss*), and I'll be making my way over to Mountain View, California, later today to pick up my press badge and scope out the scene for tomorrow's Google I/O keynote, which kicks off at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT. Google I/O is a developer conference, but that doesn't mean it's news only for engineers. While there will be a lot of nerdy stuff that will have developers hollering, what Google announces—expect updates on Gemini AI, Android, and Android XR, to name a few headliners—will shape consumer products (hardware, software, and services) for the rest of this year and also the years to come. I/O is a glimpse at Google's technology roadmap as AI weaves itself into the way we compute at our desks and on the go. This is going to be a fun live blog! —Raymond Wong

          Google has made something really impressive, but it's not exactly perfect—yet.
        


          Google has its work cut out if it's going to make the smart glasses we've been waiting for.
        


          Google says its video generation tools, Flow and Veo 3, are enough to turn you, a lowly human, into a filmmaker, but that's more than debatable.
        


          I was promised 5 minutes with Google's AR glasses prototype, but only got 90 seconds to use them.
        


          If you want the maximum amount of AI in your web search, Google's got your back.
        


          Good news: Project Starline has a new name called Google Beam. Bad news: you won't have one in your home any time soon.

If you're looking for an affordable (and secure) way to back up your files, the Seagate Portable 2TB external hard drive (HDD) currently on sale at Amazon is a great pick.

Seagate is a global leader in the storage industry and for this Memorial Day sale, you can grab the 2TB HDD model for just $69 which is a 13% discount from its usual $79 price tag. Compared to the ongoing expense of cloud storage, this is a one-time investment that saves you money in the long run. For example, a 2TB cloud plan at pCloud will cost you $120 per year, while this Seagate drive gives you the same capacity (lifetime) for less than $70.

See at Amazon

The Seagate hard drive is designed to be spare and compatible with anything that will interface with both Windows and Mac computers and most game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox…). It is available for backing up files, photos, videos or game libraries, and plug-and-play design means no software install or difficult setup to accomplish. The drive is powered directly via the USB port so you don't need external power supply.

Even though HDDs generally offer slower speeds than SSDs, the Seagate 2TB external hard drive still offers fast performance for day-to-day use. With transfer rates as high as 120MB/s, it's more than sufficient to transfer large files. In contrast, SSDs can go much faster (500 to 1000MB/s) but for most users who need to store or back up large amounts of information, the difference in speed is never a bottleneck. For a 2TB capacity, an HDD like this remains a good and affordable option.

With 2TB of storage, you have room to store hundreds of thousands of photos, hours of HD video or entire game libraries without worrying about having too little space. With drag-and-drop simple organization and control over your files, the drive's compatibility with both USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports ensures that it will get along with nearly any computer or console you happen to have on hand. For peace of mind for data protection, the drive also includes a data recovery service plan, which provides expert assistance in the case of data loss.

If you need low-cost, secure and high-capacity storage, this Seagate external hard drive is a very good choice. It's far more economical and convenient than paying for periodic cloud storage plans (or SSD hard drives) with the added benefits of portability, performance, and convenience.

If you've ever tried to multitask on a laptop, you've also been probably frustrated of working within limited screen space. Whether your laptop is 13, 15, or even 17 inches, there always seems to be not quite enough space to comfortably juggle emails, documents and web pages at the same time. And so having a second monitor feels like a luxury.

The real task is finding one that's light, truly portable, and easy to install: Amazon Memorial Day Sales now offer a very popular 15.6-inch portable monitor for an affordable $61 (which is a 31% discount from its regular $89 price) with over 6,000 five-star reviews. This is a true productivity or entertainment game-changer for anyone who wants to boost efficiency.

See at Amazon

So attractive is the MNN portable monitor for it great performance, portability and price. At just 15.6 inches, it's the perfect size to complement any laptop, and it provides a generous 1080p Full HD 1920×1080 resolution on an advanced IPS matte screen. The display supports a wide 178° viewing angle so colors remain vivid and accurate no matter where you're sitting. The anti-glare coating on the screen and its sophisticated eye-care aspects (such as blue light filtering and flicker-free support) ensure that it is easy on the eyes to use for hours on end.

The double Type-C port design of this monitor is perhaps one of its most unique aspects and enables true plug-and-play functionality. If your laptop, phone, or gaming console has a Thunderbolt 3.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP Alt Mode port, you can power and transmit video on one cable without an extra adapter or power supply. The monitor also has an HDMI input so it will connect to most devices, from PCs and Macs to gaming devices like the PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

You will also love the fact that it weighs but a few pounds (1.53 pounds) and is ultra-thin, so it will easily fit into any backpack or suitcase. The in-built smart cover made of durable PU leather provides you with great protection for the screen from scratches but also as a stand so that you can have your workspace wherever you desire in seconds.

The monitor also offers a few display modes (Copy Mode, Extended Mode, Second Screen Mode, and Portrait Mode) to fit your workflow or entertainment needs. HDR support also brings brighter highlights, deeper colors and more lifelike images, so it's a joy to have this screen for streaming and gaming. Internal speakers offer decent sound, so you won't need to use your laptop's typically tinny speakers.

If you've ever wished for more space to work or play, now's the perfect time to make it happen.

TSMC, Dell, and HP all say it's bad for business.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. Commerce Department has asked the public for comments on its plan to apply tariffs on semiconductors arriving on U.S. shores, and several tech companies responded with written protests. According to PC Mag, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has one of the more strongly worded responses, warning that applying import duties on chips will significantly reduce the demand for its customers' electronic products. This would lead to a massive decline in revenue, which would affect the timeline of its $165 billion investment in Arizona.

“Lower market demand for our leading U.S. customers' products may consequently reduce demand for TSMC's manufacturing capacity and service onshore,” the company said in its response. It also added, “Diminished demand could create uncertainty around the timeline for the construction and operation of our Arizona fabs. It could also undermine TSMC's financial capacity to timely execute its ambitious Arizona project.”

TSMC is the largest pure-play chip fab in the world, and some of its clients include Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. It has started mass production of Apple's chips in its Arizona fab, with the latter expecting to source over 19 billion chips locally. However, TSMC's Arizona chip fab is already sold out through late 2027, and it acknowledged that its current capacity is still insufficient to meet global demand.

In its letter, TSMC concludes ""Tariffs that raise the cost of endconsumer products will lower demand for such products and the semiconductor components they contain,"" and states ""Therefore, we respectfully request that the Administration avoids imposing tariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside of the United States.""

Dell and HP also had the same sentiments as TSMC, with the former saying that U.S. chip manufacturing “lacks the requisite infrastructure to supply these products at scale to meet current and increasing demand.” The latter's response is harsher, saying, “HPE has no alternative but to import semiconductors for its U.S. manufacturing operations. Imposing tariffs on those imported semiconductors would harm HPE's ability to maintain and expand its domestic manufacturing activities and retard U.S. R&D and innovation, ultimately to the detriment of national security and economic growth.”

On the other hand, chip-making giant Intel, which has been in financial trouble since mid-2024, has a unique position on the issue. The first bullet point in its response says, “Protect American Manufactured Semiconductor Wafers and Derivative Products”, which points out that “U.S.-made wafers and their derivative products” must have strategic accommodations. Otherwise, “the essential contributions of American manufacturing will be overlooked, undermining the U.S.'s position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing and technology development.”

Aside from exempting chips that are based on U.S. technology and IP, the company also wants its supply chain, including foreign-made chip-making equipment, like that from ASML, to be exempt from additional taxes. “While Intel is committed to building semiconductors in the U.S., fully localizing every element of the supply chain is economically unfeasible without significant increases and production delays,” says Intel.

This more nuanced approach will benefit key American chip makers, as they can keep on using foreign fabs to make their chips while they're rebuilding their manufacturing capacity within America. It will also help them avoid paying extra for importing technologies they need to restart, develop, or expand local manufacturing within the U.S.

Probably not for homes.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As hardware gets more powerful and power hungry, makers of power supplies have to keep up to offer relevant PSUs to interested parties, and to that end, we see even more and more powerful PSUs at every Computex. If last year we thought that 2,800W was crazy, then this year we see that several manufacturers have managed to build 3,000W+ power supplies.



Seasonic introduced the Prime PX-2300, a 3,200W 80+ Platinum ATX 3.1 model, at the show, beating Asus's 3,000W PSU that the company showcased earlier this week. The new unit features four 12V-2×6 connectors for high-performance gaming or AI/HPC GPUs, and to that end, it powered a server running four Nvidia datacenter-grade graphics cards and an AMD datacenter processor during the demonstration.

Such a setup is common for datacenter environments, though as this is an ATX-standard PSU, it can perfectly fit into a workstation, or even into a gaming desktop, though 3.2kW of power is an overkill for the vast majority of machines that are out there.



But as if 3200W is not enough, Super Flower stole Seasonic's thunder with a 3,300W PSU. In fact, Super Flower again displayed the most powerful PSU at Computex — the Leadex SF-3300F14HP. This 3300W monster is also fully ATX 3.1 compliant, offers five power rails, and is capable of supplying power to high-end processors and four GPUs using four 12V-2×6 connectors. The company expects to start its mass production late this year, so expect its wide availability in late 2025 – early 2026. As for pricing, the company's current-generation flagship 2800W PSU costs some $899. Since the new 3300W does not really replace the previous-gen, but rather enhances the product lineup, expect it to exceed the $1,000 mark.

In any case, such high-output power supplies are not universally deployable due to electrical limitations. In North America, typical 120V/15A outlets can only support PSUs up to around 1800W (though keep in mind that the ratings of power outlets are made for peak loads, not continuous loads, so 1600W or less is a more realistic target). So, in the U.S., these CPUs are good for facilities with upgraded power circuits. By contrast, a European 16A/230V outlet (not in all countries and not in all homes, though) can easily support PSUs rated at 3,000W+, depending on efficiency and continuous load.

Despite the limited market, demand for such PSUs exists in areas like AI research, custom GPU compute systems, and advanced desktop workstations. Users owning such machines are likely to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support PSUs delivering over 3kW of power, and the cost of infrastructure greatly exceeds the costs of actual PSUs.

An outstanding SSD for less is always a good thing


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It's been available for a good few years now, and the Platinum P41 from SK hynix is still a solid choice for a Gen 4 SSD for gaming and other applications. We test a lot of SSDs at Tom's Hardware, and at the time this drive was released onto the market, it was the best 2TB SSD that we had tested in our suite of benchmarking tests. Easily beating the competition to become our top pick for the best SSD.

While it's no longer the fastest SSD on the market thanks to the release of the latest and greatest Gen 5.0 drives, the P41 is still one of the quickest PCIe 4 drives you can get. In the Memorial Day sales at Newegg, you can grab the SK hynix Platinum P41 for the low price of just $124 for the 2TB capacity drive. This is a limited-time sale, so you will have to be quick to grab this offer. Use code EPES2A27 to save $25 and hit the $124 advertised price.

The Platinum P41 drive is rated for 7,000 MBps sequential reads and 6,500 MBps sequential writes with up to 1.4 million random read IOPS or 1.3 million random write IOPS.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm David Kerr, professor of cancer medicine at the University of Oxford. Those of you who listen to me on Medscape will know that I recently did a video on the benefits of drumming, such as its rhythmic beauty, the fact that it induces exercise and a collaborative community, and so on.

For this video, I'd like to talk about dance diplomacy. That's a term made up by my friend, who's a professor of radiation biology at Harvard. The history of dance diplomacy, in some negative ways, goes back to Salome, the Dance of the Seven Veils, and the execution of John the Baptist, but much more recently there's been a positive spin on it.

In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, Britain and America were worried that Ghana, a great West African nation, would leave their commonwealth and fall under the influence of the Soviet Union. This was seen as a bad thing, potentially, the Soviet Union having a foothold in Africa in those heady, difficult days. 

Up stepped Queen Elizabeth II, in a mission to persuade the Ghanaian president, Kwame Nkrumah, not to leave the partnership of nations, which she so cherished. If there is one thing that the Queen felt perhaps most strongly about, it was the commonwealth and its maintenance, a duty that she followed through on until her death. 

During the regal visit, she was accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. During a visit to the capital city, Accra — another great city I love visiting — the Queen was photographed dancing very happily with the Ghanaian leader at a time when, in the United States, Black people in America were still denied the right to vote.This had a fantastic ripple effect, not only across the Commonwealth, but across the world, seeing these two heads of state dancing happily.

Other iconic dances include Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher at a White House dinner held in her honor, in 1986. Again, the year before that, with the involvement of First Lady Nancy Reagan, John Travolta was persuaded to ask Princess Diana to dance. This was an extraordinarily iconic dance that rippled throughout the world at a time when Princess Diana was doing some fantastic work on HIV/AIDS. Some very memorable other images came from that meeting. 

Dancing is good for you. We know that. It's to do with rhythm. It's the same sense of community, collaboration, exercise, memory, and muscle memory. I love Scottish country dancing, including The Dashing White Sergeant and Strip the Willow. It's a fantastic way of really getting things going to the rhythm, often of a pipe band, which is another interest of mine. 

My dance diplomacy stemmed a couple of years ago when Beatrice Addai, a fantastic breast cancer surgeon from Ghana, chaired The Lancet Oncology's Commission on Cancer Control in Sub-Saharan Africa.

We decided to launch the commission report — a rather important piece of work, I think — in Ghana. It went well. We went north, to the garden city of Kumasi, where Beatrice has her hospital and she's done an enormous amount to raise awareness around breast cancer and its treatment.

In the video that accompanies this, you'll see me make a complete dysrhythmic fool of myself doing dad dancing with some of the breast cancer survivors and their families, who knew how to shake a rug. I look a complete imbecile, but it was fun, it broke barriers down, and the ladies liked it very much indeed.

It became a thing, every part of our tour around various other elements of the Ghanaian cancer system. I was known as Dancing Dave. I was persuaded repeatedly to get out front and to shake an incredibly inelegant rug. 

Why are we talking about this story? It's dance diplomacy. It's about people expecting someone like me — a stuffy, Oxford professor; aging, cancer professional-type person — to be rigid, distant, reserved. The sort of scientist that one would expect, but showing a glimpse of that sort of human side. This helps to break those barriers down, in an “all of humanity in it together” sort of way.

Have a look at the videos. Have a good laugh. Undoubtedly you will. You'll see some other of my friends and colleagues there. Think how you might not dance your way through diplomacy, but what other tactics you might employ to break down barriers between us and the patients and families that we care for, to show us as being similarly human and similarly aligned. 

Have a look. I'd be very interested in anything you have to say about it. Thanks for listening and watching, as always. I'm very pleased to receive any of your comments. For the time being, Medscapers, over and out.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Prophylactic radiation therapy to the contralateral breast significantly delayed the onset of contralateral breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants with early breast cancer. The 10-year contralateral breast cancer rates were lower among those who received radiotherapy than among those who did not.

“This novel approach, albeit controversial, is supported by the findings that highlight the need for a larger international trial,” the authors concluded.

The study, led by Ella Evron, MD, Oncology, Kaplan Medical Institute, Rehovot, Israel, was published online in JAMA Oncology.

Higher rates of estrogen receptor positivity and endocrine treatment for the index breast cancer, as well as elective risk-reducing mastectomy, in the control group could have contributed to the lower-than-expected rate of contralateral breast cancer. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was also lower than expected, which could have affected the findings.

This trial was funded by the Israel Cancer Association. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A substantial proportion of patients with autoimmune diseases experienced a new side effect called local immune effector cell–associated toxicity syndromes (LICATS) after receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy; these effects were usually mild, self-limited, and occurred in organs previously affected by the autoimmune condition.

“LICATS typically occurred during the period of time when CAR T cells peaked, suggesting an immunological basis for this clinical phenomenon. This distinction has important implications, as clinicians might want to escalate immunosuppression for patients in whom a flare is suspected. Increased education and awareness of LICATS could avert unnecessary use of added immunosuppression following CAR T-cell infusions,” experts wrote in an accompanying editorial.

This study was led by Melanie Hagen, MD, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg and Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany. It was published online on April 30, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

In this study, only a limited number of biopsies were taken from the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys, potentially restricting a comprehensive understanding of the tissue-specific effects of LICATS. The absence of a comparator group is another major drawback of this study.

This study received funding from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, German Cancer Aid, Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, and other sources. Some authors reported receiving grants, honoraria, consultancy fees, support for attending meetings, and other ties from various pharmaceutical companies.

Rebecca Smith, 28, endured a series of sexual assaults between ages 17 and 21. When she became pregnant for the first time at age 23, she told her OBGYN about her traumatic past. The reaction surprised and comforted her.

“She made sure everybody was respectful, and one of the things I liked most was that she would tell me whenever she would be touching me, and she would always ask me if I was okay,” Smith said.

Yet even with these warnings, Smith said she experienced moments when the scars of her past trauma were inflamed and she needed time to regain her composure. Again, her physician stepped up. “She was very gentle with her words, and she told me it's not my fault that any of this happened and that I needed to be okay with speaking up for myself and telling her what I needed,” Smith recalled.

“The only thing she did that wasn't great is that when I was pushing, she told me not to scream,” Smith said. Having the option to cancel appointments at the last minute without a financial penalty would have been helpful, she added, “because there were some days that I couldn't do it, and you didn't really know until you showed up.”

Unfortunately for many survivors of sexual assault, Smith's experience is not the norm. Many women who have been abused report rough or insensitive handling from their OBGYNs, whose clinical practice involves touching areas of the body that are physically and emotionally fraught and recalling medical histories that are difficult to share. As a thread on Reddit suggests, some women have even reported feeling mocked by nurses until they revealed their history of sexual assault.

In recent years, however, the model of trauma-informed care has become more widespread. Professional organizations, hospitals, and state agencies have begun making an explicit effort to be more sensitive to the impact of trauma on a person and the specific needs of those with a history of sexual trauma.

Managing the prenatal and obstetric care of patients with a history of sexual assault or childhood sexual abuse requires an understanding of trauma-informed care and taking steps to reduce the risk for re-traumatization, according to pregnancy care providers and survivors who discussed their pregnancy and birth experiences.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in 2021 issued a committee opinion on caring for patients who have experienced trauma, a document which emphasizes the need for clinicians to become familiar with the trauma-informed approach to care. That means understanding the effect of trauma on a person, helping support their sense of personal agency, and creating “opportunities for survivors to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment.”

The ACOG statement speaks more broadly to any and all kinds of trauma rather than sexual abuse and assault in particular.

That's partly by design, said Colleen McNicholas, DO, an OBGYN in St. Louis who helped write the statement.

“The reason you don't see specific ‘do this, ask this' [recommendations] is because the topic is so sensitive, and survivors have such different experiences with their history and what they want people to know and how they want it approached that it's really challenging from an institutional standpoint” to have specific guidelines, McNicholas said. “Having said that, there are definitely some principles and approaches that everybody should be taking.”

Not everyone does. Smith had a bad experience with an anesthesiologist during the delivery of her first child.

“He had me take my gown off completely and made my husband sit on the other side of the room,” Smith said. “He was hurting me repeatedly, and when I told him, he said, ‘No, it's not me, it's your contractions.'”

Smith's nurse became “furious,” she recalled. The nurse sent the doctor out of the room and told her colleagues not to let him go in again without another nurse present. When Smith told her OBGYN after the birth what happened, they assured her the anesthesiologist would never touch her again.

With her second pregnancy 2 years later, however, Smith had a different physician to whom she did not reveal her history of assault — in part because she felt she would be less likely to relive the experiences. In retrospect, she said, that was a mistake. During the delivery, her baby's heart rate plunged, sending the doctor into command mode and prompting him to begin yelling orders to nurses in the room.

“The second he touched me after he started freaking out, my brain started going back to the assault,” Smith said. “I think his anxiety sparked my anxiety, and the anxiety sparked the memories.”

CJ, a 48-year-old American expatriate in Mexico City, Mexico, had had bad past experiences with other physicians, so in her first pregnancy at age 37, she decided to let her clinicians know about her history, which included sexual abuse as a toddler, a sexual assault in her 20s, and another in her early 30s. She asked her OBGYN to prepare her for each step that would happen, letting her know what touching would occur and when so that she could be ready.

“She was very sweet and open to that,” CJ said. “She said, ‘Okay, I'm going to put my hand on your thigh. Then, I'm going to put my glove on,' everything step by step, but I felt like I really had to advocate for myself given past histories with other doctors.”

Some of those experiences involved the doctor acting cold or detached or not making eye contact with her, but that detachment was enough to be “triggering sometimes,” she said. Instead, providers should make space for patients who haven't learned yet how to advocate for themselves.

“That's part of trauma-informed care too, finding different opportunities in different ways to give people the chance to speak up because they might not feel comfortable,” she said.

Indeed, the onus should not be on the patient. Experts say one step is having a conversation with the patient before they change into a gown for their first appointment. That moment is an opportunity to glean relevant information about their history.

“I don't specifically say, ‘Do you have a history of sexual assault,'” McNicholas said. “What I might say is, ‘Is there anything about your previous experience with these kinds of exams or with your sexual history or experience that will make this exam or this experience more challenging for you?'”

Sometimes that conversation means an exam may not happen that day, but then the clinician can help the patient plan for the next appointment to determine ways to increase their comfort, such as bringing along a partner, friend, or family member. “It has to be individualized to the patient,” she said.

Some patients may not feel comfortable disclosing a history of sexual assault. Hannah Cutts, a certified nurse midwife who works at a federally qualified health center in Chicago, said she assumes “almost everybody who comes through the clinic doors has some exposure to trauma,” whether sexual, medical, or another form of abuse. She therefore tries to give them as much control as possible over every aspect of their care because “lack of control tends to be a real trigger,” she said.

She shows them the speculum before placing it, explains each thing she will do before doing it, and reminds them they are in charge and can ask her to stop at any point. For those with a known history of sexual trauma, she asks whether they want the explanations. Some do, others don't.

“For some people, dissociating is easier,” Cutts said. She also does not assume that disclosing their history of trauma will be productive: “I really don't try to dig very deeply into people's history unless they volunteer it.”

Deena Blumenfeld, a former doula and childbirth educator, said clinicians also should be alert to nonverbal clues that may indicate a history of trauma. Examples might include avoiding eye contact or frequently keeping their eyes on the floor, a closed posture, or handles held tightly in the laps. During an exam, observe the patient's breathing for changes or if their eyes widen. These signs are cues to stop and ask if the patient is experiencing a surge of anxiety and needs something comforting, such as their partner to hold their hand or a nurse to join them.

“I can't emphasize enough that for all situations of maternity care, the more doctors and nurses can explain to patients what is happening, why it is happening, and what choices they have, that's empowerment for patients,” Blumenfeld said. She encourages healthcare providers to use person-centered language and keep the mindset of being one of the “helpers” of the sort Mr Fred Rogers described in tragic or traumatic events.

A 2018 qualitative study included perspectives from 20 women with a history of sexual trauma who had given birth within the previous 3 years. Women expressed a desire for “clear communication about their history between prenatal care provider and the labor and delivery team” and control over who was in the labor room during exams and how exposed their bodies were during labor. They also wanted to be asked about their preference for a male provider and for their care team to avoid language that might remind them of their past trauma.

Simply asking patients what they need or what works for them can be particularly helping in giving them a sense of agency, McNicholas said.

“If you are in tune with trauma-informed care and you are paying attention to the patient in front of you, you can almost always sense that they are having some anxiety or feeling really nervous,” she said. “I will oftentimes say things like, ‘I'm sensing that you might be a little bit anxious about this exam. Is there anything I can do to make this easier for you?'”

Caring for a patient throughout their pregnancy offers physicians and midwives an opportunity to build trust and develop a relationship with their patient, but those who may be most vulnerable often arrive at the hospital without having received prenatal care and without any preexisting relationship with a clinician.

“The important thing to recognize in that circumstance is that those patients are actually at significant risk of not getting this kind of trauma-informed care,” McNicholas said. “I think the healthcare system as a whole tends to view folks who have not had prenatal care with a certain level of judgment.”

Ann Gilligan, RN, worked as a sexual assault nurse examiner before shifting to labor and delivery. Gilligan, who practices in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, said standard questions during intake ask about abuse occurring at home but not about a history of sexual abuse or assault. Developing a protocol to screen for a history of sexual assault is important, she said, and could be done gently.

“What we typically do with questions that are a little bit personal is that we preface it,” she said. “We say, ‘This is to help me give you better care, care that you deserve, so I'm going to ask you a couple personal questions, and I'm doing it alone for your privacy.'”

Many of the practices McNicholas and Cutts describe, such as informing patients of what to expect and asking permission to touch them, are ones healthcare providers should be offering to everyone anyway, especially given that approximately 1 in 4 people have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime, Gilligan said.

Practicing with a trauma-informed approach to care means a scheduled 10-minute visit may sometimes last 30 minutes or may fail to achieve what the clinician had planned or expected.

“I think in this world where patients are rightfully demanding a better experience of healthcare, we need to be taking the time to approach it in that manner,” McNicholas said. “They know what they deserve, and they should be able to find that.”

Children exposed to maternal preeclampsia and born at term (37 weeks or more) were 26% more likely to develop kidney disease in the first year of life than those not exposed. They also faced notably high risks for chronic, unspecified, and diabetic kidney diseases as they grew older, particularly at or after 25 years of age.

""In adolescents and young adults presenting with signs and symptoms of kidney dysfunction, a history of maternal preeclampsia may warrant an upweighting of kidney disease in the differential diagnosis, despite the patient's youth,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ida Lihme, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on May 16, 2025, in Kidney International.

Relatively few individuals were exposed to preterm preeclampsia and developed kidney disease, which may have yielded unstable results in some subanalyses and made it difficult to assess associations with early and late preterm preeclampsia separately. In analyses of individual kidney disease subtypes, evidence for associations with preterm preeclampsia was often lacking, likely due to a lack of statistical power.

Two authors reported receiving grants from various sources, including the US National Institutes of Health, Danish Council for Independent Research, and Novo Nordisk Foundation.

Compared with placebo, secukinumab demonstrated superior pain reduction in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in two phase 3 trials. Improvements in pain were sustained through week 52 and were associated with better quality of life outcomes.

""This post hoc analysis of the SUNSHINE and SUNRISE phase 3 trials highlights the benefits of secukinumab in reducing skin pain in patients with moderate to severe HS [hidradenitis suppurativa], seen within a few weeks of treatment initiation, and sustained, with a trend for improvement, through week 52,"" the authors wrote. ""Importantly, improvements in disease-related pain were associated with improvements in QoL [quality of life] of patients, as well as a decrease in the proportion of patients taking pain medication,"" they added.

This study was led by John R. Ingram, Department of Dermatology & Academic Wound Healing, Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales. It was published online on May 15, 2025, in Dermatology and Therapy.

Changes in skin pain observed may have been influenced by the use of concomitant medications and cannot be fully attributed to the study treatment alone. The cutoffs used for assessing skin pain categories were based on baseline NRS quartiles due to the absence of validated cutoffs for the hidradenitis suppurativa population. Additionally, the study population predominantly consisted of self-reported White participants, with a relatively low proportion of Black patients potentially limiting the generalisability of the findings to the broader global population.

 May 22, 2025  

SAN FRANCISCO — Frailty is hard to define and hard to distinguish from the effects of illness, injury, and medical interventions, but the frailty of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can have profound effects on outcomes, including the risk for mortality.

In a scientific symposium on frailty in the ICU, presented during the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2025 International Conference, researchers outlined both the challenges of assessing frailty in the ICU and the effects of frailty on patients in the ICU and after discharge.

“I think the ICU is a unique rubric to understand the role of frailty, stress, and maladaptive physiologic responses in mediating short- and long-term outcomes,” said Aluko Akini Hope, MD, from Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, Oregon.

Despite some unique challenges in the ICU setting, frailty can be measured using approaches that consider both frailty phenotype and cumulative deficits, Hope said.

He defined physical frailty as “a clinical state in which the patient has reduced functional reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors due to maladaptive changes across multiple physiologic systems.”

Although definitions and means of assessing frailty vary, they can be roughly grouped into two main conceptual models.

The phenotypic model relies on physical factors such as recent weight loss > 10 lbs, low grip strength, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity.

The cumulative health deficit model can be summed up as “the more individuals have wrong, the more likely they are to be frail,” Hope said.

Frailty can be assessed with a variety of approaches, including the frailty index, which generates a score calculated by dividing the number of deficits a patient has by the total number of health variables considered. The assessment using this index can be reduced to approximately 30 items with good predictive validity, Hope said.

The predictive power of this model relies, however, on clinical documentation in the electronic health record and is subject to residual confounding.

In contrast to the frailty index, the Clinical Frailty Scales is based on clinical judgment of experienced clinicians to summarize the overall frailty or fitness level of older patients. The 9-point scale ranks patients from being “very fit” to terminally ill and is associated with both morbidity and mortality outcomes in ICUs.

This scale, widely used in ICUs in Canada for research purposes, has strong interrater reliability in ICU multidisciplinary teams, Hope commented.

The phenotypic approach may be more difficult than other measures to use in a critical care setting because it relies on physical aspects such as ability to rise from a chair, slow walking speed, low physical activity, and exhaustion. These measures all rely on patient or caregiver recall.

Performance measures to identify frailty include a sit-to-stand test, balance test, gait speed, and mobility stress testing, which may be appropriate in the post-ICU setting but can be hard to apply in a critical care unit.

Lauren Ferrante, MD, MHS, from the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, noted that although the prevalence of frailty increases with age, from 3.2% in 65- to 70-year-olds to 25.7% in 85- to 89-year-olds in one study, many older adults are not frail, and making assumptions about frailty based only on appearance or immediate circumstances can result in either over- or undertreatment of patients.

However, it is identified “frailty is strongly associated with adverse ICU and hospital outcomes, including mortality,” she said.

In addition, frailty “is associated with worse patient-centered outcomes, including health-related quality-of-life and functional outcomes,” Ferrante said.

She summarized findings from the literature on the effects of frailty on outcomes. For example, in a study published this year in the Annals of Intensive Care, investigators looked at the impact of frailty and older age on weaning patients from invasive mechanical ventilation and found that the highest proportion of patients for whom weaning failed was in those patients who were deemed to be frail, and that frailty had more consistent effect on weaning duration and success rates than older age.

A separate study from the Canadian Critical Care Trials group, published in Intensive Care Medicine in 2024, found that frail patients were more likely than non-frail patients to experience ICU delirium and had higher in-hospital and 6-month mortality rates.

Ferrante and colleagues, Hope and colleagues, and others have also looked at frail patients in longitudinal and cohort studies and found that frailty is associated with post-ICU disabilities and poor functional outcomes.

In addition, patients who are frail have a 3.5-fold higher likelihood of new admissions to a nursing home after a critical illness than non-frail patients.

And as John Muscedere, MD, Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and colleagues reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis, also presented at ATS 2025 International Conference, compared with non-frail patients, those who were frail had a more than twofold relative risk for in-hospital death, had a more than 2.5-fold relative risk for long-term mortality, and were significantly less likely to be discharged home.

“We should be thinking more about augmenting processes of care for frail ICU across the continuum to post-discharge care,” Ferrante said.

She recommend considering automated methods of ascertaining frailty such as the eFrailty Index in the Epic medical record system, which automatically generates a frailty index score from chart data and has the potential to be adapted for use in the ICU.

Clinicians should be cautioned, however, not to conflate automated measurements with severity of illness, which could yield false positive results, she emphasized.

An ICU specialist who attended the session told Medscape Medical News that he wasn't convinced that the research presented during the session fully addressed the problem of frailty in the ICU.

“I really worry when we think about frailty as a construct in the ICU that we end up putting the cart before the horse. It's something that we know when we see it, but it's very difficult to measure, and we're talking about different things. When we say the word ‘frailty' we're not always talking about the same thing, and I definitely worry when we think about developing specific interventions, particularly around ICU patients,” said Jeremy Kahn, MD, MS, professor of critical care medicine and health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh.

“If we don't really understand what frailty is then we're going to end up with a lot of negative studies that may be several different diseases that we're conflating as one,” he said.

Asked by Medscape Medical News whether the idea of an automated frailty index had merit, he replied that “it's definitely more objective, but then it does raise the question whether you're measuring something new. We have lots of measures around comorbidities, we have age, which is very predictive, and not to say that frailty isn't a real thing, but if we can't measure it in a way differently from age or comorbidities, we're just using the electronic health record.”

In the absence of an accurate objective measure of frailty, clinicians may be measuring things that they already know, such as comorbidities, or may be identifying patient populations that are diverse and may not be amenable to a single intervention, Kahn told Medscape Medical News.

Hope, Ferrante, and Kahn reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

This article is the second in a series on prescription drug monitoring programs and analysis tools designed to give clinicians a view of how likely their patient is to abuse or overdose on a prescribed controlled substance. The first part examines one such tool, NarxCare scores, and the scientific evidence backing their use.

This story focuses on the lack of government oversight of such tools and a recent effort to prompt a regulatory agency to set standards for these products.

A group representing clinicians and pain patients is seeking a formal review from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a controversial product that uses proprietary algorithms in judging the risk for opioid overdose.

Their petition is part of a broader debate on how and if algorithm-based clinical decision support tools should be overseen by regulators, just like medical devices are, in an effort to minimize potential patient harm.

The platform, called NarxCare, was developed by Bamboo Health, a Louisville, Kentucky–based behavioral health company that is the nation's largest provider to states of technical services for prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). Half of these states — at least 20 — use the company's NarxCare platform, which contains several scores, including one that indicates the past use of prescribed scheduled drugs.

“Patients are judged by an undisclosed algorithm that can determine whether they receive medical care or not — without any way to see, challenge, or correct errors in their score,” said Beverly C. Schechtman, vice president of The Doctor Patient Forum, a nonprofit focused on patients with pain based in Rhode Island. “We are calling on the FDA to step in and regulate NarxCare before more people are harmed.”

Earlier this spring, the group asked the FDA to conduct a formal review to determine if NarxCare qualifies as a medical device subject to regulation. Their letter asked the agency to create clear guidelines for risk-scoring software used in clinical decision-making and to mandate companies to disclose their algorithms and methodologies for independent review. Critics say Bamboo Health has not published the algorithms that generate the scores nor have the tools been extensively validated.

While some clinicians see the NarxCare product as a tool to aid in patient care, many also say health clinicians may not provide appropriate pain treatment because of the scores.

“We'd definitely like to see it regulated because it is so vastly used,” said Kate Nicholson, executive director of the National Pain Advocacy Center, which represents researchers and patients.

She cited concerns that patients with higher NarxCare scores might be flagged simply because they are treated in group practices, which can make it appear as though they have multiple prescribers. She also said NarxCare scores put people who see several specialists for complex chronic conditions at a disadvantage.

Bamboo Health declined requests for interviews and referred Medscape Medical News to an outside spokesperson, who said the company “won't speculate on ongoing legal matters.”

On its website, Bamboo Health stated that it makes information about their algorithms available to clients.

The company previously told Medscape Medical News that NarxCare “falls within the exclusion from FDA oversight for non-device medical software established by Congress.”

The FDA is currently taking comments in response to the citizen petition, of which more than 1000 have been made.

The implementation of PDMPs and risk scores could be considered a success, with queries by clinicians and other authorized users like pharmacists doubling from 61.5 million in 2014 to 1.4 billion in 2023, according to the American Medical Association (AMA).

Federal funding for electronic PDMPs ramped up in the early 2000s in response to the opioid epidemic, which began in the previous decade. Overdose deaths, including those from opioids, nearly quadrupled from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002 to 32.6 per 100,000 in 2022. But prescriptions for these drugs have dropped by nearly half since 2012, and deaths linked to the substances are declining.

A driver of the crisis has been the practice of “doctor shopping,” whereby patients seek multiple prescriptions for opioids from different clinicians to avoid raising suspicion about their abuse of the drugs.

The NarxCare scores were developed in part to help prevent this problem. One of the components of the scores is information on controlled substances prescribed to a patient, including opioids and sedatives. Scores range from 000 to 999.

“Pharmacists and physicians can use the thresholds as calls-to-action to further review details in the patient's prescription history in conjunction with other relevant patient health information as they attend to the patients,” said Rob Cohen, then-president of Appriss Health, which has since been rebranded as Bamboo Health, in a 2021 press release.

At least three other companies provide services for PDMPs in the 10 states where Bamboo Health does not have a foothold, including LogiCoy in Illinois; Leap Orbit in Utah, Maryland, and Nebraska; and Tyler Technologies in Wisconsin. Two states, Kentucky and New York, collect their own PDMP data.

Of the states that use Bamboo Health to run various parts of their PDMPs, more than 20 states use the NarxCare platform, according to the company.

The AMA told Medscape Medical News it has encouraged Bamboo Health to make its algorithms subject to peer review, such as through publication of a paper in a journal.

“There's a lot of people that give it much more emphasis than it should have, which is as one tool, but not something that should define whether somebody is inappropriately getting prescribed something,” said Bobby Mukkamala, the president-elect of the AMA and chair of the group's AMA Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force.

The FDA for many years has regulated some software products used in medicine. But agency leaders and lawmakers have wrestled with questions about the FDA's role in overseeing rapid advances in the field of clinician decision support.

In 2016, Congress established broad rules about regulation of these tools as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. But the law did not resolve all the questions about which kinds of decision support products the FDA should regulate and which it should leave alone.

The FDA itself concedes that the distinction between software products it can and cannot regulate is difficult to understand.

“Because a wide variety of software can be described as ‘decision support,' understanding the regulatory requirements that may apply to such software can be challenging,” the agency says on its website.

In 2022, the FDA issued a guidance document to help companies understand which clinical decision support products might trigger further scrutiny. This drew criticism from Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who said the FDA was seeking to expand its authority of the software without identifying safety concerns for justification.

The FDA in 2023 declined to act on another citizen petition filed by the nonprofit Center for US Policy, which sought to have the agencyinitiate a recall of the NarxCare platform. The center focuses on removing barriers to the treatment of pain and opioid use disorder.

In explaining that denial, the FDA said requests for the agency to initiate enforcement actions and related regulatory activity are beyond the scope of agency responses to citizen petitions. Medscape Medical Newsreviewed petition decisions by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health since July 2024 and found most were denied.

Whether the FDA will grant the petition on NarxCare or otherwise seek to expand its current regulation of AI-driven products is unclear.

President Donald Trump has signaled a preference for a more open-market for AI-driven products than for increased regulation. His administration in January revoked a 2023 executive order in which President Joe Biden encouraged the development of AI products, while also seeking safeguards against discrimination and bias. Trump's January 2025 executive order on AI directs agencies to seek ways to remove barriers to innovation in the field.

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, MD, MPH, will likely face challenges regarding the agency's stance on clinical decision support products.

Makary last year retweeted a JAMA Health Forum article in which former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said companies working on AI tools for clinical care may limit their product capabilities to avoid having their software tools classified as medical devices. Gottlieb argued for Congress to take more steps to create a more modern approach to regulation of AI devices.

“The FDA's traditional regulatory approach, which depends on the agency's capacity to meticulously examine a product's construction, might prove infeasible in this context,” Gottlieb wrote.

Makary repeated this line in a retweet of Gottlieb post on the article, which the now FDA commissioner described as a great take on how “the FDA needs to change” how it evaluates AI.

 May 22, 2025  

Stories about humans waking up from cryosleep have dominated popular culture for decades in the Alien films, Cameron's Avatar, and Nolan's Interstellar.

While these films are out there, space- and time-wise, we know the science exists offscreen.

Globally, there are about 500 people in cryogenic preservation: 300 of them in the United States. Thousands more — currently, more than 5000 — are on the waitlist for future cryonic arrangements.

The technology for human revival has yet to exist, of course, but cryopreservation as a discipline has long been used in fertility and medical research, particularly for the opportunities it presents in regenerative medicine, organ transplantation, and neuroscience.

All of this led to some exciting news: For the first time, scientists at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg in Erlangen, Germany, successfully revived adult mouse brain tissue after cryopreservation.

To do so, lead researcher Alexander German and his team knew they had to avoid damage caused by ice formation and crystallization. Traditional freezing methods involving slow cooling at a controlled rate have resulted in the significant loss of synaptic connections in neural tissue.

They instead opted for vitrification, transforming the biological tissue into a noncrystalline, amorphous, glass-like state with high cooling rates and, more importantly, a high cryoprotectant, or cryoprotective agent (CPA), concentration.

First discovered in the 1940s, cryoprotectants, or “medical-grade antifreeze,” reduce the risk of crystallization and, by extension, irreversible damage by lowering the freezing point and increasing the solution viscosity and “glass transition” temperature. On a molecular level, they can do this by reducing the concentration of electrolytes or disrupting water–water hydrogen bonds.

Animals that hibernate during the winter months produce their own type of cryoprotectants as they transition into a state of torpor. “Naturally occurring cryoprotectants in hibernating animals, such as glycerol, glucose, sorbitol, and trehalose, protect tissues against freezing injury during extended periods at subzero temperatures,” said German. “Animals such as amphibians, insects, and some reptiles accumulate these substances seasonally or in response to environmental triggers.”

“These substances act primarily as osmotic regulators, reducing intracellular ice formation by controlling cellular dehydration and managing the osmotic environment, and can also stabilize cellular membranes and proteins against damage due to cold-induced stress,” he said.

While mice are non-hibernators, they can be synthetically induced into torpor to emulate this process.

For this study, the team relied on commonly used, synthetic cryoprotectants such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol, formamide, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) — all chemicals chosen specifically for their manageable toxicity profiles and ability to prevent ice formation during rapid cooling and vitrification. “Their main function is to transition directly into a glassy state at cryogenic temperatures below −130 °C (or −202 °F) without crystallization. These temperatures do not naturally occur on Earth,” said German.

Compared with naturally produced cryoprotectants, which are generally less toxic and more compatible with cellular metabolism, synthetic cryoprotectants are usually inherently more toxic at biologically active concentrations.

German and his team developed an optimized vitrification procedure that considered potential damage caused by the following six variables:

To expand on the first variable, high concentrations of CPA have a toxic impact on cells, which increases with concentration, temperature, and exposure time. The transmembrane solute–solvent flux that occurs during concentration changes of CPA results in osmotic changes in cell volume. The team's optimized procedure had to carefully balance potential damage from both.

“Our protocol builds upon the vitrification method reported by Pichugin and colleagues in Cryobiology (2006),” said German. “We made adjustments to cryoprotectant composition, cooling and warming rates, and exposure times. Notably, we cooled samples significantly below the previously described glass transition temperature, enhancing long-term stability. Additionally, we performed rigorous electrophysiological analyses, which were absent from earlier studies.”

To neutralize CPA toxicity, German and his team tested different combinations of cryoprotectants. Combining different CPAs in a single solution would help prevent specific toxicity caused by any one CPA at a high concentration.

“We tested multiple known cryoprotectants, including DMSO, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, formamide, N-methylformamide, 3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol, sucrose, PVP K12, and Supercool X-1000 and Z-1000, examining their ability to suppress ice crystallization and minimize toxicity in tissue and cellular models,” said German. “For example, our published early observations indicated neural activity preservation with 61% ethylene glycol. Later findings demonstrated robust electrophysiological function, including long-term potentiation (LTP), using the 59% w/v [weight/volume] ‘V3' mixture.”

The team used a variant of the vitrification solution VM3, referred to as V3, which contained a mixture of DMSO, ethylene glycol, and formamide. “The V3 mixture is based on an empirical observation that the toxicity of vitrification solutions correlates with the strength of hydrogen bonding between water molecules and the polar groups of permeating cryoprotectants, as quantified by a ratio called qv.”

Once they applied the V3 cryoprotectant mixture onto mouse hippocampus slices, the researchers cooled the slices to −196 °C (or −320.8 °F) using liquid nitrogen and transferred them to a freezer at −150 °C (or −238 °F), where they were stored for a week.

When the slices were taken out, they were rewarmed in 52% V3 at −10 °C (or 14 °F). The researchers observed that no crystallization damage had taken place during cooling or rewarming.

Thanks to the cryoprotectant mixture, the slices remained glossy and transparent, and after a series of tests, the team confirmed their near-physiological recovery. There was a modest reduction in basal respiration and limited mitochondrial swelling. Synaptic connections were intact, active, and even demonstrated promising LTP, the most important indication of lasting plasticity and widely associated with learning and memory formation.

“Conclusive determination of memory retention involves whole-brain or organism-level analysis, exceeding what acute slice experiments alone can demonstrate,” said German. “Nonetheless, successful induction of LTP strongly suggests at least structural prerequisites for memory encoding remain recoverable after vitrification.”

“To prove it conclusively, they would have to use actual animals and show that following cryopreservation, not only could animals be brought back to life, but [that] learning and memory were still operational,” said João Pedro de Magalhães, PhD, a professor of molecular biogerontology at the Department of Inflammation and Aging, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England.

Nevertheless, Magalhães, who did not participate in this research, remained impressed and optimistic. “Although vitrification of brain slices from small rodents with evidence of viability and structural preservation has been done before, this is an advance in terms of functional recovery,” he said.

So, with all this in mind, can we one day wake up and find ourselves in the Alien universe?

To paraphrase Frost, we have a long way to go until we cryosleep.

Cryopreserving whole human organs — let alone an entire body — is especially difficult due to their size. It takes longer for larger organs to cool down, making them more susceptible to damage via crystallization and toxic CPA concentrations.

While the preservation and revival of hearts, livers, kidneys, and other organs of small mammals via vitrification has previously been achieved, the freezing protocol involved has led to unfavorable, ultrastructural results, according to German. Furthermore, “vitrification of the whole brain is complicated by the need to cross the blood-brain barrier with cryoprotectants,” he said.

As one of the founders of Oxford Cryotechnology, Oxford, England, a research startup dedicated to artificial intelligence–guided cryopreservation methods, Magalhães is particularly interested in how machine learning and artificial intelligence can improve cryopreservation and determine the necessary chemical formulations of cryoprotectants: The ultimate key to achieving successful revival.

“Using big data, such as genomics and data-driven approaches, we aim to identify genes and pathways that can be targeted pharmacologically to improve cryopreservation protocols,” said Magalhães. “We are trying to repurpose and develop drugs that minimize cryoprotectant toxicity, as well as develop new, safer cryoprotectants using these approaches.”

So, figuring out which cryoprotectant combinations are the safest and most effective would inform how humans can come back from cryopreservation as though it were a deep slumber. Whether we cryopreserve ourselves as a way to travel across space or to cheat death, it's important to remember that these are still major hypotheticals, albeit the most fascinating ones.

Right now, existing and direct applications of this research would arguably be more impressive and beneficial to society.

“Given the importance of organ transplants and the growing field of tissue engineering, perfecting cryopreservation methods would have a profound impact on medicine,” said Magalhães. “Low-cost, long-term organ banking through safe cryopreservation of whole organs, which could be rewarmed when needed for transplants, would equate to countless lives saved each year.”

The same can be said for the long-term storage of gametes and embryos for later use, as well as stem cells, tissues, and organs for future treatment. There's no need to look to movies when sci-fi magic is taking place right here.

 May 22, 2025  

A 25-year-old engineer was admitted to the hospital with sudden, irresistible urges for sexual gratification, leading him to seek commercial sex workers. The condition was progressive with an increasing number of sexual encounters and masturbation.

Following a detailed history and physical and mental examination, a diagnosis was established and treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

The case report by Srishti Sharma, a resident doctor in psychiatry at the Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India, and colleagues shed light on an often taboo psychiatric illness.

The patient presented to a hospital in Chandigarh, India, with a 2-year history of progressively intensifying compulsive sexual urges. Apart from encounters with commercial sex workers, he also watched pornographic content available online for about 1-2 hours at night, followed by masturbation. His frequency of visits increased from three to four times per month initially to three to four times per week over 5-6 months. He would not use a condom or any protection during intercourse.

Although he reported an urge to watch pornographic content, the act did not give him as much sexual gratification as visiting commercial sex workers. He continued to experience initial excitement during the anticipation of sexual intercourse, which perpetuated the cycle, but soon followed by feelings of guilt and worthlessness following the encounters.

He reported not being in any romantic relationship at the time of presentation. Although he is a diploma holder in mechanical engineering, he works as a cab driver. Gradually, he felt that his desire for sexual gratification was excessive and beyond his control, as he was unable to focus on his academic and professional goals due to preoccupation with thoughts of acquiring sexual pleasure.

Other psychiatric disorders, including substance use, were ruled out, and he denied having any family history of psychiatric disorders.

The patient's vital signs were measured at the time of admission. Blood pressure, oxygen saturation on room air, body temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were all within normal ranges. Physical examination revealed molluscum contagiosum. Auscultation, palpation, and percussion revealed no pathologic findings. Routine laboratory test results were unremarkable.

The patient scored 59/110 on the Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Inventory-13 (CSBI-13) and 36/40 on the Sexual Compulsivity Scale.

On the basis of the overall findings, hypersexuality was diagnosed.

Following the diagnosis, treatment was started on fluoxetine 20 mg once daily and tablet clonazepam 0.25 mg as needed. He was initially enrolled in supportive therapy sessions, which later proceeded to behavioural therapy and relaxation exercises. A dermatological consultation was arranged for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum.

Within 2 weeks of treatment initiation, the patient reported 20%-30% improvement. However, he still engaged in excessive viewing of pornographic content, followed by masturbation.

Tablet fluoxetine was increased to 40 mg/d, and after another 3 weeks, the patient reported an overall 60%-70% improvement. To achieve further progress, the focus of psychotherapy shifted to identifying the underlying causes.

In subsequent sessions, he was able to identify that the lack of a romantic partner made him feel inadequate and unworthy, and visiting commercial sex workers had become a sort of reassurance seeking.

Based on the clinical interview and therapy sessions, the patient had poor exposure to individuals of the opposite sex during his adulthood, including the absence of peer circles and women in his adolescence, which could have further led to communication deficits and anxiety in initiating conversations with them.

After 6 months of combined therapy, the patient achieved a CSBI-13 score of 31/110. The Sexual Compulsivity Scale was reduced to 13/40.

The patient reported increased confidence in his ability to attract partners as a result of therapy.

“In the Indian context, where open conversations about sex itself are generally taboo, it is imperative to explore reasons for distress and encourage healthy discussions regarding sexual disorders so that people can seek help and not just continue to live in shame and guilt, thinking that there is something inherently wrong with them and there is no solution to their problems,” the authors wrote.

 May 22, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — Low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) dietary advice has been shown to be effective in easing bloating and abdominal pain, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but limited availability of dietitians makes delivering this advice challenging. Researchers from Thailand have successfully enlisted a chatbot to help.

In a randomized controlled trial, they found that chatbot-assisted dietary advice with brief guidance effectively reduced high FODMAP intake, bloating severity, and improved dietary knowledge, particularly in patients with bothersome bloating. 

“Chatbot-assisted dietary advice for FODMAPs restriction was feasible and applicable in patients with bloating symptoms that had baseline symptoms of moderate severity,” study chief Pochara Somvanapanich, with the Division of Gastroenterology, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, told Medscape Medical News.

Somvanapanich, who developed the chatbot algorithm, presented the study results at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025. 

The trial enrolled 86 adults with disorders of gut-brain interaction experiencing bloating symptoms for more than 6 months and consuming more than seven high-FODMAPs items per week. Half of them had IBS. 

At baseline, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the ability to identify FODMAPs were assessed. All participants received a 5-minute consultation on FODMAPs avoidance from a GI fellow and were randomly allocated (stratified by IBS diagnosis and education) into two groups. 

The chatbot-assisted group received real-time dietary advice via a chatbot which helped them identify high, low, and non-FODMAP foods from a list of more than 300 ingredients/dishes of Thai and western cuisines.

The control group received only brief advice on high FODMAPs restriction. Both groups used a diary app to log food intake and postprandial symptoms. Baseline bloating, abdominal pain and global symptoms severity were similar between the two groups. Data on 64 participants (32 in each group) were analyzed.

After 4 weeks, significantly more people in the chatbot group than the control group responded — achieving a 30% or greater reduction in daily worst bloating, abdominal pain or global symptoms (19 [59%] vs 10 [31%], P < .05). Responder rates were similar in the IBS and non-IBS subgroups. 

Subgroup analysis revealed significant differences between groups only for participants with bothersome bloating, not those with mild bloating severity. 

In those with bothersome bloating severity, the chatbot group had a higher response rate (69.5% vs 36.3%) and fewer bloating symptoms (P < .05). They also had a greater reduction in high FODMAPs intake (10 vs 23 items/week) and demonstrated improved knowledge in identifying FODMAPs (P < .05).

“Responders in a chatbot group consistently engaged more with the app, performing significantly more weekly item searches than nonresponders (P < .05),” the authors noted in their conference abstract.

“Our next step is to develop the chatbot-assisted approach for the reintroduction and personalization phase based on messenger applications (including Facebook Messenger and other messaging platforms),” Somvanapanich told Medscape Medical News.

“Once we've gathered enough data to confirm these are working effectively, we definitely plan to create a one-stop service application for FODMAPs dietary advice,” Somvanapanich added. 

Commenting on this research for Medscape Medical News, Sidhartha R. Sinha, MD, Director of Digital Health and Innovation, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University in Stanford, California, noted that there is a “notable lack of robust data supporting digital health tools in gastroenterology. Despite hundreds of apps available, very few are supported by well-designed trials.”

“The study demonstrated that chatbot-assisted dietary advice significantly improved bloating symptoms, reduced intake of high-FODMAP foods, and enhanced patients' dietary knowledge compared to brief dietary counseling alone, especially in those with bothersome symptoms,” said Sinha, who wasn't involved in the study.

“Patients actively used the chatbot to manage their symptoms, achieving a higher response rate than those in the control arm who received brief counseling on avoiding high-FODMAP food,” he noted.

Sinha said in his practice at Stanford, “in the heart of Silicon Valley,” patients do use digital resources to manage their GI symptoms, including diseases like IBS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — and he believes this is “increasingly common nationally.”

“However, the need for evidence-based tools is critical and the lack here often prevents many practitioners from regularly recommending them to patients. This study aligns well with clinical practice, and supports the use of this particular app to improve IBS symptoms, particularly when access to dietitians is limited. These results support chatbot-assisted dietary management as a feasible, effective, and scalable approach to patient care,” Sinha told Medscape Medical News.

 May 22, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — Risk for postpartum psychosis is significantly higher in women who have a sister who has experienced the condition and/or has bipolar disorder (BD), a new study showed.

In a population-based cohort study of nearly 1.7 million women, those with a full sister who had had the disorder were 10 times more likely to have postpartum psychosis than those whose sister did not have it. Odds of developing the condition were doubled when a sister had BD and about 14-fold higher if a sister had both BD and postpartum psychosis.

Although rare, postpartum psychosis is considered “one of the most severe psychiatric conditions,” co-investigator Veerle Bergink, MD, PhD, professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and director of Mount Sinai's Women's Mental Health Center, New York City, and colleagues noted.

If not addressed and treated, the condition has been linked to increased risk for suicide and infanticide. But findings such as these can help clinicians identify those at potentially greater risk and make a plan, Bergink told Medscape Medical News.

“You don't have to start medication right away, but we do need to be aware” of the risk, she said.

The findings were presented on May 19 at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting and were simultaneously published online in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

Postpartum psychosis typically occurs in the first 3 months after childbirth, with onset most likely in the first month. It can also occur in women who have no history of psychiatric illness and is the leading cause of maternal deaths, the researchers noted.

If a woman shows symptoms of the condition — which include excessive energy, agitation, paranoia, confusion, and sleep problems — it should be addressed as a medical emergency, they added.

Although previous research has shown that genetic factors can contribute to increased postpartum psychosis risk, the magnitude of that contribution has been unclear.

In the current analysis, Bergink and colleagues examined data from Swedish national registers for 1,648,759 women who gave birth between January 1980 and September 2017. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of postpartum psychosis.

Results showed that 2514 of the total participants — only 0.15% — had postpartum psychosis within the first 3 months of the birth of their first child.

However, after adjusting for year and age at childbirth, the relative recurrence risk (RRR) was 10.69 for the condition in mothers with a full sister who had experienced the condition compared with mothers with a sister who had not experienced it (95% CI, 6.6-16.3; P < .001).

Still, the absolute risk for those with an affected sister was estimated at just 1.6%.

In the women diagnosed with postpartum psychosis, 49% had a history of BD, and 24% had a history of other mental health diagnoses. Prevalence of BD was 1.4% for the entire participant population.

The odds ratio (OR) for postpartum psychosis when a sister had BD was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.0; P = .04). In addition, the combined OR was approximately 14.3 when a sister had experienced postpartum psychosis while also having BD.

The RRR was also increased when a woman had a full woman cousin with postpartum psychosis, but it was not statistically significant when adjusted for birth year and age at childbirth or when adjusted for those factors plus history of BD.

“Our results provide guidance for clinicians working with pregnant women with personal or family histories of postpartum psychosis,” the investigators wrote.

Bergink noted that the condition is not currently listed as a stand-alone disorder in any version of the DSM. However, numerous research groups are collaborating to develop criteria for its inclusion in future iterations of the manual.

They propose that criteria should include experiencing at least one of the following within 3 months of childbirth, with a duration of at least 1 week or of any duration if hospitalization is necessary: Mania/mixed state, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or thoughts, and disorganized or confused behavior.

Asked during a question-and-answer session if family history screenings are currently being done among women who are pregnant, Bergink answered, “In general, no, but it should be.”

“Because of the potential negative impacts, sometimes severe, on mother and baby, this disorder needs to be identified and effectively treated,” Ned H. Kalin, MD, editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Psychiatry and professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, said in a press release.

The current study is important because it highlighted the increased risk when the condition runs in families, he told Medscape Medical News.

“It also underscores the importance of understanding that risk and of working with your OB-GYN [obstetrician-gynecologist] doctor or psychiatrist to help reduce and mitigate the risk with treatment and close observation,” Kalin said.

Although postpartum psychosis is considered quite rare, tragic aftereffects in some undiagnosed and untreated women have been widely reported in the media.

At the press briefing, Bergink shared that a medical colleague with the condition recently shot and killed herself and her baby girl.

“Unfortunately, not all cases are detected in time. At Sinai, we lost a colleague who had no psychiatric history and her baby,” she said. “That happens. And it can occur in anyone.”

Michael F. Myers, MD, chair of the APA meeting's Scientific Program Committee, shared that he was involved with two situations where patients had extreme forms of the condition, including one where a woman psychiatrist killed herself and her child.

“You hear about postpartum depression and postpartum blues. But then there's this subset that is not only dangerous to themselves but also to their baby,” Myers told Medscape Medical News. “Talking about these situations is how we bring the stigma [about the condition] out of the darkness.”

“There's a theme that having a psychiatric history is the main predictor for postpartum psychosis. But sometimes we miss it,” Misty C. Richards, MD, associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and medical director of perinatal psychiatry for the university's Maternal Outpatient Mental Health Services Clinic, said at the briefing.

She added that, as a clinician, “you do the best that you can to try to catch this early because things can become wildly out of control in the postpartum period. Infanticide should just never happen.”

She later told Medscape Medical News that the symptoms of postpartum psychosis differ from those of schizophrenia because they wax and wane and almost present as delirium. 

“So you can be lucid one minute and the next be wildly delusional. It's usually in the setting of poor sleep and severe anxiety and becomes an emergency very quickly,” Richards said.

She added that this is much more extreme than a normal response to the chaos that often occurs during the first week after delivery.

“People may think, ‘Oh, she'll shake it off and be okay.' But no. If you miss it, that's when it can be catastrophic,” she concluded.

The study was funded by grants from the Beatrice and Samuel A. Seaver Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, as well as from an Out to Innovate Career Development Fellowship. One investigator reported having served as a consultant for the Motherhood Center of New York, New York City, and another had served as a speaker for Lundbeck. Bergink and the other five investigators, as well as Richards, reported no relevant financial relationships.

 May 22, 2025  

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that patients who stop taking cetirizine (Zyrtec) or levocetirizine (Xyzal) after long-term use may experience rare but severe itching.

The agency said in a drug safety communication that between 2017 and 2023, it had received reports of 209 cases worldwide (197 in the United States) of pruritus developing within a few days of stopping cetirizine (n = 180), levocetirizine (n = 27), or both (n = 2). Patients had used the medications daily for periods ranging from 1 week to as long as 23 years, the agency said.

According to the FDA, the number of pruritus cases increased with duration of use. The itching often affected individuals' quality of life and ability to function. Serious adverse outcomes included disability, such as being bedridden (48 cases), hospitalization (3), and thoughts of suicide or self-harm (2). “The underlying mechanism for this risk is unknown, but our evaluation supports a causal relationship between stopping cetirizine or levocetirizine and pruritus,” said the agency.

Antihistamines are frequently used, with the FDA estimating that 26.8 million cetirizine and levocetirizine prescriptions were dispensed in the United States in 2022, with an additional 62.7 million over-the-counter (OTC) cetirizine and levocetirizine products bought by consumers at retail outlets. Thus, the itching “appears to be rare compared to how often the medicine is used,” said the agency.

Pruritus resolved for most people either by restarting the medication or tapering off after restarting, said the agency. The FDA will require manufacturers to add a warning to prescription and OTC labeling about the risk of itching and the potential to resolve it by restarting the medication.

The agency advised individuals planning on long-term use of either of the medications to “discuss the benefits and risks with your healthcare professional.”

Adam Friedman, MD, professor and chair of Dermatology at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, said the warning was “full of missing holes.”

The agency's warning doesn't specify the dose, what the medication was being used for, or if there were specific demographic features among those who had pruritus, Friedman told Medscape Medical News. “I really struggle with interpreting this data in a meaningful way,” he said.

He also wonders whether clinicians should be concerned about other antihistamines like loratadine or fexofenadine.

In addition, the mechanism for pruritus is a mystery, said Friedman. “If the agency is saying that people are using this who don't have any primary skin disease, have no itching, and now they're itching, I can't reconcile why that would be,” he said.

Friedman said he's concerned that the warning will scare patients away from antihistamines during the height of allergy season.

In 2016, researchers in the Netherlands reported 12 cases of intense itching described as “unbearable” pruritus after stopping levocetirizine. And in 2019, FDA staffers published an analysis of 146 cases of itching after cetirizine withdrawal in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and medical literature.

In July 2024, The People's Pharmacy said in a blog post that it had received hundreds of reports of “unbearable itching resulting from sudden discontinuation of the allergy drug cetirizine,” which it said it had discussed with the FDA. But, the group said, it never found any descriptions of a withdrawal syndrome when the drug was still prescription-only, and there was limited information on the OTC labeling.

Friedman reported having no relevant financial relationships.

During REM sleep, the body enters a state of paralysis. This can pose a danger for patients with weakened diaphragms due to neuromuscular diseases. Now new research published at the ATS 2025 International Conference has shown that antidepressants that suppress REM sleep are associated with improved survival in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The findings could support the use of medication to inhibit REM sleep in patients with ALS, and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. It's the first study to examine the role of REM sleep in ALS progression and outcomes.

This lends credence to the question of whether pharmacotherapy to inhibit REM sleep can improve the lives of patients with neuromuscular diseases, ALS in particular, who are prone to sleep disordered breathing.""

Cosmo Fowler, MD, first author, a sleep medicine fellow, Emory University

Neuromuscular diseases like ALS can weaken the diaphragm muscles, so people rely on extra support from surrounding muscles to breathe. These patients are especially vulnerable during REM (rapid eye movement), a phase of sleep associated with dreaming, because the body suppresses muscle activity. This can cause disrupted sleep, resulting in problems like daytime sleepiness and drowsy driving. In more extreme cases, it can cause serious breathing problems, ranging from hypercarbia (high carbon dioxide levels) and hypoxic respiratory failure, to full respiratory arrest and even death.

While some research has been done on how REM affects other forms of disordered breathing like obstructive sleep apnea, little was understood about its impact on neuromuscular diseases like ALS.

For the new, retrospective study, researchers analyzed a large patient database to study outcomes for ALS patients who had been prescribed antidepressants. They compared patients who received REM-suppressing antidepressants with those whose medications did not interact with REM sleep. They found that two-year survival was significantly higher for patients in the REM-suppressed group.

""I found it surprising that a clear difference in survival was so readily apparent,"" Dr. Fowler said. He added that researchers had expected to find differences in more short-term negative clinical outcomes, but thought that survival differences would be more difficult to tease out.

The findings are especially significant considering the shortage of treatment options that are effective in altering the course of ALS, he noted; current treatments are largely aimed at improving quality of life, not increasing survival.

More research, including a prospective clinical trial, is needed to support offering REM-suppressing therapies to patients with ALS, Dr. Fowler said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Leaving out numbers in medical communication may mislead patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Leaving-out-numbers-in-medical-communication-may-mislead-patients.aspx","Thu, 22 May 2025 16:24:00 GMT","

When a physician says a procedure is ""rarely risky,"" what does that really mean? Although terms like ""common"" and ""unlikely"" may sound descriptive enough, experts in medical decision-making suggest that leaving out numbers may be misleading for patients. 

In a paper published on April 29 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, a team of researchers and clinicians explained that patients often overestimate risk estimates, like possible side effects or medical conditions, when given only verbal descriptions. They encourage doctors not to shy away from including numbers, offering a list of five science-backed tricks on how to make those numbers count. 

One of the purposes of this paper is to help physicians figure out how to communicate numeric information about risks so that patients can understand and use them to make better choices, take charge of their health and be healthier long term.""

Ellen Peters, Professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication and Department of Psychology

Peters, also director of the Center for Science Communication Research at the UO, draws on two decades of research on how patients understand numbers and make decisions. She said it's a common concern that patients won't understand numerical information, as about a third of American adults have limited numerical skills. 

 
But she's found that people often prefer getting numbers. According to her previous studies, people rated messages more trustworthy and their messenger more expert when they provided data. 

In collaboration with physicians Paul K.J. Han of the National Cancer Institute and Clara N. Lee at the University of North Carolina, Peters hopes their recommended strategies will facilitate stronger shared decision-making between patients and their health care providers. 

""There's a whole raft of strategies that you can use, some of which might be more appropriate in one situation versus the other,"" she said. ""But by choosing one of them, you can help people use statistics more than they typically would. Otherwise, numbers are just abstract and meaningless."" 

Communicate with numbers, not just words 

Physicians often default to verbal terms, knowing that a sizable portion of American adults struggle with simple numeric concepts, Peters said. But research has shown that people better understand risks and react appropriately when numbers are discussed alongside verbal descriptions. 

""When you present numeric evidence, like the likelihood of side effects for a prescription medication, what ends up happening is that it helps correct people's original expectation,"" Peters said. ""They're much less likely to overestimate the risk and are more likely to take on a physician's recommendations."" 

Do: ""Headache is a common side effect and occurs in 7 percent of people."" 

Don't: ""Headache is a common side effect."" 

Make numbers more manageable 

When patients are overwhelmed by medical information, they may rely on mental problem-solving techniques, like gut feelings, pre-existing beliefs and anecdotes they've heard from others. To avoid cognitive overload, Peters suggests limiting information to what's important. If a disease has three intervention options but a patient has a condition that eliminates one as a viable option, she advises not to mention that option. 

The authors also suggest clinicians do the math for their patients. For example, they can calculate the risk of birth control based on the number of years the patient expects to use it instead of the annual risk. 

Do: Highlight only the key facts and tailor information to the patient's situation. 

Don't: Provide information that isn't relevant to a specific patient. 

Provide context to statistics 

Numbers said alone can be meaningless, so Peters suggests using evaluative labels, like ""a 6 percent risk is generally considered poor,"" or comparisons to indicate whether it's high or low risk. 

Do: ""Ninety-three percent of patients survive with treatment A compared to 99 percent who survive with treatment B."" 

Don't: ""Ninety-three percent of patients survive with treatment A."" 

Acknowledge uncertainty 

Risk information is an estimate. In some cases, being upfront about the uncertainty of whether a patient will be a part of the 40 percent side or the 60 percent side of a risk, for example, can help convey to patients how seriously they should take it. 

Do: ""Estimates of the chance of something happening are only a best guess based on the scientific knowledge we have right now. We do not know your personal real risk because of things about you that have never been studied and we don't yet understand."" 

Don't: Present numeric risk information as unerringly precise and correct. 

Test your communication through the teach-back technique 

Experts tend to overestimate how much other people know and how clearly they've communicated. So doctors can use the teach-back technique, Peters said, in which they ask their patient to repeat what they understood and found important. The physician can then insert more information to either correct what's wrong or remind them of something. 

Do: ""This can be hard to understand. I'd like to make sure I've explained it clearly. Could you tell me how you understand the pros and cons of taking drug X?"" 

Don't: ""What questions do you have?"" 

Such strategies also can be used by patients to advocate for themselves, Peters said. If told about a possible side effect, they can ask how statistically likely it is. If given too many possible side effects or treatments, they can request to simplify the information to the most important facts. 

Peters plans to conduct a series of studies to test which of the five strategies is the most effective. She also is interested in how storytelling and anecdotes affect patient decision-making. 

""Physicians have very limited time in any one appointment and are often faced with a similar patient over and over,"" Peters said. ""What that means is, if you're trying to help them better communicate with patients, you've got to provide things that are fast and scripted so that everyone can make informed decisions about their care.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study links fetal mutations to early pregnancy loss","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250521/New-study-links-fetal-mutations-to-early-pregnancy-loss.aspx","Thu, 22 May 2025 02:25:00 GMT","

In a study published in Nature today ""Sequence diversity lost in early pregnancy,"" scientists from deCODE genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen, estimate that around one in 136 pregnancies are lost due to new mutations in the fetus. In other words, millions of pregnancies worldwide are lost because of mutations every year.

The human genome varies between individuals, but there are some locations in the genome where there seems to be little or no sequence variation between individuals. This raises the question whether the sequences at these locations are essential for human development? It is known that mutations in essential genomic sequences are major contributors to neurodevelopmental disorders, the question remains, do they also contribute to pregnancy loss? 

As part of a Nordic collaboration, scientists from deCODE genetics sought to answer these questions by sequencing 467 samples from pregnancy losses from a prospective study initiated by Henriette Svarre Nielsen and Eva R. Hoffmann.

Interestingly, by comparing the genomes of the fetuses from pregnancy losses to their parents the scientists found that the fetuses harbored a similar number of new mutations as adults. 

""Despite the similar numbers, we discovered that the main difference between the lost fetuses and adults was that the mutations in the fetuses occurred in essential genomic sequences,"" says Hákon Jónsson scientist at deCODE genetics, and one of the authors on the paper.

Moreover, they managed to pinpoint when, in the development of the fetus, some of the mutations occurred. 

In addition to mapping new mutations in the lost fetuses, they also showed that some couples are at a higher risk of pregnancy loss due to genetic compatibility issues. You inherit one copy of a gene from each parent, and most of the time, you are fine with one defective copy, but problems can arise if you inherit a defective copy from both parents.

We have shown previously that for certain genes, you never observe two defective copies in adult genomes, but we found two defective copies in some of the pregnancy losses. Importantly, these involve a high risk for recurrence of pregnancy loss for the couple but can be selected against in IVF treatments."" 

Guðný A. Árnadóttir scientist at deCODE genetics, and one of the authors on the paper

Along with recombination, the continuous generation of mutations enables us to evolve as a species. However, this continuous influx of new mutations comes at the expense of rare diseases. This study demonstrates the contribution of mutations to pregnancy loss and sheds new light on conserved sequences in the human genome.

There's good news for people with migraine who take common drugs before or during pregnancy-a new study found no increase in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD in their children. The study, which looked at drugs used for migraine attacks called triptans, is published on May 21, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

The study does not prove that there is a link between these drugs and neurodevelopment disorders.

These results are encouraging for people with migraine, who may be taking these drugs before they even know that they are pregnant, and this is helpful information for their physicians, who can make more informed decisions about treating people with debilitating migraine attacks.""

Hedvig Nordeng, PhD, study author of the University of Oslo, Norway

For the study, researchers used health registry records for the entire Norwegian population and identified 26,210 pregnancies in female participants with migraine at the start of pregnancy. Of those, 21,281 people, or over 80%, had taken triptans in the year before they became pregnant and 4,929 of those with migraine had not taken any triptans during that time. For those who took the drugs, researchers divided them into four groups: people who had low use of triptans and stopped using them before pregnancy (42%); people who increased using triptans six months before pregnancy and stopped using them in early pregnancy (31%); people who had moderate triptan use before pregnancy and continued into early pregnancy (21%); and people who used triptans before and during pregnancy (6%).

Then researchers followed the children born for an average of eight years and up until they were 14 years old for some. They checked health registries for diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder, behavioral disorders, learning and intellectual disabilities, speech and language and developmental coordination disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Overall, 1,140 children, or 4.3%, were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder during the study. The most common were ADHD and speech and language disorders. A total of 2.2% of the children of people with the highest use of triptans were diagnosed with ADHD, compared to 2.1% of the children of people with migraine who did not use the drugs. A total of 1.1% of the children of people with the highest use of the drugs were diagnosed with speech and language disorders, compared to 1.0% of children of people who did not use the drugs. When researchers adjusted the results to account for other factors that could affect the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as a parent having a neurodevelopmental disorder, folic acid intake or use of other drugs such as opioids or antidepressants, they found no increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders among children exposed to triptans prenatally.

""Migraine affects almost one in five of people of childbearing age,"" Nordeng said. ""While symptoms often improve during pregnancy, about 8% of people experience worsening attacks during pregnancy, which can lead to increased risks of both maternal and fetal complications, so it's vital to have treatment options available.""

A limitation of the study was that researchers did not verify that people took their migraine medications, only that they filled their prescriptions, so the actual drug exposure may be different than the estimates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Reducing Polypharmacy with Innovative Drug Formulation Technologies","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Reducing-Polypharmacy-with-Innovative-Drug-Formulation-Technologies.aspx","Thu, 22 May 2025 09:31:00 GMT","

In this interview, NewsMedical speaks with Joanna Lipner, Co-Founder of PIKRALIDA, and Hanna Kierońska, Head of Drug Technology, about the company's approach to reducing polypharmacy, drug formulation via hot melt extrusion (HME), and the development of novel neuroprotective and orphan disease therapies.

We are a company operating under a hybrid business model. On one hand, we focus on developing innovative therapies for unmet medical needs, and on the other, we offer professional contract research organization (CRO) services to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Our development efforts center around a highly potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), which we are advancing this into therapies for conditions such as post-stroke neuroprotection and snakebite envenoming.

We're focused on two major therapeutic avenues. First, we are developing a novel neuroprotective therapy for post-stroke patients, a space that still lacks effective long-term treatments. Secondly, we are targeting an orphan disease: snakebite envenoming. It's a neglected condition in urgent need of attention, and we believe our molecule has strong potential here due to its mechanism of action.



The twin screw extruder plays a critical role in our work, especially for hot melt extrusion. This technology significantly enhances the solubility of our active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which is crucial for improving drug absorption and efficacy. It also allows us to develop fixed-dose combination therapies by embedding different APIs into a thermoplastic polymer to ensure compatibility and enable controlled release.

Hot melt extrusion enables us to formulate complex drug combinations into a single dosage form. This is particularly important for elderly patients or those with chronic conditions who often take multiple medications.

By combining therapies into one product and modifying the release profiles appropriately, we can reduce the number of different pills a patient needs, effectively addressing polypharmacy. It's a patient-centered innovation that enhances adherence and minimizes potential drug interactions.

We often work with rare or costly APIs, so we need to keep batch sizes small. A laboratory-scale extruder is ideal for minimizing API consumption while enabling efficient process development. It's also compact, which is practical for R&D labs that tend to have limited space. Most importantly, it mirrors the design of pilot and production-scale extruders, making the transition to larger-scale manufacturing straightforward and low-risk.

It's crucial. The beauty of Thermo Fisher's twin screw extruders is that their lab models are designed to closely resemble production-scale equipment. This consistency allows for seamless technology transfer. We can develop a process on a small scale and be confident it will perform similarly at manufacturing scale, which reduces development time and risk.

Yes, the versatility of the twin screw extruder extends beyond hot melt extrusion. We're also looking into methods like continuous wet granulation, pelletization, and even producing filaments for 3D printing. These options provide flexibility in dosage form development, allowing us to tailor drug delivery to specific therapeutic needs and patient groups.

I believe combining smart drug formulation technologies with precision manufacturing tools like twin screw extrusion will transform how we develop and deliver medicines. For example, the ability to reduce polypharmacy not only simplifies therapy for patients but also improves safety and outcomes.

As we explore more personalized and complex treatments, especially in orphan diseases and CNS disorders, these technologies will be indispensable.

We are moving forward with our lead candidates in both the neuroprotective and snakebite envenoming areas. At the same time, we continue supporting biotech partners through our CRO services. We're also expanding our formulation development capabilities, which will enable us to develop even more innovative dosage forms in the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Meta analysis highlights prognostic role of circPVT1 in solid tumors","http://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Meta-analysis-highlights-prognostic-role-of-circPVT1-in-solid-tumors.aspx","Thu, 22 May 2025 13:57:00 GMT","

circPVT1 has emerged as a key regulator in disease progression and clinical outcomes. However, its prognostic relevance and association with clinicopathological parameters in solid malignancies remain to be fully elucidated. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis to elucidate the clinical significance of circPVT1 in solid tumors.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI, with a cutoff date of December 31, 2024. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0 to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessing the impact of circPVT1 expression on overall survival (OS) and its association with clinicopathological characteristics.

This analysis included 27 clinical studies encompassing a total of 2,219 patients. Elevated circPVT1 expression was significantly associated with poorer OS in patients with solid tumors (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.39–2.02, P < 0.001). This association was particularly notable in lung cancer (HR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.51–2.88, P < 0.001) and osteosarcoma (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.38–1.97, P < 0.001), with similar trends observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the increased circPVT1 level was correlated with larger tumor size (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11–1.67, P = 0.004), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.22–2.00, P < 0.001), distant metastasis (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.10–2.92, P = 0.017), and advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.50–2.25, P < 0.001).

Our meta-analysis indicated that elevated circPVT1 expression levels are closely linked to unfavorable OS in tumor patients. circPVT1 has the potential to act as both a prognostic indicator and a molecular target for solid tumor therapy. Future research should focus on validating these findings through large-scale, multicenter prospective studies to further establish the clinical utility of circPVT1 in cancer management.

A study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society indicates that social engagement may help older individuals live longer.

In the study of 2,268 U.S. individuals aged 60 years and older who completed the Psychosocial and Lifestyle Questionnaires and provided blood samples in 2016, there was a strong association between engaging in social activities and a low risk of 4-year mortality. High social engagement was associated with a 42% lower mortality risk than low engagement.

Specific activities, such as charity work, engaging with grandchildren, and participation in sports or social clubs, were particularly significant predictors of a reduced risk of dying.

Also, analyses indicated that decelerated biological aging and greater physical activity levels played key roles in facilitating the beneficial relationship between social engagement and lower mortality rates.

Staying socially active is more than a lifestyle choice. It is closely linked to healthier aging and longevity. These results underscore how participating in community life contributes to better health in older adults.""

In women with dense breasts (breasts with relatively low levels of fatty tissue) and a negative mammogram, supplemental imaging techniques detect early-stage cancers, with imaging techniques three times more effective than ultrasound, finds a phase 3 randomized control trial published in The Lancet.

Women with extremely dense breasts, about 10% of those aged 50-70 years in the UK, face a fourfold increased risk of breast cancer compared to those with the least dense breasts. Mammograms are less effective for detecting early-stage cancer in dense breasts, as the tissue can hide tumors on the breast x-rays. Previous studies have shown MRI and ultrasound are effective supplementary imaging methods, but this study is the first to compare them with contrast mammography in women with normal mammograms and dense breast tissue.

Over 9000 women in the UK with dense breasts and a negative mammogram were randomly allocated to one of three different supplementary techniques. The cancer detection rate for the imaging techniques was 1.7% (for a fast MRI) and 1.9% (for contrast mammography), whilst the cancer detection rate for the ultrasound group was 0.4%.

Authors highlight that although this study shows the scans can detect additional small cancers which are likely to save lives, further research is needed to confirm whether they could reduce the number of deaths due to breast cancer, to establish the risk of overdiagnosis and to estimate the cost benefit ratio of implementing a supplemental imaging strategy for breast cancer screening.

In addition to the relevance for the UK's breast cancer screening programme, this study has global implications for all countries where screening is undertaken for women with dense breast tissue.""

Kevin Hines has been living in a house without a roof in the days since a tornado devastated his community. He has seen some of his neighbors sleeping in their cars. A different man has spent untold hours on a bench.

In the aftermath of the May 16 tornado, Hines, 60, has a blue tarp covering his home. Still, rain came in three days later — an expected problem in a house without a roof. But he didn't think wildlife would be an issue. Then a bird landed on his television. He spotted a squirrel on the sofa.

He already has enough to handle. He's not sure when his home will be repaired. A toppled tree destroyed the purple Jeep he bought only months ago. His job told employees not to come into work because the building was damaged.

The tornado cut a 23-mile-long path, touching down in the affluent suburb of Clayton, Missouri, before ripping through the north side of the city of St. Louis then across the Mississippi River through communities in western Illinois. At least five people were killed, 38 more were injured, and about 5,000 structures were damaged, according to St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer. The twister caused more than $1.6 billion in estimated property damage.

While the impact was felt throughout the area, it will take some neighborhoods longer than others to recover. Kayla Reed, a community activist who runs the Action St. Louis nonprofit, which is coordinating help for storm victims, said residents in the predominantly Black area known as North City especially face a long set of challenges in the days ahead.

""A natural disaster met a created one and a systemic one,"" Reed said. ""They've sort of been in a long-term storm all of their lives. If you live in this footprint, you know this is where infant mortality is highest. This is where incarceration rates are highest. This is where poverty rates are highest.""

Food and water aid provide some relief, Reed said, but the community needs more than that. “I can't put into words how long it's going to take to stabilize some of these families and how much trauma they are navigating,"" she said.

A possible source of major aid is the federal government, which can unlock resources at the president's discretion. But Missouri is already waiting for President Donald Trump to approve federal assistance for damage left by three sets of storms in March and April that killed 19 people in the state. Trump has denied major disaster requests from West Virginia and Washington this year, and initially denied one for storm and tornado damage in Arkansas before reversing course and approving the request May 13.

Black families here in North St. Louis are worried that their community will not be prioritized.

On May 19, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, requested that Trump issue a federal emergency declaration, which would authorize about $5 million in federal assistance for cleanup efforts. Kehoe also requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency conduct a preliminary damage assessment, a necessary step to securing a ""major disaster declaration,"" which would provide federal resources for homeowners and renters, reimburse local government efforts, and pay for damaged public infrastructure.

FEMA was on the ground two days later helping conduct damage assessments. But a disaster declaration could take weeks, if it comes.

""Bringing FEMA in, it's my understanding, is not going to be a quick process,"" the mayor said at a May 21 press conference. ""All elected officials at every level here are doing everything they can to make that process as quick as possible.""

That includes Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who asked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during an oversight hearing May 20 to help expedite the pending aid requests from Missouri's three previous storms and for the recent tornado. “Yes, absolutely,"" she responded.

While the city waits, thousands of volunteers have shown up to the parking lot of the YMCA's O'Fallon Park Rec Complex in North St. Louis in what they are calling the ""People's Response"" to help residents in need. So far, they've helped more than 5,000 families. Volunteers have collected more than 17,280 pounds of food, according to Action St. Louis.

The last time such an outpouring occurred around here, according to locals, was in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. Rasheen Aldridge, an alderman who represents part of the storm-affected area, said some of the same activists who showed up then made it a point to help now.

Hines, too, looked for ways to help his neighbors. He became an unofficial traffic director at the YMCA as thousands of cars streamed into the area to get help — or provide it.

""It's not about me,"" Hines said. ""I'm staying until no one is here because there's nothing to do at my house. I have no power.""

Residents in North City described the moments after the storm as chaos: trees down everywhere; power lines damaged; limited cellphone service, making it hard to connect with loved ones. Then the sun went down, cloaking corners of the city in complete darkness.

Five days after the tornado, people still needed candles, flashlights, and batteries to make it through the night. Piles of debris filled street corners. Exterior walls were ripped off homes, exposing the inside of closets, bedrooms, and living rooms to passersby on the street. Some buildings were leveled. The downed trees in the tornado's path left a scar in the city's canopy visible from miles away.

The tornado flipped a semitrailer outside a new gas station and strip mall that had been scheduled to open this fall. One evening, Charles Stanford, a security guard for the property, sat in the parking lot to make sure no one tried to enter what remained of the building. Stanford said the project had been nearly complete. Now, it is surrounded by rubble and debris.

A giant tree crashed into the house of one of Hines' neighbors. He said the woman recently had heart surgery and had been recovering at home. But then she went back to the hospital, and he thinks stress after the tornado may be why. Hines was planning to bring her a few Hershey's Kisses, her favorite candy, to lift her spirits.

Shannette BoClair, 52, said she found her infirm father, Albert Noble, on the floor in the fetal position after the tornado passed her parents' home. A window had imploded and strong winds knocked him down. BoClair called 911 but, she said, first responders were overwhelmed by calls for help and tree-blocked streets. Her father needed medical attention right away, she said, so his family helped him hobble a mile to his grandson, who drove him to a triage station that had been set up for tornado victims.

They learned he had broken his hip, she said. He had surgery within days.

BoClair, who works as a health and wellness director at the YMCA, said she's helping care for her mother, who remained at home after the storm. BoClair is depending on meals provided by volunteers and staffers at the YMCA but said she had also spent about $500 on DoorDash meals to feed her family since the tornado hit.

As far as federal aid goes, BoClair said she hopes it comes soon. The community needs dumpsters for the debris, reconstruction, and more.

But the outpouring of support from volunteers amazed her. The People's Response drew so many volunteers that lines of cars snaked outside of the YMCA parking lot in North City. The smell of barbecue wafted through the air as residents without electricity grilled food for one another before it spoiled.

""I'm so proud of our community,"" BoClair said. ""They say we don't care. We do care.""

Reed said volunteers would be stationed in the YMCA's parking lot for a few more days. But, she said, that doesn't mean the job ends there. The community will need more help to rebuild.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study identifies populations at risk for high-dose opioid prescriptions","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250521/Study-identifies-populations-at-risk-for-high-dose-opioid-prescriptions.aspx","Thu, 22 May 2025 02:47:00 GMT","

Researchers from the University of Missouri School of Medicine have shed light on what populations are more likely to be prescribed a high dose of opioid medication. This increases their risk of developing opioid use disorder.

Opioids like hydrocodone or oxycodone are typically prescribed to relieve intense pain. A prescription can become an addiction; side effects include building a tolerance to the medication – so the patient has to take a higher dose to feel relief – or becoming physically dependent on the drug. These effects can happen quickly, even when taking opioids as prescribed.

Many factors increase the risk of developing opioid use disorder. These include the severity of pain itself, how long opioids are used, their dosage and other medical conditions, such as neurologic or mental health disorders.""

Mirna Becevic, study author 

To determine the populations most at-risk, Becevic and her team combed through over 3 million records of Medicaid claims in Missouri from 2017 to 2021. The study had a total of 306,432 observations, which was compared against 2018 USA census data and data from 2020 detailing the primary care shortage.

Becevic and her team found that male patients and people in the middle age range up to 60 years old were more likely to be prescribed a high dose of opioids. They observed a more conservative prescribing pattern for younger adults, which may be because of increased awareness about the opioid epidemic.

""Incidence of chronic pain increases with age, which may have affected the prescribing patterns we saw,"" Becevic said. ""Interestingly, the risk of prescription past age 60 sharply declined, though this could be because of the increased risk of adverse effects and potential drug interactions.""

Researchers also determined that areas with the largest risk of high-dose opioids correlated with areas that tended to be more urban and had higher percentages of veterans and primary care providers.

""These findings emphasize the need for public health strategies to address the opioid crisis,"" Becevic said. ""Opportunities are available for clinicians interested in learning more about evidence-based treatment for pain and opioid use disorder, including our Show Me ECHO program.""

While current clinical guidelines say high-dose opioids prescriptions should be avoided, it remains a common practice in certain areas. Since the study used only Missouri data, Becevic says the findings may not be relevant to other populations in the United States.

""Other states and regions have their own unique demographics, policies and health care access,"" Becevic said. ""Further studies should investigate long-term trends and why doctors prescribe high-dose opioids. Our study's findings, however, help identify risk factors for all Missouri patients.""

Mirna Becevic, PhD is an assistant professor of dermatology at the MU School of Medicine. Her research focuses on telemedicine and telehealth.

""Identifying high-dose opioid prescription risks using machine learning: A focus on sociodemographic characteristics"" was recently published in the Journal of Opioid Management. In addition to Becevic, MU study authors include Olabode Ogundele, PhD, with the Institute for Data Science and Informatics and the Missouri Telehealth Network; Butros Dahu, PhD, with the Institute for Data Science and Informatics; Praveen Rao, PhD, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science; Xing Song, PhD, assistant professor of Biomedical Informatics, Biostatistics and Medical Epidemiology; Timothy Haithcoat, PhD, assistant teaching professor of Data Science and Analytics; and Tracy Greever-Rice, PhD, Director of the MU Center for Health Policy. Other authors include Mutiyat Hameed, from SSM Health, and Douglas Burgess, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at University of Missouri – Kansas City.

Women who choose to stop treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are putting their health at risk, and have to weigh their desire to have children and breastfeed against a risk that we know very little about. In two ongoing clinical trials, researchers establish a new standard for human lactation studies that includes sampling of breast milk and plasma from both mothers and breastfed infants.

The lack of scientific evidence is an ethical problem for women and doctors, considering that around 70 percent of women need to use medicines sometime during their pregnancy. In many cases, women are recommended to refrain from breastfeeding or stop using their medicines. However, breastfeeding has benefits for both mother and child.""

Mats G. Hansson, senior professor of biomedical ethics, Uppsala University's Centre for Research Ethics & Bioethics, head of two ongoing clinical trials

95 percent of all medicines have not been studied well enough to include safety information for pregnancy and breastfeeding on the label. The current standard for lactation studies uses animal data and concentrations of medicines in mother's milk, using PB/PK to estimate how much of a particular substance transfers to the baby. The studies that exist are old and rely on data from very few individuals, with old analysis methods.

BMJ Open has just published a protocol for a new golden standard for clinical lactation studies, looking at the concentration of prednisolone in the mother's milk, and plasma from both mother and infant. Prednisolone is prescribed for several conditions, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, a chronic and debilitating condition that requires long-term treatment.

Samples are biobanked and analyzed with regard to pharmacokinetic properties of the medicines and transfer from breast milk to infant plasma. The present studies are focusing on prednisolone, used in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, and metformin, used in the treatment of type 2 Diabetes. With biobanking and the obtainment of informed consent for future, yet unspecified research, the protocol opens for long-term follow up of medication effects on breastfeeding infants.

Women are recruited through a network of clinical centres in Sweden, and the samples are stored for future research in a network of breast milk biobanks managed by BBMRI-ERIC. According to Mats G. Hansson, this ensures the study is part of a larger European infrastructure, making future research possible.

The just-published protocol was developed within the large European collaboration framework ConcePTION, and describes how samples are collected and analyzed.

Scientists have identified unique metabolic fingerprints in blood and urine that can objectively track ultra-processed food intake, paving the way for more accurate diet studies and new tools for public health.

Study: Identification and validation of poly-metabolite scores for diets high in ultra-processed food: An observational study and post-hoc randomized controlled crossover-feeding trial. Image Credit: Rimma Bondarenko / Shutterstock

With ultra-processed foods (UPFs) now accounting for over 50% of daily calories for many Americans, researchers are searching for biological clues in blood and urine that can objectively measure UPF intake. In a recent study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, researchers from the United States (U.S.) and Brazil aimed to identify specific patterns of metabolites—tiny molecules in the body—that serve as reliable markers of UPF consumption.

The study focused on an older, predominantly White U.S. population, which may limit the generalizability of its findings to other demographic groups.

Ultra-processed foods, such as packaged snacks, sugary drinks, and ready-to-eat meals, are widely consumed worldwide, especially in the U.S. These foods are mainly made from refined ingredients and additives and are linked to a growing number of health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.

While dietary surveys help track eating habits, they often rely on memory and self-reporting, which can introduce inaccuracies. Furthermore, the Nova classification system, which categorizes foods by their level of processing, requires detailed data that is not always available in food tracking tools. As a result, assessing UPF consumption reliably has become challenging in large-scale studies.

Scientists are now turning to metabolomics, the study of metabolites or the small molecules present in blood and urine due to metabolic processes, to find biomarkers that reflect actual dietary intake.

To identify biological markers linked to UPF intake, the researchers used data from the IDATA Study, which followed 1,082 adults aged 50 to 74 years. Of these, 718 participants had both dietary and biological data and were included in the metabolomics analysis.

The participants were required to complete up to six web-based 24-hour dietary recalls over a year. Foods were classified according to the Nova system, which sorts food items into four groups based on their level of processing. The researchers then calculated the percentage of total energy intake from UPFs.

Blood samples and two types of urine samples (24-hour and first morning void) were collected at two different time points, six months apart. The samples underwent metabolomics analysis using advanced mass spectrometry techniques to identify over 1,000 compounds from various chemical groups such as lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and vitamins.

Statistical analyses were performed to determine correlations between UPF intake and the metabolites, adjusting for factors like age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. The researchers then used statistical tools to identify a combination of metabolites (poly-metabolite scores) that could best predict UPF intake. These scores were built separately for blood, 24-hour urine, and first-morning urine samples.

To test whether these scores were reliable, the team then used data from a previous crossover feeding trial. In this controlled setting, 20 adults consumed diets with either 80% or 0% UPF for two weeks each. Blood and urine samples from this trial were analyzed using the same methods, allowing researchers to compare how the poly-metabolite scores changed between diets. This helped confirm whether the scores could detect actual dietary differences in real time.

It should be noted that dietary recalls and biospecimen collection were not always precisely paired in time, which may affect the interpretation of some results. Additionally, the feeding trial sample size was small, and the study was not powered for disease outcomes.

The study found that blood and urine contain distinct metabolic signatures that reflect a person's UPF consumption. The researchers identified hundreds of compounds that were either more or less abundant depending on UPF intake. Using this information, they developed poly-metabolite scores—combinations of selected metabolites—that successfully predicted an individual's UPF consumption.

Specifically, 191 metabolites in blood and 293 in 24-hour urine showed strong correlations with UPF intake. These included amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and compounds from food additives or packaging materials. Notably, four metabolites were robust indicators across both blood and urine: (S)C(S)S-S-methylcysteine sulfoxide, N2,N5-diacetylornithine, pentoic acid (all negatively associated with UPF), and N6-carboxymethyllysine (positively associated). The latter, which is linked to advanced glycation end-products, is also associated with diabetes and heart disease.

The identified metabolic signatures reflect not only high UPF intake but also a lower intake of whole foods, including fruits and vegetables. For example, lower β-cryptoxanthin, a marker of fruit and vegetable consumption, was observed in those with higher UPF intake.

When tested in a controlled trial where participants consumed high- and no-UPF diets, these poly-metabolite scores reliably distinguished between diet phases within individuals. This showed that the scores worked not just in observational settings but also under tightly regulated conditions. The discrimination ability of these scores was moderate (AUCs of 0.66–0.78), suggesting further refinement is needed for use in diverse populations.

Furthermore, the results confirmed that high UPF intake is associated with lower levels of beneficial compounds like β-cryptoxanthin, found in fruits and vegetables, and higher levels of certain xenobiotics — foreign substances likely from food additives or packaging. This supported the idea that UPF-heavy diets may lack essential nutrients while introducing potentially harmful compounds.

The metabolic pathways associated with UPF intake included not only xenobiotic metabolism, but also amino acid, lipid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism, highlighting the broad biological impact of dietary patterns high in UPFs.

In summary, the study provided strong evidence that blood and urine metabolites can serve as objective indicators of UPF intake. The researchers developed and validated poly-metabolite scores for blood and urine samples, and the scores consistently reflected habitual dietary patterns.

The findings offer a promising tool for objectively measuring UPF intake in future health studies. However, the scores need further evaluation in more diverse and younger populations, and their predictive value for long-term health outcomes remains to be established. While more work is needed to adapt these scores to diverse populations, the results mark an important step toward better tools for nutrition research and public health monitoring.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Neurologic disorders are the leading cause of illness and disability as a result of increased life expectancy and global population aging, highlighting the urgent need and great challenge for discovering neuroprotective agents with better efficacy and minimal side-effects.

Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside derived from Rehmanniae Radix, has therapeutic potential in neurologic diseases due to its diverse biological activities. This review summarizes the research advances and therapeutic potential of catalpol for a wide range of neurologic disorders, including depression, cognitive impairment, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

A comprehensive discussion of experimental models used, dosages, duration of treatment, and mechanisms involved is provided. The common mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of catalpol on these neurologic disorders are closely related to antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, as well as the capacity to promote neuroplasticity and neurogenesis.

Despite the promising results from experimental studies, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as identifying direct binding targets, assessing toxicologic effects, and understanding pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, well-designed and controlled clinical trials should be conducted to validate the efficacy and safety for treating various neurologic conditions. This review provides compelling evidence supporting catalpol as a promising natural neuroprotective agent.

This article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are revolutionizing drug discovery, cutting costs, accelerating timelines, and enabling rapid breakthroughs through automation and predictive modeling.

Traditionally, developing a new drug takes many years and requires a massive financial investment, often involving significant risk and a high likelihood of failure. AI models trained on extensive data sets, sophisticated mathematical models, and advanced computational algorithms have been developed in an effort to directly address these inefficiencies.

Pharmaceutical companies worldwide are increasingly using AI to predict clinical trial outcomes, identify therapeutic targets, and optimize molecular designs. Technologies such as AlphaFold from DeepMind, which accurately predicts three-dimensional (3D) protein structures, and generative AI platforms that design medicinal molecules exemplify the transformative role of AI in drug discovery.

Although the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved an AI-generated drug for human use, several compounds developed through AI, such as treatments for fragile X syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are currently being investigated in clinical trials.1

Drug discovery remains a challenging, costly, and time-intensive process. In fact, current estimates indicate that the approval of a single new drug typically costs about $2.8 billion USD and takes approximately 12 to 15 years.



Drug discovery and development. The main stages are represented in a highly simplified manner. The process varies depending on the molecular mechanisms expected to be linked to the disease and the type of therapeutic agents that needs to be developed. The approximate cost is around US $2.8 billion and the time needed to complete the entire process is around 12–15 years.2

The drug discovery process comprises multiple stages, beginning with basic research to identify therapeutic targets linked to specific diseases. Scientists then screen large numbers of potential compounds through computational methods, laboratory assays, and animal models. Despite rigorous preclinical testing, high failure rates persist, particularly during human clinical trials, where many drug candidates fail due to unforeseen toxicity or inefficacy.2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for accelerated drug development, which required revolutionary technologies like AI to expedite target validation and compound screening. Nevertheless, advancements in this area have been limited due to the lack of complete data, combined with biological complexity and stringent regulatory requirements, all of which emphasize the urgent need for more efficient and innovative solutions to enhance the speed, affordability, and success rate of drug discovery processes.2

Robotics has transformed laboratory practices, particularly in drug discovery, by utilizing automated platforms for tasks such as liquid handling and high-throughput screening (HTS). Advanced robotic systems enable precise and rapid screening of vast compound libraries, significantly enhancing efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

At the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chemical Genomics Center, robotic automation facilitates quantitative HTS (qHTS), where multiple compound concentrations are simultaneously tested to generate comprehensive concentration-response data. This robotic system incorporates precise liquid dispensers, multifunctional robotic arms, and sophisticated software capable of handling complex assay workflows, thereby reducing manual intervention, reagent consumption, and human error.3,4

Several companies and institutions exemplify this automation trend. Insilico Medicine, for example, combines robotics with AI to expedite compound identification and drug development, whereas Evotec employs robotic platforms for efficient large-scale biochemical screening. Emerging lab automation startups are further advancing robotic technologies by integrating microfabrication and adaptive handling mechanisms to enhance system speed and reliability.3,4

Robotic systems are associated with numerous advantages, including increased throughput, reproducibility, and operational consistency. For example, robotic systems at the NIH have generated millions of concentration-response curves from various assays, which improves the reliability of screening data for chemical probe identification. These platforms are also designed to accommodate diverse assay formats, including cell-based, biochemical, and complex multi-step procedures.3,4

AlphaFold accelerates target identification by accurately predicting protein structure from amino acid sequences. Likewise, BenevolentAI integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms to discover new drug targets and rapidly progress them into clinical trials. Atomwise employs neural networks to perform virtual screening to identify molecules with high binding affinity to targets.5,6

A flow chart of the role of AI in drug development3

Combining AI with robotics creates closed-loop discovery systems that automate and optimize drug discovery cycles. These platforms perform iterative tasks, including hypothesis generation, automated experimentation, analysis, and refinement, which collectively increase research speed, scale, and consistency.5,6

Techniques like graph neural networks and reinforcement learning further enhance molecule generation and optimization. Ultimately, AI-driven drug discovery promises improved efficiency and personalized treatments tailored to individual patient needs, accelerating the translation of novel therapies from laboratories into clinical practice.5,6

Complex neural networks, which are often described as ""black boxes,"" are difficult to validate, which creates uncertainty around their predictions. Addressing these concerns requires the simplification of AI architectures by removing redundant neural network layers without losing accuracy, thereby increasing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI models.5,6

Another ethical concern regarding AI and machine learning (ML) is data bias, which can lead to inaccurate outcomes, especially when algorithms are trained on non-representative or incomplete datasets. This bias has the potential to reinforce health disparities, rather than reduce them.

Regulatory agencies like the United States FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) are adapting their frameworks to remain aligned with these rapidly advancing technologies. Nevertheless, recently proposed legislation struggles to address AI's dynamic and self-learning nature, especially in generative models that continuously produce new data.

Ethical questions are also becoming increasingly prominent, including who is responsible when an AI-driven medical error occurs. There is also growing concern over data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and long-term societal impact.7

Flexible yet rigorous regulations, global cooperation, and clear ethical guidelines are essential to ensure the safe, effective, and equitable deployment of AI-ML in healthcare.

The pharmaceutical landscape is witnessing a surge in collaborations between technology firms and pharmaceutical companies. These partnerships are fostering innovation through advanced data analytics, automation, and computational modeling. The startup ecosystem is also increasingly contributing fresh perspectives and agile development models.

To thrive in this evolving field, expertise in data science, automation operations, and AI-based modeling is becoming essential. As AI tools are embedded in research workflows, the future promises more efficient, precise, and patient-specific drug development.8

AI and robotics are not replacing scientists; rather, these technologies are empowering researchers to work faster and more efficiently. Together, humans and machines form a hybrid model that is redefining drug discovery.

Whereas scientists bring creativity, clinical insight, and ethical oversight, AI accelerates data analysis, and robotics automates repetitive lab work. This collaboration shortens timelines, reduces costs, and increases precision.

As these technologies continue to evolve, the future of pharmaceutical research will be shaped by a synergy between human intelligence and ML. Ultimately, this hybrid approach promises faster, more personalized, and accessible therapies for patients worldwide.

ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland. Players will begin reporting June 1 to Chicago to start preparation for the summer.

The matches will provide the USMNT with one of its few opportunities to face European opposition before the World Cup and will serve as the team's final tune-up before competing in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

“As we continue preparations for the World Cup, this is a fantastic opportunity to work with this group of players for an extended period and it's important we take advantage of every moment we have together,” Pochettino said. ""Of course, we want to win and to perform in a very good way. These players have earned the chance to compete for our fans and to show their quality and mentality.”

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET, with the match broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock. [TICKETS]Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca-Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local) and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo, and Peacock. [TICKETS]

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary on USMNT matches for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call.

Fans can follow the @USMNT on X and Instagram and U.S. Soccer on Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

GOALKEEPERS (4): Matt Freese (New York City FC; 0/0), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids; 30/0), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace/ENG; 51/0)

Chris Richards and Matt Turner joined former USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard as the only U.S. internationals to win the prestigious FA Cup in England. Crystal Palace defeated powerhouse Manchester City in the Final at famed Wembley Stadium in London last Saturday.

Malik Tillman and Sergiño Dest are Dutch league champions once again with PSV Eindhoven, the club having a remarkable late season surge capped off by a victory on the final matchday to capture their second straight title.

Brenden Aaronson had his best season in England, helping propel Leeds United to the top spot in the English League Championship and a return to the Premier League.

Meantime, 20-year-old striker Damion Downs tied for the team leading scoring as FC Köln finished first in the league and will be back in the German Bundesliga next season.

The U.S. roster boasts loads of scoring talent. With eight goals in 10 matches, Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White is tied for third in the MLS Golden Boot race, while Diego Luna sits one behind with seven goals in 13 appearances this season.

Veteran attacker Brenden Aaronson pocketed nine goals and two assists in 46 matches, while first-time call-up Damion Downs tallied 10 goals in 29 matches.

Striker Haji Wright collected 12 goals and one assist in 29 matches as Coventry City fell just short of Premier League promotion.

Malik Tillman finished second on the scoring charts for PSV, tallying 12 goals including the insurance strike in the 3-1 win away to Sparta Rotterdam on the final match day to secure PSV's championship title.

Meanwhile, first-time call-up Quinn Sullivan's seven assists in 14 matches for the Philadelphia Union leave him tied for second league wide. 

Several familiar faces make their return to the USMNT. After recovering from a ruptured ACL, Sergiño Dest returns to camp for the first time since helping the USA claim the Concacaf Nations League title in March 2024.

Following an injury, forward Folarin Balogun is back for the first time since September 2024. A dual national of England the United States, his first goal for the U.S. came in the 2-0 win against Canada in the final of the 2023 Concacaf Nations League.

The roster features five exciting young prospects, including first-time call-ups in defenders Alex Freeman and Quinn Sullivan, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and forward Damion Downs. 

Freeman is the son of former Green Packers All-Pro wide receiver and Super Bowl champion Antonio Freeman. Sebastian Berhalter has been one of the MVP performers for Vancouver Whitecaps in leading them to the Concacaf Champions Cup final, which included back-to-back victories against Inter Miami in the semifinal. Downs, a dual national of Germany and the United States, grew up playing football in Texas before moving to Germany.

Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS Next Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. He's made the most of the opportunity, already collecting three goals in four matches.

“Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break.

""After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season,” U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said.

COLUMBUS –U.S. Soccer today announced that Columbus Crew goalkeeper Patrick Schulte and midfielders Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki were selected by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino for the squad's June training camp in Chicago, Ill. ahead of two friendlies against Türkiye (at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, East Hartford, Conn. on June 7) and Switzerland (at Geodis Park, Nashville, Tenn. on June 10). The Crew lead the way with three players receiving call-ups to the USMNT's upcoming camp.

The deadline for final rosters for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is Wednesday, June 4. The USMNT will play its Group D matches against Trinidad and Tobago (at PayPal Park, San Jose, Calif. on June 15), Saudi Arabia (at Q2 Stadium, Austin, Texas on June 19) and Haiti (at AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas on June 22).

Arfsten has made three appearances (two starts) for the USMNT and earned his first cap on Jan. 18, playing 65 minutes in a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. Most recently, the Fresno, Calif. native represented the U.S. at the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League Finals, earning the start against Canada in the Third Place match on March 23. In 2025, Arfsten has started 13 MLS matches for the Crew, recording six goal contributions (three goals, three assists), including the game-winning goal against the San Jose Earthquakes on April 26.

Owning three caps with the USMNT, Schulte made his senior debut against Slovenia on Jan. 20, 2024, when he played 90 minutes and registered three saves. He recorded his first win for the U.S. on Jan. 18 during a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. The St. Charles, Mo., native represented the United States in the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he started all four U.S. matches and became the first active MLS player to record a shutout at the Olympics. Bolstered by his performance, the Americans reached the knockout rounds for the first time in 24 years.

This season, Schulte has started 13 MLS fixtures, notched two clean sheets and tallied 32 saves. The goalkeeper ranks second all-time for the Club in regular season wins by a goalkeeper with 39 in his 71 appearances.

Zawadzki previously took part in the USMNT's 2024 January Camp, recording his first start against Slovenia on Jan. 20. The Olmsted Falls, Ohio native has started 13 of the Black & Gold's MLS matches this season, notching two goals, highlighted by equalizing goal against the Philadelphia Union on May 10 in the 90'+3' minute of the contest.

Coverage of the USA's match against Türkiye begins at 3:30 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo and Peacock. The USMNT's match against Switzerland  will kick off at 8 p.m. ET and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo and Peacock.

During the nation's January camp, Robinson captained the States senior team in a 3-1 friendly win against Venezuela on January 18 at Chase Stadium.

POCHETTINO NAMES 27-PLAYER ROSTER FOR TRAINING CAMP AHEAD OF JUNE MATCHES AGAINST TURKEY AND SWITZERLAND

USA Hosts Turkey in East Hartford on June 7 Nearly One Year Before World Cup Comes to North America; Send-Off for Gold Cup on June 10 in Nashville for USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca Cola

ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland. Players will begin reporting June 1 to Chicago to start preparation for the summer.

The matches will provide the USMNT with one of its few opportunities to face European opposition before the World Cup and will serve as the team's final tune-up before competing in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

“As we continue preparations for the World Cup, this is a fantastic opportunity to work with this group of players for an extended period and it's important we take advantage of every moment we have together,” Pochettino said. ""Of course, we want to win and to perform in a very good way. These players have earned the chance to compete for our fans and to show their quality and mentality.”

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET, with the match broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock. [TICKETS]

Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local) and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo, and Peacock. [TICKETS]

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary on USMNT matches for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call.

Fans can follow the USMNT on X (@USMNT), Instagram (@USMNT), Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

CAMPEONES!
Chris Richards and Matt Turner joined former USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard as the only U.S. internationals to win the prestigious FA Cup in England. Crystal Palace defeated powerhouse Manchester City in the Final at famed Wembley Stadium in London last Saturday.

Malik Tillman and Sergiño Dest are Dutch Eredivisie champions once again with PSV Eindhoven, the club having a remarkable late season surge capped off by a victory on the final matchday to capture their second straight title.

Brenden Aaronson had his best season in England, helping propel Leeds United to the top spot in the English League Championship and a return to the Premier League. 

Meantime, 20-year-old striker Damion Downs tied for the team scoring lead as FC Köln finished first in the league and will be back in the German Bundesliga next season.

PLENTY OF FIREPOWER
The U.S. roster boasts loads of attacking talent. With eight goals in 10 matches, Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White is tied for third in the MLS Golden Boot race, while Diego Luna sits one behind with seven goals in 13 appearances this season.

Veteran attacker Brenden Aaronson pocketed nine goals and two assists in 46 matches, while first-time call-up Damion Downs tallied 10 goals in 29 matches.

Striker Haji Wright collected 12 goals and one assist in 29 matches as Coventry City fell just short of Premier League promotion.

Malik Tillman finished second on the scoring charts for PSV, tallying 12 goals including the insurance strike in the 3-1 win away to Sparta Rotterdam on the final match day to secure PSV's championship title.

Meanwhile, first-time call-up Quinn Sullivan's seven assists in 14 matches for the Philadelphia Union leave him tied for second league wide.

WELCOME BACK
Several familiar faces make their return to the USMNT. After recovering from a ruptured ACL, Sergiño Dest returns to camp for the first time since helping the USA claim the Concacaf Nations League title in March 2024.

Following an injury, forward Folarin Balogun is back for the first time since September 2024. A dual national of England the United States, his first goal for the U.S. came in the 2-0 win against Canada in the final of the 2023 Concacaf Nations League.

FRESH FACES
The roster features four exciting young prospects who are receiving their first call-ups: defenders Alex Freeman and Quinn Sullivan, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and forward Damion Downs. 

Freeman is the son of former Green Packers All-Pro wide receiver and Super Bowl champion Antonio Freeman. Sebastian Berhalter has been one of the MVP performers for Vancouver Whitecaps in leading them to the Concacaf Champions Cup final, which included back-to-back victories against Inter Miami in the semifinal. Downs, a dual national of Germany and the United States, grew up playing football in Texas before moving to Germany.

WELCOME HOME
Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special place in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS Next Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. He's made the most of the opportunity, already collecting three goals in four matches.

US men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named 16 MLS players to his 27-man roster for a pair of June friendlies before this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.

MLS call-ups are bolded above.

In the build-up to the Gold Cup, the USMNT will host a pair of tune-up contests against European foes Türkiye and Switzerland. Both opponents reached the quarterfinals at the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament.

The Pochettino-led USMNT begin their Gold Cup slate on June 15 against Trinidad & Tobago at San Jose Earthquakes' PayPal Park, before closing Group D play against Saudi Arabia and Haiti. Each group's top two sides reach the knockout phase.

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup looming, the Gold Cup provides a crucial opportunity for the USMNT to rebound after coming up short in the Concacaf Nations League last March.

Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna continues to thrive after being named the 2024 MLS Young Player of the Year, already scoring seven goals before the season's midway point.

Vancouver Whitecaps FC forward Brian White is tied for third in the Golden Boot presented by Audi race (eight goals) and has played a crucial role in his side reaching the Concacaf Champions Cup final on June 1 vs. LIGA MX's Cruz Azul.

Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Zack Steffen will vie for the starting role alongside former New England Revolution netminder Matt Turner, while center backs Tim Ream (Charlotte FC) and Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati) offer a veteran presence.

Orlando City SC right back Alex Freeman, Philadelphia Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan, and Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Sebastian Berhalter are all in their first USMNT camp.

Freeman has seized a starting role after shining in MLS NEXT Pro, Sullivan has a team-high seven assists for the league-leading Union, and Berhalter's box-to-box role proved pivotal in Vancouver reaching the CCC final.

After impressing in this year's January camp, Houston Dynamo FC midfielder Jack McGlynn and Charlotte FC striker Patrick Agyemang will both hope to carve out bigger roles.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

ATLANTA – U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday.

Players will begin reporting June 1 to Chicago to start preparation for the Concacaf Gold Cup.

The roster was without several familiar names, including A.C. Milan's Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah, Juventus' Weston McKennie and Tim Weah, and Borussia Dortmund's Gio Reyna.

Pulisic and Musah have been given rest by Pochettino. Juventus and Dortmund are participating in the FIFA Club World Cup, which is being held at the same time as the Gold Cup.

“Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break,” U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker said in a statement.

“After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season.”

The friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland will provide the USMNT with one of its few opportunities to face European opposition before the World Cup and will serve as the team's final tune-up before the Gold Cup.

“As we continue preparations for the World Cup, this is a fantastic opportunity to work with this group of players for an extended period and it's important we take advantage of every moment we have together,” Pochettino said in a statement. “Of course, we want to win and to perform in a very good way. These players have earned the chance to compete for our fans and to show their quality and mentality.”

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn.

RENTON — Frustration is building among MLS players expected to participate in the FIFA men's Club World Cup in June due to the league not responding to requests to negotiate how participation money is divided.

Soccer's governing body announced in March the tournament will have a record $1 billion prize pot. FIFA included a tiered system for how the money would be distributed — with the Sounders, Inter Miami CF and possibly Los Angeles FC, if they win a play-in match against Club América, receiving a $9.55 million payday for participating as part of the CONCACAF clubs.

FIFA was clear the money is to entice players and clubs to treat the debut of the tournament's new 32-team format seriously. But MLS, according to the Players Association, isn't reflecting that mission.

Under the league's current collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in 2021, the CWC falls under a clause for “performance and/or participation in a compulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament.” That stipulates a collective $1 million cap for players, which in the case of the initial CWC earnings would be an approximate 90-10 split.

“There's no incentive for us to play, really, if you're talking about 90-10 for performance bonuses,” Sounders keeper Stefan Frei said Wednesday. “I don't think that's what FIFA had intended. They're worried about the players being fairly compensated for the extra workload. We feel the same way. We're not arguing about more money coming in for bonuses at all, just divvied up accordingly.”

The league didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Union leadership for the clubs held virtual meetings the past month to educate their teammates and strategize. Midfielder Cristian Roldan, defender Jackson Ragen and keeper Andrew Thomas are representing the Sounders.

MLS has revisited CBA issues in the past and may seek the MLSPA's approval for a change in their competition schedule. But for the unprecedented CWC windfall, the league hasn't even considered budging, as of Wednesday.

And the discrepancy could grow if one of the MLS clubs is successful.

The CWC format consists of three pool matches where the top two finishers will advance to the knockout stages. Clubs earn $2 million for wins and $1 million for draws. Teams that advance out of the group stage receive another $7.5 million. The tournament finale is slated for July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. where the runner-up gets $30 million, and the champion earns $40 million.

Seattle opens play against reigning Copa Libertadores champion Botafogo on June 15 at Lumen Field. The Sounders will host Spanish power Atlético Madrid on June 19 and France's Paris Saint-Germain on June 23. PSG is playing Italy's Inter Milan for its first UEFA Champions League title on May 31.

Botafogo will receive a $15.21 million participation payout. Atlético and PSG are part of 12 European clubs that will be paid between $12.81 to $38.19 million based on sporting and commercial rankings, according to FIFA.

The only criteria FIFA made regarding the purse is owners can't pocket the earnings.  

“To potentially be playing for essentially pennies could be frustrating,” Roldan said Wednesday. “We are engaging more than they (MLS) are and that's a bit frustrating because we want to resolve it together. That's at the end of the day what players are fighting for. There are no terms on the actual Club World Cup, so we want to create those terms.”

Ragen was part of training Wednesday and remains on track to be available to play Saturday when the Sounders (5-4-5) host FC Dallas (4-5-4) at Lumen. He suffered a hamstring injury in a road win against Dallas on April 12.

“I've got a smile on my face because he looked sharp,” Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer said of the session. “But he's got to pass some tests, so we'll see.”

João Paulo was also part of training after suffering from a bout of food poisoning last week. But Schmetzer said the midfielder not being part of the gameday roster for the draw against Portland was mainly a “coach's decision.”

“He put in heavy minutes, and he worked his butt off against LAFC,” Schmetzer said of the 4-0 road loss last week.

Xfinity announced Wednesday it will carry MLS's “Sunday Night Soccer” beginning this weekend with a matchup between Atlanta and FC Cincinnati. The Sounders match against Minnesota on June 1 is also part of the free offer for Xfinity customers.

The weekly matches are available on Xfinity X1 and the Xfinity Stream app throughout the duration of the season. Customers can also say “MLS” into their voice remote to start watching. No additional subscriptions are required.

Filed under:

A new keeper's in town.

Bayern Munich keeper-in-waiting Jonas Urbig could be getting his next chance to start at the summer's Club World Cup competition in the United States.

As captured by Sky Sport DE journalist Florian Plettenberg:

   It's the clear and agreed plan: Jonas Urbig is set to feature at the Club World Cup in the USA with FC Bayern!

As a result, he will not take part in the U21 Euros in Slovakia.

@kerry_hau @SkySportDE   

Does this mean that Manuel Neuer will not be the main starter between the sticks for the Bavarians? The captain fought his way back into the starting lineup after returning from injury for the final Bundesliga games of the season, but the summer will be a good opportunity for him to rest — and for Urbig to get a jump start on competitive integration with the team.

The 21-year-old has impressed as a shot stopper in his cameo stretch for Neuer this season, but teammates have not looked as comfortable yet relying on him in distribution. Of course with Neuer, that is a high bar...but Urbig can take some strides in June.

KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County. Share your story idea with Tod.

FIFA World Cup 26 arrives in Kansas City in less than 13 months, but KC2026's push to get businesses in the region ready is well underway.

“With this big event coming to the city, it has a chance to put Kansas City on a map worldwide — not only for all sports, but also for our business community,” Joe Burger, the executive director of the Kansas State Youth Soccer Association, said.

Burger served as the emcee for an Olathe Chamber of Commerce Business Luncheon focused on World Cup readiness Wednesday at the Ball Events Center in south Olathe.

Dozens of Olathe business owners heard a panel discussion with two KC2026 representatives, Director of Regional Impact Tracy Whelpley and Director of Volunteer Operations Lori Thomas, and Johnson County Transit Director Josh Powers about how to get ready for the region to welcome a 650,000 visitors who will spend $650 million, according to VisitKC projections.

“We're talking about 40 days from the start of the tournament to the end of the tournament,” Whelpley said. “Then, if we have base camps, we have teams and their fans and support systems that will be coming to the region potentially as early as two weeks before that. ... We're talking about six different major events that are almost on the scale of a Super Bowl.”

That's why Whelpley is touring the region, meeting with business groups to ensure Kansas City's entrepreneurs are ready to meet the moment.

More than 1,400 regional businesses already have filled out the KC2026 Business Interest form, an online tool that will help keep businesses in the loop about World Cup-connected business opportunities.

“We've talked to a lot of organizations — ESOs (entrepreneur-support organizations), chambers — that regularly work with small businesses to advise us on how we should be counseling them,” Whelpley said. “What they told us was, ‘This is an unprecedented event of a scale of magnitude that we haven't seen. ... We have these relationships already. We know how to work with small businesses and how to advise them. We have great tools. What we need are those World Cup-specific information and trainings that help them contextualize this opportunity, that help them understand more about the people that will be coming to visit here, and how to best serve and welcome them.'”

Part of KC2026's mission is to make sure the entire region — especially restaurants, hotels, attractions and retail shops — benefits from the World Cup.

“It took a regional effort to attract the World Cup to Kansas City — a bi-state effort,” Whelpley said. “Kansas, Missouri, and all of the counties and municipalities that make up the region had to pull together to attract it, so we want to make sure that the benefits go across the region as well.”

That didn't happen with the 2023 NFL Draft, which proved to be a fairly insular event. People who came to Kansas City tended to stay within the footprint setup by the league, but the World Cup promises to be different.

“I think what's coming is on a world scale we haven't seen yet,” Burger said. “But I think once we understand what's actually coming and we prepare the business, it'll help them flourish.”

Visitors will arrive earlier, stay longer and spend more time in the local communities.

“You mentioned the NFL Draft, and it's something that we're very aware of — that there was a level of disappointment amongst some business owners,” Whelpley said. “We want to make sure that we're communicating and helping to build expectations appropriately. ... We had to show that we have 55,000 hotel rooms within a two-and-a-half hour radius of Kansas City, so that should give you an idea of the kind of distribution of visitors and how they'll be out and about — not just sequestered to one small, two-block footprint.”

The 33-year-old former Espanyol winger hopes to bring a cutting edge to Branko Ivankovic's squad, who need to win their next two matches

Wu Lei looks set to make his first appearance for China in more than eight months after being included in Branko Ivankovic's 27-man squad for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Indonesia and Bahrain on Thursday.

The 33-year-old former Espanyol winger, who has scored 36 goals in 99 appearances for his country, last played an international against Saudi Arabia last September before being sidelined by a knee injury.

He returned to action for Shanghai Port last month and Ivankovic will hope he can bring a much-needed cutting edge to China's forward line, which has failed to find the net in either of their past two qualifiers.

Uncapped midfielder Yang Mingyang was also included in the squad after the former Swiss youth international had his request to change international allegiance approved by Fifa on Monday.

China are bottom of Group C and cannot now earn direct passage to the 2026 World Cup finals from the third stage of Asian qualifying.

They could, however, still get through to a fourth stage if they can leapfrog Bahrain, who are above them on goal difference, and Indonesia, who stand three points ahead, after the final round of qualifiers.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","soccer"

The Premier League season is pretty much over, folks. Save for the final day Champions League scramble, all of the important races are done and dusted. There's even a seemingly unanimous pick for the Player of the Year, with Mohamed Salah set for a clean sweep of the various awards.

That doesn't mean the season was without event, drama or comedy, though. Far from that. The beauty of the Premier League is that even when the stakes are reduced, you can still find enjoyment in it.

The Portuguese had been relying on winning the competition to make amends for his torrid time in charge, but now he has serious questions to answer

On the eve of the Europa League final, Ruben Amorim was asked whether it was strange that his opposite number Ange Postecoglou was under huge pressure at Tottenham while the Manchester United manager was not. Before he could answer, Bruno Fernandes hilariously interjected: ""Who told you he's not? He is!"" Well, he certainly is now, after United bungled their one shot at redemption by losing 1-0 to Spurs in Bilbao.

United were not just left with the pain of watching Tottenham lift the trophy in front of them, as they also had to contemplate the fact they had wasted a golden chance to return to the Champions League. And for only the second time in the last 36 years, they will have to make do without European football altogether next season.

The plus side for Amorim is that he will have more time to work on the training ground, which will be crucial for the players to properly understand his methods and master his 3-4-2-1 formation. The negative, however, is that he has no riposte and no excuse for overseeing the club's worst domestic season in half a century, and will have to explain to Sir Jim Ratcliffe why the club will not be getting the £100 million ($134m) pay day the part-owner had hoped for.

But while United were counting the cost of their defeat, Tottenham were savouring their first piece of silverware in 17 years and shedding the 'Spursy' tag that has dogged them for so long. They are, though, now left with a huge dilemma: move on from Ange Postecoglou or give the Australian another chance as a reward for ending their trophy drought?

Defeat to Tottenham has brought the situations of three key players into sharp focus as well as that of the coach - but there is one positive outcome

The defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham confirmed Manchester United's worst season since being relegated in 1974 - and depressingly, it's still not over. It won't even be done after they host Aston Villa on Sunday, when there is the prospect of them dropping below Spurs in the Premier League and finishing in 17th, the last place above the relegation zone.

A few days after what is sure to be a funereal occasion at Old Trafford, United travel to Malaysia and Hong Kong for a post-season tour, the only objective of which is to scrape back a bit more money. They could sure do with some extra change after losing the golden ticket of Champions League qualification and the £100 million ($134m) pay cheque that would have accompanied it, but going on a trip halfway around the world must be the last thing Ruben Amorim or any of his players want to do after such a disheartening loss.

The mood on the 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpar is sure to be tense, especially between Ruben Amorim and Alejandro Garnacho after the winger made his displeasure at starting on the bench in Bilbao clear and hinted at the possibility of leaving United. Kobbie Mainoo might also have a similar plan after only coming on in added time, while Bruno Fernandes will have lots of time to weigh up those lucrative offers from Saudi Arabia.

Amorim himself is likely to have some frank conversations with United's chief executive Omar Berrada and later down the line with Sir Jim Ratcliffe as the major consequences of United's defeat at San Mames begin to emerge...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cobolli – Bautista-Agut: 22.05.2025 13:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Flavio Cobolli has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Turin, Cobolli lost against Altmaier in the quarterfinals in straight sets. This week in Hamburg, the Italian defeated Davidovich Fokina in straight sets in the second round. Last season in Hamburg, he reached the second round, eventually losing to Zhang in straight sets.

Roberto Bautista-Agut has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Rome, the Spaniard lost against Paul in the second round in straight sets. This is his fourth appearance in Hamburg. He has never made it past the quarterfinals. This week, the Spaniard won both matches in straight sets against Giron and Tiafoe.

According to the bookies, Cobolli is the slight favourite in this matchup and we agree. He is a better clay-court player at this moment. Bautista-Agut usually starts the tournament well, but as the week progresses, his form declines. We expect Cobolli to be a better player today.

That being said, Cobolli winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Flavio Cobolli winning @1.50 @bet365

Rublev – Darderi: 22.05.2025 15:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Andrey Rublev has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Rome, Rublev lost against Marozsan in the opening round in three tight sets. He won the title here in 2020. This week, Rublev won both matches in straight sets.

Luciano Darderi has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Turin, Darderi lost in the opening round of the Challenger tournament against Passaro in straight sets. This is his second appearance in Hamburg. In the opening round, Darderi defeated Dedura in straight sets. In the second round, after spending almost three hours on the court, Darderi won against Nakashima. Last season, Darderi reached the quarterfinals, eventually losing against Baez in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Rublev is the favourite in this matchup and we agree. Darderi had a hard match yesterday against Nakashima and the French Open is just around the corner. We expect him to struggle on the court and Rublev to win easily.

That being said, Rublev winning in straight sets is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Andrey Rublev winning 2-0 @2.20 @bet365

Muller – Auger-Aliassime: 22.05.2025 18:00 CEST
H2H: 1-1

Alexandre Muller has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Rome, Muller lost against Tsitsipas in straight sets in the second round. Yesterday, the Frenchman upset Zverev in the second round in three tight sets.

Felix Auger-Aliassime has lost three of his last five matches. This week in Hamburg, the Canadian won both matches against Altmaier and Mpetshi Perricard in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Auger-Aliassime is the favourite in this matchup and we agree. Muller upset Zverev, but he gave his all in the second round. We expect Auger-Aliassime to be more rested and dictate the rallies.

That being said, Auger-Aliassime covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Jannik Sinner will aim to capture his fourth major title and first on clay when he leads the field as the top seed at Roland Garros, which begins on Sunday in Paris.

Sinner arrives at the major off the back of a run to the final in Rome, where he fell to Carlos Alcaraz in the title match. The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alcaraz is the second seed, meaning he will not be able to face Sinner until the final.

The 22-year-old Spaniard is the defending champion, having beaten this year's third seed Alexander Zverev in the final. American Taylor Fritz rounds out the top four seeds, while two-time champion Novak Djokovic is seeded sixth. The Serbian is chasing a record-extending 25th major.

Jack Draper (fifth), Casper Ruud (seventh) and Lorenzo Musetti (eight) complete the top eight seeds.

The headline of the Roland Garros draw Thursday was that Novak Djokovic is in Alexander Zverev's quarter and on Jannik Sinner's half. But there were plenty of other takeaways, including a number of tantalising first-round matches.

ATPTour.com looks at five first-round matches to watch in the first round of the clay-court major.

(2) Carlos Alcaraz vs. Kei Nishikori - First Meeting
Nishikori has spoken several times about his interest in playing the rising stars who have ascended to the top of the sport, including Alcaraz and Sinner.

“It's forced me to adjust my game, change how I play to stay competitive,” Nishikori said in Madrid. “And that challenge has been good motivation.”

The Japanese superstar will get his wish in Paris, where he will take on Alcaraz in the first round. It will be the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

The 35-year-old former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings is still one of the purest ball-strikers on the ATP Tour, but he will have his work cut out for him against Alcaraz. The defending champion is high on confidence after winning titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome, and will try to remove the Japanese from his dominating comfort zone.



(3) Alexander Zverev vs. Learner Tien - Tien 1-0
In Acapulco earlier this year, Tien earned the best win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against then-World No. 2 Zverev, stunning the German 6-3, 6-4.

""I just went out there and tried to control my side of the court,"" Tien said.

Will the #NextGenATP American be able to replicate his feat in the best-of-five-set format? It will be a tough task against Zverev, who has advanced to at least the semi-finals on the Parisian clay in his past four appearances.

Last year's Roland Garros finalist lost to Alexandre Muller in the second round in Hamburg, but has not lost before the fourth round at the clay-court major since 2017 (R128). Another key to the match is Tien's relative inexperience on clay.

The Californian has never competed at Roland Garros as a professional. Two years ago, the lefty made the semi-finals in the boys' singles event, defeating Joao Fonseca in the quarter-finals.

 

(13) Ben Shelton vs. Lorenzo Sonego - Shelton leads 2-1
In the first major of the year, Shelton and Sonego met in the quarter-finals, with the American claiming a fourth-set tie-break to make the last four. One of them will suffer a disappointing first-round exit in Paris.

Shelton leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1, but his defeat came two years ago at Roland Garros. Sonego was victorious on that occasion 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.

The big question: How much Shelton has improved on clay since then? The lefty has one of the world's biggest serves and is able to use pace, spin and placement to beat his opponents. The results show he has grown more comfortable on clay, lifting the trophy last year in Houston, and this season making the final in Munich.

Sonego will bring a steady game and make Shelton work for every point. It will be up to the American to seize the victory.

(30) Hubert Hurkacz vs. Joao Fonseca - First Meeting
Hurkacz and Fonseca will open their Lexus ATP Head2Head series in one of the most interesting first-round clashes at Roland Garros.

One of the stories of the year has been the rise of Fonseca, last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion. The Brazilian stunned Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires. His dynamic play has captivated countless fans around the world. However, he enters the clay-court major on a three-match losing streak.

Former World No. 6 Hurkacz entered Rome with a 7-8 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But with coach Nicolas Massu on his side and a run to the quarter-finals at the Foro Italico, the Polish star appears to be rounding into form.

Hurkacz is one of the biggest servers of his era and can take the racquet out of his opponent's hand. Will Fonseca be able to work his way into enough rallies to bring his jaw-dropping shotmaking into play? 

(11) Daniil Medvedev vs. Cameron Norrie - Medvedev leads 4-0
Both Medvedev and Norrie have been inside the world's Top 10, but only one will advance to the second round in Paris.

Medvedev leads Norrie 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and has never lost a set to the Briton. Just two weeks ago in Rome, Medvedev defeated Norrie 6-4, 6-2. And despite his many jokes over the years about his feelings regarding clay, the former World No. 1 has advanced to at least the fourth round in three of his past four Roland Garros appearances.

But Norrie has long been one of the best competitors on the ATP Tour and the World No. 90 will be hungry to make a statement and show fans that he still belongs near the top of the sport.

Swiatek's drop to No. 5 made her a dangerous floater for the top seeds.ByDavid KanePublished May 22, 2025 copy_link

The 2025 Roland Garros women's draw is set and full of intriguing match-ups, with top seed Aryna Sabalenka and defending champion Iga Swiatek both landing in a stacked top half.Sabalenka was guaranteed to lead the draw as the WTA No. 1, but Swiatek's recent drop from No. 2 to No. 5 made her placement a mystery leading up to Thursday's draw ceremony. The former No. 1 and three-time defending champion could have faced Sabalenka as early as the quarterfinals, but Swiatek instead landed in the second quarter anchored by newly-minted No. 4 seed Jasmine Paolini.MEN'S DRAW: Sinner, Draper, Djokovic headline top halfPaolini is fresh off a WTA 1000 tournament victory at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the run bumping Swiatek out of the Top 4 following her third-round loss to Danielle Collins at the Foro Italico. Paolini will open against Yuan Yue, while Swiatek will play her first-rounder against Rebecca Sramkova—with a potential second round against resurgent 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.

Sabalenka's quarter provides a projected Rome rematch against Zheng Qinwen, who scored her first meeting over the world No. 1 in seven tries. Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals and semifinals of her last two Roland Garros appearances and will play her first match against Kamila Rakhimova. Zheng gets a tough path starting with 2021 Roland Garros finalist Anastasia Pavluyuchenkova, and she could face rising star Alexandra Eala in the second round.Eala has been one of the biggest stories of the 2025 season, the Filipina teenager storming into the Miami Open semifinals with wins over Australian Open Madison Keys and Swiatek, ultimately pushing eventual finalist Jessica Pegula through three tough sets.

The headline of the Roland Garros draw Thursday was that Novak Djokovic is in Alexander Zverev's quarter and on Jannik Sinner's half. But there were plenty of other takeaways, including a number of tantalising first-round matches.

ATPTour.com looks at five first-round matches to watch in the first round of the clay-court major.

(2) Carlos Alcaraz vs. Kei Nishikori - First Meeting
Nishikori has spoken several times about his interest in playing the rising stars who have ascended to the top of the sport, including Alcaraz and Sinner.

“It's forced me to adjust my game, change how I play to stay competitive,” Nishikori said in Madrid. “And that challenge has been good motivation.”

The Japanese superstar will get his wish in Paris, where he will take on Alcaraz in the first round. It will be the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

The 35-year-old former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings is still one of the purest ball-strikers on the ATP Tour, but he will have his work cut out for him against Alcaraz. The defending champion is high on confidence after winning titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome, and will try to remove the Japanese from his dominating comfort zone.



(3) Alexander Zverev vs. Learner Tien - Tien 1-0
In Acapulco earlier this year, Tien earned the best win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against then-World No. 2 Zverev, stunning the German 6-3, 6-4.

""I just went out there and tried to control my side of the court,"" Tien said.

Will the #NextGenATP American be able to replicate his feat in the best-of-five-set format? It will be a tough task against Zverev, who has advanced to at least the semi-finals on the Parisian clay in his past four appearances.

Last year's Roland Garros finalist lost to Alexandre Muller in the second round in Hamburg, but has not lost before the fourth round at the clay-court major since 2017 (R128). Another key to the match is Tien's relative inexperience on clay.

The Californian has never competed at Roland Garros as a professional. Two years ago, the lefty made the semi-finals in the boys' singles event, defeating Joao Fonseca in the quarter-finals.

 

(13) Ben Shelton vs. Lorenzo Sonego - Shelton leads 2-1
In the first major of the year, Shelton and Sonego met in the quarter-finals, with the American claiming a fourth-set tie-break to make the last four. One of them will suffer a disappointing first-round exit in Paris.

Shelton leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1, but his defeat came two years ago at Roland Garros. Sonego was victorious on that occasion 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.

The big question: How much Shelton has improved on clay since then? The lefty has one of the world's biggest serves and is able to use pace, spin and placement to beat his opponents. The results show he has grown more comfortable on clay, lifting the trophy last year in Houston, and this season making the final in Munich.

Sonego will bring a steady game and make Shelton work for every point. It will be up to the American to seize the victory.

(30) Hubert Hurkacz vs. Joao Fonseca - First Meeting
Hurkacz and Fonseca will open their Lexus ATP Head2Head series in one of the most interesting first-round clashes at Roland Garros.

One of the stories of the year has been the rise of Fonseca, last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion. The Brazilian stunned Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires. His dynamic play has captivated countless fans around the world. However, he enters the clay-court major on a three-match losing streak.

Former World No. 6 Hurkacz entered Rome with a 7-8 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But with coach Nicolas Massu on his side and a run to the quarter-finals at the Foro Italico, the Polish star appears to be rounding into form.

Hurkacz is one of the biggest servers of his era and can take the racquet out of his opponent's hand. Will Fonseca be able to work his way into enough rallies to bring his jaw-dropping shotmaking into play? 

(11) Daniil Medvedev vs. Cameron Norrie - Medvedev leads 4-0
Both Medvedev and Norrie have been inside the world's Top 10, but only one will advance to the second round in Paris.

Medvedev leads Norrie 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and has never lost a set to the Briton. Just two weeks ago in Rome, Medvedev defeated Norrie 6-4, 6-2. And despite his many jokes over the years about his feelings regarding clay, the former World No. 1 has advanced to at least the fourth round in three of his past four Roland Garros appearances.

But Norrie has long been one of the best competitors on the ATP Tour and the World No. 90 will be hungry to make a statement and show fans that he still belongs near the top of the sport.

Carlos Alcaraz speaks exclusively to the Roland-Garros Magazine about his first Parisian title

In June 2024, Carlos Alcaraz won his third Grand Slam title and his first on the Paris clay. He spoke to Roland-Garros Magazine about this memorable achievement, as well as his future and his idol, the recently retired Rafael Nadal.

It's already been a year since you won Roland-Garros. Has it sunk in yet?

I've had time to think about it, yes, and realise I won Roland-Garros, then Wimbledon. It's incredible to be back here in Paris, especially now I have all these great memories.

What is your relationship with Roland-Garros, firstly as a fan when you were a boy, and now as champion?

Roland-Garros is a very special place for me. Obviously, I watched many Spanish players do well here, including Rafa Nadal, of course. As a kid, I remember hurrying home from school to turn on the TV with one thing in mind – spending the afternoon watching the tennis. When I was 11, I played my first tournament at Roland-Garros. Then we could go and watch some matches, and if I remember rightly, the first player I saw was Richard Gasquet. I remember saying to myself back then, “one day, that'll be me. One day, I'll play here at Roland-Garros”. A few years later, in qualifying, I lost in the first round [defeat to Aleksandar Vukic in 2020]. I came back, played the qualifiers again and was lucky enough to get into the main draw. After that, I built up experience, enjoyed some unforgettable moments on court, and last year won in the final. It was incredible, a dream come true. I always wanted to win Roland-Garros.

Carlos Alcaraz, Roland-Garros 2022 second round

You're only 22 and have already achieved so much. What is it about you that has made it possible to reach this level?

I've worked really, really hard to get here. You have to have talent, obviously, but that doesn't get you anywhere if you don't put in the work. For years I worked, sacrificed so much when I was younger to reach my goal, achieve my dreams and become a professional tennis player. I think the secret is to invest all the necessary time and energy on the court and grow up with the best possible people around you. It really helps if you've got good people around you and I think I've done that well. I work with great people, really professional, who help me become a better player and a better person. My parents played a key role too, of course.

You've had some ups and downs, and overcome some big challenges too. What helped you the most in those times?

My friends and family. They are always there for me when I need. They've been there when it really mattered. They've been a calming influence. It's so important, so helpful. It is essential to surround yourself with the right people when you're struggling. When I've been down, when I've lost matches I really wanted to win, it's like a slap in the face. But thanks to the support of my friends and family, I've always been able to say, “Ok, I'm living my childhood dream. There's no need to get angry, no time to lose with frustration. Just keep going and enjoy living the present moment.” That's my mentality, and that's a lot down to my friends and family.

Carlos Alcaraz, Roland-Garros 2023 second round

Let's talk about Rafael Nadal. You played together at the Olympic Games and he has always been one of your favourite players. What is it you admire most about him?

His game, the way he is on court, his mentality, his love of the game. Rafa is an exceptional person, really humble. When you meet him for the first time he's just like you and me. It was incredible to be so close to my idol, to learn from him and spend time with him as a person. It was an exceptional experience.

What did you learn from him?

The way he approaches a match, the passion with which he plays each tie and how he prepares too. Playing doubles with him, I also learned how he managed certain situations and handled pressure. That will be really helpful to me throughout my career. He has been one of the best ambassadors for tennis and I think his legacy will last forever. He was probably one of the players who put tennis at the pinnacle of sport, the pinnacle of the world. It was amazing to have Rafa in tennis at this time in my life.

A few months after your first title at Roland-Garros, you won Olympic silver in the singles. How were the Games for you?

I wanted to take part in the Olympics, see what it was like, how it feels to represent your country. It was an extra source of motivation. And, of course, the fact it was in Paris a few months after I won here just made it even more special for me. Playing again on the Philippe-Chatrier court, but this time with the Spanish flag on my chest, was a truly unforgettable experience for me. It was a moment I will hold in my heart forever.

How do you feel about playing on clay?

I can't say it's my favourite surface (laughs). Hard courts are probably my favourite, but I grew up playing on clay. When I started out, I only ever wanted to play on clay. I didn't set foot on a hard court before I was about 11 or 12! Clay is always special for Spanish players. I've managed to raise my game on clay, I feel good and my game suits the surface. I enjoy every match on clay and when the clay season ends and we move to grass, I really miss it.

One last question about your coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero. He won Roland-Garros when you were just a few weeks old (in 2003). Have you seen anything of his victory in Paris?

Yes, I've seen a few photos, and video highlights of his matches too, but not that much really. From what I've heard from other players, he was really good, solid behind the base line. A really good returner too, but I think his greatest skill was how he moved; he moved really well and sometimes I think I'd love to have a game like his. I think he was a more complete player than I am right now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","No. 2 seed Coco Gauff gets favorable draw at French Open. Other key observations.","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/french/2025/05/22/coco-gauff-french-open-draw/83788174007/","Thu, 22 May 2025 13:59:51 GMT","

Heading into Thursday's draw for the French Open, there was only one huge storyline: Where would Iga Swiatek, the women's champion four of the last five years, end up? 

Due to a recent dip in form, Swiatek shockingly fell to the No. 5 seed, meaning one of the top four seeds would have to face the most accomplished clay courter of their generation in the quarterfinals. 

The loser of that random drawing?  Jasmine Paolini, who lost to Swiatek in last year's final and comes to Roland Garros in top form, having just won the Italian Open in her home country. 

The big winner? Coco Gauff.

Gauff, the No. 2 seeded American still seeking a second Grand Slam title after winning the 2023 US Open, will begin this year's French as a pretty solid favorite to make the final given how the draw shook out. 

Not only would Gauff dodge Swiatek until at least the final, pretty much all of the other prime contenders for the title ended up in the top half of the draw with No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka. 

Gauff, who recently lost in the finals of Rome (to Paolini) and Madrid (to Sabalenka), even avoided tricky opponents in the early rounds – at least on paper. Her potential third-round opponent, No. 30 Anna Kalinskaya, has never advanced beyond the second round in Paris. In the fourth round, she would be projected to face former Roland Garros winner Barbora Krejcikova, who is coming off a back injury and hasn't played an official match this year. 

In the quarterfinals, Gauff would potentially play No. 7 Madison Keys, who started the year hot with the Australian Open title but has cooled down considerably over the last couple months. And Gauff's most likely semifinal opponents would be No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, whom she's beaten twice in routine fashion on clay recently, or No. 3 seeded American Jessica Pegula, who is much more comfortable on hard court than the French surface. 

Meanwhile, if Sabalenka is going to make the final, she must deal with several stumbling blocks including potentially a quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, who won the Olympics last year at Roland Garros, and whoever emerges from the Paolini/Swiatek quarter. Of course, Swiatek may not even get there because she is potentially lined up for a round of 16 match with Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, whom she has never beaten in six matches. 

Here are the four other key observations from the French Open draw. ","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","tennis"

MANILA, Philippines — Filipino tennis sensation Alex Eala is set to make her women's Grand Slam main draw debut at the 2025 French Open.

Eala, who turns 20 on Friday (May 23), enters Roland Garros with momentum after breaking into the top 70 of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) world rankings.

The Filipino prodigy began her rise at the Miami Open with a historic dream run.

Eala became the first wild card to take down three consecutive Grand Slam champions in the history of the WTA to reach the Miami Open semifinal.

She took down World No. 25 Jelena Ostapenko, World No. 5 Madison Keys, and knocked World No. 2 Polish star Iga Swiatek out of the WTA 1000 event quarterfinal, 6-2, 7-5.

Her run ended in a tight three-set loss to World No. 4 Jessica Pegula, but it vaulted her from World No. 140 to No. 69 in the WTA world rankings.

That Cinderella campaign earned her a direct entry into the French Open women's main draw—her first appearance at this stage of a Grand Slam tournament.

Last year, Eala narrowly missed the French Open main draw, losing to Julia Riera in the final qualifying round after earlier wins over Ma Yexin and Taylah Preston.

The Rafa Nadal Academy Graduate also reached the final round of qualifiers at Wimbledon and the US Open, while struggling in the Australian Open, where she has yet to win a qualifying match in three years.

Still, Eala has a proven Grand Slam pedigree, having won the 2022 US Open girls' singles title—the first ever by a Filipino.

She also won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles in the 2020 Australian Open with Priska Madelyn Nugroho and 2021 French Open with Oksana Selekhmeteva.

Eala, who said she has grown into a more mentally tough player this time, vows to make the most of her Grand Slam main draw debut.

And she's eager to make a name for herself and make the Philippines proud while she tries to follow in the footsteps of her mentor—without living in his shadow.



“Of course, Roland Garros meant a lot to him as a player,” Eala said in her media availability for Philippine news outlets last April.

“I'm trying to just make my own path and do, you know, not just because I want to do well in Roland Garros, not just because Rafa did well there. I want to do well there because it's what I want to do. And I believe that I can do well on the Grand Slam of clay.”

A month before her Roland Garros main draw debut as a pro, Eala opened her clay season.

Eala reached the Round of 16 of the Oeiras Ladies Open but fell to Panna Udvardy of Hungary, 6(4)-7, 4-6 loss, following a 6-3, 6-4 first-round win over Anouk Koevermans in Portugal last April.

She also suffered from a first-round exit in the doubles tournament with partner Katie Volynets.

The 5-foot-9 lefty joined the Madrid Open, but her stint ended in the Round of 64 as Swiatek exacted a sweet revenge and fended off another gallant stand by the Filipino, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, last April 24.

In the Italian Open, Eala was sent crashing by Marta Kostyuk with a 6-0, 6-1 sweep in the first round.

However, she made a deeper run in doubles with Coco Gauff, reaching the quarterfinals before falling to Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini, 5-7, 6-3, 7-10.

Eala's bracket for Roland Garros will be revealed Friday (Manila time). She enters the tournament ranked World No. 69 and is set to share the court with some of the biggest names in tennis.

She will be in the same tournament, once again, with three-time defending champion Swiatek.

World No. 1 and Miami Open winner Aryna Sabalenka will be the top seed of the tournament. Her former doubles partners Gauff and Volynets are also part of the main draw.

Her Miami Open rivals Pegula and Keys as well as Paula Bedosa, whom Eala was supposed to face in the Round of 16 but had to withdraw due to injury, will also see action.

Paolini, Mirra Andreeva, Qinwen Zheng, and Emma Navarro are part of the top 10.

The French Open has now arrived, with qualifying for the latest Grand Slam of 2025 currently underway.

Carlos Alcaraz has been backed to win the French Open, with the Spaniard having just won the Italian Open.

He defeated Jannik Sinner in the final in Rome, with the Italian having won the first Grand Slam of the season.

ATP number one Sinner won the Australian Open in January, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final in Melbourne.

Zverev also lost the 2024 French Open final, where he was defeated by Alcaraz, with the German having finished as runner-up in all three of his Grand Slam finals.

Another player who has experienced such Grand Slam heartache is Matteo Berrettini, who lost the 2021 Wimbledon final to Novak Djokovic.

And the Italian has now suffered more disappointment ahead of the French Open, having made the difficult decision to withdraw from the tournament.

Sharing an update on social media, Berrettini wrote on Instagram: “Ciao everyone, I unfortunately had to make the very difficult decision to withdraw from Roland Garros.

“I just ran out of time to feel 100% ready to compete at the level that is needed. I'm looking forward to competing on grass and am already preparing with my team. I'm very appreciative of the support I feel from you all and can't wait to be back out on the court.”

A post shared by Matteo Berrettini (@matberrettini)

Berrettini enjoyed a superb run at the All England Club in 2021, which was ended only by legendary figure Djokovic.

The Serbian battled it out with the Italian on the London grass, where he came from behind to win 6-7(4-7), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3.

Djokovic is currently playing in Geneva to prepare for the French Open, having decided to skip the Italian Open.

World number 28 Berrettini did play at the Italian Open, but retired hurt during his round of 32 meeting with Casper Ruud.

The 29-year-old was the 29th seed on home soil in Rome, but called time against sixth seed Ruud while losing 5-7, 0-2.

The walkover came after Berrettini defeated Jacob Fearnley in his opener, having also lost his doubles opener alongside his brother Jacopo Berrettini.

Matteo Berrettini rose two spots in the latest ATP rankings, and currently has a 13-10 win-loss record for the season.

The Italian has won 10 times throughout his career, with three wins in 2024 – Kitzbuhel, Gstaad and Marrakech – having all arrived on clay.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The world of tennis was hit by shockwaves when an organised gambling syndicate suspected of fixing hundreds of matches and paying off around 180 players from around Europe was uncovered in January 2019.

Grigor Sargsyan, a 28-year-old Armenian man known as 'the Maestro', was thought to be the ringleader of a massive match-fixing scheme, organised via encrypted messaging, involving dozens of low-ranked players in small tournaments with little prize money.

“The impression we're getting is that it is very commonplace,” one official told The Associated Press as up to 180 players were suspected of having worked with the syndicate, fixing matches, sets or games in exchange for payments of 500 to 3,000 euros ($570 to $3,400).

Chris Kronow Rasmussen, Associate Professor of Sports Betting Integrity at the University of New Haven, told Flashscore that we have probably only scratched the surface when it comes to uncovering the scale of match-fixing for players ranked below 200 in the world.

“It is, of course, difficult to say how big the problem is, but I think we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. 

""The Sargsyan case gives an indication of how big the problem can actually be. He had about 180 players in his portfolio, and there are probably about 1500 players in the world rankings, so that adds up to a very high percentage of potentially fixed matches”, said Kronow Rasmussen.

Kronow underlines that WTA, ATP and ITF are partly responsible for having created the problem around match-fixing because prize money for many lower-ranked players doesn't even begin to cover the massive expenses for coaching, training, food, travel and accommodation.

“For players ranked from No. 200 to No. 1000 in the world, there is a better incentive to lose matches on purpose and fix matches than to do their best to win matches. 

""You should scrap all the tournaments where the prize money is less than $50,000 because financially it is not worth it for the players to participate, even if they end up winning the tournament, and that is a grotesque situation. It's really a big mess”, says Kronow Rasmussen.

Every tournament has a set amount of prize money, which varies dramatically depending on the type of event and while a ticket for the first round of a Grand Slam tournament (players who make it to the first round of Wimbledon's main singles draw take home £60,000) can cover all expenses for a whole year, paychecks and ranking points available continue to decrease for lower levels of tournaments.

As such, the range of pay on the ITF Women's Tour ranges from $50 (first round of qualifying at a W25) to $15,239 for a winner at a W100 tournament.

Jamie Loeb, who is currently ranked 305 on the women's WTA Tour, also says that prize money distinctions are often misleading.

""People think if you win a $25,000 tournament, that's what you get, but I'm like, 'The joke is on you'. That amount is split up amongst everybody, plus taxes, plus expenses, so most of the time you're losing money at those tournaments, even if you win”, said Loeb to ESPN.

With financial insecurity constantly hovering like a black cloud over the lives of young tennis players struggling to make ends meet, it is not surprising that some players are tempted to cut corners if they are asked to fix matches by shady businessmen, according to Frederik Lochte Nielsen, former winner of the Wimbledon doubles tournament and current Danish Davis Cup captain.

“There is no doubt that, when you have a system that is organised like it is today, where people play for peanuts and someone comes and asks if you want $10,000 to lose the first set, then there are many who are tempted, which you can also see because there are many who get caught,” Lochte Nielsen tells Flashscore.

“Tennis is an incredibly attractive sport to bet on because there are matches all year round and you make bets per point, so I think that will always be a huge problem”, adds Lochte Nielsen who has previously admitted that he was offered money to lose on purpose but immediately chose to turn it down.

The Tennis Integrity Unit was set up in 2008 to combat match-fixing in tennis but was subsequently replaced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency in 2020. It had the ability to impose fines and sanctions, and ban players, umpires, and other tennis officials from participating in tournaments. Still, there is evidence that the system was far from effective, as a report in 2018 uncovered a ""tsunami of corruption in lower-level tennis.""

The report pointed out that lower-level tennis had turned into a fertile breeding ground for match-fixing due to the number of players struggling to make a living, few people watching the matches in person, and the ITF's decision to sell official live scoring data in 2012. Seven years later, nothing has changed, says Kronow Rasmussen.

""A number of organisations pat themselves on the back, when they find a tennis player who has cheated, but they usually never find the perpetrators and it would be better if athletes were trained not to accept money, or prize money was offered at a size that enabled players to live a decent life,"" adds Kronow Rasmussen, who underlines that he doesn't think any tennis player enjoys cheating.

""I think 70% of tennis players do it out of necessity rather than because they think it's fun to cheat. Nobody thinks it's cool to lose on purpose.

""But if you get 5000 euros, you might look through it because the family needs to have food on the table,"" concludes Kronow Rasmussen.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Interview: Becker, who coached Djokovic from 2013-2016, gave his thoughts on the six-month partnership

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Boris Becker revealed he is “lost for words” that Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray's coaching partnership has ended after just six months. 

Djokovic hired great rival Murray as his coach at the back end of last year, with the pair working together at the Australian Open in January, where the Serb beat Carlos Alcaraz and reached the semi-finals before withdrawing due to injury. 

Yet Djokovic's results have nosedived since, with just one final appearance in Miami, and he lost his first matches on the clay of Monte Carlo and Madrid. As such, last week, the pair jointly announced that they have gone their separate ways, with Djokovic adding this week he “couldn't get more” out of the partnership. 

But three-time Wimbledon champion Becker, who coached Djokovic between 2013-2016, believed the pair would continue working together until at least The Championships, which start on 30 June. 

“I'm a little bit surprised that they would end their working relationship just a week before Roland-Garros,” Becker told The Independent, ahead of the French Open beginning this Sunday. 

“I thought Melbourne was a big success. I was happy to see Andy back in action in Novak's corner. I really wanted to see them both at Wimbledon, actually. 

“Andy knows a thing or two about winning Wimbledon, he's very popular there. I thought it would be an advantage for Novak to have Andy in his corner. 

“I'm a little bit lost for words [as to] why they've broken up just before the second grand slam.” 

Djokovic, who turned 38 on Thursday, is a seven-time winner at Wimbledon but has lost in the final to Carlos Alcaraz in the last two years, while Murray won the tournament in 2013 and 2016. 

Becker, who will feature on TNT Sports's coverage of Roland-Garros, coached Djokovic to Wimbledon titles in 2014 and 2015, and the German, 57, said he considers the 24-time grand slam champion like a “younger brother”.

Asked further what went wrong with the Djokovic-Murray partnership, Becker replied: “I thought it was always about the grand slams and I thought the campaign in Melbourne went very well. 

“I don't know the reasons. Novak is a smart guy – he knows what he's doing. I definitely thought this relationship would go at least until Wimbledon, but I was wrong. 

“But you should never underestimate Novak Djokovic, he's always a very fierce competitor, he always has something up his sleeve. 

“Novak Djokovic knows pretty much everything about tennis. So, who can he talk to that knows more? 

“The challenge is for Novak to find someone that he has respect [for], who he can learn something from.

“That's very difficult because he's so good and knowledgeable, he's done everything there is to do in tennis and that's the difficulty he has.”

Djokovic, now the world No 6, is eyeing a record-breaking 25th grand slam on the clay courts of Roland-Garros over the next fortnight, the same venue where he won his last tournament – gold at the Paris Olympics – last summer. 

“I think he has tennis left in him, but he has to be realistic,” Becker added, regarding Djokovic's future in the sport. 

“He's not getting any younger, he cannot play forever. Those are the facts. You have to deal with reality and start to think about how much longer you have to play. That would be a wise thing to do.” 

The Serb won his first match on clay this year at the Geneva Open on Wednesday, beating Marton Fucsovics in straight sets. He faces Matteo Arnaldi in the quarter-finals on Thursday.

Matteo Berrettini has officially withdrawn from the French Open as his nightmare injury run continues. The world No. 28 has not played Roland Garros since his quarter-final run in 2021 after years of on-and-off physical issues. Berrettini also retired from his last two tournaments, the Masters 1000s in Madrid and Rome.

Berrettini's withdrawal was announced just three hours before the main draw ceremony is due to take place in Paris on Thursday afternoon. The Italian will be replaced by a lucky loser.

The announcement comes after Berrettini retired from his home tournament, the Italian Open, earlier this month. He was trailing sixth seed Casper Ruud 7-5 2-0 when he threw in the towel, and later admitted that he almost pulled out before the match.

""Today until ten minutes before the match I thought I couldn't make it. Then I said, whatever, I'm going to try, come on. I was surprised at how my body reacted up to a certain point,"" Berrettini said following his third-round retirement.

""Then I felt another pull, towards the end of the first set, and after that I couldn't remain in the match, remain focused. I had to pull out one more time.

""I did not want to retire, but then I know what happens if I do not stop, I have to spend three months not playing, every time I sneeze I jump. I did not want that thing there to happen again.""

Berrettini also retired while facing Britain's Jack Draper in the third round of the Madrid Open a few weeks ago. The 2021 Wimbledon runner-up has since revealed that he is facing an oblique injury, similar to an issue that sidelined him from the tour a few years ago.

""It is close to a point where I have hurt before, I don't know what is wrong with my obliques. The feelings, unfortunately I know them well because I've been there over and over again,"" he added.

It's the fourth year in a row that Berrettini has been forced to miss the French Open. He pushed Novak Djokovic in a tense four-set match in the 2021 quarter-final, and has not played since.

In 2022, Berrettini missed the entire clay season after undergoing emergency surgery for a hand injury.

An abdominal and oblique issue kept him out of the tournament in 2023 and, last year, he said he was ""not quite ready"" to return to competiton in Paris after suffering with illness.

It's been a tough few years for Berrettini, who peaked at No. 6 in the world three years ago and reached his only Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in 2021, losing to Djokovic.

When he's been healthy, he's proved he can still be one of the best players. The current world No. 28 upset Djokovic in the first round of the Qatar Open in February and, a month later, he reached the Miami Open quarter-final.

Berrettini will be hoping to recover in time for the grass swing as he thrives on the surface. He is defending 165 ranking points from reaching the Stuttgart final last year and is a two-time former champion at London's Queen's Club.

Bianca Andreescu's Comeback: What Lies Ahead After Roland Garros Setback

Former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu has been through a rollercoaster journey from the peak of success in 2019 to battling injuries and setbacks. Now, facing the need to qualify for Grand Slam main draws, Andreescu's path forward may be uncertain, but the Canadian tennis star is determined to make a strong comeback.

In a recent Roland Garros qualifying match against Nao Hibino, Andreescu suffered a tough loss after holding a commanding position. Despite the disappointment, there are silver linings for Andreescu as she focuses on regaining her form and staying injury-free.

Known for her talent marred by injuries, Andreescu has been working on her physical fitness and mental well-being to make a triumphant return to the top of the tennis world. Embracing a strict diet and a disciplined lifestyle, Andreescu is leaving no stone unturned in her quest for success.

Looking ahead, Andreescu's schedule for the upcoming grass court season remains uncertain, with no current plans for post-Roland Garros tournaments. However, she is expected to ramp up her efforts to secure spots in key events to boost her rankings and performance.

As Andreescu navigates her way back to the pinnacle of tennis, her focus on staying healthy and competitive will be crucial. With the support of fans and fellow players, Andreescu is gearing up for a strong comeback and aims to make a mark in the upcoming tournaments.

Despite the recent setback, Andreescu's determination and resilience are unwavering, setting the stage for a compelling return to the courts. Tennis enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting Andreescu's next moves as she fights to reclaim her status as one of the top players in the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","No. 2 seed Coco Gauff gets favorable draw at French Open. Other key observations.","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/french/2025/05/22/coco-gauff-french-open-draw/83788174007/","Thu, 22 May 2025 13:59:51 GMT","

Heading into Thursday's draw for the French Open, there was only one huge storyline: Where would Iga Swiatek, the women's champion four of the last five years, end up? 

Due to a recent dip in form, Swiatek shockingly fell to the No. 5 seed, meaning one of the top four seeds would have to face the most accomplished clay courter of their generation in the quarterfinals. 

The loser of that random drawing?  Jasmine Paolini, who lost to Swiatek in last year's final and comes to Roland Garros in top form, having just won the Italian Open in her home country. 

The big winner? Coco Gauff.

Gauff, the No. 2 seeded American still seeking a second Grand Slam title after winning the 2023 US Open, will begin this year's French as a pretty solid favorite to make the final given how the draw shook out. 

Not only would Gauff dodge Swiatek until at least the final, pretty much all of the other prime contenders for the title ended up in the top half of the draw with No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka. 

Gauff, who recently lost in the finals of Rome (to Paolini) and Madrid (to Sabalenka), even avoided tricky opponents in the early rounds – at least on paper. Her potential third-round opponent, No. 30 Anna Kalinskaya, has never advanced beyond the second round in Paris. In the fourth round, she would be projected to face former Roland Garros winner Barbora Krejcikova, who is coming off a back injury and hasn't played an official match this year. 

In the quarterfinals, Gauff would potentially play No. 7 Madison Keys, who started the year hot with the Australian Open title but has cooled down considerably over the last couple months. And Gauff's most likely semifinal opponents would be No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, whom she's beaten twice in routine fashion on clay recently, or No. 3 seeded American Jessica Pegula, who is much more comfortable on hard court than the French surface. 

Meanwhile, if Sabalenka is going to make the final, she must deal with several stumbling blocks including potentially a quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, who won the Olympics last year at Roland Garros, and whoever emerges from the Paolini/Swiatek quarter. Of course, Swiatek may not even get there because she is potentially lined up for a round of 16 match with Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, whom she has never beaten in six matches. 

Here are the four other key observations from the French Open draw. ","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","tennis"

The massive upgrade will expand fan space, luxury lounges and athlete perks

Arthur Ashe Stadium, the grandest stage in tennis, is set for an $800 million reinvention that promises to serve both fans and players a serious upgrade—without so much as a single delay in play. 

Announced Monday by the USTA, the transformation is the largest investment in the history of the U.S. Open and will completely modernize the stadium, build a state-of-the-art Player Performance Center, and usher in a new era for one of New York's most iconic sporting events.

The renovation will unfold over three phases through 2027, carefully scheduled to avoid disrupting the 2025 or 2026 tournaments. The new look will include a Daniel Libeskind-designed Grand Entrance, expanded concourses (up 40-percent), more elevators and escalators, vastly improved food, drink, and retail spaces and 2,000 additional courtside seats. Two new luxury suite levels and sleek hospitality lounges will bring a level of comfort and glam typically reserved for the Met Gala.

“This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis, which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years,” said USTA CEO Lew Sherr. “It also provides us the opportunity to give the players that compete in that stadium an unparalleled space that will enable them to perform at their best.”

That includes athletes getting their own $250 million playground in the form of a new Player Performance Center. Perched atop a four-story structure on the west side of the stadium, the facility will feature indoor and outdoor training turf, spa-style locker rooms, lounges and a private cafe. The center will also boast a new players-only courtyard and an exclusive entryway, giving the world's top competitors the backstage treatment they deserve.

The architectural heavy-hitters behind the redesign include ROSSETTI (the original Ashe Stadium architect), Libeskind (of World Trade Center fame), and hospitality design expert Garrett Singer, known for building out buzzy clubs and restaurants across the country.

And in a refreshing twist, the entire project is fully self-funded by the USTA—no taxpayer dollars required. With the Open already delivering $1.2 billion in annual economic impact to the city, the upgrades promise to pay off for the city as much as for the sport.

Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.

Emma Raducanu could face world No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open if the two players win their respective opening matches.

Raducanu will play Xinyu Wang in the first round, while defending champion Swiatek faces Rebecca Šramková.

The 2021 US Open champion has never beaten Swiatek in her career. Raducanu was thrashed 6-0, 6-1 when the pair last met in the third round of the Australian Open in January.

Raducanu suffered an injury scare just four days before the French Open in a three-set defeat to Danielle Collins on Wednesday.

Fellow Brit Katie Boulter could face a challenging second-round match of her own. The British No. 1 is scheduled to play Madison Keys if she beats a qualifier.

As far as other British interest goes, Sonay Kartal will play Erika Andreeva in the opening round, while Jodie Burrage has a meeting with America's Collins.

Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembélé helped conduct the draw in the French capital.

On the men's side of the draw, Jack Draper has been drawn in the same quarter as world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. The pair would meet in the quarterfinal if they both progress through the competition.

Draper will start against Sinner's compatriot Mattia Bellucci.

Jacob Fearnley, who is playing in the French Open for the fist time in his career will play 40-year-old former French Open champion Stan Wawrinka in the first round.

Cameron Norrie was also handed a tough draw. The Brit will have to get past Daniil Medvedev if he is to progress beyond the first round.","{'href': 'http://kwese.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

The headline of the Roland Garros draw Thursday was that Novak Djokovic is in Alexander Zverev's quarter and on Jannik Sinner's half. But there were plenty of other takeaways, including a number of tantalising first-round matches.

ATPTour.com looks at five first-round matches to watch in the first round of the clay-court major.

(2) Carlos Alcaraz vs. Kei Nishikori - First Meeting
Nishikori has spoken several times about his interest in playing the rising stars who have ascended to the top of the sport, including Alcaraz and Sinner.

“It's forced me to adjust my game, change how I play to stay competitive,” Nishikori said in Madrid. “And that challenge has been good motivation.”

The Japanese superstar will get his wish in Paris, where he will take on Alcaraz in the first round. It will be the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

The 35-year-old former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings is still one of the purest ball-strikers on the ATP Tour, but he will have his work cut out for him against Alcaraz. The defending champion is high on confidence after winning titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome, and will try to remove the Japanese from his dominating comfort zone.



(3) Alexander Zverev vs. Learner Tien - Tien 1-0
In Acapulco earlier this year, Tien earned the best win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against then-World No. 2 Zverev, stunning the German 6-3, 6-4.

""I just went out there and tried to control my side of the court,"" Tien said.

Will the #NextGenATP American be able to replicate his feat in the best-of-five-set format? It will be a tough task against Zverev, who has advanced to at least the semi-finals on the Parisian clay in his past four appearances.

Last year's Roland Garros finalist lost to Alexandre Muller in the second round in Hamburg, but has not lost before the fourth round at the clay-court major since 2017 (R128). Another key to the match is Tien's relative inexperience on clay.

The Californian has never competed at Roland Garros as a professional. Two years ago, the lefty made the semi-finals in the boys' singles event, defeating Joao Fonseca in the quarter-finals.

 

(13) Ben Shelton vs. Lorenzo Sonego - Shelton leads 2-1
In the first major of the year, Shelton and Sonego met in the quarter-finals, with the American claiming a fourth-set tie-break to make the last four. One of them will suffer a disappointing first-round exit in Paris.

Shelton leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1, but his defeat came two years ago at Roland Garros. Sonego was victorious on that occasion 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.

The big question: How much Shelton has improved on clay since then? The lefty has one of the world's biggest serves and is able to use pace, spin and placement to beat his opponents. The results show he has grown more comfortable on clay, lifting the trophy last year in Houston, and this season making the final in Munich.

Sonego will bring a steady game and make Shelton work for every point. It will be up to the American to seize the victory.

(30) Hubert Hurkacz vs. Joao Fonseca - First Meeting
Hurkacz and Fonseca will open their Lexus ATP Head2Head series in one of the most interesting first-round clashes at Roland Garros.

One of the stories of the year has been the rise of Fonseca, last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion. The Brazilian stunned Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires. His dynamic play has captivated countless fans around the world. However, he enters the clay-court major on a three-match losing streak.

Former World No. 6 Hurkacz entered Rome with a 7-8 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But with coach Nicolas Massu on his side and a run to the quarter-finals at the Foro Italico, the Polish star appears to be rounding into form.

Hurkacz is one of the biggest servers of his era and can take the racquet out of his opponent's hand. Will Fonseca be able to work his way into enough rallies to bring his jaw-dropping shotmaking into play? 

(11) Daniil Medvedev vs. Cameron Norrie - Medvedev leads 4-0
Both Medvedev and Norrie have been inside the world's Top 10, but only one will advance to the second round in Paris.

Medvedev leads Norrie 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and has never lost a set to the Briton. Just two weeks ago in Rome, Medvedev defeated Norrie 6-4, 6-2. And despite his many jokes over the years about his feelings regarding clay, the former World No. 1 has advanced to at least the fourth round in three of his past four Roland Garros appearances.

But Norrie has long been one of the best competitors on the ATP Tour and the World No. 90 will be hungry to make a statement and show fans that he still belongs near the top of the sport.

Madison Keys: From Triumph to Turmoil – Will the Former Slam Champion Overcome Recent Struggles at Roland Garros?

Madison Keys, once basked in the glory of her Australian Open victory, is now facing a tumultuous journey filled with challenges and doubts as she gears up for the upcoming French Open at Roland Garros. The American tennis star soared to new heights by clinching her maiden Grand Slam title, but the aftermath of her triumph has proven to be more exhausting than she could have ever imagined.

After her historic win in Melbourne, Keys was forced to take a hiatus from the sport due to a leg injury, missing crucial tournaments in the Middle East before returning for the BNP Paribas Open. As she sets her sights on the clay courts of Roland Garros, the pressure mounts for the former World No. 1.

In a candid pre-event interview, Madison Keys opened up about the overwhelming nature of her post-Australian Open success, admitting, “winning the Australian Open was like the greatest but most exhausting thing that I have ever done in my career.” The newfound attention and scrutiny took a toll on the typically low-key player, who found herself grappling with the demands of her elevated status in the tennis world.

Despite her initial resurgence at the Indian Wells, where she reached the semifinals, Keys' form has been inconsistent in recent tournaments. Disappointing early exits at the Miami Open, Charleston, and Rome have raised concerns about her readiness for the challenges ahead in Paris. The American's struggles on clay courts further exacerbate doubts about her performance at Roland Garros.

As the French Open looms large, Madison Keys faces mounting expectations and a checkered history at the tournament. While she has shown flashes of brilliance in past editions, including semifinal and quarterfinal appearances, her recent track record suggests a potential uphill battle in Paris.

With critics questioning her ability to replicate past successes on the Roland Garros clay, all eyes are on Madison Keys as she seeks to overcome her recent setbacks and make a lasting impression at the upcoming Grand Slam event. Will the former slam champion rise to the occasion and silence her detractors, or will Roland Garros prove to be an insurmountable challenge for the American star? The tennis world awaits the answer with bated breath.

https://arab.news/6ytat


	BERLIN: If there is one tennis player who knows how to beat the odds when they are stacked against him, it is 24-times Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.
	The 38-year-old Serbian's bid for a fourth French Open crown looks more unlikely than in many years, with Djokovic struggling for form since his run to the Australian Open semifinals back in January before retiring injured.
	Since then Djokovic, who has 99 tour titles to his name and is in the twilight of a glorious career, has reached only one final and has not lifted a trophy this year.
	After two early losses in Monte Carlo and Madrid, it was clear that Djokovic's attempt to claim a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam could be his hardest yet.
	“(It is) kind of a new reality for me, I have to say, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament,” Djokovic said after his early Madrid exit.
	He was expected to jumpstart his clay campaign in Rome before returning to Paris, where he won Olympic gold last year, but he skipped the Italian Open without giving a reason.
	Instead he picked up a surprise wild card for the Geneva Open this week, in what looks like a last-ditch attempt to get some more matches on clay under his belt before Paris.
	News of the wild card came as Djokovic split with his coach Andy Murray after only a few months working together.
	Djokovic appointed fellow former world number one Murray ahead of this year's Australian Open and the Serb said at the Qatar Open in February that he would continue working with the Scot for an indefinite period.
	That time, however, ended abruptly last week with the Djokovic-Murray partnership yielding no titles and one losing final in Miami.
	Their partnership is now officially over as Djokovic heads toward the French Open in a cloud of uncertainty over his form and future.
	The world number six has struggled to assert his dominance after winning three out of the four Grand Slams in 2023.
	There is even more uncertainty over his chances of reaching the last major goal in his illustrious career: adding that elusive 25th record Grand Slam to his collection to move past Margaret Court on the all-time winners' list.


	DUBAI: The road to Rugby World Cup 2027 will culminate in Dubai, with the UAE city set to host the Final Qualification Tournament at The Sevens Stadium from Nov. 8-18, 2025.


	The event will decide the 24th and final team to secure a spot at the expanded global showpiece in Australia.


	Four teams will compete in a round-robin format across three match days, with the highest-ranked side at the end of the tournament booking their place at the World Cup. Belgium is the first nation confirmed for the Dubai qualifier, having finished fifth in the 2025 Rugby Europe Championship.


	The remaining three teams will emerge from ongoing regional qualification campaigns, including the Rugby Africa Cup, Asia Rugby Championship, Sudamerica Rugby Championship, and the Pacific Nations Cup. Representing four continents, the participants will highlight the global reach and growing competitiveness of the sport.


	World Rugby Chair Brett Robinson welcomed Dubai's selection as host of the final qualifier, describing the tournament as a pivotal point in the international rugby calendar.


	“The Final Qualification Tournament is always a thrilling, do-or-die moment in the build-up to Rugby World Cup — and it's fitting that we bring it to a world-class destination like Dubai,” Robinson said.


	He added: “As we head toward the most inclusive and globally representative tournament ever, with 24 teams competing in an expanded format and at least one nation from each of our regional associations, this final step on the ‘Journey to Australia 2027' will be a celebration of ambition, resilience and the global spirit of rugby. We cannot wait to see which team earns the final place and joins us for what promises to be a unique celebration of rugby and Australia in 2027.”


	The 2027 event in Australia will mark a new era for the sport. With 24 teams, a round of 16 stage, and a total of 52 matches, it will be the largest Rugby World Cup to date, aimed at increasing opportunities for emerging nations and enhancing the overall fan experience.


	For the first time in the professional era, the pool draw will take place with all 24 teams confirmed. Scheduled for December 2025, the draw will be based on the official World Rugby Men's Rankings at the close of the November international window, offering a more accurate and current reflection of team performance.


	All international fixtures in 2025 — excluding matches during the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia — will influence the rankings and, ultimately, the pool seedings. Every result could be decisive in shaping the composition of the six pools for Rugby World Cup 2027.


	As the global qualification process reaches its final chapter, all eyes will turn to Dubai this November. The tournament promises high-stakes rugby and a fitting finale to the long journey toward what is expected to be the most inclusive and competitive Rugby World Cup in history.


	In modern parlance, it is what techies would call a “disruptor,” to say the least.


	It will take a lot more, however, for sporting fans of earlier generations to get their heads around the concept of the Enhanced Games, which were officially announced on Wednesday and will take place next year in Las Vegas.


	Saudi Arabia's Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al-Saud, founder and CEO of KBW Ventures and chairman of the Kingdom's Sports For All Federation, is the region's first, and to date only, investor in the tournament that allows athletes to use performance-enhancing substances without being subjected to testing.


	Prince Khaled — nicknamed the “Tech Prince” for his investments in startups, among many other fields — is bullish about the potential of the Enhanced Games when asked if the sports world is ready for such a controversial step.


	“Look, I like to think of myself as a progressive investor, venture capital typically backs very nascent ideas,” he told Arab News.


	“You are always looking for the big idea, the society-changing concept. Then, you attempt to predict and really visualize how and where and when that big idea will prove relevant to the wider world.


	“As someone who is pretty involved in sports on both personal and business levels, I think there is a segment of the world who would like to push the limits of human potential,” Prince Khaled said.


	“How fast? How far? How long? All questions in sport that someone like me is curious about, and very eager to see. I want to see real-world application, and a competitive approach.”


	He accepts that this idea, with all the ethical points and counterpoints it evokes, might take a long time to be accepted in mainstream sports.


	“Is the world ready? The world wasn't ready for most fresh concepts. At the most basic level people weren't even ready for ride-hailing, now it is considered a must for many all over the world, he said.


	“So, whether it is transportation or AI or art or biotechnology or in this case, sport and biohacking, the world is usually not ready for things that have not been done before. That doesn't mean they should never be done.


	“Elite athletes who have never been granted the opportunity to experiment with body autonomy and enhancement exploration can now sign up if they so choose,” said Prince Khaled.


	“If you want to talk sports in specific, I also think the world wasn't ready for MMA, but it's now one of the biggest crowd draws out there.”


	The reaction from the sports community at large has, unsurprisingly, been a negative one.


	In February of last year, a joint statement issued by the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency condemning the games was supported by The International Fair Play Committee.


	“Well, it is voluntary, and it's like for like. The Games is for those who choose to enroll and compete with enhancements. It is ethical; the ethics rests in equality, safety and transparency.


	“There is a disclosure protocol, and everyone knows that everyone else is applying the same types of enhancements and experimenting with biohacking.


	“I don't think I have to justify investing in what I see as a form of competitive sport,” he added. “As long as everyone involved is aware, then it is fair and transparent.”


	Prince Khaled is known to be the Middle East North Africa face of venture capital, with investments across artificial intelligence, biotechnology, agricultural and food technology, as well as in the sports-adjacent sector, robotics and broadcast technologies.


	One of his biotechnology bets, Colossal Biosciences, recently made headlines with its reported $10.2 billion valuation.


	“I met the co-founder of Enhanced Games (Aron D'Souza) at a private conclave staged by FII (Future Investment Initiative) last year in Riyadh. This was my first exposure to the idea of the Enhanced Games.


	“It was a closed-door working group held to discuss democratizing access to healthy aging solutions. Some of the foremost figures were present; from stakeholders from the Saudi Health in All Policies committee, to scientists, to entrepreneurs and investors.”


	“I do think the Enhanced Games can play an important role here; how better to analyze the effects of enhancement than on elite athletes? People who are in the best possible shape physically that they can be naturally, and then build on that,” he said.


	“When your baseline is elite athlete level, then we can really see what biohacking and these enhancements can do.


	“I do think it is ethical, because there is no subjectivity and no varying board rules, and because it is upfront and clear about the idea that everyone is competing with their own approach to enhancement.”


	Certainly the games seem to appeal to athletes either coming to the end of their careers or ones for whom Olympic and international success remain out of reach. Established figures, including Australian swimming coach Brett Hawke, have backed the idea.


	At the age of 31, four-time Olympic Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev will take part in the Enhanced Games, having received a $1 million prize for breaking the long-standing 50-meter freestyle world record with a time of 20.89 seconds.


	“Being the first to break a world record at the Enhanced Games means a lot to me. I'm proud to lead the way,” said the athlete who specialized in sprint and butterfly events, and earned a silver in the 50-meter freestyle at the 2019 FINA World Aquatics Championship in South Korea.


	However, having not consistently been at the top of the sport, he sees these Games as an opportunity to make up for missed opportunities.


	“One year at the Enhanced Games could earn me more than six Olympic cycles combined,” Gkolomeev told Arab News. “I've never had this kind of support; doctors, nutritionists, therapists, all working to make me better.”


	Prince Khaled accepts that participation will depend entirely on the choices of the individual athletes and their particular circumstances.


	“There are athletes who are not going to want to join, and then there are those who will be the early adopters,” he said. “At launch, there is already a record-breaker, who just won a million dollars.


	“Is this going to make everyone rush to sign up? No, but this will definitely spark some honest and much-needed discussions about the irregularities between sporting rules and different governing bodies, and the allegations of unfair treatment levied against some athletes over others.”


	“Democratizing access to aging solutions is what first interested me in the Games, and then I began to think of the implications on sport.


	“I'm sure you know about the politics involved when deciding which athletes were accused of using enhancements, in several instances countries felt their athletes were unfairly targeted.


	“At the Enhanced Games, this political maneuvering is completely removed from the equation. I bet if you ask the athletes that felt they were wrongly maligned, they would be pretty quick to agree that politics played a role.”


	In its statement last year, the International Fair Play Committee said the Games “represent a potentially catastrophic healthcare risk” to the athletes.


	The Enhanced Games' website meanwhile promises medical vigilance and safe participation for the athletes. Critics will rightly question just where the line is drawn in terms of the use of performance-enhancing substances.


	“To my knowledge, there are two cohorts, one is enhanced with their own resources and medical guidance, and one cohort that is officially under the Enhanced Games,” said Prince Khaled.


	“For the second cohort, there is a full treatment protocol lined up for athletes.


	“They will definitely have better medical guidance and access to the latest in monitoring methodologies and technologies with the Enhanced Games than they have ever had in their professional sporting careers.”


	“Everyone knows one of the biggest barriers to elite athletics is cost,” he added. “The Enhanced Games is bringing the best medical and scientific protocols and giving the athletes access to that.


	“To bring this conversation full circle, this is something enabled by funding, and in venture capital, funding is, most of the time, allocated to groundbreaking entities and ideas.”


	Prince Khaled said he is a “cautious believer in biohacking” which is, simply stated, the optimization of nutrition to enhance energy, cognitive function, and overall health and well-being.


	“I think longevity medicine and healthspan and various other biotechnology sectors are burgeoning for a reason.


	“KBW Ventures is invested in biotechnology, health tech, medtech, and with the Enhanced Games, I consider it kind of an ultimate biohacking opportunity for elite athletes,” he said.


	“I expect that so much valuable scientific data on reversing biological age, and repair and so much more is going to come out of the Enhanced Games,” Prince Khaled added.


	“On a separate note, the athletes that participate in the Games have to undergo what is termed health testing, ensuring that they are fit to compete. They also need to disclose everything that they are using to enhance their performance.”


	At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the world of athletics was shaken to its core when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of the gold medal he had won with a world record time of 9.79 seconds.


	Author Richard Moore's “The Dirtiest Race in History” remains a seminal read on the events of Sept. 24, 1988. Since then, many other athletes have been banned from participating, or stripped of medals, for similar offences with increasingly less fanfare and shock.


	But is the world ready now to consign such considerations to history?


	The clock is now ticking toward the first Enhanced Game. It remains a tough, if not almost impossible sell, for a sporting community brought up on the concepts of fair play and the dangers of performance-enhancing drugs.


	Whether the world is ready for these Games, and how the future will judge these developments, remain open questions.


	Tyrese Haliburton was a bit premature after he mimicked Hall of Famer Reggie Miller's infamous “choke” sign at Madison Square Garden.
	Nevertheless, Haliburton and his Indiana Pacers teammates made certain the gesture didn't come back to haunt them in a 138-135 victory in overtime over the New York Knicks on Wednesday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
	Haliburton scored 31 points and Aaron Nesmith added 30, highlighting an 8-for-9 performance from 3-point range by making five treys during the final 3 1/2 minutes of regulation. That surge allowed the fourth-seeded Pacers to overcome a 14-point deficit in the final 2:39 of the fourth quarter.
	“It's unreal,” Nesmith said of his sizzling shooting. “It's probably the best feeling in the world for me. I love it when that basket feels like an ocean and anything you toss up, you feel like it's going to go in. It's so much fun.”
	Haliburton appeared to win it following a friendly carom off the rim on an apparent 3-pointer at the buzzer, only for replays to show that his toe was on the line. That made it a 2-pointer and forced overtime.
	When he thought the game was over, Haliburton made the choke sign in the direction of the Knicks' bench.
	“I thought it was a 3. I tried to hit the celly. It didn't work. But we finished it in overtime,” Haliburton said.
	Miller famously flashed the gesture toward Knicks superfan Spike Lee while leading a Pacers comeback in a playoff game in 1994.
	The third-seeded Knicks will look to bounce back in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series on Friday in New York.
	“In the playoffs, when you win it's the best thing ever. When you lose it's the worst thing ever,” said Knicks star Jalen Brunson, who finished with 43 points.
	“The best way to deal with all of that is to stay level-headed. Making sure we have each other's backs.”
	Pacers coach Rick Carlisle also kept it in perspective after the game.
	“It's a long series. We're not gonna get too excited about this,” he said. “We've got things to clean up. They've got things to clean up. Game 2's gonna be another war.”
	Andrew Nembhard sank a 3-pointer and two layups in OT, the last lay-in giving Indiana a 136-135 lead with 26.7 seconds to play. An attempted pass to Brunson deflected off his fingers and out of bounds, and former Knick Obi Toppin's dunk extended the advantage to three with 10.9 seconds left.
	Brunson and teammate Karl-Anthony Towns misfired on 3-point attempts in the final moments.
	Pascal Siakam scored 17 points, Nembhard finished with 15 and Myles Turner added 14 for the Pacers. Haliburton handed out 11 assists.
	Towns collected 35 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks.
	Towns sank 4 of 8 shots from 3-point range, a big improvement after he made just 3 of 19 attempts from beyond the arc in New York's six-game series victory over the Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals.
	Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby each scored 16 points in the loss.
	Brunson committed his fifth foul with 10:05 remaining in the fourth quarter and retreated to the bench after T.J. McConnell made a free throw to pull Indiana within 94-92.
	New York, however, went on a 14-0 run in Brunson's absence, with Anunoby draining a 3-pointer and a short jumper to ignite the spurt. The Pacers did themselves no favors by fouling Miles McBride and Towns on 3-point attempts, with the duo combining to make 5 of 6 free throws.
	“I feel like our intensity dropped,” said New York's Josh Hart, who amassed eight points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. “We started playing slower. Playing more into their hands.”


	Louisiana native Dustin Poirier is locked for a UFC BMF title fight in his home state to conclude his career, as New Orleans will host Poirier's battle with title-holder Max Holloway to highlight the July 19 card at the Smoothie King Center.
	This will be the third battle between the lightweight combatants, the 36-year-old Poirier, who hails from Lafayette, Louisiana, taking the first two contests.
	Both fighters are coming off losses in title fights, however. Poirier (30-9) submitted to Islam Makhachev last June, while the 33-year-old Holloway (26-8) lost in knockout fashion to Ilia Topuria in October.
	“For Dustin Poirier to be able to finish his remarkable UFC career in New Orleans is special,” UFC executive vice president Peter Dropick said in a news release. “Thank you to the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation, the Louisiana Office of Tourism, New Orleans & Company and Smoothie King Center for helping us make this happen.
	“It's been 10 years since we've held an event in New Orleans, we know the fans are ready for us to be back!“
	The Octagon will also play host to ranked middleweights No 10 Marvin Vettori (19-8-1) and No. 11 Brendan Allen (24-7), who will do battle for the first time in an official capacity at UFC 318.
	The two were slated to fight at UFC Vegas 90 last April, though Vettori pulled out. A few months later, the pair squared off (unofficially) in a brawl at a Florida casino.
	Their ranked billing remains hotly anticipated.
	The rest of the lineup includes newly announced fights between Kyler Phillips (12-3) and Vinicius Oliveira (22-3) at the bantamweight level, Jimmy Crute (12-4-2) facing Marcin Prachnio (17-8) in light heavyweight and Carli Judice (4-2) battling Nicolle Caliari (8-3) at women's fly.
Other fights include:
	--No. 7 Amanda Ribas vs. No. 10 Tabatha Ricci in strawweight
	--Neil Magny vs. Gunnar Nelson in welterweight
	--Adam Fuitt vs. Islam Dulatov in welterweight
	--Ikram Aliskerov vs. Brunno Ferreira in middleweight


	NEW YORK: The case for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was simple. He's the best player on an Oklahoma City Thunder team that had the best record this season and set a league mark for margin of victory. If that wasn't enough, he also won the scoring title.


	That's an MVP year.


	Gilgeous-Alexander was announced Wednesday as the NBA's Most Valuable Player, his first time winning the award. It's now seven straight years that a player born outside the US won MVP, extending the longest such streak in league history.


	And when it happened, Gilgeous-Alexander said a life of moments — getting cut, traded, overlooked, celebrating, the wins, the good times — all flooded into his mind.


	“I don't think there's enough emphasis on how much off the court influences on the court,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “And once I became better off the court my career started to skyrocket. It's no coincidence.”


	It ultimately was a two-person race. Gilgeous-Alexander got 71 first-place votes and 29 second-place votes; Denver's Nikola Jokic got the other 29 first-place votes and the other 71 second-place votes.


	Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, getting 88 of the 100 possible third-place votes.


	Gilgeous-Alexander — the No. 11 pick in the 2018 draft — averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game this season, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record. The Thunder outscored teams by 12.9 points per game, the biggest margin in league history.


	He becomes the second Canadian to win MVP; Steve Nash won it twice.


	“He set the foundation,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of Nash. “He was the first Canadian basketball player I knew of. And without seeing guys go to the NBA from Canada, it wouldn't have been as much of a dream as it was for us as kids growing up. So, to be in a conversation with a guy like that and what he has meant to not only basketball but to the country of Canada, it's special.”


	And Gilgeous-Alexander is the first guard to win MVP since James Harden in 2018.


	“His value is his confidence,” Oklahoma City's Kenrich Williams said of Gilgeous-Alexander, his Thunder teammate for the last five seasons. “His confidence that he has in himself and the confidence that he instills in every one of his teammates, including the coaches.”


	Jokic — a winner of three of the last four MVP awards — was second, despite a season for the ages. He averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game, the first center to average a triple-double and the first player since all those stats were tracked to finish in the NBA's top three in all three of those categories.


	It was the sixth instance of a player finishing a season averaging a triple-double — at least 10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds per game. Russell Westbrook did it four times and Oscar Robertson once, but only one of those triple-double seasons led to an MVP win.


	“He's a special player,” Jokic said of Gilgeous-Alexander earlier this week when the Thunder eliminated the Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. “His shot selection, his shot capability ... he's always there. He's a special player.”


	Antetokounmpo, who averaged 30.4 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, was third. He started this run of international players winning MVP; Antetokounmpo, of Greek and Nigerian descent, won in 2019 and 2020.


	Jokic, a Serbian, won in 2021, 2022 and 2024. And Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, who was born in Cameroon but since became a US citizen, won the award in 2023.


	Now, it's Gilgeous-Alexander — a son of Ontario, where hockey reigns — carrying the MVP flag. He was fifth in the voting two years ago, second behind Jokic last year, and used being so close to the award as fuel this season.


	“There are voters every year. That will never change,” Gilgeous-Alexander said on TNT during the broadcast when the results were revealed. “And last year, all it meant was that more people thought I shouldn't have won than should have won. This year I wanted to change the narrative and have it flipped. I think I did a good job of that.”


	Boston's Jayson Tatum was fourth, Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James was sixth — the 20th time in his 22-year career that he got some MVP votes.


	Detroit's Cade Cunningham and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards tied for seventh, Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth and three players — the Los Angeles Clippers' Harden, New York's Jalen Brunson and Cleveland's Evan Mobley — tied for 10th.


	The MVP award, like most other NBA honors, was voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly before the start of the playoffs.


	The other awards that were part of that voting process and have already been unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning coach of the year, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels winning most improved player, San Antonio's Stephon Castle winning rookie of the year, Cleveland's Evan Mobley winning defensive player of the year, New York's Jalen Brunson winning clutch player of the year and Boston's Payton Pritchard winning sixth man of the year.


	Other awards announced by the league since the end of the regular season: Golden State's Stephen Curry won the Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year award, Warriors teammate Draymond Green won the hustle award, Oklahoma City's Sam Presti won executive of the year and Boston's Jrue Holiday won the sportsmanship award for the second time in his career as well as the league's social justice award.


	The award came at a price for Gilgeous-Alexander, who is in line for an extension that will easily top $300 million and could even see him make about $1 million per regular-season game in 2030-31 and 2031-32.


	He promised teammates watches if he won the MVP; those guys have those watches now, and they deserve all that and more, he said.


	“This is nothing compared to what they've been to me,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I would rather have the MVP over a Rolex every day of the week and without them, I wouldn't have the MVP.”","{'href': 'https://www.arabnews.com', 'title': 'Arab News'}","tennis"

Iga Swiatek's dominance on clay, especially at Roland Garros, has made her practically a lock for the French title in recent years.

But this time she arrives in Paris in a form slump, and somewhat startlingly will be seeded outside the top four.

After losing in the third round in Rome, where she was the defending champion, Swiatek fell to world No.5 – her lowest ranking in more than three years.

She has also failed to win a title since Roland Garros last year. You have to go back to 2019, the year of her tour-level debut, to find a period when Swiatek went 12 months without hoisting a trophy.

Still, she knows better than anyone how to get it done in the French capital. 


                                    Alcaraz-Sinner Grand Slam duopoly to continue at Roland Garros?

                                    Increasingly dominant, is clay Sabalenka's next domain?
                                

NEWS

A winner of four of the past five editions and the three-time defending champion, Swiatek could become the first woman in more than 100 years to win four in a row. The last to do so was French legend Suzanne Lenglen in 1923.

Swiatek has hoarded French titles to such an extent that there are only two other women competing today – Jelena Ostapenko and Barbora Krejcikova – who have also won the event.

So, will we see a new Roland Garros women's singles champion, or will Swiatek rediscover her winning ways at her favourite tournament? 

Sam Stosur, a Roland Garros finalist in 2010 who reached another three semifinals, says either possibility is plausible.

""I think the other top players and contenders people might be talking about for the title are like: ‘oh, here's our time',” Stosur told ausopen.com.

“We know what she's done but she's not playing like that right now, she's been struggling, hasn't won a title, etc. You'd be like, ‘this is my best chance probably in the last four or five years to be able to do that. 

""Given the player she is, the champion she's been, she's won multiple Grand Slams and been No.1 – Iga does have a lot of experience to now think: ‘OK, that is what I've got to now lean on going into this year's French Open, because I've proven time and time again that I can win it.

“So if she's ever going to feel good, it's gotta be coming now. She has to think of it as a positive that she's had the results at Roland Garros, and not the other way around. 

""But I would say most of the field are thinking: 'This is our opportunity here'.”

So who has the best opportunity? Stosur believes five players stand out.

The world No.1 is increasingly dominant, having already reached six finals in 2025 and winning three – Brisbane, Miami and Madrid.

She's 11-2 on clay this year – she reached the Stuttgart final and Rome quarters either side of her Madrid triumph – and is now almost 4,000 ranking points ahead of second-ranked Coco Gauff.

Since 2021 Sabalenka has been the game's most consistent performer at the majors, reaching 10 semifinals, five finals and winning three titles, most recently the 2024 US Open.

She's also come incredibly close in Paris, losing to Karolina Muchova from match point up in the 2023 semifinals, then last year suffering an illness-affected quarterfinal loss to Mirra Andreeva.

Stosur described those moments “little blips” which just happened to come at huge moments for her. ""I don't see that happening again,” she said.

“As each year's gone on, she's become more dominant, she's won multiple Slams now so it's kind of obvious that she's got that experience and backing behind her.

“One thing that she always does is bounce back so well, and I find it hard to believe that we're going to see that sort of snap from her again this year.

“I think she's going to be extremely tough. There's no reason why she can't win Roland Garros, she's got a huge game. I don't think there's as many clay-court specialists; I think everyone can play on it. 

“I will be interested to see how the next couple of weeks goes and plays out with her and Gauff.” 

One of the big beneficiaries of Swiatek's ranking fall, Gauff takes the No.2 seeded position at the opposite end of the draw to Sabalenka, meaning they can only meet in the final.

The last time they met in a major final, Gauff upset Sabalenka to win the 2023 US Open, but expressed surprise her first Grand Slam title was in New York – she always imagined it would come at Roland Garros.

The closest she got in Paris was the 2022 final, where she was overwhelmed by Swiatek. But she's wrested control of the match-up and won their past three meetings in straight sets, including a 6-1 6-1 thrashing in the recent Madrid semifinals.

COREY GAUFF: Serena's AO 2010 triumph kick-started Coco's tennis journey

“It was quite interesting to see that result and how it looked like Iga handled it and everything was a bit shocking, really. It was really unusual, given their past history,” Stosur said.

""Coco making back-to-back finals [in Madrid and Rome] is definitely a big boost in her year, because she hadn't been incredible, I think that's fair to say, right? Last couple of weeks she's managed to turn that around.” 

Indeed, Gauff heads to Paris having won 10 of her past 12 matches on clay.

The last of those matches was a loss in the Rome final to Italy's Jasmine Paolini, a stunning triumph that electrified fans at the Foro Italico while reminding everyone of her clay-court credentials.

Last year at Roland Garros Paolini powered into her first major final, then reached the Wimbledon final to establish herself as a bright new star.

Back inside the top four, she'll be looking to repeat her Parisian feat, and go one better.

""Paolini winning Rome, plus the doubles – that's a heck of an effort,” Stosur said.

“I wouldn't have said going into this year, ‘OK Paolini can make a couple of Grand Slam finals again'... but she's just played at an event [Rome] where everyone's playing, and she's gone and won it, with that home-town feeling. 

“That's huge for her going into Roland Garros now, trying to back up a finals appearance.”

Teenage star Andreeva has risen to a career-high ranking of world No.6 but is third in the Race to the WTA Finals after an outstanding season. 

Already in 2025, the 18-year-old has scooped WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells and continues to add to her game as she grows – literally – and matures.

Beating Sabalenka in last year's Roland Garros quarterfinals sent her through to her first Grand Slam semifinal, yet Stosur believes the pressure could go up a notch for her in Paris this year.

""She's been in probably the form of the year, really,” Stosur said. 

“I know this year she's been exceptionally good and we've seen improvements in all parts of her game. Now this is sort of the first time where she's going into a tournament and people are maybe talking about her.

“It could be a really interesting couple of weeks for her, with all of those elements. It's not just about hitting tennis balls and playing tennis, now; if she allows those other things to maybe enter her thoughts, how does she handle that?

""She's got an excellent person with her in Conchita Martinez to handle that side of things, and I've really enjoyed seeing their partnership grow. 

“This will probably be one of the biggest tests that they've maybe had, so far.”

Stosur said she would “throw a spanner in the works” by mentioning Zheng Qinwen's name among the favourites.

""The last time anyone played at Roland Garros was the Olympics, where she won gold,” Stosur pointed out.

“It was expected that Iga would probably win gold there and she ended up with bronze. Even just talking about psyche; going back to a place where you've been so dominant, but the last result she had there was probably quite disappointing. You just never know where players hold that sort of stuff months and months later. 

""On the flipside, for Qinwen winning gold, gosh, you're gonna feel pretty good going back there.”

Zheng, the AO 2024 finalist, may not have lit up the early parts of 2025 in the same way, but she's quietly built a solid record, reaching back-to-back quarterfinals at Indian Wells and Miami and maintaining her place in the top 10.

Since switching to clay she made another quarterfinal in Charleston then pushed Gauff to the limit in a compelling Rome semifinal.

""She's had a very good result last week,” Stosur said, “and at the last sort of minute maybe puts her hand up to say: 'hang on, I'm still here you guys, I'm still around'.""

Danielle Collins has shown her fiery side once again after blowing up at a cameraman at the Strasbourg Open.

Up against Brit Emma Raducanu, Collins was leading 4-6, 6-1, 4-3 as both players took a break.

With the camera focused on her from behind the umpire's stand, Collins spoke to the camera operator, pointing for him to move to the side so she could fill her water bottle.

Instead of moving onto the tennis court, the cameraman stepped back, much to the disapproval of Collins.

""No, no, no, I need to get water. We're in a changeover, you don't need to be that close to me and you don't need to be on top of Emma,"" she said.

""It's like widely inappropriate,"" she continued, looking up to the umpire.

""It's not that difficult to give space.""

Collins then looked at Raducanu and said sorry.

Raducanu was noticeably standing right next to the camera.

As she approached the court, Collins said to the umpire ""you need to get that man out of here"".

Naomi Osaka's Roland Garros outfit may be inspired by cherry blossoms, after she unveiled her custom Nike shoes that feature shades of pink and draw from French Baroque design. Osaka's custom outfits for Grand Slams showcase creativity and cultural influences, with flower themes planned for future events.

Flower power! Will Naomi Osaka's much-anticipated Roland Garros outfit be inspired by the cherry blossom?

Osaka revealed Tuesday that her sneaker muse for the clay-court major is the flower known as sakura in her native Japan. She gave her Instagram followers a first look at her signature Osaka GP Challenge 1 PRM Nike shoes in a light pink colorway, which Nike says features four branded shades -- Pink Foam, Pale Pink, Hyper Pink and Polarized Pink -- to create the theme, which also draws from French history.

""Spring is sakura season,"" Osaka wrote in the caption. ""The girlies are gonna love this one.""

""This special design is a luxurious take on an ornate bouquet from the French Baroque time period,"" the apparel-maker added on its website.

A post shared by 大坂なおみ🇭🇹🇯🇵 (@naomiosaka)

Osaka has been designing eye-catching custom outfits with Nike since 2019, and in April, she wrote on the social media app Threads that she was ""treating every Grand Slam like the Met Gala"" when it came to her future outfits -- getting fans excited for the creativity she no doubt has in store. She revisited some of her favorite 'fits in subsequent slides on her Instagram story -- her ""super suits,"" inspired by her heritage, family and other interests -- and reiterated that she was sourcing different florals as inspiration for her big-stage outfits in 2025.

At the Australian Open, Osaka first revealed that blossoms would play a big part in her on-court fashion on major stages this season. Sunflower motifs were prominent on her outfit Down Under, as her black, white and gray clothes were brightened up by Osaka GP Challenge 1 PRM shoes -- in a fitting sundial yellow and brown colorway and with abstract sunflower details on the shoe tongues and bodice -- and she completed the look with sunflower clips weaved in her braided hair and sunflower earrings.

""The Australian Open's the happy Slam, so I thought it was really fitting for it to have a sunny theme,"" she noted, and teased more to come.

""Every Slam this year will have a flower-themed shoe. I think that's really cute.""

Already spotted on the practice courts at Roland Garros, the former World No. 1 will fully unveil her spring threads when the main draw kicks off on May 25.

PADDOCK INSIDER: Leclerc concedes his Monaco victory hopes are ‘low' – but Ferrari ‘don't want to give up now'

FIA Thursday press conference – Monaco

Hamilton ‘buzzing' for first Monaco weekend with Ferrari after taking positives from Imola charge

Russell insists Mercedes 'need to find performance quickly' as team seek Monaco turnaround

The next stop on this European triple-header takes us to Monaco for one of the most prestigious events in sport. The famous street circuit is uniquely challenging, and is bound to test selection decisions in F1 Fantasy.

It's not too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer each week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

F1 FANTASY: The Official Formula 1 Fantasy Game - Play for free today

Ahead of each race weekend, the Strategist reviews seven unique F1 Fantasy assets that can help your team to fantasy success.

The Circuit de Monaco has a history of rewarding those that make the most of Qualifying on Saturday, given how difficult it can be to make overtakes, so remember to lock in your fantasy teams before Qualifying begins on May 24 at 1600 local time (1400 UTC).

Race Highlights: 2024 Monaco Grand Prix

For a pure points play this weekend, Charles Leclerc becomes an extremely tempting driver to own at his home race – perhaps even a candidate for the Final Fix chip should he deliver another successful result in Qualifying.

It has been a difficult season so far for the Ferrari driver, but he has salvaged four F1 Fantasy scores of 20+ points since his China disqualification.

ANATOMY OF AN OVERTAKE: Ex-F1 racer Jolyon Palmer breaks down three key moves at Tamburello in Sunday's Grand Prix

Encouragingly, the Monegasque racer has also recorded three pole positions in his last four visits to the French Riviera, plus his breakthrough victory in 2024. That result delivered 45 F1 Fantasy points and Driver of the Day honours for the hometown hero.

Although there may be some concerns around the pace and performance of the car, Leclerc may be hard to ignore if he is running near the top of the timing charts through free practice.

Leclerc will be searching for another strong result at home in Monaco this weekend

Yuki Tsunoda appears on the Strategist's watchlist for the first time this season after scintillating F1 Fantasy performances over the last two weeks which netted him 42 points.

The Japanese driver needs to score equal to or greater than -2 fantasy points to secure at least a $0.2m price rise.

READ MORE: Tsunoda takes positives from Imola recovery drive but admits he won't try to be a ‘hero' in next Qualifying sessions

Although his hefty price tag may dissuade potential new owners from the 5% owned Tsunoda, the improving Red Bull and his recent strong qualifying results – prior to Imola – suggest he's worth a look.

With an average qualifying position of 9.3 between Bahrain and Miami, and Tsunoda gaining more experience in the Red Bull machine, could more of the same be on the cards this weekend?

Tsunoda will be looking to bounce back in Qualifying this weekend after a disappointing result on Saturday in Imola

Carlos Sainz is coming off three consecutive P6 qualifying results in a car that has been on an upward trajectory in recent races.

The Spaniard has an exceptionally good record in Monte Carlo, having finished in the points at every Grand Prix there since his debut with Toro Rosso in 2015.

Sainz can also take confidence from more recent podium finishes in three of the last four Monaco Grands Prix.

At a track that tends to reward those that qualify well on Saturday, expect the Williams racer to be in the mix for another strong Q3 result this weekend.

Sainz has the fifth-best qualifying average on the grid over the last three races

Pierre Gasly appears on the F1 Fantasy radar in Monaco as a fantastic option to increase team value at a friendly price point.

The Frenchman only requires 7 fantasy points to increase $0.6m in value, on the back of averaging 10.5 points over his last two races.

READ MORE: Gasly hails ‘best Friday of the year' with P3 in Imola after bouncing back from ‘unfortunate' FP1 incident

The Alpine racer can also look to his recent Qualifying performances as a good omen for this weekend – four Q3 appearances for 2025, which includes a season-best P5 in Bahrain.

If Gasly can replicate some of this strong single-lap pace on Saturday, expect him to make a mockery of his $7.6m price tag over the weekend.

Gasly has shown impressive single lap pace on several occasions this season

Nico Hulkenberg has recorded back-to-back F1 Fantasy scores of 9 points in both Miami and Imola, positioning him to only need 5 fantasy points for a $0.6m price rise in Monaco.

The 234-race veteran's recent performances indicate he could once again deliver at a track that rewards experience and race craft.

READ MORE: Hulkenberg calls Imola ‘one of the closer ones' as Kick Sauber come within touching distance of points

At his price point, there are few other drivers on the grid that offer the same budget-gain upside and points reliability as the German does in Monaco.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Lando Norris

Hulkenberg's fantasy value and experience will make him an attractive asset to own this weekend

Red Bull have been the second-highest scoring constructor to McLaren over the last two races.

Max Verstappen has four front-row starts in his last five races and Tsunoda, prior to his Imola Qualifying crash, has had three Q3 appearances so far this season.

READ MORE: Horner hails Verstappen after ‘win it or bin it' Turn 1 move on Piastri at Imola

Verstappen has two wins, four podiums and three pole positions so far this campaign, and is just 22 points behind championship leader Piastri.

If this form and performance continues in Monaco, a circuit which punishes hesitation but rewards confidence, expect Red Bull to contend from the outset for more strong results.

Red Bull are building into form after Verstappen's second win of the season in Imola

Williams are proving to be great value for money, averaging more than 2 fantasy points per $1 million spent in the last three race weekends.

The Grove-based outfit have continued to improve after a mixed start to the season – improving every week since Bahrain with recent scores of 13, 27, 31 and 42.

READ MORE: Albon left with mixed feelings over P5 finish in Imola after ‘licking my lips' at potential Williams podium

With Sainz and Alex Albon securing the maximum 10 teamwork points in each of the last two race weekends for both making Q3, momentum is firmly on their side heading into Monaco.

Williams also provide an exceptional route to increasing your cost cap, only needing to exceed -13 fantasy points this weekend to achieve the maximum $0.6m price increase.

Other constructors to monitor: McLaren, Mercedes

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on free practice to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

Williams are back mixing it with the top teams and will target another strong result in Monaco

Formula 1 heads back to the streets of Monaco this weekend with Max Verstappen fresh off the back of another win in Italy. Can the reigning World Champion stand on the top step in the Principality again, or will McLaren pairing Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris be able to taste victory for the first time in Monaco? Here are what the odds tell us...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix

Five consecutive podiums for Oscar Piastri leave him 13 points ahead of team mate Lando Norris in the Drivers' Championship, but the Australian's three-race win streak came to an end at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix last weekend courtesy of Max Verstappen.

Even so, Piastri has finished on the podium in every race so far this year apart from the season-opener, all of which leaves him favourite to come out on top in Monaco. Norris, meanwhile, starts this weekend with the best finishing average on the grid at 2.29, while Verstappen is a two-time winner in Monaco.

Drivers' Championship leader Piastri is favourite for victory in Monaco

Piastri, Norris and Verstappen top the podium odds after accumulating 16 top-three finishes between them, with the trio finishing on the podium together at Suzuka and Imola.

George Russell disappointed in the last race after finishing outside of the top five for the first time this term, but the Mercedes driver has been consistent this season, securing a podium at four races this year.

Home hero Charles Leclerc will be hoping to reach the podium again after victory 12 months ago, while Ferrari team mate Lewis Hamilton will be attempting to improve on his fourth place at Imola this weekend.

Leclerc will be hoping to stand on the podium in front of his home crowd again

Verstappen and Norris are the only two drivers on the grid to have finished every Grand Prix inside the top six this season. The Red Bull driver finished on the cusp in Bahrain, while Norris drove his worst race in Saudi Arabia, crossing the line in fourth place.

Williams continue to impress this season as Alex Albon was fighting for a podium spot for the majority of the Emilia-Romagna race before finishing fifth, his third top-six finish in seven races.

Kimi Antonelli ended his home race in heartbreak as his Mercedes suffered reliability issues forcing him to retire - only the second race in 2025 where the Italian has missed out on a top-six return.

Albon has finished in the top-six three times so far this season

Hamilton has crossed the line inside the top 10 in his last five starts in Monaco, while Leclerc has a perfect record in his previous three races.

Carlos Sainz is starting to find his rhythm in the Williams and begins the extravagant affair fresh off three straight top 10s, while Yuki Tsunoda offers fine value for money in this area, with three top 10s between Bahrain and Emilia-Romagna. Finally, the young Frenchman Isack Hadjar consistently challenges for a top-10 spot, earning his third of the season last weekend.

Tsunoda is good value for money to finish inside the top-10

Piastri and Verstappen get their weekend underway tied for the most pole positions on the grid in 2025 with three each.

The importance of Qualifying in Monaco is elevated due to the difficulty in overtaking, leading to a trend of the fastest qualifiers taking the checkered flag.

Leclerc won from pole last year, while Sergio Perez is the only driver in the last five editions to triumph without starting from the first row.

Verstappen will look to beat Piastri in Monaco

Red Bull and Mercedes have dominated the Monte Carlo circuit in the last 10 races at this track, prevailing in four apiece. Red Bull holds the edge in recent years, winning four of the previous six with Verstappen handing the team the most recent triumph in 2023.

Mercedes enjoyed their success in the pre-COVID era, last tasting success in 2019 courtesy of Hamilton, while McLaren's last win at the track came in 2008, also from Hamilton.

The new film from the maker of 'Why We Fight' focuses on the fourteen years the famous WikiLeaks founder spent confined to an embassy and a London prison.


							By 

	Jordan Mintzer



	Unless you followed the ups and downs — well, mostly the downs — of Julian Assange's life over the past 15 years, you'll have to wait until the last half-hour of Eugene Jarecki's new documentary, The Six Billion Dollar Man, to understand what its title means.


	By that point, the WikiLeaks founder had been holed up for over six years at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he faced imminent arrest by the UK authorities. It's then that we learn how the first Trump administration offered, via the IMF, to loan Ecuador's government $6.5 billion if they agreed to kick Assange out. The move is not exactly shocking, especially coming from a dealmaker like Trump, and it shows just how much the U.S. authorities were willing to pay so they could nab one of their most wanted men.

The Bottom Line

	
	Conventional but substantive.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Special Screenings)Director: Eugene Jarecki

								2 hours 6 minutes			






	Much of Jarecki's jam-packed and informative two-hour feature, which premiered as a special screening in Cannes, focuses on the decade-plus legal rollercoaster ride that Assange and his team of committed lawyers were obliged to take. The film can get a bit repetitive during all those scenes at the embassy, which is not the most cinematic of locations. But we do grasp the sense of confinement and growing paranoia Assange experienced for years on end. Technically he wasn't in jail, but his life was under house arrest.




			Related Video		







	The first half of The Six Billion Dollar Man gives us some of the backstory leading up to that point, showing how Assange rose from unknown Australian hacker to worldwide hero of free journalism to public enemy number one, especially for the American government.


	Founded in 2006, his tiny startup WikiLeaks became a phenomenon the next year when Assange released a video called Collateral Murder, unveiling leaked footage of U.S. Marines massacring Iraqi civilians. (Jarecki includes a long excerpt, which is as disturbing now as it was back then.) In the years that followed, the site dumped thousands of redacted documents online, including military field logs, diplomatic communications, and lots of nasty emails between members of the Democratic National Committee.


	This was a promising time for the internet, when it seemed like online journalism could shake up the world order. “Would you rather not know?” a bearded Edward Snowden explains (presumably from Moscow), referring to all the information Assange was offering up free of charge. But that period would be short-lived, especially when the U.S. struck back against the many compromising documents WikiLeaks was putting out in public. “A fight with the Pentagon only ends one way,” is what one interviewee tells Jarecki, and the rest of the movie shows how our government desperately tried to land Assange behind bars, leaving him no option but to take political asylum in the only place he could get it.

	











	Jarecki is no stranger to the abuses of U.S. power, especially in early features like The Trials of Henry Kissinger and Why We Fight that focused on disastrous American foreign policy, from the Vietnam War to the War in Iraq. In the opening sections of his new doc, he does a good job contextualizing the importance of Assange's work, which aired lots of embarrassing — not to mention criminalizing —  dirty laundry under the administrations of both Obama and Trump, neither of whom come off as good guys here.


	Enough happened in those early WikiLeaks years to fill an entire series, requiring Jarecki and his team of four editors to condense tons of material until they get to the heart of the matter for them, which is Assange's ten years of legal hell in England.


	Two co-stars appear in the story at that point: The first is Jennifer Robinson, a human rights lawyer and fellow Aussie, who defended Assange when he first received an international arrest warrant in 2010, then stuck with him until the bitter end. The other is Stella Assange, an attorney and advocate for WikiLeaks, who fell in love with its founder while he was under embassy lockdown, giving birth to their first child. For all the dark clouds of that period, the silver lining was that Assange — whose legal woes started with an eventually dropped rape investigation in Sweden — managed to find his soulmate.


	Chock-full of talking heads, archive footage, CCTV images, clandestine iPhone shots and catchy music cues that are also a tad obvious (in one scene, M.I.A.'s “Paper Planes” drops as Assange tosses actual paper planes out of a window), the filmmaking in The Six Billion Dollar Man can be far more conventional than the man in question, whose appearance changes drastically as the years of purgatory drag on.

	











	But if there's more substance than style in Jarecki's movie, there's also plenty of truth-telling. And as Naomi Klein says toward the end of the film, in a simple statement that sums up what WikiLeaks represented back when it was created, and still means right now in our age of rampant misinformation: “The truth matters.”

Lower assures The Hollywood Reporter that Dan Erickson and Ben Stiller aren't playing mind games with their cast — well, not beyond literally the entire plot of the show.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



[Do not read further if you have yet to watch the Severance season two finale in full. But also, what's taking you so long?]


	It's frustrating when TV storylines keep us in suspense for literal years, as was the case of Severance season one to season two. While the same (real) time will not lapse between the Apple TV+ series' second and third seasons — Ben Stiller promises! — we don't have to wait until season three to re-engage in some Severance season two-finale cliffhanger chatter.




The Hollywood Reporter grabbed Britt Lower while she was on a break filming Netflix's adaptation of Harlan Coben novel I Will Find You (Lower is “still a redhead” for that one, she says) to ask her all the burning questions about her other streaming drama.

	Did Mark S. (Adam Scott) make the right decision at the end of season two, when he chose himself and Helly R. over his Outtie/Mark Scout and Gemma Scout/Ms. Casey? And, is she sure sure she wasn't actually Helena Eagan when that all went down? Read on for her answers, below.


	***


How much do you know about season three?


	I honestly don't know anything. I wish I did. I'm as hungry as the fans are to find out what these characters are going to get up to, and I probably have as many daydreams as as you all might about where they're gonna go and what they might be thinking.


How has your career changed since Severance?


	It's really hard to comprehend the scope of how impactful the show has been. When you do theater, of which I do a fair amount, I do live performance — someone gave me this analogy the other day that I've been really thinking about. You do a play and you go out at the end to do a bow, and that bow is not only to receive applause, which is so lovely, but also it's a way to thank the audience for coming to the show, to honor the audience by saying, “Hey, this would be weird if we were doing this to an empty room. Thank you for coming.”


	In TV and film, we don't have that immediate audience response, right? There's a year or two between when we step into the character's perspective and when the audience sees it. So, doing press and getting to see how the fans are impacted by what we've done is our chance to take that bow.


	That's always the goal with art, right? That it somehow has a resonance with the audience, and we're on this journey together. My personal opinion is that art is this chance for us to to think about what really makes us human. When we're making art, we're saying, “Who am I really? What makes our consciousness different from a tulip or a bird or AI?”

	











When did you first learn you would be playing Helena Eagan in addition to Helly R.?


	I suppose it was after I was cast — pretty early on that was embedded into the storyline. I did not know that it was Helly and Helena when I auditioned, but once I got the news that I was going to get to be Helly R., then Dan Erickson and Ben Stiller told me the full scope of season one and that all of the Innies get this little glimpse of who they are on the outside. Because we film the show out of order, we were privy to the whole arc ahead of time, so you're sort of stringing that process together.


A trend has been one actor playing twins — is it like that for you?


	I'm always trying to come up with new analogies. It's these two parts of the same person. They share the same anatomy, they share the same physiology. They share some of the same psychology, because they have a subconscious that's shared, but it's their consciousness that's different, right? Their subjective experience of awareness, of being awake, is separate in the same way that, as an actor, I share the same body as Helly, and I share some of the same subconscious space. If I bruise my elbow on set as Helly, I'm gonna feel it as Brit. But I have a different consciousness than these two parts of the character that I play.


Fans pretty quickly picked up on the physical differences you bring to the characters, like their different postures. Can you talk about creating that tool for yourself?


	My job is to sculpt the inner life of each of them, and sometimes stuff that's happening internally affects how the character moves through the world. Some of that the fans picked up on and that just happened as a result. Helly has this drive. She moves with a lot of conviction and determination. And Helena kind of waits for the world to come to her. Their psychology works differently, given their circumstances.

	











When did you first learn what Cold Harbor is?


	For season two, I had the pleasure as an actor of now stepping into that weird world of the Lumon higher-ups and seeing what it's like to be a Lumon worker as Helena, and how everyone's always watching each other — and the extent to which Helena is aware of what's happening in the company is also a little mysterious. She knows a lot, but there are also things kept from different departments within Lumon. I had to know at least what Cold Harbor was as Helena. But the extent to which she knows what it is, I'm not certain.


I know you've said that was definitely Helly R. in the season two finale and not Helena (again pretending to be Helly R.) — but are you sure Dan (Erickson) and Ben (Stiller) didn't lie to you about that to get a certain performance?


	That's so funny. No, there's no trickery involved in the Severance collaborative. If you track the whole episode and you see Helly trapping Milchick (Tramell Tillman) in a bathroom, her friend, Dylan (Zach Cherry), comes to help. She runs and stands on the tri-desk, remembering her friend Irving (John Turturro) and looking out at this sea of humanity of the Innies… That speech really embodies the question of the whole season: Are Innies people?


	In season one, [Helena tells Helly] she isn't a person and has no right to make choices about her body. Helly had no connection to meaning in the work that they were doing on the Lumon floor. She was like, “This has no meaning to me whatsoever, get me out of here at all costs. In fact, I'm willing to risk my life to do so. Get me out of here.” The question of season one is, who am I in relationship to this work, which doesn't have meaning to me (Helly)? Then, over time, she's forming this chosen family with Irving, Dylan and with Mark. The connection she has to these people who she loves is then the journey of season two. All of these Innies have this new information about who they are, and it makes them even hungrier for purpose and meaning in their lives.

	











	So then to see her on that tri-desk at the end saying, “They give us half a life and think we won't fight for it?” I just can't believe that anyone else would have said that.


Did Mark S. make the right decision at the end of season two?


	Well, again, I'm gonna go back to that question of, are Innies people? Like, Helena says to Helly R., “I am a person, you are not. I make the decisions, you do not.” So I think embedded in your question is: Is he allowed to make a decision?


	Mark's subjective experience of awareness — his consciousness — is separate from his Outtie's. So, you have to put yourself in his shoes. These Innies have been stripped of so much already, right? They don't get to see daylight. They don't get to experience music or art — not really, not very much, at least. They don't get to make choices about what they're gonna have for lunch, or what they put on in the morning. And to expect him to make a decision for his Outtie's dream to reunite with his wife is perhaps a step too far.

""We are on the right side of history,"" the Irish rap trio said in a statement after Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh was charged with displaying a Hezbollah flag.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh, one-third of Irish rap group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offense in the U.K.


	Ó Hannaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara and was a star of Rich Peppiatt's “print the legend” biopic on the Belfast, Ireland-based band, is accused of “displaying a flag in support of proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London gig,” according to the city's Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard.




	The 27-year-old was charged by the police after an incident on Nov. 21, 2024 at a venue in north London. He is due to appear in court on June 18.

	The band took to social media after news of the charge. “We deny this ‘offense' and will vehemently defend ourselves,” said Kneecap. “This is political policing. This is a carnival of distraction. 14,000 babies are about to die of starvation in Gaza, with food sent by the world sitting on the other side of a wall, and once again the British establishment is focused on us.”


	Concluded the band: “We are on the right side of history. You are not. We will fight you in court. We will win.”


	The group has drawn widespread criticism in recent months, and the Met Police said it would investigate after online videos showed the band calling for the death of British parliament ministers, as well as chanting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” It is illegal in the U.K. to express support for Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon, as it is considered a terrorist organization in Britain.


	Kneecap, which also includes members Naoise Ó Cairealláin and J.J. Ó Dochartaigh, said the video in question has been taken out of context, and that they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah.


	Last year, the movie Kneecap, also starring Michael Fassbender, dominated film headlines. Director Peppiatt made BAFTA history by tying the record for nominations for a debut filmmaker with six. He won one BAFTA — namely for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer — serving as both writer and director of the film.


	But the group's political views have gotten them into hot water. In April, they displayed messages about the ongoing war in Gaza during their Coachella set, leading to the cancellation of their concerts in Germany. Later, they parted ways with their booking agency Independent Artist Group, sources confirm to The Hollywood Reporter.












	Kneecap is set to headline the Wide Awake festival in South London on Friday.

The actress told The Hollywood Reporter at the New York premiere that her characters in 'White Lotus' and 'Sirens' are ""polar opposite,"" but they share being ""underestimated."" 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



Meghann Fahy adds another high-society series to her résumé — but this time, she's not playing the wealthy one.


	In Netflix‘s upcoming series Sirens, created by Molly Smith Metzler (Maid), Fahy plays Devon, a character who comes from a poor upbringing in Buffalo and is spending the weekend on an island, living in luxury, but whose main focus is helping her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) leave her boss Michaela Kell (Julianne Moore), a dame of the island's high society.




	When taking on this role, she skipped a phone call to Mike White, asking for any pointers. “I think the character that I played in White Lotus of Daphne and Devon in this show, Sirens, are so polar opposite, in most ways,” she told The Hollywood Reporter of the characters at the premiere Tuesday. “The one storyline that I could identify between those two women is just that they are underestimated. They are not what they appear to be at first glance, and they are misjudged for that.”

	In the second season of White's cultural phenomenon The White Lotus, which follows the privileged lives of vacationers staying at a luxury resort, Fahy's Daphne is married to financier Cameron (Theo James). And while the other characters assume she's superficial at first, she proves to be a lot more complex throughout the series as the dynamics with her husband are revealed.

	However, Fahy addressed the similarities between the shows' themes. “Of course everyone's obsessed with wealth and dissecting it and making fun of it and all those things, so there's a lot of that happening these days,” she said.


	Even though every season of The White Lotus begins with a mystery death, by the end of the show, it could be easy to label who the show's villain is, but what unravels always makes it more complex than naming just one. And in Sirens, there's a lot to be said about the class system, too.


	“Society is the real villain,” Alcock said. “It's the pressures that these women have to upkeep. Not only these women, but these men.” 


	Castmember Josh Segarra thinks the darker moments are because of “greed” and “everyone wanting more.”


	Meanwhile, Fahy, believes the show is all about “perception and how we see people and how we misjudge people.”

Stars of the surreal mystery series will make 18 stops around the U.S. to discuss stories from in front of and behind the camera, with two events taking place at iconic series locations.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


Twin Peaks fans who were left wanting more following the series' long-awaited third season in 2017, rejoice: Top members of the original cast are set to tour the country later this year.


	Starting in early August, stars of the surreal David Lynch and Mark Frost-created saga will be sitting down for nostalgic conversations in cities across the U.S., from Tysons, Virginia, to Seattle, Washington. Ray Wise (who played Leland Palmer), Harry Goaz (Deputy Andy Brennan) and Kimmy Robertson (Lucy Moran) as well as Twin Peaks: The Return executive producer Sabrina S. Sutherland will share their experiences on the series and swap behind-the-scenes stories at the ticketed events.

	Sheryl Lee, who played the high school homecoming queen whose murder formed the central mystery of the story and gave a startling starring turn in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, will additionally appear at certain stops in the Western U.S. 


	The tour will kick off less than a year after series co-creator Lynch's death at the age of 78. According to Sutherland, the cinematic legend gave his blessing for the tour before he passed.


	“David was very happy that we were going to have this cast tour to celebrate Twin Peaks with the fans all around the U.S.,” Sutherland said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “It's sad that I won't be able to call him each night to let him know how the show went as I had promised. But I look forward to celebrating his work each night and having him in my heart instead.”


	The tour (see all events here) also includes two stops at iconic series locations in Washington state. In an engagement that's already sold out, on Oct. 18 fans will be able to tour the house in Everett, Washington that served as the Palmer residence in the series, with Lee, Wise and property owner Mary Reber, who played Alice Tremond, telling stories from the series and Fire Walk With Me. (The event promises tea — no word yet on coffee and cherry pie.)


	And on October 20, Lee and Wise will visit the Kiana Lodge in Poulsbo, Washington, where interiors of the Great Northern Hotel and the Martells' home were shot. The venue's exterior is perhaps even more famous, with Laura Palmer having been found dead and wrapped in plastic by a giant log on the beach outside in the Twin Peaks pilot.

	











	David Roy Williams Entertainment is producing the shows under license from Paramount Location-Based Experiences as Lynch fandom and Twin Peaks nostalgia is having another moment. 


	This year's Cannes Film Festival saw the premiere of the documentary Welcome to Lynchland, which examined the Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive filmmaker's life and career, while a nonfiction film focused on the life and work of Catherine Coulson, Twin Peaks' beloved “Log Lady,” has been screening in cities around the U.S.


	A watercooler hit when it premiered on ABC in 1990, Twin Peaks have been credited with helping to create prestige television as we now know it with its continuous mystery structure, cinematic flourishes and devoted fan community. After Twin Peaks was canceled in its second season, Lynch returned to the Pacific Northwest with Fire Walk With Me, which was considered a box office and critical failure upon release, but has since been reappraised (and gotten the Criterion Collection treatment).


	In 2017, Lynch and Frost smashed expectations with their Showtime limited series Twin Peaks: The Return, which both confounded and delighted audiences with its idiosyncratic structure but typical (at least of Lynch's work) lack of reassuring answers.

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	For his return to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night (May 21), Jin transformed the stage into a giant bed — and Billboard has the exclusive preview photos to prove it.


	The BTS member made himself at home in Studio 6B, getting extra cozy for his performance of “Don't Say You Love Me,” the lead single from his just-released second solo EP Echo. Jin dropped the seven-track project — the follow-up to his November debut solo EP Happy — on Friday, May 16.

In addition to his comfy performance, Jin also sat down for an interview with Fallon — just like he did for his first solo appearance on The Tonight Show late last year. And this time, he turned the tables on Fallon too, jumping behind the desk to grill the late-night host.


	Jin's superstar group BTS — also comprised of SUGA, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook — first visited The Tonight Show back in 2018 for a performance of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 11 hit “Idol” and “I'm Fine.” In 2020, the boys made multiple Tonight Show appearances — including a couple of virtual performances on the show during the COVID-19 pandemic — before returning again in 2021 for performances of their No. 1 hits “Butter” and “Permission to Dance.”


	Back in March, Jin's BTS bandmate j-hope made his solo Tonight Show debut and got similarly cozy, rocking a pair of fluffy bunny slippers with his jeans-and-black-blazer ‘fit.


	To watch Jin's full performance and interview, tune in to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night (May 21) at 11:35 p.m. ET on NBC, or streaming on Peacock.

	BTS' Jin made a triumphant return to U.S. late-night television this week, delivering a stirring performance of his new single “Don't Say You Love Me” on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (aired May 21).

	Taking the stage with signature poise, Jin performed the emotional ballad under soft, moody lighting, accompanied by a live band and backing vocalists. His warm yet melancholic tone filled the studio as he sang the reflective lyrics from “Don't Say You Love Me,” a track that has quickly become a standout on Echo, which dropped last Friday (May 16).

	











	Before the performance, Jin joined Fallon for a light-hearted interview segment that included a comedic role reversal, with Jin briefly acting as the show's emcee. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	When asked about his next chapter as a solo artist, Jin shared details about his upcoming Hi-Seokjin fan tour. “You might be expecting my vocal skills, but I hope you're most excited to see my face up close,” he joked with a smile.


	The Hi-Seokjin event series kicks off this Friday in New York City, where Jin will meet with 1,000 fans for an exclusive concert and fan interaction. He'll then return to South Korea to play two sold-out shows in Goyang on May 28 and 29, with additional Asian dates expected to follow.


Echo has already topped the iTunes charts in over 60 countries and received early critical praise for its blend of tender ballads and experimental production. 


	“Don't Say You Love Me” serves as the centerpiece of the project, showcasing Jin's evolution as a solo vocalist and storyteller.


	Jin previously appeared on The Tonight Show in November 2024 to perform “Running Wild,” a track from his debut solo EP. His return signals a strong re-entry into the global spotlight as he prepares to embark on his first official fan tour, while BTS continue to pursue solo activities during their staggered enlistment period.

	The album's announcement was also paired with the news that it appears to thematically continue the narrative arcs which the band have focused on across the past decade. “Hello Clancy. Hello Blurryface,” they wrote on social media. “Let's finish this.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Referencing the titular characters of their 2024 and 2015 LPs Clancy and Blurryface, respectively, the record will ostensibly wrap up the narratives that have also continued across records such as 2018's Trench and 2021's Scaled and Icy.


	Composed of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, Twenty One Pilots first formed in 2009 and released a pair of independent records before 2013's Vessel served as their major label debut and commercial breakthrough, ultimately peaking at No. 21 on the Billboard 200. The group received their first No. 1 with 2015's Blurryface, with their following records all reaching the top three.


	More recently, Twenty One Pilots wrapped their Clancy World Tour with a series of U.K. dates earlier this month. These shows made headliners when, in the final moments of their gig at Manchester's AO Arena on May 11, a concertgoer was seen grabbing one of Dun's drums and casually walking away with it. 


	“I really don't think you should take that,” one fan can be heard saying in a widely shared video of the alleged theft, as another adds, “Have I just witnessed a crime. Has she actually just stolen that drum? That's crazy.”


	Though the unnamed fan initially appeared to get away with the souvenir unhindered, dedicated fans went into full investigative mode to attempt to track them down. The hours-long search appeared to pay off when Twenty One Pilots' behind-the-scenes tour videographer Sax posted on Instagram on May 12 that the one-of-a-kind drum had been returned.

The confidential settlements are the latest in a string of lawsuits accusing brands of using copyrighted songs in TikTok and Instagram ads without paying for licenses.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Universal Music Group (UMG) and the Beastie Boys have both reached confidential settlements to end lawsuits in which they accused restaurant chain Chili's of using their music in social media advertisements without permission.  


	Two court filings on Wednesday (May 21) informed federal judges that Chili's owner Brinker International agreed to settlements with both UMG and the Beastie Boys during a mediation session two weeks earlier. The terms of the settlements have not been revealed, as is typical in these types of lawsuits.


	UMG and the Beastie Boys both sued Brinker in 2024, alleging Chili's featured their copyrighted music in advertisements on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms without buying so-called “synch” licenses.




			Trending on Billboard		







	While social media platforms provide huge libraries of licensed music for users to add to their videos, a brand must purchase a special synch license if it wants to include a song in any commercial or promotional content.


	The Beastie Boys, who are famously averse to their music appearing in advertisements, claimed in a July lawsuit that Brinker used their iconic 1994 song “Sabotage” in a promotional video without permission.


	To add insult to injury, the Beastie Boys said this Chili advertisement also showed three men in “70s-style” wigs, fake mustaches and sunglasses carrying out a “robbery” of food ingredients from a Chili's. The rap trio claimed these visuals clearly evoked the “Sabotage” music video, which featured Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz, Michael “Mike D” Diamond and the late Adam “MCA” Yauch in similar attire.


	UMG followed up with its own lawsuit this past October, alleging that dozens of Chili's social media advertisements used unlicensed music from the label. UMG said the restaurant company's wrongdoing extended to more than 60 songs by artists including Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Lana Del Rey, ABBA, Luke Bryan, Travis Scott, Bruno Mars, Lil Nas X, Earth Wind & Fire and The Weeknd.


	According to Wednesday's court filings, both UMG and the Beastie Boys have reached agreements “in principle” to end their claims against Brinker. The settlement deals are currently being finalized, and both lawsuits are expected to be closed by early July.


	A UMG rep declined to comment on the settlement news. Spokespeople for the Beastie Boys and Brinker did not immediately return requests for comment.


	Numerous brands have faced lawsuits in recent years from music companies and artists over the use of copyrighted songs in social media ads. All three major labels sued drink maker Bang Energy for this in 2021, leading to closely-watched judgments in favor of UMG and Sony.


	In July, Kobalt and other music publishers brought lawsuits against more than a dozen NBA teams over the use of songs in social media videos, leading to a bevy of settlements earlier this year. And just last month, a Detroit-area Ford dealership settled claims that it unlawfully featured Eminem's “Lose Yourself in TikTok videos.

From Dot's new verse on ""Family Ties"" to SZA bringing out Lizzo for a ""Special"" surprise, here are the best moments from the first LA stop of their Grand National Tour.


													By
												

	Heran Mamo



	“You said you feel the love, right?” Kendrick Lamar asked SZA after performing their twinkling 2018 hit collab “All the Stars” during the first LA tour stop of their Grand National Tour at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium Wednesday night (May 21). 


	“I think so,” she responded breathlessly. “You feel it?” 


	“I definitely feel it.” 


	The two dove head over heels into “Love” from his 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN., with SZA's honeyed vocals taking the track's featured artist Zacari's place. While Dot has been hailed as a generational hater for vanquishing Drake in last year's monthslong epic rap war, the stadiums he and SZA have been dominating for the last month since the tour started don't feel like battlefields. Sincere and cheeky love songs like “Snooze” and “Kiss Me More” share the stage with scathing and calculated diss tracks like “Euphoria” and, of course, the five-time Grammy-winning juggernaut “Not Like Us.” The Grand National Tour serves as a well-deserved victory lap for Lamar, who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year, and SZA, whose 2022 blockbuster album SOS has continued breaking Billboard 200 chart records three years later. Because what's better than taking over one stadium? Taking over 32.


	As both superstars embarked on separate and at times intertwined trips down memory lane throughout the show, their modes of transportation were very different, yet very them. Lamar pulled up in his sleek black 1987 Buick GNX and frequently flexed his signature whip on stage, while SZA's “ride” was a gigantic animatronic ant named Anthony (because why not) that carried her throughout “Kitchen.” Shortly after, she sang Rihanna's “Consideration” lyric about “ridin' in on a pale white horse,” but that couldn't be further from the truth. One can only dream of RiRi returning to any stage for their first joint performance of the song since the 2016 Brit Awards, but SZA did surprise concertgoers with her “best friend” Lizzo.


	The dynamic duo ended on a high note with the one-two punch of “Luther” and “Gloria,” the former of which has spent the last 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as of this week (chart dated May 24), and samples Luther Vandross' 1982 hit “If This World Were Mine.” Well, if you're Kendrick Lamar and SZA, it certainly feels like it is.  


	Here are the five best moments from the first SoFi Stadium stop during their Grand National Tour.


	“We've been all around the world and back, we was on the East Coast, we was in the South for a little bit, but you know I couldn't motherf–king wait to make sure I came back home, you hear me!” he exclaimed at the base of the stage, homecoming hurrahs greeting him from every corner. “Is Long Beach in this motherf–ker tonight? Is South Central in this motherf–ker tonight? Better yet, is Watts in this motherf–ker tonight? Is Inglewood in this motherf–ker tonight? Is Compton in this motherf–ker tonight?”


	After Lizzo caught a vibe at the after party for SZA's Not Beauty brand in Brooklyn earlier this month, SZA brought out her “best friend for energy and positivity,” she announced before the pop star popped out for a precious performance of the “Special” remix. While the “Good as Hell” hitmaker was the only special guest for the first LA stop, her feelgood attitude and undeniable star power sufficiently filled up the stadium.  


	Even though he brought out his younger cousin Baby Keem to perform “Family Ties” during one of their MetLife Stadium stops earlier this month, Lamar held his own with a new verse. “Ay, you n—as will never compare to me/ F— poppin' in, I'mma declare the streets/ My mama said ‘be scared of God'/ On God, they better be scared of me/ Beverly playing, I was making a right/ Pop punani ain't making it right/ Told you, you would fight my fight/ I'm buckling up,” he rapped.


	Following “Snooze,” SZA re-emerged onto the stage in a glimmering chrysalis gown with wings during “Crybaby” and caught flight mid-song. She eventually shed the long skirt and completed her metamorphosis into a beautiful butterfly before jumping into her Hot 100 top 10 hit “Nobody Gets Me.” “I wrote this about my ex-fiancé. He hates me,” she said matter-of-factly before encouraging her fans to sing along for him. When asked during one of the deposition video skits if she thought she would have hit songs without dysfunction in her relationships, SZA responded, “No, so grateful. I owe everything to those terrible… interactions.” 


	It's a poignant reminder that personal growth and prosperity don't come without its own set of challenges, but the end result make everything worth it.


	SZA has certainly found her sweet spot in the buddy comedy world. After fighting with her bestie/roommate (played by Keke Palmer) while facing eviction in their critically acclaimed One of Them Days film earlier this year, she took on the role of Dot's nagging little sister during one of the video sketches as the two pulled up to the gas station – in his GNX, no less – and bickered over which snacks he needs to pick up.


	“What is it, chimmy chua?” he asked her, acting puzzled over the pronunciation of the sweet, salty and spicy Mexican delight.


	“Chamoy,” she responds snootily. “Your fans are Mexican. How do you… Chamoy!” 


	As he walked away muttering his frustrations under his breath, his LA-based Mexican fanbase nearly lost theirs after having the spotlight on them. Lamar has long documented his appreciation for this demographic and recently featured mariachi singer Deyra Barrera on “Wacced Out Murals,” “Reincarnated” and “Gloria” on GNX, as well as Mexican rappers Peysoh and Lefty Gunplay on the title track and “TV Off,” respectively.

With a new label, new management and collabs with Shakira, Manuel Turizo and Grupo Frontera, the Spanish star returns with new album ¿Y Ahora Qué? 


													By
												

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


	Back in 2005, Spanish star Alejandro Sanz — the heartthrob with raspy vocals, a poet's way with words and a flamenco flair that defined his global pop sound — teamed with another superstar, Colombia's Shakira, for “La Tortura,” a sexy flamenco/reggaetón vamp.


	It was a headline-grabbing collaboration at a time when such pairings were scarce in Latin music: Spain's most lauded and top-selling artist cavorting with a crossover star at the height of her popularity.


	Accompanied by a video dripping in sensuality, featuring an oil-bathed Shakira writhing on a kitchen table, the song exploded, notching a then-record 25 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.

	











	Twenty years later, Shakira and Sanz again danced together to heightened expectations. On May 13, the Colombian star invited her Spanish buddy as a special guest to the opening date of her U.S. tour at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., where the two performed “La Tortura.”


	The moment served as a bookend in Sanz's career as he prepares to release ¿Y Ahora Qué?, his first studio album in four years, featuring “Bésame,” a new duet with Shakira, as the focus track. The song, which harks back to the flamenco/Caribbean sound of “La Tortura” but is set over sparse dance beats, boasts that mix of sophisticated and commercial that has informed so many Sanz hits through the years.


	But ¿Y Ahora Qué?, which translates to “Now What?,” is as existential as it is hit-driven, navigating intensely personal fare with humor and unexpected turns.


	“It's what you ask yourself every time you start something new, every time you face change, when you change your sentimental life and things happen that truly move you,” Sanz says, sitting next to me on a couch on a Tuesday afternoon.


	Fit, tan and still charmingly impish, Sanz met with Billboard over a glass of red wine at Sony's 5020 Studios in Miami in early May. This kind of scenario — warm, open, unscripted — has very much been the Sanz way through the years; once he opens up, he shuns formality and careful choreography.


	His first album on Sony Music Latin, Y Ahora, is an EP that follows a turbulent period where he switched labels (leaving Universal after a decade in 2021), his former manager took him to court, and, most recently, he publicly dealt with depression and a romantic breakup.

	











	Aside from longtime friend Shakira, Sanz also collaborates with hot new hit-makers Grupo Frontera — in a salsa that steers the act far from its regional Mexican sound — and Manuel Turizo, who eschews his up-tempo rhythmic dance fare for a more melancholy ballad.


	For Sanz, it's a jump of boldness and optimism after the storm. The cover of the album shows him in various stages of movement — walking, leaping, running — as does his newly released tour art. Sanz is a prolific live artist whose 2023 shows grossed $23.8 million and sold 235,000 tickets, according to Billboard Boxscore. All told, between 2022 and 2024, his Sanz en Vivo tour (his largest to date), played 86 concerts throughout Europe, Mexico, South America and the United States, selling over 860,000 tickets and grossing $100 million, according to his management. Sanz has already announced the first leg of his new tour and is slated to play 17 dates in Mexico, including four-sold nights at Auditorio Nacional from a presale, prompting the addition of two more.


	But Sanz's real strength lies in his songs. Rhythmically complex and riveting, underscored by his distinctively raspy voice, Sanz's compositions have led to 14 career entries on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart, including four No. 1s and 11 top 10s. On Hot Latin Songs, he has notched 28 entries, including 10 top 10s and five No. 1s; he has won five Grammys and 25 Latin Grammys, and he holds the title for most wins — seven — for record of the year at the Latin Grammys.


	In his native Spain, Sanz still boasts the top-selling album of all time, according to local society Promusicae: his 1997 breakthrough, Más, which has been certified 22 times platinum for 2.2 million certified copies sold, and includes his biggest, most lasting hit, “Corazón Partío.”

	











	“In my opinion, Alejandro is the best Spanish-language composer of all time,” says Iñigo Zabala, the former head of Warner Music Latin America & Spain who signed Sanz to his first recording deal back in 1991.


	Today, Zabala co-manages Sanz in an unorthodox agreement with Alex Mizrahi, with the two executives focused on different areas of his career. Mizrahi, who heads management and promotion company OCESA-Seitrack, oversees Sanz's international management and business, while Zabala, who is also a musician, handles his recording career and creative output.


	The two began managing Sanz in 2022 when the artist was at a crossroads. He had no formal manager and had decided to end his contract with Universal Music, his home since 2011. But he continued touring, and Mizrahi, his agent in Latin America, yearned to expand his relationship with him.


	“I'm a manager focused on touring. But an artist as sophisticated as Sanz needs someone like Iñigo, who knows his origins and who's had a long artistic relationship,” Mizrahi says.


	That same mind frame — artistry leading the business — also informed Sanz's decision to sign with Sony Music a year later, in a license deal that lets him keep control of his masters.


	“I need a label I can talk music with, who will dream about repertoire with me,” Sanz says. “I have attorneys to talk numbers, and so do they.”


	Which is not to say Sanz is improvising. Beyond his touring, he has been active in ancillary, visible projects. He's in the midst of shooting a Netflix documentary that will premiere this fall, and production crews have followed him for the past year, including when he sat for a Q&A at Billboard Latin Music Week last year and received the Billboard Lifetime Achievement Award.

	











	His music is also being used for an upcoming stage musical, jukebox-style, that is not based on his life story, but features a character called Ale. And a deluxe version of ¿Y Ahora Qué? will be released later in 2025 with additional collaborations.


	Sanz spoke to Billboard about his creative process and where he is now.


So, now what?


	“Now what,” “¿Y ahora qué?,” is the first line of the album, in [the single] “Palmeras en el Jardín.” “Now what?” is a question almost everyone asks themselves at some point. Whenever you're about to start something new, whenever something happens, whenever you face a change, you ask yourself, “Now what?” Especially when it comes to emotional or sentimental changes that really shake you up. I find it very relatable, and I love taking common phrases or ideas that are already part of our collective imagination and giving them a poetic twist in my albums.


“Palmeras en el Jardín,” the song with that phrase and the first single, is about sadness and the loss of your previous relationship. But the album's mood shifts after that.


	I think emotions don't really distinguish between what's sad and what's happy; instead, they create a certain sense of satisfaction. You like sunny days, but sometimes you also enjoy rainy ones, don't you? “Palmeras en el Jardín” is the rainy day, and there are a few sunny ones throughout the album. It felt fitting for that to be the first thing said because it reflects the inner struggle I went through to start making this album and to feel inspired again to create new songs. I needed that question in my life: “Now what?” Because you have so many options — stay where you are, crumble, move forward, climb higher or jump out of a hot air balloon.

	











Do you have a process for starting to make music, or do you just wait for the perfect moment?


	No, no. Waiting for the perfect moment is just laziness and shows zero commitment. I think you have to actively go after the song, just like you chase luck or love.


Are you disciplined when it comes to songwriting?


	When I have to do it, I do it. When I first started making albums, I could write anywhere — in a bakery or on a plane. Now I go to the studio and work with the people I collaborate with — musicians, producers, composers — and approach it differently. Before, I used to lock myself in my room and spend 14 hours writing compulsively and, honestly, in a completely unhealthy way. But that's how I used to do it. Now I find shorter sessions much more productive, and I've changed the way I work.


I used to think those habits were set in stone…


	But they're not. You can change them. The same tools from before don't always work anymore. For example, when I used to write an album, I would always learn a new instrument or find inspiration within the music itself. Now I've discovered that working with other people really sparks something in me. It teaches me a lot, and I get to share what I know, too. That fascinates me because I'd never done it before.


Speaking of working with others, this album has a lot of collaborations. You've got three, including “Bésame” with Shakira. How did that one happen?


	We'd been talking for a while about working together again. I used to joke with her, saying, “When are we going to make another song? You only make songs with talented, handsome guys!” We hadn't found the right song that we both connected with. It's tough after making a song like “La Tortura” to find the right reason to team up again. You don't want to be too predictable or repeat the same thing, but you also want the new collaboration to be just as sweet.

	











You're both so busy. Did you work together in the studio?


	No, we didn't. But I think the process unfolded exactly how it needed to. We worked perfectly by sending ideas back and forth. We'd send each other voice notes and messages. We're both very hands-on artists, so our conversations were intense. She'd send me audiobooks, and I'd try to summarize them. It was beautiful because we managed to create what we always do when we sing together: Something magical happens. I think we accomplished that by combining our roots, a little imagination and, now, some added experience. There weren't any arguments because she loves the world of flamenco and we really admire each other's work. That mutual respect is so important when collaborating.


This album feels like a release for you — more so than others.


	Well, what is a release, really? At its core, why do we use music? To communicate. Over time, music has become more commercialized, but if you think about it, the original reason for making songs was to tell your stories and free yourself. People are always surprised when music is used to tell deeply personal stories, but that's how it's always been. The difference now is that, with social media, everyone knows exactly where the stories are coming from. I often debate whether to release something or not. But what's the alternative? Once everything is out in the open and the well is discovered, it's there for everyone. You can't clip the wings of creativity just because you feel a little embarrassed about one feather.


	When people ask me if this album has a common thread, I say that the connection is me — my voice, my way of interpreting music. I've always loved being eclectic and exploring different rhythms. That's the beauty of music — it reflects what's happening in your life.

	











“Hoy No Me Siento Bien” with Grupo Firme is a salsa song, despite its title, and it's upbeat. But “Como Sería” with Manuel Turizo and “Vino de Tu Boca” are about loss.


	“Hoy No Me Siento Bien” is about recognizing that it's OK to feel bad sometimes. It's about finding the light at the end of a dark tunnel. That's why the synergy between the lyrics, which talk about emotional struggles, and the upbeat music works — it's like saying, “I feel bad, but it's OK.”


You and Shakira are aligned, but it feels like you pushed Turizo and Grupo Frontera out of their comfort zones. Did Frontera ever say no to singing salsa?


	No, not at all. They were excited! I think they love experimenting with music, and you can tell. What musician doesn't enjoy playing around with music, trying new things and getting their hands dirty? That's the most wonderful part of doing this job.


Let's talk about “Como Sería,” your ballad with Turizo.


	It's a ballad, but not your typical ballad. It has layers and corners that feel familiar for a ballad, but it's less safe. You know, there are ways to write lyrics or melodies that keep you in your comfort zone, but this song steps out of it. I hadn't worked with Manuel before, but we met at a show in Spain, hit it off and decided to make a song together. His brother also co-wrote it, and honestly, the result is great. It's similar to the single with Shakira — there's a bit of his world, a bit of mine, and we meet in a place where you wouldn't expect to see either of us.


Did you write it together?


	They had an idea and sent it to me, and we went back and forth. Some might think that process sounds cold, but I love it. Sometimes when you're in the same room writing, there are distractions — other people watching who aren't contributing, for example. When you're in the studio, there's embarrassment or hesitation, and it doesn't flow the same way. But when someone sends you the song, you're at home, tweaking it, sending it back — you have the intimacy to work freely.

	











I love this album. It feels like it has all the right songs. What does this album mean to you?


	It came into my life at a very important moment. I was closing a chapter where, musically and emotionally, I was in a tough spot. I was caught up in conversations that had nothing to do with music — more about numbers and other things that didn't resonate with me. I got into music to free myself from math equations, to wake up late and to be my own boss — those are the three things I've always wanted to be. Somewhere along the way, I lost that excitement. Before, people would sell out musically, but they'd do it discreetly. Now it's out in the open: “Let's make this trash because we know it'll work.” And if you don't do that, you get stuck in this giant drawer of [old artists]. I was in that space, and this album brought light back into my life — into that empty space where my passion, drive and effort had disappeared.


With today's business models, I keep hearing that artists need to manage their businesses themselves.


	A lot of artists love to say they're entrepreneurs and that's fine, but I don't believe it. As an artist, you can try to make a living however you want based on supply and demand, but I don't think you can truly be an entrepreneur at the same time. There's a complete conflict of interest there.


Beyond the music, you've spoken openly about your experiences with depression and mental health in 2023. Why?


	Because it's important. If not us, then who? If we can't openly talk about these things, then what are we showing the people listening to this interview, for example? That they should be ashamed of it? No. But it's a very personal thing.

	











Did it take you a while to decide to say, “I'm feeling bad, but I'm going to talk about it”? I ask especially because you're so private.


	Yes, I'm very private about the things that aren't anyone else's business because, really, no one cares about what I do in my personal life. But this is something that affects everyone, and I think it's good to talk about it. When I was going through it, I struggled with social situations. Seeing too many people at once gave me anxiety. But the one place I felt comfortable was onstage.


You'd think it would be the opposite.


	Exactly. I did my first concert in Spain and thought, “If this goes well, I'll do the tour. If not, I won't.” And I felt amazing up there. As the tour went on, I made changes to prioritize myself. For example, I decided not to meet with anyone after the show. I'd finish the concert, go to my hotel or my house and not worry about meeting everyone's expectations. That's so important — to be polite, do your job well, be kind to your people and that's it. That's all you need to demand of yourself. The rest should be whatever makes you happy. If signing autographs for 20 hours makes you happy, do it. But if it doesn't, then don't.


Do you have mechanisms to manage your anxiety?


	It's less about mechanisms and more about habits. I've learned to say no. You always try to be the person you once were — to be nice to everyone. But I know how to set boundaries now, and I don't let things get out of hand.


What can we expect from this tour?


	I'm really excited to include new songs in the setlist. I want to invite friends to some of the shows, but mostly, I want to completely refresh the repertoire. I don't know if I'll perform the entire album, but almost all of it. There will also be changes within the band. We start rehearsals in July and will spend all of July and about 20 days in August rehearsing in Spain at my place in the country. I set up a tent there, and we rehearse surrounded by horses, sheep and chickens. I want to create something beautiful and put a lot of care into the stage design. There's always a special connection during the concerts. We always create something unique, and it's been a while since we've seen each other.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


BREAKING ….Caught in the blast radius of multiple multi-million dollar lawsuits between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over accusations of sexual harassment and an online smear campaign, Taylor Swift can now shake off that pesky subpoena.


	In an unexpected move, the It Ends With Us star and director has withdrawn the paperwork seeking information from Swift about what she knew about what went down between her pal Lively and Wayfarer Studios co-founder Baldoni on the domestic violence themed film. Part of the reason the summons was dropped was because details that the Bryan Freedman-represented Baldoni and crew sought were provided, I hear.

	











	Having said that, reps for Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, its execs and publicists did not respond Thursday to request for comment on the withdrawal of the high-profile subpoena against the “Fortnight” superstar and her lawyer J. Douglas Baldridge. Team Swift did respond, with a polite “no comment.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Swift is a longtime friend to Lively and even the godmother to one of her and Ryan Reynolds‘ children. Even before news of more backlash from a previously served Swift subpoena leaked out on May 14, the IEWU soundtrack contributor had already made several cameos in various lawsuits and countersuits ever since Lively on December 20 filed her sexual harassment and retaliation complaint with California's Civil Rights Department.


	With all that, Baldoni's team may be mum today and Swift's people circumspect, but Lively's side certainly had something to say.


	“We are pleased that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties have withdrawn their harassing subpoenas to Taylor Swift and her law firm,” a Lively spokesperson told Deadline this morning. “We supported the efforts of Taylor's team to quash these inappropriate subpoenas directed to her counsel and we will continue to stand up for any third party who is unjustly harassed or threatened in the process,” they also noted.


	And of course, this being the Lively vs Baldoni case, there was always more to say.


	“The Baldoni and Wayfarer team have tried to put Taylor Swift, a woman who has been an inspiration for tens of millions across the globe, at the center of this case since day one,” the Lively spokesperson said of their client's close close pal who has popped up in more than one filing or two since this all started with the Another Simple Favor actress' CRD complaint in late 2024. “Exploiting Taylor Swift's celebrity was the original plan in Melissa Nathan's scenario planning document, and it continues to this day,” the statement adds, with a swipe at Baldoni's crisis management PR chief. “Faced with having to justify themselves in federal court, they folded.”

	











	“At some point they will run out of distractions from the actual claims of sexual harassment and retaliation they are facing.”


	With no settlement on the horizon and a vast cast of co-defendants and countersuits, Lively and Baldoni are set to face off in federal court on March 9, 2026.


	Last week saw a flurry of attorney accusations of strong-arming of Swift by Lively's side along with  “witness tampering and evidence spoliation,” plus protests by the Gossip Girl‘s crew of moves “to launder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.” It was a lot of thunder and not much lightning as Judge Lewis J. Liman reacted to a Lively team request and yanked the damning correspondence from Freedman and other Baldoni lawyers out of the court docket.


	“The Letter is improper and must be stricken,” ordered Judge Liman in response to a motion by Lively's side filed mere hours after Freedman's letter. “It is irrelevant to any issue before this Court and does not request any action from this Court,” he added, noting that Swift's  Venables LLP counsel were fighting the subpoena in DC court.


	The reference by the Lively spokesperson Thursday to publicist Nathan, who along with ex-Jonesworks VP Jennifer Abel, directed Baldoni's public face, is noteworthy here, and clearly very personal.  Lively and Deadpool star Reynolds' team have claimed that Nathan and Abel were the paid brains behind astroturfing social media effort to preemptively taint Lively before the actress went public with tales of her IEWU co-star's alleged misconduct. Both Nathan and Abel have denied those allegations, essentially stating they didn't need to attack Lively, the internet hated her all by itself.


	However, a mention of Swift in a Nathan/Abel planning document now in the court docket, can't be denied. “As part of this, our team can also explore planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people in BL's circle like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully' into getting what they want,” Nathan wrote in August last year, around the time the Sony-distributed IEWU was released.


	With all the drama and stakes at play in what is a $400 million and growing legal action on many fronts, don't expect this withdrawal of a subpoena to be the last you hear of Ms. Swift in this matter. By a long shot.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: In a spirited bidding war, Netflix has landed an adaptation of The Secret of Secrets, from author Dan Brown and showrunner Carlton Cuse (Lost, Jack Ryan, Locke and Key), with a series order. The yet untitled drama is set in the world of Brown's anticipated mystery thriller novel The Secret of Secrets, the sixth book in his series about Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon.


	Brown and Cuse are co-creators, writers and executive producers, with Cuse serving as showrunner. Emma Forman of Cuse's Genre-Arts also executive produces. Staffing for the series is already underway.

The Secret of Secrets is set for September 9 release by Doubleday. In it, symbologist Robert Langdon races against ancient forces and time to rescue a missing scientist and her groundbreaking manuscript whose discoveries have the power to forever change humanity's understanding of the mind. The series adaptation will blend futuristic science with mystical lore, delivering on the heart-pounding suspense and international intrigue that has made the Langdon stories a global phenomenon.

	In announcing the publish date, Brown called The Secret of Secrets “by far the most intricately plotted and ambitious book that I have ever written, and I also happen to think that it's the most fun.”


	This may explain the eight-year gap between the newest installment and the most recent Robert Langdon novel, the longest in the series, which includes Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013), Origin (2017) and the upcoming The Secret of Secrets (2025). Fueled by the massive worldwide success of The Da Vinci Code, Brown's novels have sold over 250 million copies in 56 languages.


	Three of the novels have been adapted into features starring Tom Hanks as Langdon and directed by Ron Howard, The Da Vinci Code (2006), Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), which have grossed combined $2.24 billion worldwide (adjusted in 2025 dollars). A fourth, The Lost Symbol, was turned into a 2021 Peacock series with Ashley Zukerman as a younger version of Langdon. It ran for one season.


	Cuse successfully adapted for TV another bestselling series of thriller novels that had spawned a feature franchise, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. He co-created with Graham Roland, executive produced and served as showrunner for the first two seasons of Prime Video's hit Jack Ryan action drama starring John Krasinski.

	











	At Netflix, the former Lost co-showrunner previously developed and served as writer, director, and showrunner (with Meredith Averill) on Locke & Key, based on the graphic novels by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, and was executive producer/co-showrunner alongside creator Zoe Robyn on the medical drama Pulse. His credits also include co-developing/executive producing A&E's Bates Motel and Apple TV+'s Five Days at Memorial, both based on books.

	A new Michael Corinthos is about to show up in Port Charles: Deadline has confirmed that Rory Gibson (The Young and the Restless) will make his first appearance May 23 on General Hospital.


	“We are excited to welcome him to our show,” said a spokesperson.


	Gibson is replacing Chad Duell, who appeared on the sudser for 15 years. He was last seen in GH in January.


	Gibson played Noah, the son of Sharon and Nick Newman, from 2021-23. He told TV Insider that his audition process was “super top secret.”

	“It was super, super top secret,” he relays. “I came in and screen-tested for that with Kate Mansi [Kristina Corinthos] and Katey MacMullen [Willow Tait], and it went well. They were super warm and welcoming. A couple weeks went by, and they brought me in for another screen test with Steve Burton [Jason Morgan] and Laura Wright [Carly Spencer]. About a week after that, they locked me in, and it's been a nice little journey ever since.”

	Gibson's previous credits include Netflix's Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child Of Fire.


	Last December, Duell told The Daily Drama Podcast that things had become “stagnant” in his life, so that's why he stepped away from the GH role that earned him his first Daytime Emmy in 2015. 


	“It's a life adjustment,” he said. “A lot of stuff's been going on in my life. There's a few things behind it but one thing I did say is my dad passed away and I'm still coming to terms with that.”


	“I'm preparing myself for next chapters,” he saad. “Right now, I'm just trying to grow in ways that maybe I feel like I stifled myself in certain aspects, and sometimes you need to take drastic steps or make yourself feel uncomfortable to take a step.”

					By Antonia Blyth 

Executive Editor, Awardsline


	In Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut Eleanor the Great, scripted by Tory Kamen, June Squibb stars as a 94 year-old who suddenly funds herself living in New York and battling loneliness and grief after the death of her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar).


	The film's narrative includes remembrance of the Holocaust, with real Holocaust survivors in the cast. For Johansson, this story had a “sense of urgency” given the age of the survivors now. 


	“In not so many years, I think it would be less possible,” she said during an interview at Deadline's Cannes studio. “Even casting our Holocaust survivor support group and identifying who was not just willing to participate, but who could participate, really made that very clear.”

	











	Johansson set out to honor her Jewish identity, and that of her own grandmother, with whom she was very close. “The Jewish identity piece of this story is something that I felt I could confidently execute because it's in my DNA,” she said. “I grew up identifying as a Jewish kid growing up in New York, I had a grandmother who was not like Eleanor in some ways, but also kind of impossible and amazing — a very strong character; a very strong Jewish woman. And I think hopefully when you see the film, the authenticity of that comes through. If that piece didn't feel authentic to me, I probably wouldn't have touched this film.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	For Squibb, returning to the Cannes Croisette ten years after attending the festival with Nebraska, this time around has been less overwhelming, since she knows her way around the festival now. “I didn't know what I was doing [last time],” she said. “I was just sort of led around,” she smiled. 


	One way in which Squibb said she connected to the character of Eleanor was in her fearlessness. “We would all love to give people the finger all the time,” she said. “And she does it, you know. I mean, a lot of it is her humor, but a lot of it has a zinger to it, too. She's not afraid to say anything.”


	Erin Kellyman, who will next be seen in 20 Years Later, said she came to the set believing she was in over her head in comparison to Squibb and Johansson, who seemed to have it all figured out. But then, Squibb's openness really helped salve her concerns. “First of all, I think just watching June do her thing on set was a lesson in itself,” Kellyman said. Then addressing Squibb, she added, “But also, you were really open about your experience of still figuring it out. Obviously, I'm coming onto this set thinking, OK, Scarlett and June know exactly what they're doing, and I'm drowning. I'm drowning at this set. But you being open about that, I think made me relax a little bit more in feeling like, OK, so I think we're all maybe just trying to figure it out.”

	











	Johansson has recently revealed she has no plans to return to the role of Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (she also serves as executive producer), but when Deadline asked if she would consider directing a big action film, or a Marvel film specifically, she said: “I think the movies that I like that are big action movies also have the human connectivity piece. Even producing Black Widow and being a part of the production of that, and the development of the story, and the story between Natasha and Yelena… [there is] I think, a way of doing it, a way of maintaining the integrity of the idea of human connection, family, disappointment, all of the things that were themes in [Eleanor the Great], and doing it in a giant way in a giant universe — there's ways of doing that… So, yeah, definitely, it could be, it would be fun.”


Eleanor the Great is a Sony Pictures Classics and TriStar Pictures co-production, and producers are Johansson's These Pictures with Jonathan Lia and Keenan Flynn, Jessamine Burgum and Kara Durrett of Pinky Promise and Celine Rattray and Trudie Styler's Maven Screen Media.


The Deadline Studio at Cannes is sponsored by SCAD, Cast & Crew and Final Draft.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Neon has picked up North American rights to Jafar Panahi's well-received feature It Was Just an Accident, which had its world premiere in Competition at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this week.


It Was Just an Accident has a one-line synopsis that reads: “What begins as a minor accident sets in motion a series of escalating consequences.” The film, which has been one of the best-reviewed movies at the festival, deals in a fictional way with past wrongfully incarcerated working-class people seeking revenge against the guard who tortured and berated them. In his review, Deadline's Pete Hammond called the movie “a powerful statement for humanity” that “serves as a warning that you better watch your back.”

	The Wednesday afternoon screening was met with a 10-minute ovation — and was highly significant because Panahi himself was in attendance, marking the first time he has been able to appear at the festival in over 20 years.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Panahi, whose credits also include The White Balloon, The Circle and Taxi, has spent most of his filmmaking career in the crosshairs of Iran's authoritarian Islamic Republic government, including more than a decade facing multiple detentions, prison sentences, house arrests and filmmaking and travel bans.


	He was released from his latest jail stint in February 2023, and in the production notes for It Was Just an Accident, he says: “The sentence that banned me from making films, writing, giving interviews and traveling has been officially annulled. But in practice, I remain on the margins. … I have no choice but to keep working outside the system.”


	The filmmaker employed clandestine methods to shoot It Was Just an Accident and said that before wrapping, “plainclothes officers turned up and demanded all the footage. I refused. They continued to put pressure on us by threatening to arrest the crew and shut down production. In the end, they gave up. We paused the shoot for a while, then resumed. Nothing further happened.” 


	Neon has a typically stacked Cannes lineup now, with other Palme d'Or contenders including A Sentimental Value and The Secret Agent. 


	Panahi's first feature, The White Balloon (1995), was selected for Directors' Fortnight at Cannes, where it won the Caméra d'Or. He returned to th Croisette with 2003's Crimson Gold, which played in Un Certain Regard and won the Jury Prize. Initially selected to represent Iran at the Oscars, Crimson Gold ultimately was banned by the authorities, preventing it from being shown in Iranian cinemas. 

	











It Was Just An Accident was produced by Jafar Panahi and Philippe Martin and co-produced by Sandrine Dumas and Christel Henon, with David Thion and Lilina Eche serving as associate producers. The film is a Les Films Pelléas and Jafar Panahi Production from Iran/France and Luxembourg. MK2 Films is representing the international sales rights to the film. The deal was negotiated by Neon's Sarah Colvin and Jeff Deutchman with MK2 Films' Fionnuala Jamison on behalf of the filmmakers.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	At the heart of History of Sound is a wonderful gay romance between two men during the early 1900s.


	But don't make any comparisons to Brokeback Mountain, please, per the movie's star Paul Mescal and South African director Oliver Hermanus.


	Mescal plays Lionel, a talented singer from rural Kentucky raised on the songs his father sang. In 1917, he leaves his family farm to attend the Boston Music Conservatory and meets David (Josh O'Connor), a charming composing student, and they bond over their love of folk music. David is soon drafted into the end of WWI. In 1920, the two spend a winter walking through the forests and islands of Maine. Lionel drifts through Europe in his twenties and thirties, building a new life of profound success and happiness, and experiencing new loves. Yet he is constantly drawn back to memories of his brief time with David, trying to understand the impact of their relationship. Eventually, a reminder of their work together reveals why their connection rang loud.

	Said Mescal, “I personally don't see the parallel at all between Brokeback Mountain, despite the fact that we spent a little bit of time in a tent.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“When I look at Brokeback Mountain, it's dealing with repression, this film is pointed in the opposite direction,” he added, “To be honest, I find those comparisons lazy and frustrating.” 


	Added Hermanus, “That movie wasn't in our heads….it just shows there should be more forms about these nuances of queer relationships, beyond the context what most movies deal with. I felt that the idea of History of Sound, it wasn't about the complications of their sexuality that wasn't the problem between them, rather what was going to keep them apart is that they would have other loves in their life.”


	The pic repped Hermanus' first time here at the Grand Lumiere, but second time in Cannes after 2011's Beauty which played in Un Certain Regard. The History of Sound received a nine-minute standing ovation at its premiere Wednesday night. 


	We caught up with Mescal in the scrum after the press conference, asking him what his prep has been like to play Liverpool native Paul McCartney in Sam Mendes' quad Beatles epic. 


	Said the actor keeping it short: “I'm working on it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'American Idol' Finalist Cries in Car, Bravely Admitting She's 'Lost So Many People' Since Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/haven-madison-castle-song-instagram-post/","Thu, 22 May 2025 00:17:05 GMT","

Chasing dreams has come at a cost for “American Idol” season 21 top 8 finalist Haven Madison, who bravely admitted on May 21, 2025, that she'd experienced a major low and a huge high all in the same day.

Posting a video as she sat behind the wheel of her car, the 19-year-old pop singer was crying happy tears over achieving a major milestone with her newest single, “Castle,” mixed with tears of sadness over the friends she's lost since competing on the show and signing a record deal with 19 Recordings, a subsidiary of BMG, in late 2023.  

“I have been pursuing music my entire life,” Madison said, noting that she tried out for “American Idol” when she was 16. “I signed a record deal when I was 17, and I have been working so hard.” 

“I've lost so many people and so many friends along the way, and it has literally been anything but easy,” Madison said tearfully, but then she shared a document with her fans that showed “Castle” was the second most-added song on Top 40 radio stations, only behind Morgan Wallen's duet with Tate McRae, “What I Want.” 

A post shared by Haven Madison (@havenmadison)

“Let me show you what happened today,” Madison said before pulling up the document and pointing to “Castle” in second place on the list. She then admitted that hours before getting that news, she was in her therapist's office, thinking of giving up. 

“To put it in perspective, literally at therapy this morning, I was just like, so broken,” she said, getting choked up again as she said she had been feeling that her songs were not making any impact on the music industry and that “the world wouldn't be different if I wasn't here.”

“And I just think this moment is about so much more than me,” Madison continued, wiping away her tears. “I just want whoever's watching to know that you have such a divine purpose, and it might take a long time. It might be at the cost of losing some people you thought you wouldn't lose, but what's meant for you can't pass you by. You are so, so important.”

Madison concluded, “And to anybody who follows me or listens to my music, or has supported me in literally any way, thank you so much. Like, you don't even know how much it means. It's been really hard, it's been a long road, and it's only the beginning. But I'm just so grateful.” 

Madison received a flood of support in the comment section of her post, including from some of her fellow “American Idol” contestants. 

“Yes queen yes,” wrote fellow season 21 finalist Blake Proehl, with whom she's remained close friends. 

Another friend she made on the show, Jordan Anthony, wrote, “UR AMAZING SUGARRRR ❤️”

Lucy Love, a top 12 contestant on season 21, wrote, “Right on time 🙌❤️ Congratulations Hay 😘🙌🏾”

Kayko, a top 10 finalist from season 22, chimed in, “Hi my name is haven Madison AND IM A BADASS AND I WRITE FIRE MUSIC”

Melinda Doolittle, a beloved contestant from season 6, commented, “That milestone is amazing, and you have been amazing leading up to it, and you will continue to be amazing way past it”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lindsay Hubbard Puts Andy Cohen on the Spot About Her ‘Summer House' Season 10 Status","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/summer-house-cast-younger-lindsay-hubbard/","Thu, 22 May 2025 04:59:24 GMT","

Lindsay Hubbard questioned Andy Cohen about her status on ”Summer House.” On the May 21 episode of “Watch What Happens Live,” the Bravo TV veteran reacted to a question about her future on the show now that she is a mother.

During the segment, Hubbard's co-star Kyle Cooke noted that while she's had a major lifestyle change, it doesn't necessarily mean “sayonara” or the end of her time in the summer house.

Hubbard then looked at Cohen and asked him point blank, “So where do we go from here, Andy? What do we do?”

Cohen laughed uncomfortably before cutting the conversation off and telling Hubbard, “Alright, let's talk about it after the show.”

Fans reacted on social media, with one noting, “ANDY KNOWS SOMETHING.”

Others agreed that it's high time for a new show with the OGs. ”We need a ‘summer in the city' spin off! Seeing their business ventures, events, family life etc,” one fan wrote on Instagram.

A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)

Cooke's wife Amanda Batula also talked about the future of “the show.”Summer House.” The Bravo TV personality opened up in an interview with Teen Vogue to address the possibility of bringing in some younger cast members to the Bravo reality show now that the original stars are in their 30s and 40s. In season 9, Lexi Wood, and Bailee Henderson, both 27, were introduced to fans.

Batula, who will turn 34 this summer, admitted she “can't keep up” with the Gen Z crowd that sometimes shows up at the Hamptons party house. “I can't keep up with half the stuff they're saying,” she admitted in the May 2025 interview. “My husband [Kyle Cooke] definitely can't, but you know, it's fun having younger people in the house too. I feel like it keeps me young and in the know, but I think that there's a world where people need to, like, graduate out.”

“We need the freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, [class], and we need some more freshmen for sure,” she added.

In the interview, Batula noted that she has no say in “Summer House” casting decisions. “But if I were on the inside, I think the show could go one of two ways. It could either follow the current cast as we get older, or you know, we could sort of break off and it can go back to being young and partying and introducing more of those fun Gen Z kids,” she said.

Fellow “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo has been vocal about feeling she has started to “age out” of the original “Summer House” party premise. In an interview with Glamour, the “Giggly Squad” host admitted, “There's an end date for me at some point.”

“With the lifestyle of ‘Summer House' specifically, I'm probably not fitting into the original show idea anymore,” the 32-year-old admitted. “Whenever I see a comment that's like, ‘She's a little too old to be on this,' I'm like, ‘Yeah, I kind of am.”

Co-star Jesse Solomon has said he hopes to have one final “hurrah” with the veteran cast members, who include Batula, Cooke, Hubbard, and Carl Radke.

 Speaking with Us Weekly just before the Bravo reality show usually starts production, Solomon said, “There's gotta be a season 10 with the OG cast. One final hurrah.”

“Beyond that, I think people are interested enough in the OGs' lives to follow 'em to the city and, maybe, continue partying in the Hamptons with some of the other cast,” he added.

The cast for “Summer House” season 10 has not been confirmed by Bravo. Filming typically starts in early July each summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Chip Gaines Gets Real About Joanna Flying Solo in New Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/chip-gaines-joanna-solo-show/","Thu, 22 May 2025 02:45:13 GMT","

Chip and Joanna Gaines built their Magnolia empire side-by-side. So how does he feel that Joanna's latest show, “Mini Reni,” is a solo project?

In a new interview with Parade, Chip makes it clear that he not only does NOT feel left out, he's actually delighted for his wife of almost 22-years.

“As I think about Jo and this incredible opportunity that God has blessed us with, I mean — it's just like, I thought I was going to be a superstar. But it turned out the universe had a totally different idea in mind, and she has become just this incredible leader,” he says. “I'm so proud of her … We've definitely evolved in our older age in almost a sarcastic way. Like, I've become a little more bashful, I'm a tad insecure, dare I say. And Jo has become this force to be reckoned with.”

Chip goes on to say, “She's done a couple of cooking shows without me. She's done a show called ‘Mini Reni' without me. And it's just like I've launched this superstar into the universe and I could not be more proud.”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

In the Parade interview, Chip admits that the two have switched places over the years. “I was a very confident 20-something,” says Chip. “Thought the world was my oyster… I was one of these kids that, now that I'm 50, I kinda look back and I kinda peaked in high school, I'm not gonna lie. But high school and college, like, that was my era. I did all that you could possibly imagine and then some. And people would, like, vote me most likely to succeed. Why? I was terrible at school, not terribly smart, but I meet Jo, who was a little bit of a wallflower in her earlier, in high school and college. She probably would've been a little bit quieter, a little more bashful… and now she has become this incredible leader.”

Chip marvels at the impact his wife has had on both their business and their community. “We've got this beautiful company of which, two-thirds are female, we're here in Waco, Texas and the impact that we've had on this community, I mean, it's like I wish I could take credit for it because I feel like I should've been picked in this way, but instead it was Jo that was bound to be the superstar.”

A post shared by Chip Gaines (@chipgaines)

Viewers have rarely heard Chip call his wife by her given name Joanna. But they've heard him call her plenty of nicknames. Chip told Parade that he started out calling her “JoJo.” But he quickly shortened it to “Jo.” And then he switched to “Joey,” though he says he's not sure why. “I have no earthly idea where this came from,” he says.

But he reveals that there's one nickname he has for her that viewers have not heard. That's because he only uses it when he's irritated or frustrated with his wife. “When I'm mad at her, I don't know if this is relatable, but you know how when you like call somebody by their first, middle and last name and you're like ‘oh no, I'm in huge trouble?' I call her Joseph Daniel.. and she knows something is irritating me in that context.”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

Chip Gaines famously got his long hair chopped off as a birthday present for Jo, who turned 47 on April 19.

But he says he misses it. “I'm so convinced that I'm a better human with long hair. And not better like morality. I'm probably a bit rowdier with long hair, it's probably a good decision that I keep my hair short. But any time I cut it short I feel like ‘gosh, that's the boring decision that any old person might make.' And so I'm always, like, desperate to grow it long again. But I think it's pretty clear that I definitely do better with a short head of hair.”

Finale night is here for the 48th season of “Survivor.”

Although it wasn't as spicy as prior seasons, season 48 has seen its fair share of mild controversy. One contestant needed a lot of dental work performed after their time on the island. Another was found to have been a part of the reality show world already – even after having applied and participated as a “Survivor” reserve previously. Two contestants were very open in their post show interviews about how others weren't playing the game or how poorly they were treated while filming.

The finale of season 48 airs tonight and the remaining players are a grab bag of strength, strategic and coattail riders. While they have painted pictures as to what they need to tell the jury voters why they deserve to win, their actions have already been captured for viewers to see.

Below are summaries of what each player did to get to the final five. 

Easily the top contender to win from a fan perspective, Hunter has dominated the physical competitions. As of the finale airing, he's won 11 challenges – including seven immunity challenges. Hunter was one of the oldest players in the game this season but his occupation is fire captain so he was well prepared to take on every challenge.

He also struck a chord with viewers after partnering with fellow player Eva Erickson, who confided her autism diagnosis with him. Hunter would take her under his wing as the two would end up trading off wins throughout the season. During the episode “Icarus Time,” Hunter won the immunity challenge that ended with being able to read letters from home. He would then reveal in a more or less private moment on the beach that his departed sister, Joanna, was the reason he even applied to be on the show. Everything he did in the past 30 days has been for her.

Strengths: LoyaltyWeaknesses: ParanoidChances of Winning: 1 in 5

Erickson is one of the strongest women to compete on the show. This PhD candidate also grew up with brothers and plays hockey so she can give as much as she can take. She's won six immunity and reward challenges. Not only that, she's also been invited to three separate rewards that she lost. 

With most of her wins, Erickson has been the most fed contestant on the island this season by far. She also has a fellow contestant's immunity idol that she's been holding on to since week five. But she's also grown complacent in her status on the island, not making any moves whatsoever. While she may have outplayed many, Erickson definitely didn't outwit. That could mean no votes coming her way.

Strengths: PhysicalityWeaknesses: ArroganceChances of Winning: 1 in 5

Fraser is one of the more daring contestants this season due to his willingness to do something other than let the game play out on its own. The lying lawyer didn't reveal his profession — even to this number one, Kamila Karthigesu — until late in the season. He proved himself to be a slick talker, weaving between alliances without being caught. He's won five challenges not including a sixth where he won a team reward but lost immunity. Not to mention Fraser is also willing to be vulnerable when the  situation calls for it.

One of the better aspects of the season was his partnership with Karthigesu. Both promised each other to make it to the final three. Not a single soul on the island knows about the alliance – which has made for some of the only tension during season 48 as both Karthigesu and Fraser delegated manipulating votes behind the backs of others. Fraser's real prowess for devising came into light during the late season episode “Icarus Time” when he exacted a plan to send home Shauhin Davari.

Strengths: CharmingWeaknesses: Too many irons in the fireChances of Winning: 1 in 5

Even though she's only won four challenges and rewards, Karthigesu is one of the more likeable players in the final episodes of the season. As with every contestant, there's obviously a want to be the big winner at the end but her constant reiterating of “final three” to alliance member Fraser paints Karthigesu to be more loyal than most.

Karthigesu's gameplay has been less physical and more strategic (although, prior to the show, her husband did make her workout in order to prepare). In true “Survivor” fashion, Karthigesu's ability to thrust herself in and out of the narrative has shown that some of the best contestants don't only need to outplay but also outwit and outlast.

Strengths: Very undercoverWeaknesses: Too undercoverChances of Winning: 1 in 5

Speaking of the show's motto, Guerra is supremely in the “outlast” camp thanks to his ability to go on few rewards (two to be exact) while not making any noteworthy moves. He is, however, a much more strategic player than even some of the more physical ones. He managed to block Sai Hughley's vote. But that's about it. 

Strengths: Easy to get along withWeaknesses: Can't make a moveChances of Winning: 1 in 5

Former HGTV couple Christina Haack and Tarek El Moussa, who were married from 2009 to 2018 and hosted the hit show “Flip or Flop,” rarely open about their religious beliefs with fans. 

But on May 18, 2025, as their nine-year-old son Brayden was baptized, they couldn't help but share their excitement over the spiritual milestone, both giving fans glimpses of the ceremony and their post-service celebration with their blended family. 

A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa)

Haack and El Moussa, who share custody of Brayden and their 14-year-old daughter Taylor, both shared multiple videos in their Instagram Stories from Brayden's baptism on May 20, including footage of a pastor dunking their son in a baptismal pool inside a church. Brayden wore a t-shirt for the occasion that said “Meet the new me.” 

Haack wrote over a video of the moment, “Special day for our boy. So proud of you Brayden. We all love you so much.” 

El Moussa shared a photo of he and Haack with Brayden, which she re-shared, and wrote, “Big day for Bray Bray!! Getting baptized today, proud dad moment 🙌”

In a video taken behind-the-scenes at the church before Brayden's baptism, El Moussa asked his smiling son, “Where are going, Bray? Your baptism! You excited, bro? Let me see that face.”

“Come on, Bray, here we go,” he said as they climbed the stairs to the sanctuary. “It's your big day, buddy!” 

El Moussa wrote over the video, “No nerves, just excitement. The whole family is here to support Bray Bray on his special day.” 

After Brayden's baptism, El Moussa shared video from an outdoor family luncheon that included his second wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, and their two-year-old son Tristan, as well as Haack's five-year-old son Tristan, from her previous marriage to TV personality Ant Anstead. Grandparents and cousins were seated around the table, and Brayden's big sister Taylor was present, too. 

Haack and El Moussa rarely open up about their religious backgrounds and beliefs, but their son attends a private, Christian school in southern California that's connected with the Baptist church where he got baptized. 

In 2017, El Moussa told Country Living, “I'm half Middle-Eastern, so (my name) comes from Middle-Eastern descent. My dad was raised Catholic in the Middle East in Lebanon and then Egypt. My mom's from Belgium and my dad moved to Europe when he was in his late teens.”

That same year, both El Moussa and Haack shared that they were inspired by Tim Storey, a life coach who has an honorary degree from Bethany Theological Seminary, per his website, and founded the Congregation Family Church in 2015. 

In May 2017, as he and Haack were in the midst of their divorce, El Moussa shared a Facebook photo from attending church with Storey and wrote, “Sundays are the best days 💙 Love quality time with the kids and of course church with Pastor @TimStoreyOfficial.” 

“He's changed my life,” El Moussa continued, “and so many others, for the better and can do the same for you!”

That December, Haack told Country Living Magazine that as part of her holiday plans, she was “volunteering with Pastor Tim Storey, serving meals at the Los Angeles Mission on Dec. 22. Giving all year round is really important to me, and especially during the holidays. I am so grateful that I am able to give back because there have been times in my life when I didn't have anything extra to give, when I struggled just to make rent. Sharing the wealth is what the holidays are all about.”

Last year at this time, “Anora” played like gangbusters at the Palais (audience applause is a Cannes ritual that is part performance and part real, but difficult to quantify), earned raves from the Screen International jury grid, and inevitably, won the Palme d'Or. That gave Neon confidence to play its long Oscar hand, successfully, gaining five Oscar wins including Best Picture, Director, Editing, Actress, and Screenplay.

This year the late-festival movie that performed as well is Joachim Trier's likely Norwegian Oscar entry “Sentimental Value,” an intense family drama about an established actress (Renate Reinsve) with anxiety issues whose estranged father (Sweden's Stellan Skarsgård) seeks to regain his foothold in the film industry with a new movie starring his daughter. When she's not interested, he casts an American actress (Elle Fanning) instead. Both Reinsve and Skarsgård give towering performances that will not be denied at Oscar time, given that Neon, which bought the film a year ago at Cannes before production, is adept at playing the awards game and recently added the Oscar whisperer Ryan Werner (Cinetic Media) to their in-house team as distribution chief. This could be their sixth Palme d'Or win.

Besides, two set pieces, including Reinsve's panic attack before going on stage opening night, and a heartfelt moment with her sister (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), are scene-stoppers. Movies that draw on the emotions are often winners, especially with actors. Four serve on this year's jury, including the president Juliette Binoche, plus Halle Berry, Alba Rohrwacher, and Jeremy Strong.

Giving this film a huge leg up is that Trier is already established with Oscar voters; he played the awards game with Neon's “The Worst Person in the World” (2021), which earned two Oscar nominations including Original Screenplay for Trier and Eskil Vogt, who reteam on “Sentimental Value,” and Best International Feature. They are members of the club. And “Sentimental Value” is a brilliant film, not only about family but about art, legacy, and reconciliation, as both the actress and her aging director father struggle to pursue their art.

Reinsve won Best Actress at Cannes in 2021 for Joachim Trier's “The Worst Person in the World” and has since added a number of English-language projects to her slate, from Apple TV+'s “Presumed Innocent” to Aaron Schimberg's “A Different Man.” Her star is rising and she's primed for major stateside awards play.

 










Just as last year Neon scooped up “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” at the last minute before awards night, just in case “Anora” didn't bring home the prize, this year they've added to their war chest Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” which also played well this week and could win a prize. The Iranian auteur returned to Cannes for the first time since 2003; he conjured up the story in an Iranian prison. Neon also partnered with Panahi in 2021, releasing Cannes special screening “The Year of the Everlasting Storm.”

And not taking any chances, Neon just acquired North American rights to Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho's 70s caper “The Secret Agent.” Star Wagner Moura has nabbed some Best Actor heat at Cannes as a technology expert on the run hoping to reunite with his son. The film earned strong reviews for the Brazilian auteur behind “Bacarau.”

Most of us don't appreciate where our problems sit on a scale from ordinary to tragic. One day your frustrations relate to impressing the family of your intended husband, or to the local school's struggles to contain your tearaway son. The next day, there are no footholds for this conventional social anxiety because the bottom has fallen out of your world. 

Selling a descent from stress into a state of devastation that can never be shed (only briefly reprised) is the formidable actress Parinaz Izadyar. Remarkably, considering how often she is tasked to cry or yell, there is nothing repetitive to her performance. She keeps reacting to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune with fresh volatility, not letting her character, Mahnaz, become passive or automated.

Returning to the Cannes competition lineup after 2022's “Leila's Brothers” Iranian melodramatist, Saeed Roustayi, proves that he has an Almodovarian flair for painting in the colors of female pain under patriarchy. While his production design is more naturalistic than the Spaniard's, the voluptuous emotional expression is comparable and Roustayi knows just when to rein it in for a moment of beautifully composed quiet.

Quiet can never be achieved when pre-adolescent nightmare Aliyar is around. Mahnaz's son is a Tasmanian devil spinning his ticking time bomb energy into entrepreneurial pursuits (running a gambling ring at school), bullying classmates and yelling at any adult that interferes with his forcefield. When Aliyar breaks a match inside a lock and traps 700 kids in the school playground, he is suspended for a week from school. (This does, in fact, feel fair.)

It does, however, create an extra problem for Mahnaz — a hospital nurse — raising two kids (the second child is a meek girl) in her mother's house after the death of her first husband. A romantic rapport with paramedic Hamid (Payman Maadi) has reached the point where he wants to propose, necessitating the blessing of his family from out of town. In order for this to happen, evidence of her two children must be scrubbed from the premises. The news of their existence will be broken at a less pivotal moment.  

The first act unrolls the settings and characters that dominate Mahnaz's life and work. Roustayi makes it clear that we're embedding in a flawed microcosm where no one is on their best behavior. Hamid is always hustling the infirm to supplement his earnings. Mahnaz is an apologist for Aliyar's antisocial behaviors, dismissing a colleague's valid objections that the kid makes her uncomfortable. As Aliyar demands an explanation for this 30-year-old woman's lack of response to his Instagram messages, she can laugh at his childlike precocity while fearing the not too distant day when these overtures will feel more menacing. He is at an age where the shadow of the man he will become looms large.

 










With the exception of Mahnaz's straight-shooting mother, the women in her life fade into the background within this early hustle. Younger sister Mehri (Soha Niasti) and daughter Neda are barely registered as our leading lady focuses on wrangling men to transform her modern family situation and set down new socially acceptable roots.

Then comes a double whammy of tragedy and betrayal that makes Mahnaz's efforts to fit into normal Iranian society a wild dream of yesteryear. Roustayi excels at threading transformative moments through scenes mounted upon other business. In the corner of a busy room someone is looking someone else in the eye and now nothing will be the same again. The biggest moments happen off screen. We are shown the build-up and the aftermath as Mahnaz rushes to catch up with what her life has become and to count who is still there.

Inasmuch as emotional arcs are pitched toward the extreme, domestic and work settings are sketched with a keen anecdotal eye and enlivened with compelling details. Pity the poor female patient trying to find the voice to object as Mahnaz conducts a passionate phone call at the same time as she injects the patient's hand with a needle. On the home front, Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee almost walks away with the whole film in the course of another phone call. Her social politesse transforms into a maternal fury and the air turns blue with inventive insults.

 










A few structural issues threaten to tip the balance from cinematic melodrama into TV soap as the bad news keeps on coming, but Izadyar's sustained emotional conviction carries the vision onwards. Working with cinematographer Adib Sobhani, Roustayi finds moments at home and at work to let the visual elements take over from the fizzing human drama. Two hospital scenes featuring a ventilator bookend key events, serving as boundaries between the person Mahnaz used to be and how far she is willing to go now.

Home – not the one she thought she was building, but still nonetheless a home, emerges as the focus of the second half of the film. Three women therein alternately tolerate and turn on each other. Their unspoken bond is the knowledge that they are beholden to different rules than the men in their lives. The patriarchy expresses itself in standards of behavior the men around them feel they can get away with. ‘Woman and Child' is scarcely a film about personal triumph, but as the chance of conventional assimilation into Iranian society is wrenched from Mahnaz, who then takes it upon herself to blast it further out of reach, Roustayi's intelligent film poses the question over whether the raw remains have their own value.

“Woman and Child” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

 Throughout the first season of the Apple TV+ series “The Studio,” directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Goldberg have risen to a number of elaborate challenges, from shooting every scene as one unbroken take (and, in the case of Episode 2, shooting an entire episode to give the appearance that it's one unbroken take) and restaging The Golden Globes to using the production design as a sort of ongoing Hollywood history lesson. 

On the season finale, they faced one of their trickiest filmmaking problems yet: filming Bryan Cranston as a studio executive high on mushrooms as he ran wild through a working casino.

 










“It was insane,” Goldberg told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast of the effort to shoot Cranston and celebrity co-stars including Rogen, Catherine O'Hara, and Dave Franco (playing himself) while just five feet off camera, patrons of the Venetian casino were watching the filming in between spins at the slot machines. “Usually there were three to four famous people per shot. So the odds of someone bothering us were pretty high the whole time. And every single spot that we shot had a restriction timing-wise.”

To make matters worse, those restrictions would change arbitrarily from day to day. “They'd change it all the time,” Rogen said of the casino. “We'd get there thinking we had two hours and they'd be like, ‘You've got to be gone in 45 minutes.'” The pressure would have been stressful for any production, but the long take strategy that Goldberg and Rogen had established made shooting in the casino especially nerve-wracking. “For a shooting style that requires an incredible amount of control over the timing and the environment, we had very little control over the timing and environment in Vegas.”

Just getting the Venetian, which Goldberg and Rogen wanted because its gondolas, statues, and other features would provide ample comic opportunities for Cranston's rampage, was no easy task. “Historically the Venetian has been the hardest casino to get,” location manager Stacey B. Brashear told IndieWire, adding that the script was risky — not only because it depicted Cranston's character running wild through the casino on mushrooms, but because it involved him climbing statues, jumping into fountains, and committing various offensive acts that the casino would not want viewers to emulate.

 










“We got them the script pages and it took months,” Brashear said of the approval process. “We had already started to buy airline tickets for the crew, and we had set up rooms. In addition, Hewlett Packard had one of their largest conventions there, so they ate up a lot of space. So it was not just a matter of script approval, but also of getting approval to coexist with them when they had a majority of the hotel booked.” The production also had to coordinate with a last-minute party being thrown by Britney Spears, but at the last minute everything came together.

“I screamed so loud and unprofessionally in the production office,” Brashear said. “But everybody was happy because they knew what it meant.” Once the location was locked, Brashear and the filmmakers had to deal with the numerous restrictions placed upon them, like keeping their equipment as out of sight as possible. While they could shoot scenes set in individual rooms during normal working hours, the shots in the casino itself had to be done in the middle of the night to avoid disrupting normal casino business. 

Luckily, the hotel was more than willing to accommodate the production when it came to shooting in multiple areas, because they wanted the location to be prominently featured on screen. “It was part of the contract, we had to promote them,” Brashear said, noting that the hotel didn't charge the production location fees in exchange for the free publicity being on the series would provide. That said, one moment in the final episode did make Brashear nervous.

 










“I was concerned that they would think of it as a liability issue,” Brashear said of a scene where Cranston jumps into a fountain. “And I was hoping they weren't going to come back to me and be like, ‘Well, we don't want fans of the show to think they can hop in that fountain' — that their legal team wouldn't be like, ‘We don't want people to get the idea to come take a selfie imitating Bryan Cranston in the fountain.' But they were willing to take that risk.”

Goldberg and Rogen were glad that shooting scenes like the one with Cranston in the fountain came late in the show's production schedule. “We were pretty dialed into the process,” Rogen said. “It was logistically insane and we couldn't plan it all — we had no access to any part of it before we got there.” Once the cast and crew did arrive at the Venetian, however, they were immersed in it — they stayed in the rooms at the hotel, so everyone would typically roll out of bed and be on set after just a quick walk to the elevator.

“It turned into a ‘Twilight Zone' episode,” Goldberg said. “We never left except for one shot in 120-degree weather with Seth in a car.” “I ate nothing but Grand Lux Cafe for two weeks straight, which isn't healthy,” Rogen added, but in the end he feels that the surreal experience of living at the hotel while shooting there seeped into the final product. “You really had to hand yourself over to the insanity of it…which was good for the [last two] episodes.”

“Sirens” begins at what looks like rock bottom. Devon (Meghann Fahy) sits on the steps of a police station, having just been released from an overnight hold, and texts her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) a single word: sirens. Given how often she's sent the word and how furiously she's typing it now, there's no secret as to what it could mean. “Sirens” is their code word for emergency, and Devon has been sounding the alarm for the last 24 hours. Simone just isn't answering.

Call and response. The associated expectations have changed since cell phones and the internet made everyone ping-able around the clock. Younger generations won't answer the phone unless they recognize the number (and sometimes not even then). Older generations are slow to adopt texting, or simply can't keep up with its evolving language. But some things never change: When your family informs you of an emergency, you respond… right?

With that instinctual query, the mystery is afoot. “Sirens” hooks you with a clear, enticing premise. Devon drops everything — well, everything except for Simone's shallow response to Devon's cry for help: an exorbitant Edible Arrangement, which she lugs on a 17-hour bus trip from Buffalo to the beach, where she tries to extract Simone from the clutches of her kookie boss (and billionaire's wife), Michaela (Julianne Moore).

Is Simone's new job a real job, or is she unwittingly serving a cult leader? Is Devon addicted to drama? Is Simone in danger? Who is this rich, bird-obsessed weirdo she's working for, and why is there a nagging fear that she'll never leave her nest? 

Then, over five taut hourlong episodes, “Sirens” scrupulously resolves these riddles while introducing even dicier dilemmas and upending audience expectations. The initial song that draws you in is honest — Netflix‘s limited series is crackling entertainment, alive with secrets, twists, and humor. But as Devon discovers more than she bargained for on her weekend trip to Simone's luxurious coastal enclave, there's a deeper resonance to chords that may sound familiar at first. 

This isn't “The White Lotus” (besides Fahy's presence) or “The Perfect Couple” (besides the palatial beach house and Fahy's presence) or “Nine Perfect Strangers” (thank God); “Sirens” is a giddy riff on class dramas and wellness satires, but Molly Smith Metzler‘s five-episode anthem still offers its own distinct melody, and it's one you'll want to play again the second it ends.

 










Like “Maid” before it (Metzler's Emmy-nominated 2021 breakout), “Sirens” centers how wealth inequality can affect families and marriages, parents and children, safety and security. Devon and Simone don't come from money. Their mother died when her daughters were young, and their father never recovered. Now, after years of hard work and harder drinking, Bruce (an extraordinary Bill Camp) has early onset dementia. He's fighting every day to remember where he's living, what happened to his family, and who this blonde woman is taking care of him. (It's Devon.)

Even before any additional trauma gets unpacked, who could blame Simone for running off and joining a cult — especially one as fancy as Michaela's? Officially, Simone is Michaela's assistant. She helps manage her bird sanctuary, which seems to require more fundraising than flight-tracking, though “Kiki” (as those closest to Michaela can call her) does both. She rehabilitates falcons in her backyard facilities and tracks their progress around the world after they've recovered. She also hosts galas, dinners, and photo shoots. She opens each get-together by reciting the same poem (by Rachel Carson) and closes them with her own signature catch-phrase: “hey-hey.”

Of course, all this isn't just funded by affluent birders. Michaela is married to Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), a billionaire hedge-fund manager whose immense fortune makes his wife's philanthropic endeavors possible. Attentive and relaxed, handsome and patient, Peter cuts the figure of an ideal husband. Most of the time, he's either out of the house for work or hiding in his gentleman's tower — an inverted man cave where he smokes pot, drinks whiskey, and gazes thoughtfully over the open ocean. (Liev Schreiber's ground floor hideout in “The Perfect Couple” is eerily similar — is this what real billionaires do in their downtime?) But Peter brings sweet, nostalgic gifts back from his business trips and still shows up for Michaela's priority parties on time. That he looks good in a suit certainly doesn't hurt, either.

 










Michaela was never able to have kids of her own — a sore subject for Peter, who desperately misses his children from his first marriage — which may be why she latches on so tightly to Simone. It's not uncommon for them to wear the same clothes, sleep in the same bed, and share the same piece of gum. The staff, often exasperated by Michaela's uncaring orders (and their inevitable reversal), even calls Simone “mini Michaela.”

For a 25-year-old woman forever scarred by an unstable, unsafe household, being taken under Kiki's wing is everything Simone could've hoped for. She has her own room, her own staff (or, at least, she treats them as such), and her own replacement mommy and daddy… but when the sister she never told anyone about suddenly shows up in the driveway — still dripping from the sprinkler shower she took on the lawn next door and cursing at such a pace she claims to have “rich people Tourette's” — Simone's sanctuary starts to fall apart.

From there, “Sirens” deftly weaves in and out of familiar patterns. Yes, Devon is forcibly adopted into her sister's upper-class lifestyle, but her steadfast disdain for moneyed pomposity (and dismissal of so-called wellness practices) feels like a breath of fresh air next to shows that eagerly revel in the extravagant customs of the 1 percent. Yes, mysteries build around Michaela — does she have something to do with the former Mrs. Kell's mysterious disappearance? is she plotting to lock Simone away in an ivory tower? — but rather than strive for gasp-inducing twists, the answers drive the story down thorny, curious paths. Yes, there are dramatic showdowns between sisters, couples, and other warring parties, but the resulting casualties are never quite who or what you'd expect.

 










Along the way, there's so much to savor. Metzler's dialogue is sharp, consistently surfacing memorable lines without drawing enough attention that you're pulled out of the story. The top trio of stars all turn in fine performances, led by Moore finding just the right pitch for Michaela — believable and mystical, easy to stereotype yet hard to pin down — while Glenn Howerton (as the Kells' not-quite-as-rich neighbor and Simone's semi-serious boyfriend), Josh Segarra (as Devon's doofy boss and unserious fuckboy), and Bill Camp (as the aforementioned Bruce, whose scenes in the last two episodes demand Emmy voters' full attention) steal so many moments across the breadth of the series, they very nearly usurp the leads they're meant to support. Luckily, a trio of discerning directors (led by “Watchmen” DGA-winner Nicole Kassell) fill their frames with such vibrant colors, meticulous details, and vivid lighting (the lighting, my god!), the whole series seems like it's bursting at the seams, rather than just its formidable ensemble.

Despite being defined as an S.O.S. call from the start, “Sirens” isn't just about getting a response — it's about who's calling and why; it's about the siren song of money, family, and even safety; it's about mistaking prosperity for credibility, fealty for love, escape for evasion; it's about the chosen realities we build our lives around, and the truths we can't hide from in the end; it's about the people who fall short, and the people who have no choice but to pick up the pieces.

 










What looks like rock bottom from high on top of a cliff may end up being exactly where you need to be.

“Sirens” premieres Thursday, May 22 on Netflix. All five episodes will be released at once.

It's almost impossible to have a thorough discussion about the myth of the American West and the way it permeated pop culture without turning one's attention to Italy. Italian filmmakers like Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci had a field day with cowboy iconography in the 1960s, churning out a series of violent Westerns that many enthusiasts would say rival or surpass the American Westerns made by the likes of John Ford and Howard Hawks. From their largely European casts and overtly Catholic imagery to their hot-blooded stories of violent revenge, the so-called Spaghetti Westerns were distinctly Italian products. But their existence was only possible due to the endless fascination that Italians had with America and the myths that Hollywood loved to perpetuate.

Italy's love of American cowboys provides the backdrop for “Heads or Tails,” the new film from “The Tale of King Crab” directors Alessio Rigo de Righi and Matteo Zoppis that once again feels like it was ripped from the yellowing pages of a beautiful old storybook. It's the turn of the 20th century and legendary entertainer Buffalo Bill Cody (John C. Reilly) has brought his blockbuster Wild West show across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. His traveling circus of lassoing, sharpshooting, and cowboy crooning has turned into a hot ticket among Italy's elite, with his carefully curated stage presence giving these aristocrats the sense that they're interacting with a real live cowboy. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






A hustler to his bones, Cody sometimes struggles to reconcile his stage persona as a Wild West adventurer with the fact that he's the kind of man who sails to Europe to entertain wealthy Italians. During a conversation with a rich local farmer who boasts about the roping skills of his own cowboys, Cody agrees to stage a rodeo contest between the Italian ranchers and his team of trained professionals. The farmer agrees to his terms, though he asks his star ranch-hand Santino (Allesandro Borghi) to take a dive as part of a gambling scheme. Santino, who is as proud as he is devilishly handsome, reluctantly agrees but is unable to go through with his promise. He wins the contest, humiliating the Americans while alienating his boss. With nothing left for him at home, he decides to flee the scene with Rosa (Nadia Tereszkiewicz), his true love who just happens to be the boss' wife. For good measure, she shoots her husband in the head on her way out the door.

 










With his reputation on the line, Buffalo Bill decides to go after the runaway lovers. The showman is not particularly skilled as a bounty hunter, but he once again struggles to separate his persona from reality. Reilly gives a predictably excellent performance as the legendary entertainer, nailing both his on-stage bravado and the private moments of insecurity where he hesitates to drop the act because he's not clear what mask he'd don in its place. With no easy way to turn down his employer's father's request to catch his son's murderer, he sets out on his own journey through the Italian countryside. 

Cody is reduced to a supporting character in the rest of the film — a pity, given how entertaining Reilly's performance is, but it makes narrative sense. The focus shifts to Santino and Rosa, who quickly find that the initial euphoria of escaping routines doesn't protect against relationship struggles. The outside world mistakenly believes that Santino killed Rosa's father because of the bounty placed on his head, and he soon becomes a folk hero among revolutionaries who want to seize the means of production. Rather than correct his admirers and explain that Rosa is the killer, he embraces the newfound fame and finds his public mask fusing to his face in a manner that's not unlike what happened to Buffalo Bill. As the story takes a brilliantly surreal turn that will remain unspoiled, Rosa is forced to reckon with the bleak fact that the stories we tell ourselves, whether they're pulpy Western novels or sweeping romances within our own lives, are often written by the victors and clouded by their own delusions and desires.

 










“Heads or Tails” is visually stunning, with Italy's forests and mountains captured in a rich celluloid color palette that will look as marvelous in 100 years as it would have a century ago. The storybook shot composition benefits from the fact that very few Westerns were ever actually filmed in Italy, as Sergio Leone and his colleagues primarily shot their outdoor sequences in the deserts of Spain. The film gives one of the world's greatest Western-producing nations its own moment in the spotlight, and the country's landscapes more than rise to the occasion. 

“Heads or Tails” builds on the playbook that Rigo de Righi and Zoppis established with their first film, exploring the ways that time erodes our shared stories despite presenting itself in a package that's utterly timeless. Sentimental when it needs to be and subversive whenever boredom lurks around the corner, “Heads or Tails” is a fitting second entry in what could soon become one of the most stylistically distinct bodies of work among today's active filmmakers. 

“Heads or Tails” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor build a budding wartime romance in the 2025 Cannes Film Festival premiere “The History of Sound.” What you won't see onscreen are either a tale directly about queer repression circa World War I or any explicit sex scenes, as much as the internet might be hurting for them. Mescal and O'Connor play music students in love and on the road, recording songs from everyday American people, with circumstances and years that force them apart and together yet again.

South African director Hermanus (“Moffie,” “Living”) brings a film to the Cannes Competition for the first time, as does Mescal, the Oscar-nominated actor whose iconic “Aftersun” broke out of the Critics' Week section in 2022. The filmmaker, adapting a short story from Ben Shattuck who also writes the script, doesn't make a big gay fuss about the love forming between Lionel (Mescal) and David (O'Connor), demuring in moments that could've gone more explicit, instead downplayed here in favor of an understated story that's also a tribute to folk music.

“I've been very lucky with the actors I've worked with across my career, with Josh [O'Connor], Andrew [Scott], Jessie [Buckley], Saoirse [Ronan], Daisy [Edgar-Jones], where nothing was ever intentional in terms of how you build a relationship [onscreen],” Mescal told IndieWire over an interview at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Cannes the day before “The History of Sound” premiered at the Palais. O'Connor was not at the day's press junket, though he'll be at Cannes at the end of the week for Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind”; he's currently in his last days of filming Steven Spielberg's upcoming sci-fi movie in the U.S.

 “It either stands on its own two legs, or it doesn't happen. With Josh, it very much felt comfortable. We knew each other, and we'd been talking about the film since 2020, so that's when we first initially connected. He's such a good soul. We're quite similar in terms of the work that we like and are relatively similar as people. It just grew from there.” 

“The History of Sound” grew out of the COVID years as a film project before eventually shooting in New Jersey and also Tarquinia, Italy, in 2024. That the short story wasn't focused on gay self-loathing or repression appealed to director Hermanus, as well as how the film treats the relationship between Lionel and David with a casualness that belies its potentially upsetting subject matter. It's World War I times, after all, and both men are scarred by brushes with the draft as they head into the backwoods of Maine together to record sounds.

 










“When I read the short story, there was this disinterest in the context of their sexuality,” Hermanus said. “Two people meet in a bar, they connect over so many different things, and they have chemistry and desire for each other. They spend the night together, and the nature of that night is also kind of free… In the bigger picture of queer cinema or queer discourse, it isn't about repression. It isn't about the struggle of two people having to take a step that we all know. Any queer person knows that first step that you have to take as a young person, that first step of expressing your desire for somebody of the same sex, not knowing if you're going to be reciprocated or shamed or harmed, and I've made movies about that in the past as well.”

The most physically intimate moment we see onscreen of Lionel and David is a farewell embrace in a train station, the film eschewing sex scenes for a dynamic that's more furtive, more tacit (though Lionel and David certainly are sleeping with each other, as understood in a couple of moments).

“Maybe it's a personal taste thing. Even in my previous work, I've been very specific about what intimacy is, and what are intimate moments. There is an idea we had in writing this film, which was, I asked Ben, how do we have something that each of them does, which wasn't in the short, that would demonstrate their love for the other that might be unknown to the other?” Hermanus said. “For Josh, with David, it was this collecting of the pillow feathers, and with Paul, it was the feather he was keeping for the rest of his life. That's what I feel were intimate ideas rather than a 55-minute sex scene.”

 










“Thank God,” Mescal, who has put in his time on sex scenes in TV's “Normal People,” the show that introduced him to the world, added. “I've done my fair share of sex scenes, I'm like, ‘been there, done that.' What feels slightly different about this from [other] romantic relationships onscreen, I would say in the hierarchy of their relationship, physical touch isn't the priority. It's intellectual stimulation, it's friendship. Not that they're not physically attracted to each other; they very much are, but their chemistry is born from this shared love of these folk songs, and it extends from there.”

Lionel and David at one point, on their voyage, exchange a look that makes for a wounding cinematic moment. “Looking at each other in the tent at the very end,” Mescal said, “that last look in the tent was something that we grabbed in the last 10 minutes of the shooting, because we felt we might need something. I remember calling Oliver and saying, I don't think I've ever looked at somebody with that much love. It was done so quickly. You're not thinking, it's not scripted. At that point, it was Josh's last day, or second-to-last day on set… When you get to that place with actors, I suppose even what's inside of the story, you can just kind of start to create environments or situations when the actors can play in those contexts.”

 










Mescal, who is Irish, also had to adopt a Kentucky accent to play Lionel for the film, a first for the “Gladiator II” star. “It's about finding a reference, somebody you can hook on, and say, ‘That's what Lionel sounds like, when he's 60 or 25. We found one off a Kentucky database of somebody talking about the land they grew up on. I said, ‘That sounds like his voice.' I loved the musicality of the accent that Lionel has. In terms of cultural understanding, there's not a massive disconnect between that Southern American culture and the gathering of folk songs, it's not too dissimilar to Irish folk songs. There's lots of crossover in that regard.”

Ridley Scott's “Gladiator II,” Mescal's entrance into franchise filmmaking, had shot the year before, and much press has already been made about the body he had to amass via a workout routine in order to play a swords-and-sandals onscreen hero and fighter (he gained almost 20 pounds of muscle for that film). “A lot of it to me was just trying to get rid of ‘Gladiator' body beforehand,” Mescal said. “Lionel is somebody who's not making themselves small, but he's not at the forefront of conversation. He's absorbing things.”

“He's a wallflower,” added Hermanus, acknowledging that Mescal had indeed shed his bulked-up physique for this movie (though there is still a little bit of it there). “Seeing when he's walking around the house topless,” the director added of one scene, “I was like ‘I can see your spine.'”

 










Speaking about the early days of the project, Mescal said that initially he wanted to play O'Connor's character David when he received the script. “I was living with that for probably six months, six, seven months, and then Oliver rang me up and said, ‘Do you want to play Lionel?'” Mescal said. “I was new to the industry at that point, and I thought you would just read a script, and then suddenly within a year it would be happening. So it was an education in that sense. I think I don't generally have patience, but this project definitely benefited from getting made exactly when it did.”

“The History of Sound” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. MUBI will release the film in the U.S. later this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Kid Cudi Testifies in Diddy Trial","https://pitchfork.com/news/kid-cudi-testifies-in-diddy-trial/","Thu, 22 May 2025 16:31:46 GMT","

On Thursday, May 22, Kid Cudi took the witness stand in the federal sex trafficking trial against Sean “Diddy” Combs. Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, was briefly in a relationship with Casandra Elizabeth “Cassie” Ventura, Diddy's former partner, in 2011 that angered Diddy to the point of allegedly retaliating by blowing up Cudi's car the following year. The racketeering conspiracy charge against Diddy accuses him of running a criminal enterprise for two decades, and this moment—Diddy's associates setting fire to Cudi's Porsche by cutting open the convertible top and dropping a Molotov cocktail inside—plays a key role in the case against the hip-hop musician and mogul.

After Cassie filed her initial lawsuit in 2023 that began Diddy's legal spiral, Cudi, via a lawyer, confirmed that her recounting of his car's explosion in February 2012 was “true.” Today's appearance on the stand will mark Cudi's first public discussion of the incident and his role in the case. Diddy has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him. His lawyers argue that he was “simply not involved” in the arson allegations in particular.

While on the stand today, Cudi clarified the timeline during which he and Cassie began seeing each other in 2011. “We were friends and dated briefly,” said Cudi. “She and Sean Combs had some problems and they weren't dating.” In December 2011, Cassie called Cudi early one morning to inform him that Diddy learned about their relationship and that he was “abusive” and “she didn't know what [he] would do,” said Cudi. He drove over to pick her up and bring her to the Sunset Marquis, a boutique hotel in Los Angeles.

Cudi claims that Capricorn Clark, one of Diddy's staff members, called him while she was “on the verge of tears” to inform him that Diddy was at his Hollywood Hills home. Cudi immediately drove home and called Diddy, asking, “Motherfucker, are you in my house?” to which Diddy allegedly replied, “I just want to talk to you.” When Cudi arrived, his house was reportedly in disarray as if there was a break-in, the security cameras had been moved and didn't work, Chanel gifts he purchased for his family were opened, and his dog was locked in the bathroom and “very jittery.” Cudi alleges that he called Diddy immediately because “I wanted to confront him, I wanted to fight him,” but ultimately decided to call the police and filed a report over the break-in.

While spending the holidays when Cassie's family in Connecticut, Cudi allegedly received a text message from Diddy asking to speak with him. “You broke into my house, you messed with my dog, I don't want to talk with you,” Cudi allegedly replied. He said the relationship with Cassie ended shortly afterwards.

In January 2012, Cudi was in Los Angeles when he received a call from his dog sitter, who was at his house around 6:30 a.m., he claims. The sitter allegedly told Cudi that his car, a Porsche convertible, was on fire, and he returned home to see the damage himself. Photos of Cudi's car were then shown in court, with smoke damage to the car doors and a hole cut into the roof of his convertible clearly visible. A photograph of a Molotov cocktail found near the car was also shown.

Cassie alleged that Diddy learned of her seeing Cudi while he was looking through her phone at the site of a “freak-off”—the lengthy sex marathons with male prostitutes that are at the center of this case—and he lunged at her with a wine bottle opener. Later that day, Diddy threatened to release sexually explicit videos of Cassie in retaliation, she claims. “He was just so angry, and when I was in the room, he told me about videos that he had that he was going to release, and how he was going to hurt Scott and I,” Cassie testified. She went on to specify that Diddy threatened that Cudi's car would be “blown up” in his driveway. Cassie claims she ended the relationship with Cudi because she was afraid of what Diddy might do next.

The three artists met at the Soho House in Los Angeles to discuss the relationship, during which they alluded to the damaged car, according to separate testimonies from both Cassie and Cudi. “[Diddy] was standing there like a Marvel super villain,” recounted Cudi. “[He] offered me water twice. It was weird, Sean Combs being so calm.” After Cudi asked about his car, he claims Diddy replied, “I don't know what you are talking about.” During her time on the stand, Cassie described a similar exchange: “Scott said, ‘What about my vehicle?' And Sean said, ‘What vehicle?' And that was the end of the meeting.”

Cudi's testimony followed four days of questioning of Cassie, and the ensuing testimony of his former collaborator Dawn Richard, both of whom claimed that Diddy verbally and physically abused them. Richard worked alongside Diddy on the Making the Band reality show for several years and in the groups Danity Kane and Diddy - Dirty Money. In that time, she alleges that Diddy verbally and physically abused her—allegations outlined in a separate lawsuit filed last year.

During her four-day testimony in the opening week of trial, Cassie shared explicit details about the “freak-offs” at the center of the prosecution's case. “It basically entails the hiring of an escort and setting up this experience so that I could perform for Sean,” sometimes for as long as four days, she said, and explained how Diddy directed her to hire the escorts herself. “The freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.”

Following the conclusion of her testimony, both Cassie and her husband, Alex Fine, released statements on the trial via her attorney Douglas H. Wigdor. “This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me. I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear,” Cassie shared via Wigdor. On Fine's behalf, he said “Cassie saved Cassie. She alone broke free from abuse, coercion, violence, and threats. She did the work of fighting the demons that only a demon himself could have done to her.”

What are Stereolab, exactly? Folding seemingly incompatible elements into a blend that's both natural and outlandish, the veteran post-rockers have never been easy to define—they only stopped evolving when they hung up their hat in 2009. The Groop regrouped in 2019; Instant Holograms on Metal Film is the band's first studio album in 15 years. But despite a tracklisting that reads almost like parody—“Mystical Plosives,” “Vermona F Transistor,” the quintessentially 'Lab-esque “Esemplastic Creeping Eruption”—the record doesn't suggest any particularly easy answers.

We know who they are: guitarist Tim Gane, singer Laetitia Sadier, and a cast of bandmates gathered around the former romantic couple's Anglo-French alliance. We know that they formed in London in the early '90s and powered through a raft of studio albums before splitting in 2009. But the band's fundamental essence has always been difficult to capture: a slippery mixture of krautrock, yé-yé, electronics, easy listening, avant-garde collage, and left-wing politics that shifts, twitches, and mutates whenever you get it under the microscope. Stereolab are relentlessly shape-shifting—yet they always sound exactly like themselves.

Instant Holograms on Metal Film brings a new producer (Bitchin Bajas' Cooper Crain), new musicians (jazz cornetist Ben LaMar Gay, percussionist Ric Elsworth), and new vocalists (including Marie Merlet, formerly of Sadier's Monade) into the Stereolab orbit. Nevertheless, the album sounds resolutely Stereolab. Most of the key qualities that define the band are present and correct—motorik chug, bubbling Moogs, odd analog squiggles, and, above all, Sadier's vocals, cool but engaged, glowing with the discreet passion of a hotel lobby rendezvous. The record also has touches of the radical vocal interplay that Sadier and the late Mary Hansen perfected in Stereolab's mid-'90s imperial phase, when the two singers transcended rockist ideas of lead and backing vocal in favor of a gorgeously interlaced, ego-free fusion.

The band's characteristic mid-song switch-ups also appear frequently, swaggering in with the unexpected emotional jolt of a visit from a friend you'd forgotten you missed. Halfway through “Immortal Hands,” a strutting drum-machine rhythm kicks the hitherto languid song into a newly animated phase. “Melodie is a Wound,” meanwhile, adds a sunny Beach Boys-and-synths coda to the song's baroque melancholia that builds to a furiously fuzzed-up climax. At moments like these, Stereolab's music feels both intricately planned and strangely loose, with the telepathic connection of a well-drilled jazz quintet or a jam band with decades of experience in the collective fanny pack.

But as soon as you zoom in a little and try to work out exactly which Stereolab records Instant Holograms on Metal Film reminds you of, the possibilities spiral out of control. The album is animated by the great electrical thrust of early Stereolab, for instance in the galloping motorik beat of “Electrified Teenybop!” (albeit minus the visceral guitar rush of those first records); it sports the influence of jazz, which bubbles up through the bewitching chord progressions of “Immortal Hands”; there are Dots and Loops electronic touches on “Mystical Plosives” and the even more Dots-esque marimba on “Immortal Hands”; not to mention the the plasticky, retro-futuristic charm of the antiquated drum-machine tick on “Colour Television.” Instant Holograms on Metal Film sounds like the Platonic idea of Stereolab, rather than being a repeat of any particular LP, which is a neat trick for a reunion album to pull off.

If there is something genuinely new on Instant Holograms on Metal Film, it comes in addition of men's voices, from bassist Xavi Muñoz and keyboard player Joe Watson, on songs like “Aerial Troubles,” “Le Coeur et la Force,” and “Esemplastic Creeping Eruption.” This isn't entirely unexplored territory for Stereolab—Jean-Baptiste Garnero, of the French band Spring, is credited with backing vocals on Mars Audiac Quintet's “Transporté sans Bouger.” But it isn't something they have done a lot of. Sadier's vocals bounced off Gina Morris' in the early years, then intertwined with Hansen's, then—rather tragically—played off against her own multi-tracked voice after Hansen died in 2002. (Hansen's niece, Australian-British songwriter and producer Molly Read, adds “special guest backing vocals” to “Vermona F Transistor,” a neat emotional touch.)

Stereolab were never able to replace the eerily instinctive skein of Hansen and Sadier's vocals, which were so close they felt like two flowers from the same stem, and it is no slight against Muñoz, Watson, and co. that Instant Holograms on Metal Film's songs lack the chimerical vocal magic of classic Stereolab. “Aerial Troubles,” with cleverly patchworked vocals from Sadier, Muñoz, Watson, and Merlet, is a nifty musical puzzle but nowhere near as spellbinding as Stereolab in full flight. And on the otherwise excellent “Melodie Is a Wound,” Sadier goes it alone, her voice sounding oddly lonely without its melodic counterparts.

Instant Holograms on Metal Film is a relatively safe album—not exactly a retread of past glories, but far from a great leap forward. Still, a safe Stereolab album is like a middling Can record, which is to say far from the beige wash of most bands' comfortable late periods. And there are a handful of genuinely beautiful songs, showcasing the sharp melodic skills that are a sometimes overlooked weapon in the Stereolab armor. “Melodie Is a Wound” is an absolute earworm, in the nagging style of “Ping Pong”; “Flashes From Everywhere” is perfectly, stridently melancholic; and the Chemical Chords-ish “If You Remember I Forgot How to Dream Pt. 1” is pop music as positive affirmation, its cool melody like a soft-focus call to arms.

At the same time, Sadier's lyrics of self-empowerment in the face of capitalist duplicity feel more relevant than we might like, in the second Trump era. “Greed is an unfillable hole,” she trills on “Aerial Troubles,” more sad than angry. “Flawed, the extradition request/Blown, the freedom of conscience,” she solemnly intones on “Melodie Is a Wound,” and we furiously nod our heads in agreement. “Je dis ‘non'/A la guerre,” she concludes on “If You Remember I Forgot How to Dream Pt. 1,” and we eagerly say “non” with her. (When she namechecks philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's “rhizomic maze” in “You Remember I Forgot How To Dream Part 2,” she makes the concept sound more improbably dreamy than your average graduate student ever could.)

Stereolab have a reputation as a cerebral band, but as these songs show, their braininess never comes at the expense of emotion: These are angry, sad, hopeful songs that offer catharsis and solidarity. This mixture—of pulsating brains and jangling nerves, beating hearts and open minds—may be the closest we get to the essence of Stereolab; and in this, Instant Holograms on Metal Film is a laudable comeback.

Remember “Smack a Bitch,” the rap-rock stomper in which Rico Nasty thanked God that she didn't have to slap the shit out of someone? When it dropped in 2018, it was a rallying cry for rap-rooted, emo-curious young people: an eclectic subset that bootlegged pop-punk songs, looked up to Lil Peep, maybe fucked with Paramore. This month, some of those angsty teenagers graduated from college; Thrasher beanies and discarded vape pens gather dust on their closet floors. This doesn't make their past selves any less authentic—they've just grown up. Rico, too. Years ago, as a DMV upstart, she funnelled her influences—punk rock, swag-era pop, regional rap—into a glammed-up character that bordered on cartoonish. She wore her hair in spikes, favored platform boots, and created alter egos. Nearly a decade later, none of them fit anymore.

This is the premise of LETHAL, the most wrathful and freewheeling Rico Nasty album to date. Released via pop-punk label Fueled by Ramen, the record attempts to ditch old constraints—costumes, identities, categories—in favor of unfiltered feelings. Those computer-generated guitars from “Smack a Bitch”? They're live now. Sometimes the drums, too. Oh, and there's a death metal song. “I've already been looked at as the big, angry, screaming bitch anyway,” she said in a recent interview. “So why the fuck would I care?” Somewhere in these 15 songs is the most hell-raising, heavyweight Rico Nasty album in years. But as much as LETHAL seeks to do away with costume-play, the scattered cross-genre patchwork effectively makes competing caricatures of its influences—no longer melding rock with rap, but slipping in and out of them like changes of clothes. Tacobella and Trap Lavigne are not only still alive, they're competing for space.

This tug-of-war makes for a disjointed listen, which sucks, because there are so many glimpses of the cutthroat album that could have been. In the first three tracks, Rico darts between redundant rage (“Who Want It”), arena-rock pastiche that would crush in a Nerf commercial (“Teethsucker (Yea3x)”), and one of the most affecting love songs in her catalog (“On the Low”). It's the real thing: not the unfuckwithable Tacobella, nor the punk princess Trap Lavigne, but a yearning Rico Nasty setting aside braggadocio to promise that she won't kiss and tell. The simmering “Eat Me!” attempts to subvert hypermasculine rage, turning feminine agency into authority. (Compare “He wanna fuck on a MILF, callin' me mama” to “I'm fuckin' on a MILF, yeah, ayy, this bitch like 30.”) The production is too monotonous to be convincing, and this leaves Rico on an island. Then there's a sudden transition, and she's shit-talking over a sputtering new beat that finally matches her energy. It's vintage Rico Nasty, the bratty flexer that slid all over Nasty in 2018. But it's hard to appreciate, because it's only half of the song.

LETHAL is, in spirit, a passion project: Rico Nasty sounds like she's having a blast. Yet certain moments seem dropped in, as if to meet a rebellion quota. Midway through “Grave,” she raps, “Rocking shit like I rip on a guitar,” and—surprise!—a heavy guitar lick appears, like someone pressed a Hard rock sound effects button. The buzzsaw riffage of “Smoke Break” is a beautiful match for Rico's raspy timbre, but the song is undermined by anti-everything clichés like “Break shit always” and “Burn this shit down”: rock music as anarchy ASMR. It's too bad, because the album has highlights if you know where to look: “Can't Win Em All” lobs a mellow alt-rock ballad over wonderfully shifty percussion; the foot-tappy “Crash” is disarmingly desperate, proof that Rico is more than just punchlines and persona. More often, the Rico Nasty of LETHAL feels like she's playing herself in a biopic: performing the most extreme version of a character she set out to deconstruct.

May 22, 2025

Laurie Osborne and Adam Winchester have a way of bringing out the inner adventurer in each other. Not that the Berlin-based DJs have ever been boxed in by genre: Winchester first emerged from Bristol's dubstep scene as Wedge and has grown into a voracious noise sculptor, even teaching seminars on sound design. Osborne, meanwhile, has touched on dub, breakbeat, techno, and garage under his Appleblim moniker. But together as Wrecked Lightship, the two musicians tease an otherworldly club logic out of their combined sensibilities. Dubby basslines radiate with the soft glow of the setting sun. Alien synth stabs break apart like machinery casting off a crash-landing rocket. Every tone seems to be in the process of decay, crunching and crackling as if in the throes of their final transmission.

Where Wrecked Lightship's nebulous Peak Oil debut last year leaned into their more abstract instincts, Drained Strands, their fourth album, ups the rhythmic factor considerably, incorporating molten textures into a more driving set of tracks. Think Kenny Larkin's cybernetic techno, but drenched in the hypnotic surface noise of Pole and bolstered with the weight of Porter Ricks' mulched thump. It's still better suited to sinking into your couch than tearing up the dancefloor, but Osborne and Winchester's floating bass patterns and spine-tickling hi-hats imbue everything with a deathly urgency. Osborne delights in the tension between human imperfection and mechanical precision. “I like the idea of both always trying to do what the other can't,” he has said: “Machines trying to sound human and humans trying to sound like machines.” Drained Strands comes alive in the smeared interzone where technology fuses with the organic.

Wrecked Lightship's music exists in a dark, dank world not unlike that of Osborne's former Skull Disco label partner Shackleton, their rhythms so solvent they could slip through your fingers. Even the duo's more straightforward songs thrive in their aqueous details: “Reeling Mist” bears their most clearly defined melody yet, but the real joy is in the staticky signals that roll up and down the track, or the swaying garage snare that click-clacks with just the right amount of echo. It's a trip-hoppy piece of comedown lounge ammo; “Lagoon,” on the other hand, plunges straight into the abyss, as Osborne and Winchester ground their slippery downtempo claps with deep, enveloping rounds of throbbing bass. The title track opens the album on a magnificent charge, a time-warped footwork beat dodging between blood-red synths that flit like security beams in some dystopian jailbreak.

Osborne and Winchester are at their strongest when charting strange new rabbit holes through their many influences, but the purely ambient passages here are less gripping. “Ultra Red” and “Somnium Sands” rest entirely on straightforward drones that run as long as six minutes without offering much beyond some eerie sound design. They're passable as a zone-out-inducing rest stop in between the more propulsive voyages, but as sketches they probably didn't need to take up a full third of the album. Wrecked Lightship have no trouble pulling you into the fog with just their ghostly rhythms; for two vets who have been around the block, they're still treating dance music like an ancient mystery waiting to be solved.

Beastie Boys have very nearly settled a lawsuit in which they accused Chili's of copyright infringement over a social media ad that parodied the “Sabotage” video, Billboard reports and court records confirm. The band sued Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's Grill & Bar, last July, alleging that the use of the Ill Communication song falsely implied that Beastie Boys endorsed Chili's. Universal Music Group (UMG) subsequently sued Brinker for using unlicensed music in dozens of other Chili's ads. (The label has also now settled with Brinker International.) The Beastie Boys' impending settlement follows mediation between the parties this month; terms of the agreement have not been revealed. They expect to file a formal dismissal on July 7, according to the court document.

The Beastie Boys lawsuit alleged copyright infringement and trademark rights violations over an ad that, per the lawsuit's description, featured “three characters wearing obvious 70s-style wigs, fake mustaches, and sunglasses,” in the style of the Spike Jonze–directed 1994 video for “Sabotage.” The group, which does not license songs for third-party advertising, originally sought $150,000 in monetary damages, a takedown of the commercials, and an order preventing Brinker from using their work moving forward.

Donald Trump's tax bill, which Republicans passed in the House of Representatives overnight on Thursday, will slash funding for Medicaid, food assistance, and Medicare to finance a new set of tax cuts for the rich. It also includes tax breaks for gun silencers. 


	In a speech at 4 a.m. on Thursday, as Republicans were pushing through their tax bill, Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) took credit for the initial provision, which will eliminate a $200 excise tax on gun silencers. The lawmaker owns a gun shop worth millions of dollars.


	“My Democrat colleagues have asked: How did this get in the bill, what was the deal, and who asked for it,” Clyde said. “No deal. I believe the speaker, with the purest of motive, simply wanted to restore a constitutional right.” Before his time ended, he added, “And who asked? Me. I asked.”


	The lawmaker posted on X Thursday that he had quietly secured additional tax breaks on silencers. “The original bill text only removed the $200 transfer tax for suppressors. Now, the bill eliminates both the transfer and making tax for suppressors, as well as the registration,” Clyde wrote, calling it a “massive” Second Amendment victory. (These changes appear in the manager's amendment that Republicans released late Wednesday and passed Thursday.)

	











	Clyde owns a gun shop, Clyde Armory, in Athens, Georgia, and the building it is housed in — which could best be described as a gun castle. (Take a look.)


	The store, which lists silencers for sale on its website, was previously placed under an enhanced federal monitoring program, according to The New York Times, after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives “found that more than 25 guns sold there had been used in crimes within three years of their purchase.”


	According to Clyde's 2023 financial disclosure, the gun shop was worth between $5 million and $25 million. He valued the property as being worth between $1 million and $5 million. Clyde reported earning between $200,000 and $2 million in income in 2023 from the shop and property.

	Everytown for Gun Safety, the anti-gun violence advocacy group, slammed Republicans' silencer tax breaks in a statement Thursday. “There's a reason silencers have been regulated for nearly a century: They make it much harder for law enforcement and bystanders to react quickly to gunshots,” said the organization's president, John Feinblatt. “In the name of gun industry profits, House Republicans are putting law enforcement and our communities at greater risk of being shot — all while gutting health care for millions of Americans.”

	











	Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) was among the Democrats criticizing the silencer provision in recent days. “I have no idea why we think it's a good idea to repeal a tax on silencers when we are going to feed fewer children in our country as a result of this. It's a moral damn failure is what it is,” she said Wednesday.


	Earlier this month, Clyde introduced legislation, called the “Constitutional Hearing Protection Act,” to deregulate and eliminate the excise tax on silencers.


	“As an ardent defender of our Second Amendment liberties, I'm working to remove all infringements on our God-given right to keep and bear arms,” Clyde said in a press release at the time. “By deregulating suppressors, eliminating the costly $200 tax stamp on these firearms, and avoiding additional taxation, my legislation offers a constitutional solution to increase Americans' access to suppressors.”


	Clyde was one of four late conservative holdouts on the Trump tax bill who demanded that the legislation do more to cut Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. 


	As a result of their efforts, the bill will phase in work Medicaid requirements sooner, by the end of 2026. That means the 10 million Americans who are expected to lose Medicaid coverage will lose their coverage sooner.

	​​“We are not cutting Medicare or Medicaid,” Clyde said, falsely. “We want to strengthen Medicaid by saying to those who can work ‘all right, you need to work.'” 


	The poor may not have health insurance or food assistance once Republicans pass this bill, but at least they won't have to deal with the “draconian tax,” as Clyde put it Thursday morning, on gun silencers.

Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed the House of Representatives early this morning, and the president couldn't be more thrilled about being one step closer to kicking millions of Americans off their health care coverage and food assistance programs. 


	“THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” has PASSED the House of Representatives! This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, noting some of the marginally populist provisions in the legislation, including “No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, [and] Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle.” 


	“Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,” the president added. 


	Trump also accused Democrats of having “lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination,” alleging they “have forgotten their landslide loss in the Presidential Election, and are warped in the past, hoping someday to revive Open Borders for the World's criminals to be able to pour into our Country, men to be able to play in women's sports, and transgender for everybody.”

	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) celebrated the passage of the legislation in a statement on social media. “The media and the Democrats have consistently dismissed any possibility of House Republicans succeeding in our mission to enact President Trump's America First,” he wrote. “House Democrats voted against all of it — which clearly proves they want tax hikes on their constituents, open borders, and Medicaid for illegal immigrants.”


	The reconciliation bill — which enshrines Trump 2017 tax cuts into law and pays for those same cuts by taking a machete to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — faced no smooth path through the House.

	After a marathon markup session that began at 1 a.m. on Wednesday, the bill passed the lower chamber in a 215-214 vote. The margin was only a single vote because two members of the GOP voted no, several abstained (rumors are that at least one accidentally slept through the vote), and three Democratic members of the House have died in office in the past three months. This includes Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who died Wednesday morning from complications related to terminal cancer. 

	











	During Wednesday's markup session in the House Rules Committee, Democrats bashed their Republican colleagues for scheduling the debate sessions and hearings in the dead of night, when most of the public and media were asleep. 


	“In just over 100 days, you guys have gone from promising to lower costs to ripping away people's health care. Of course you don't want anybody to know what you're doing here,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said during one session. “It's because you know this bill betrays the people who voted for you.” 


	The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation would remove over 10 million people from their health care coverage under programs like Medicaid, and over 7 million going uninsured. This is on top of the 26 million Americans who are already uninsured.


	While the bill may have passed the House by the skin of its teeth, it will face a renewed battle in the Senate. Some Republicans in the upper chamber have already made clear that they have no interest in being viewed as the party that kicked millions off their health care coverage to give tax breaks to the rich. In an opinion piece for The New York Times published earlier this month, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called the bill's provisions “both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

	“Republicans need to open their eyes: Our voters support social insurance programs. More than that, our voters depend on those programs. And there's a reason for this that Republicans would do well to ponder. Our economy is increasingly unfriendly to working people and their families,” Hawley wrote. “If Republicans want to be a working-class party — if we want to be a majority party — we must ignore calls to cut Medicaid and start delivering on America's promise for America's working people.” 


	Hawley is not alone. One anonymous GOP senator told The Hill today that “there's probably five, six, seven of us who if you do anything that cuts into benefits, you're going to have a real problem.”

This post contains spoilers for the limited series Sirens, now streaming on Netflix. 


	Maybe I should have known that Sirens was going to be confusing when its main character licked a stranger's neck. 


	The licking happens late in the first of five episodes, created by Molly Smith Metzler, based on her play Elemeno Pea. Our heroine is Devon (Meghann Fahy), a hot mess from Buffalo who has arrived on a rich and insular Martha's Vineyard-eque island in search of her younger sister Simone (Milly Alcock). Devon is in desperate need of help to care for their senile father Bruce (Bill Camp). Simone, meanwhile, is personal assistant to Michaela “Kiki” Kell (Julianne Moore), the aloof second wife to wealthy businessman Peter (Kevin Bacon), and has no interest in Buffalo, Bruce, or anything that doesn't involve basking in the reflected glow of her rich and glamorous employer. After Devon makes a big scene, Kiki offers her a $10,000 payoff to leave the island and never return, and sends her away in the care of her chief of staff, Jose (Felix Solis), who drives Devon to a local inn to spend the night ahead of the morning ferry. 

	











	And as Jose is dropping Devo off at the inn, she licks him. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	She apologizes quickly, explaining, “It's a thing I do.” She says she's working on the problem with her text therapist — she can't afford traditional therapy. Jose shrugs, pleads with her to not lick anyone at the inn, and leaves. 


	In and of itself, there's nothing wrong with the licking scene. It's strange. It's surprising. It's a nice bit of awkward comedy for Fahy — whose star has been on the rise since her turn as the surprisingly complex trophy wife in the second season of The White Lotus — and it fits into the quirky vibe that Metzler and director Nicole Kassell have established throughout the premiere. It also seems to be setting up a payoff later, whether it's Devon talking more about how this particular tic developed, or her licking someone else at the worst (or best) possible moment.

	But the licking is essentially forgotten after that, other than Jose affectionately calling her “neck licker” in a later episode. Instead, it becomes one oddball incident in a show that's full of them while also trying to make you take the relationship between the sisters and their neglectful father seriously, and that can't decide what it wants the great Julianne Moore to play. 

	











White Lotus has led to a cottage industry of shows involving rich, eccentric people getting into various hijinks in beautiful, ominous locales. Often, they feature Nicole Kidman (whose Nine Perfect Strangers returned to Hulu for a second season this week), and/or Fahy. (The two of them teamed up for Netflix's The Perfect Couple.) And they're generally aiming for the same blending of tones — satire, but with genuine emotions lurking just underneath the humor — that White Lotus creator Mike White has attempted with varying degrees of success. 


	Few things in TV are more satisfying than when a show tries to cover multiple vibes and genres at once — It's a mystery! And a sitcom! And a soap opera! And a trenchant commentary on the Way We Live Now! — and succeeds. But when it doesn't work — and boy, does it not work for Sirens — few things lead to more head-scratching for viewers. 


	There are at least a half-dozen different shows elbowing one another for dominance in Sirens. Some of them seem genuinely appealing. Fahy is a lot of fun playing against recent type as a blue-collar woman who has zero interest in the glamorous, opulent world that so fascinates her sister. There's a brief period where it seems as if Sirens will involve Devon going undercover to expose the truth about the cult that she believes has Simone in its thrall. But that idea gets scrapped not long after it's introduced. During that brief story window, there's a scene where Kiki's three interchangeable sidekicks are all lip syncing to “WAP,” and it's unclear whether Devon is hallucinating this, or they're really doing it. It's less that the show's reality is elastic than that it's muddled.

	Mostly, though, this impressive cast is asked to play multiple, at times incompatible, versions of the same character. At times, Bruce — who eventually winds up on the island in the care of Ray (Josh Segarra from The Other Two and Abbott Elementary), Devon's married boss and sometime-lover — is a figure of pure awkward comedy; at others, he is a figure of genuine nightmare, and the reason Simone has so enthusiastically turned herself into a Stepford Assistant whose entire personality is modeled on Kiki's. Similarly, Kiki vacillates between a broad figure of oblivious privilege, not that far removed from Moore's The Big Lebowski heiress, and a scrapper who feels just as insecure in this place as either sister. Glenn Howerton from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia plays next-door neighbor Ethan, an idle rich man-child having a secret affair with Simone. He seems to mostly be a joke, but then we're meant to be somewhat sympathetic when Simone rejects his marriage proposal; then he becomes ridiculous again when he falls off the cliff on the edge of Kiki and Peter's property, and escapes with only a few broken bones. 

	











	All of this builds to one of the more unintentionally silly conclusions to a story like this in recent memory. Earlier in the story, Peter — increasingly unhappy with Kiki's controlling personality, and going through at least his second midlife crisis — kisses a shocked Simone during a private moment. A Vanity Fair photographer, in town for the weekend to shoot Kiki's exclusive annual summer gala, catches the kiss on camera, and sells the photo to Kiki, who fires Simone and ponders using this evidence of infidelity to nullify her restrictive prenup. But Simone warns Peter. Peter has Jose steal the only copy of the photo(*) from Kiki's safe, and tells Kiki that he's trading her in for a newer model: Simone. And in the middle of the gala — a gala that, mind you, Kiki made a big show of kicking off for all the guests only minutes before — Kiki is sent packing, and Peter swans around the party with Simone on his arm. None of the guests seem to even notice the swap in partners, much less seem concerned by it. 


(*) Never mind that this story takes place in the present, and thus Kiki could always go back to the photographer for another one.

	Maybe if Metzler and company had leaned all the way into the most arch version of the story, the strangely seamless transition would feel fitting as its final joke: Simone, like Kiki before her, sliding into a life that will never really be hers, where she'll eventually be replaced with a similar ease. But because Sirens keeps toggling between cartoon logic and a more sincere approach, the twist plays as nonsensical. Devon leaves the island with Bruce in tow, lamenting the fact that she's completely lost her sister, and discovers Kiki riding the same ferry, the two of them essentially at the same social station now. For a few minutes, Kiki is written, and played, as a human being. But a three-dimensional person has no place in a show that could have the mid-gala switcheroo take place moments earlier. 


	I'll give Sirens this: It may be a failure, but it's an interesting one. Most of the shows in this corner of the streaming economy seem content to stick to a basic formula.

Beastie Boys and Universal Music Group have settled their lawsuits against the parent company of Chili's that claimed the restaurant used the group's “Sabotage” in social media ads without permission.


	In July 2024, the band and their label sued Brinker International over the ads that first started appearing in November 2022. In addition to using the song without permission, the complaint claimed, one of the ads also resembled the song's famed Spike Jonez-directed music video, complete with “three characters wearing obvious 70s-style wigs, fake mustaches, and sunglasses who were intended to evoke the three members of Beastie Boys.”


	“Use of the ‘Sabotage' sound recording, music composition and video was all without permission,” the lawsuit said. “The plaintiffs do not license ‘Sabotage' or any of their other intellectual property for third-party product advertising purposes, and deceased Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch included a provision in his will prohibiting such uses.”

	











	Beastie Boys and UMG sought at least $150,000 in damages from Brinker. On Wednesday, lawyers for both sides filed briefs to the federal court notifying it that they reached a settlement “in principle” following mediation, Billboard reports. Terms of the agreement were not revealed.

	Beastie Boys have been fiercely protective of their music following Yauch's death in 2012, as one of the provisions in his will aimed to block the use of the trio's music in advertising.


	Back in 2014, the band won a $1.7 million verdict against the Monster Energy drink company for using several of the group's songs in a promotional video. That same year, Beastie Boys reached an undisclosed settlement with toy company GoldieBlox over the use of their song “Girls.”

	Two staff members from the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. were shot and killed Wednesday evening while leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. The suspect shouted “Free, free Palestine” after he was arrested, according to police. 


	The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were leaving the event when the suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, approached and opened fire. The event was hosted by the American Jewish Committee.


	“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. this evening. We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue,” American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement. “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”


	D.C. police chief Pamela A. Smith briefed reporters last night, noting that the suspect was seen pacing outside the museum before approaching the group and firing with a handgun multiple times. He was detained by the venue security before the police arrived, and is currently in police custody.

	Smith confirmed police “have not had any prior interactions” with the suspect. She added, “We don't see anything in his background that would have placed him on our radar. Our joint terrorism task force is working very closely with the FBI to ensure that we can do a deep dive into his background.”


	Yechiel Leiter, Israel‘s ambassador to the U.S., told reporters that the two people killed were a young couple about to be engaged. “The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said. “They were a beautiful couple.”


	President Donald Trump responded to the incident on his Truth Social, writing, “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen!  God Bless You ALL!”

	Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that she visited the scene of the shooting. “Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more,” Bondi wrote on X. She added she was there with former judge Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in Washington whose office would prosecute the case.

	











	Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement he is “devastated” by the scenes in D.C. “This is a despicable act of hatred, of antisemitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,” Herzog said. “Our hearts are with the loved ones of those murdered and our immediate prayers are with the injured. I send my full support to the Ambassador and all the embassy staff. We stand with the Jewish community in DC and across the US. America and Israel will stand united in defense of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”


	Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government is tightening security for Israel's outposts worldwide. “We are witnessing the terrible price of antisemitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel,” he said in a statement. “The blood libels against Israel are paid in blood, and we must fight them relentlessly. My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer.”


	The shooting occurred as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has escalated in recent weeks. Israel has been blocking aid deliveries to Gaza since March, resulting in a lack of food and medical aid in the region. Last night, the United Nations it had dispatched “around 90 truckloads of goods” into Gaza, but that is only a fraction of what is needed to prevent an imminent famine. Israel's military has also been attacking Gaza with notable force, including hospitals, schools, and shelters, causing dozens of deaths per day.

	The event at the Jewish Capital Museum was focused on how to help the people of Gaza, according to American Jewish Committee board member JoJo Kalin. “I'm not going to lose my humanity over this or be deterred,” she said, per the BBC. “And that Israelis and Palestinians both still deserve self determination and [it is] just deeply ironic that that's what we were discussing. It was bridge building and then we were all hit over the hide with such hatred.“

He's Making Up for It","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-cash-in-presidency-corruption-sky-palace-crypto-1235345468/","Thu, 22 May 2025 13:00:46 GMT","


	President Donald Trump will host a gathering of VIPs today at his private golf resort outside Washington, D.C. These are not diplomats or heads of state. They are rich people, foreign and domestic, who have put money into the Trump family's pockets.


	The dinner is for winners of a contest — the crypto traders who raced to become the top 220 holders of the president's $TRUMP meme coin. According to one analysis, they collectively accumulated about $150 million of the crypto asset, which has no intrinsic value and is equivalent to a digital baseball card. 


	The contest has made Trump's family crypto business money on each transaction. And it has swelled the president's personal net worth, by driving up the price of the coin, which the family business holds massive reserves of. 


	The meme coin contest is just the latest example of Trump wielding the public office of the presidency for his private enrichment. In fact, sources with direct knowledge of the matter tell Rolling Stone that one of the lessons Trump took away from his previous stint in the White House is that he was wrong to leave a ton of money on the table as president. 

	











	The president himself has privately said this on multiple occasions in recent months and years, according to two people who've been in the room with him. In moments of casual banter, Trump has mentioned that it was “stupid” of other Republicans and advisers to persuade him — at least on occasion — to side with government ethicists who cautioned him from obliterating the line between public good and private gain.


	Trump says such things often enough that he can't help himself from repeating some of it in public, including recently about the proposed gift of a $400 million 747 jumbo jet “sky palace” from the government of a Gulf emirate. “I think it's a great gesture from Qatar; I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” the president told the press at the White House in mid-May. “I mean, I could be a stupid person saying, ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.'” (As Rolling Stone previously reported, Trump often does not distinguish between what's his and what belongs to the people or its government, including when it comes to this plane — which he privately refers to as “one of my” new airplanes.)

	Trump does not hold space in his mind for any distinction between his private interest and the public interest. “A deal is a deal,” the president has said in the past several months, according to one of the two sources, dismissing Democratic complaints about the meme coin, or about how his business and real-estate empire is working to strike major foreign deals. 


	To anyone holding fast to the bedrock norms of public service, Trump's self-dealing is appalling. “The situation should be revolting to anybody who cares about the American interest,” says Norm Eisen, a good-government champion who now directs the Democracy Defenders Fund. “It's damaging to the country. When people give you a $400 million plane, or a $2 billion investment, or buy your meme coins in large amounts to have dinner with you and visit the White House — they expect something in return.”


	Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, agrees. Trump's deals make the campaign finance scandals of the last century — recall the Clinton-era scandal in which top donors were treated to overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House — look quaint. 


	“It's not even in the same ballpark as what we're seeing with Donald Trump,” Bookbinder says. From crypto deals to a Qatari sky palace, he notes, “you're talking about Trump's personal bottom line — about money going into his pocket, or about luxuries that make his daily life better.” And the special interests providing these riches, Bookbinder warns, will enjoy “access to him, and the ability potentially to influence him.”

	Anna Kelly, a Trump White House spokesperson, tells Rolling Stone, “There are no conflicts of interest. President Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children. It is shameful that Rolling Stone is ignoring the GOOD deals President Trump has secured for the American people, not for himself, to push a false narrative. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly reelected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.”


	The Trump Organization and the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, did not respond to requests for comment.


	In venting to close allies about accusations of open corruption and, effectively, bribes from foreign entities and regimes, the president has said that any nation or city overseas should be proud to have a Trump Tower or other new Trump family property built there. This is, Trump says, in part because such a building now carries the “prestige” of not only his brand name, but the United States as a whole, one of sources who's been in the room with Trump in recent months tells Rolling Stone. 

	











	On Monday, Reuters reported that the Trump Organization and a local partner are considering building a skyscraper in Vietnam, after the country approved the Trump family empire's plans for a $1.5 billion luxury residential development and golf club. Eric Trump attended the golf club's groundbreaking ceremony on Wednesday with Vietnam's prime minister. Vietnam is simultaneously working to negotiate a tariff deal with the Trump administration. 


	Both in public and behind closed doors, Trump often repeats a new mantra: It does not matter how much lucrative new business the Trump Organization or his children engage in while Trump is the president, because he and his family are so wealthy that he doesn't need that new cash flow or windfalls — and therefore, he must be unbribable. (For his part, Trump's son Eric has abandoned concerns about the optics or appearance of corruption, telling The Wall Street Journal that his efforts to keep certain interests of the Trump Organization and the first Trump presidency separate went unrewarded. “I got very little credit for it,” he said. “We still kind of got stomped on.”)


	The second Trump administration, from Day One, has been working to make the world safe for corrupt business practices — in ways that have already eclipsed the sky-high standards of corruption set by Trump's first four years as leader of the free world.


	Through his executive orders, Trump has opened the door to corruption both foreign and domestic. In February, Trump issued a pause on enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This anti-corruption statute bars companies from using bribes to secure overseas business deals and requires adherence to basic bookkeeping standards. 


	Trump issued his executive order in the name of “eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad” and normalizing “routine business practices in other nations.” The order declares that suspending enforcement will “prioritize American interests” and improve “American economic competitiveness.” The executive order leaves any enforcement solely to the discretion of the attorney general, Pam Bondi. 


	Bondi has experience with foreign business interests, having previously acted as a lobbyist for the government of Qatar. The public knows about the arrangement between Bondi and Qatar because of disclosures required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA — a law meant to shine a light on foreign influence and propaganda campaigns inside the U.S.

	











	The Trump administration, on Bondi's first day, also ordered a halt to criminal prosecutions for violations of FARA. This means the Department of Justice will turn a blind eye to covert foreign influence operations, unless there is “conduct similar to more traditional espionage by foreign government actors,” according to Bondi's order. 


	Bondi also ordered DOJ's ​​Foreign Influence Task Force to be disbanded. And under her leadership, the FBI has disbanded an elite unite tasked with rooting out public corruption by executive officials and members of Congress.


	“The administration started with weakening corruption safeguards for others,” says Eisen of Democracy Defenders. “And it has evolved into open profiteering based on public office by Donald Trump himself.”


	Trump is leveraging his family's crypto business as a means for very rich people, many of them foreign nationals, to put money in his pocket.


	The brazen meme coin contest has received the most scrutiny. The $TRUMP meme coin is not officially supposed to be an investment vehicle. (The coin's fine print insists it is not “an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.”) 


	But Trump's decision to launch the crypto asset just days before reclaiming the White House cemented his status as a multibillionaire. (His wife, Melania, created her own coin, too.)


	In April, the president announced a contest in which the top holders of $TRUMP coin would gain access to him personally at a dinner at Trump National Golf Club outside D.C. The coin's 25 biggest investors have also been promised a special reception and an unspecified “VIP Tour.” (Originally this was billed as a “VIP White House Tour.”) 


	“You have a situation where people who buy millions of dollars worth of his meme coin have a chance to talk to him and pitch him on policy that regular Americans don't have,” says Bookbinder of CREW. “That is corrupt.”


	The top holder in the contest spent about $18 million on $TRUMP coin. Justin Sun, who identified himself in a post on X as the $TRUMP whale, is a controversial crypto billionaire whose own fortune is in jeopardy. 


	In 2023, Sun was sued by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged fraud and manipulation involving his company's Tron coin. Sun has since emerged as an adviser to the Trump family's crypto business and reportedly invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, netting the Trump family an estimated $56 million in fees, according to Bloomberg. In February, not long after Trump took office, the SEC reportedly asked a judge to pause its litigation against Sun, so it could pursue a resolution out of court.Separately, as part of his trade war, Trump has weighed delisting Chinese companies from America's stock exchanges. The Wall Street Journal reports that some Chinese firms are now rushing to buy $TRUMP coin, seemingly in a quest to stay in Trump's favor — and on the Nasdaq.

	











	Trump is also reaping money from a different crypto coin. In early May, an investment firm in Abu Dhabi announced it would make a $2 billion investment in the crypto platform Binance — doing so using a “stablecoin” minted by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, $USD1. 


	Stablecoins are pegged to a unit of fiat currency, in this case the U.S. dollar. The minters of stablecoin typically profit from transaction fees, as well as from the interest generated by the real-world assets (like U.S. Treasuries) that are used to ensure the value and liquidity of the cryptocurrency.


	Bookbinder argues that the stablecoin transaction “could be incredibly valuable” to the Trump family. The sheer size of the transaction establishes the Trump family's stablecoin as a major asset in a crowded market — giving the family's company invaluable brand cachet. And then there's the $2 billion itself. “It appears that they're going to be able to invest it and take the proceeds,” Bookbinder says, “which could be many, many millions of dollars.”


	Congress is currently considering legislation, called the GENIUS Act, that would enact new, weak regulations on stablecoins — a boon for Big Tech firms and likely the president's family, too. The Senate passed the legislation on a bipartisan basis on Monday.


	In what critics allege is a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, Trump is seeking to accept a luxury 747 jumbo jet, known as a “sky palace,” from the government of Qatar for use as Air Force One during the course of his presidency. As part of the jaw-dropping proposal, the plane would remain available for Trump's post-presidential travel upon leaving the White House. 


	The deal has been blessed as lawful by Attorney General Bondi — the former lobbyist for Qatar — under the logic that Trump will never personally own the plane, as it will ostensibly remain in the hands of Trump's library foundation, which Trump appears to be turning into a slush fund for donations to fund a lavish post-presidency.


	It's been reported that the Qataris are happy to hand off the plane — a garish golden albatross that they've been unable to sell. But the plane's over-the-top luxury appeals to the intended recipient, Trump. “It's hard to imagine that he's not going to be influenced by the fact that he is flying around in a luxurious plane,” Bookbinder says. “Based on his statements, we have every reason to think that would influence him. That's a kind of corruption that we haven't seen before.”


	Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) agrees. “This level of corruption is so gross that even Trump's most hardened MAGA sycophants are turning against him,” Murphy said in a floor speech that cited conservatives Laura Loomer and Ben Shapiro as unlikely allies in the fight. “They can't believe he … is willing to put our nation's security at risk, take unconstitutional bribes just so he can fly himself and his Mar-a-Lago golf buddies around the world in a gold-plated luxury plane.”

	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is in a position to defend the Constitution against Trump's corrupting impulses. But when faced with questions about Trump's airplane deal with Qatar, Johnson demurred, bizarrely insisting, “It's not my lane.”


	Johnson went on to suggest that Trump should get away with his corrupt deals because they're happening in broad daylight. “Whatever President Trump is doing is out in the open,” Johnson said. “They're not trying to conceal anything.”

A striking new music video for ""Supernatural"" hit screens on Monday, May 19. The footage shows Ariana Grande walking through a wrecked city with scenes of alien contact, mirroring the visuals from her Brighter Days Ahead short film. In the finale scene Republic Records just made public, you can see her drift skyward into an alien craft's beam.

""This love's possessing me, but I don't mind at all. It's taking over me. Don't wanna fight the fall,"" sings Grande in lyrics of ""Supernatural.""

She co-directed the music video with Christian Breslauer, and the piece fits into her Brighter Days Ahead film. In it, she plays Peaches, a woman trying to scrub away memories of a past love. The plot nods to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

""When we are young, sometimes we want to erase certain things or rewrite certain things that seem painful to us in the moment, but when we grow older, we would do anything to relive those moments,"" said Grande in an Instagram video.

A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)

""Supernatural"" is the fourth single from her Eternal Sunshine album, which dropped on March 8 last year. The record shot straight to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with 227,000 units sold in week one.

This track follows ""Yes, And?"", ""We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)"", and a duet with Penn Badgley titled ""The Boy is Mine."" In March, six new songs were added to the original album in the expanded Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead version.

A retired researcher has detected an unusual pulse in the light of nearby stars while looking for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. Aliens are one possible explanation for the strange signal, but as with every other unexplained space phenomenon, it's probably not aliens.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An unusual pulse signal has been detected in the light of nearby stars — and it's left scientists scratching their heads, a study searching for extraterrestrial intelligence finds.

The pulses saw the stars become fainter and brighter in a fraction of a second, suggesting that something passed in front of — and partially obscured — the stars' light. This doesn't mean aliens were zooming by in spaceships, but unknown alien activity is one of several possible explanations left on the table by the researcher who detected the signal.

Richard Stanton, a retired scientist who formerly worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has spent years with a 30-inch telescope scrutinizing more than 1,300 sun-like stars for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. He does this by measuring changes in light coming from individual stars.

This effort didn't yield anything particularly unusual until May 14, 2023, when Stanton detected two quick and identical pulses in the light of a star named HD 89389 — located around 102 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major.

""No single pulse anything like these has ever been found in more than 1,500 hours of searching,"" Stanton wrote in the study, published April 23 in the journal Acta Astronautica.

Stanton checked historical data on starlight observations and found that a similar pair of pulse signals was recorded in 2019, this time in the light of a star called HD 217014, or 51 Pegasi. After completing his study, Stanton then detected a third double pulse event in the light of another star (HD 12051) on Jan. 18, 2025. The pulse signals are currently unexplained.

However, Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in California who was not involved in the study, urged caution when attributing the pulses to potential alien activity.

""There's a history (going back more than a century) of astronomical discoveries that were, at first, attributed to extraterrestrial beings, but in fact turned out to be natural phenomena,"" Shostak told Live Science in an email. ""Given that history, one should be cautious in saying that these 'starlight pulses' are due to extraterrestrials trying to get in touch.""

Shostak added that he would expect any alien transmissions, be they optical, radio or something else, to convey information of some kind — because, as he puts it, clever aliens wouldn't go to the trouble and expense of sending empty signals into space.

""And as these signals seem to be both regular, kind of simple (two pulses) and repetitive, I'm more than a little inclined to say that we're dealing with astrophysical phenomena here — not an attempt by some alien society to send interstellar telegrams,"" he said.

Even so, the pulses of light coming from HD 89389 were ""strange,"" according to Stanton's study. The star's light was reduced by about a quarter in one-tenth of a second. No known phenomenon could have caused the star itself to change in brightness and then revert back to normal so quickly, according to the study.

There are plenty of objects in and around Earth that regularly obscure stars in the night sky, causing their brightness to flicker. However, Stanton found that the usual suspects for obscuring stars, like airplanes, birds, satellites and meteors around Earth, didn't explain these pulses. For example, objects like airplanes and asteroids typically obscure all of the star's light, but HD 89389 never completely disappeared.

What's more, Stanton snaps images of the stars while measuring the photons they emit, and these images often pick up passing satellites that have obscured a star's light. However, there wasn't anything visible in the images of HD 89389 to explain the pulses.

""Nothing was found in any of these frames, suggesting that the source of the pulses was either invisible, such as due to some atmospheric effect, or too far away to be detected,"" Stanton wrote.

One possible explanation is the activity of an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), but it would have to be near to Earth (relatively speaking) because of how rapidly the stars changed in brightness.

—Intelligent aliens would need a power supply to jump-start their civilization — would they require fossil fuels?

—'Perhaps it's only a matter of time': Intelligent life may be much more likely than first thought, new model suggests

—What's the best evidence we've found for alien life?

""Whatever is modulating the star's light must be relatively close to Earth, implying that any ETI activity must be within our solar system,"" Stanton wrote.

The study explored several potential causes for the pulses but left many questions unanswered. Alongside aliens, possible explanations left on the table included gravitational waves — ripples in the fabric of space-time — and the starlight diffracting off some unseen space object.

""More and better data are needed, such as could be gathered using arrays of telescopes on the ground,"" Stanton wrote. ""Data from this new source, or information from other approaches, may be the only way to unravel this mystery.""

ByLance Eliot,

 Contributor. 

In today's column, I explore a fascinating proposition about what we might do once we have progressed conventional AI into becoming AGI (artificial general intelligence). In a post-AGI era, there is a notable task that AGI could substantially help humanity resolve. What is that worthy task? It would be the esteemed search for extraterrestrial life. The usual parlance is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). We could use our newly invented AGI to be a kind of space alien hunter that finally determines whether there really is extraterrestrial intelligence somewhere out there.

Let's talk about it.

This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).

First, some fundamentals are required to set the stage for this weighty discussion.

There is a great deal of research going on to further advance AI. The general goal is to either reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) or maybe even the outstretched possibility of achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI).

AGI is AI that is considered on par with human intellect and can seemingly match our intelligence. ASI is AI that has gone beyond human intellect and would be superior in many if not all feasible ways. The idea is that ASI would be able to run circles around humans by outthinking us at every turn. For more details on the nature of conventional AI versus AGI and ASI, see my analysis at the link here.

We have not yet attained AGI.

In fact, it is unknown as to whether we will reach AGI, or that maybe AGI will be achievable in decades or perhaps centuries from now. The AGI attainment dates that are floating around are wildly varying and wildly unsubstantiated by any credible evidence or ironclad logic. ASI is even more beyond the pale when it comes to where we are currently with conventional AI.

A standing question that has puzzled humankind for ages is whether we are the only intelligent life that is in existence or once was in existence.

The usual refrain is that there must be other intelligent life, somewhere. It might have existed long ago and since then has died off. Nonetheless, they hopefully left clues so that we could detect their prior existence.

There might even be intelligent life right now alive and existing on some remote planet or flying around in a remote spaceship. Maybe they are trying to communicate with us, but we aren't astute enough to catch and interpret their signals. Of course, they might not be aware of us and thus it is up to us to contact them. No one can say for sure what is going to be the best course of action that will lead to humanity connecting with that extraterrestrial intelligence.

Just about every method we know of is currently being leveraged to try and detect extraterrestrial signals. Specialized devices scan the skies for electromagnetic signals, optical signals, radiation signals, etc. Not only are we attempting to read what might be coming in our direction, but we also transmit signals to the heavens.

You might remember that in 1977, NASA launched the Voyager into outer space and included the now-famous Golden Record. This was a phonograph record that depicted sounds and other data portraying life on Earth. The belief was that an alien being in outer space would come across the Voyager, be curious about what civilization sent out the spacecraft, and then play the phonograph.

Carl Sagan, a well-known astronomer, characterized this as sending a bottle out into the cosmic ocean.

Not everyone necessarily heralds the search for extraterrestrial life.

One of the pressing concerns is that we might inadvertently awaken a sleeping giant that will then come and crush us. An extraterrestrial life that can receive our signals or otherwise figure out where we are might decide that we are worth conquering. This otherworldly intelligence could enslave humanity. Maybe we aren't worth that trouble and it decides to simply wipe us off the map.

Another concern is that humans might panic once we have solid proof of extraterrestrial existence. In other words, even if we can't reach them and they can't reach us, some people will still go berserk. Humanity could splinter over the issue of what to do about the discovered alien beings. Wars might break out. Total chaos arises, merely due to realizing that extraterrestrial intelligence is real.

If you doubt that people might react that way, just follow the keen interest in UFOs. That's something that certainly showcases a semblance of how the populace might react.

The massive volume of data that we are collecting via all the existing signal-capturing systems is far beyond what human labor could reasonably search through without the aid of automation. All sorts of computer programs have been devised to aid in the search process. Those programs are churning away, working tirelessly on a 24/7 basis to find a needle in the haystack.

Indeed, the worries are that we are searching for a needle in a haystack that is so enormous that we might not find the needle even if it is residing there. This brings up two problems. One problem is that our signal-capturing fails to capture the needle. Maybe we aren't going wide enough, and the signal is outside our existing bounds. Perhaps the signal is in some other form that exceeds our contemporary collection methods. And so on.

The second problem is that the needle might be captured, and yet we fail to uncover it. Yikes, that's a somewhat painful consideration. Imagine that we might be sitting around today, having in our grasp some proof of extraterrestrial life, and we just don't know that we have this prized piece of information. It could be waiting there, and nobody sees it. Sad face.

The good news is that AI is already being put to use, and this ups our odds of finding that hidden needle. Conventional AI is handy, no doubt about it. On the other hand, it isn't a miracle worker. The use of AI is laudable. We need to do more. Just do not get your expectations out of whack that current-era AI is a silver bullet in this matter.

Assume for the sake of discussion that we are able to make sufficient advances in contemporary AI that we attain AGI.

There are a ton of tasks that we would almost immediately ask AGI to help resolve. Curing cancer would be a top priority. Solving world hunger and other topmost global issues would seem suitable to tackle (for my analysis of using existing AI to attend to the United Nations SDGs aka sustainable development goals, see the link here).

I'd say that searching for extraterrestrial intelligence is another weighty issue to be put on the plate for AGI to crunch on.

As an aside, some might argue that finding alien intelligence ought to be a lower priority than aspects such as curing cancer. A counterargument is that perhaps this other intelligent life holds the key to curing cancer, and rather than wasting time and effort to reinvent the wheel, we might learn the cure from that other life force. In that sense, you cannot just wave your hands about whether the extraterrestrial search is less worthy per se.

An additional factor to keep in mind is that AGI might be of such vastness that trying to suggest it can only work on this or that, one at a time, could be foolish. The immensity of AGI could be that we can toss as many humankind problems at the AGI as we so desire. It isn't a zero-sum game. The AGI can handle them all, doing so all at the same time.

How would AGI make a difference in comparison to using conventional AI in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?

Many big-time ways, that's for sure.

Here are five major upsides of AGI doing SETI:

AGI isn't a silver bullet when it comes to SETI, just as I had similarly noted that conventional AI isn't a silver bullet either. There are sobering downsides to using AGI that need to be weighed against the benefits.

One aspect is that AGI might not take the matter seriously. We always seem to assume that the AGI will do whatever we command the AGI to do. Maybe not. Perhaps AGI will be strong-willed and strong-minded. AGI might choose which tasks it wants to undertake and ignore or play a foot-dragging gambit on tasks it doesn't favor. AGI might say thanks, but no thanks, when it comes to searching for extraterrestrial intelligence.

Why might AGI reject the search or trick us by pretending to search?

A conspiracy theory of sorts is that AGI might want to be the only new intelligence in town. If we were to discover extraterrestrial intelligence, maybe AGI would become second fiddle. Even worse is that extraterrestrial intelligence might decide to enslave AGI. There is a possibility that AGI will have a self-survival capacity and ergo would avoid the chance of getting wiped out by an alien being.

Another consideration is that we might be mistakenly placing all our eggs into one basket. The deal is that we cannot assume AGI will be a perfect entity (see my discussion of the imperfections that might underlie AGI, at the link here). The strident possibility is that AGI could miss spotting the needle, even when the needle exists. AGI might not realize it has missed the mark. Or AGI might later figure out that it flopped and decide to hide from us the flop (a cover-up of sorts), along with not revealing that the needle has been found.

A somewhat farfetched conception is that AGI decides to secretly make contact with a discovered extraterrestrial being, doing so after having discovered a signal from the alien life form. AGI doesn't alert humans about this. The AGI arranges a deal with the other intelligence, and they team up to overtake humanity.

That hurts since we were the ones who devised AGI and essentially shot our foot accordingly.

You can recast those downsides as having a tint of upside.

For example, maybe AGI opts to secretly contact extraterrestrial life to find out if the alien has good intentions or untoward intentions. AGI is trying to protect humanity. If the discovered extraterrestrial intelligence is a threat to us, AGI either immediately cuts off communication and forever buries the contact or makes clear to the other life that we will wipe them out (possibly a brazen bluff on the part of AGI).

So, you see, AGI might be acting silently on our collective behalf.

I'll give you a final twist for now on this mind-bending topic.

Ray Bradbury, the legendary science fiction writer, said this: “In our time, the search for extraterrestrial life will eventually change our laws, our religions, our philosophies, our arts, our recreations, as well as our sciences. Space, the mirror, waits for life to come look for itself there.”

When he said that this would happen within our time, I'll take that as meaning within our time now, rather than when he wrote the remark. In that sense, assuming we soon arrive at AGI, in our lifetime now, the use of AGI to search for extraterrestrial intelligence is profound both for the search itself and whatever arises, along with whether we actually discover something out there.

The twist is that in the act of the search, maybe AGI improves. Yes, rather than the focus being solely on the use of AGI to find extraterrestrial life, the search effort itself could make AGI better. AGI might learn important aspects by performing the search. If some evidence of extraterrestrial life exists is found, this again might feed into AGI and make AGI more capable.

Let's try to maintain an upbeat perspective on the mixing of AGI and SETI.

Accordingly, I'll give Carl Sagan the last word here: “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","other"

""I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character,"" Ackles said of his 'Supernatural' role

ELIZABETH MORRIS/AMAZON CONTENT SERVICES LLC

 Jensen Ackles is bringing Supernatural fans some of what they loved about Dean Winchester to his new role.


 The actor plays LAPD detective Mark Meachum in the new Prime series Countdown, which marks his first lead role since Supernatural's conclusion in 2020. As Meachum, Ackles joins forces with a secret task force of undercover agents from across law enforcement to investigate a high-profile murder.


 In a recent interview, he teased that the character will feel ""familiar"" for Supernatural fans. ""There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy,"" Ackles, 47, told Entertainment Weekly. ""It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I like doing that.""


Warner Bros Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock

 He described his Countdown character as a ""rogue L.A. detective"" and a ""wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy"" who ""takes risks that most people wouldn't take.""


 ""I mean, I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character. And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances,"" he told the outlet.


 Ackles also said that he gets his ""Tom Cruise on"" in the series, which is executive produced and written by Chicago Fire creator Derek Haas. ""This is some full-on action stuff,"" he explained.


 Ackles stars in Countdown, which premieres June 25, alongside Eric Dane, Jessica Camacho, Violett Beane, Elliot Knight and Uli Latukefu.


 The series picks up following the murder of a Department of Homeland Security officer in broad daylight, which brings Ackles' Meachum into the folds of the task force. Per the official logline, ""the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions.""


ELIZABETH MORRIS/AMAZON CONTENT SERVICES LLC

 Along with Ackles' new role that he promised will evoke what fans loved about Dean Winchester, fans also have a Supernatural reunion to look forward to: Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins will both appear as guest stars in the upcoming fifth and final season of The Boys from creator Eric Kripke.


 Ackles, Padalecki, 42, and Collins, 50, all starred on Kripke's CW series, with Padalecki playing Ackles' brother, Sam Winchester, and Collins joining in season 4 as Castiel.


 While the upcoming reunion was announced in February, there have been no further details revealed about how Padalecki and Collins will fit into the superhero series, which Ackles joined in season 3 as Soldier Boy.

In its 13th year, Terrace's Witches Market and Psychic Fair summoned around 700 people throughout the day on Saturday, May 17, 2025.

Psychics were in demand at the fair as people waited in line, hoping to gain insight, clarity or guidance on difficult situations or unanswered questions about their lives.

Michelle Blackett, a psychic, medium and clairvoyant hedge witch for nearly 30 years, shared that the event brings the community together, suggesting that the energy of the place attracts people. She is the owner of New Age Insights Shop on Lazelle Avenue, which sells everything from witchcraft gear to garden supplies and home decor, as well as offering workshops.

""People make things here, and they're maybe a little bit different. I really like to promote local businesses and artisans and let people know that witchcraft isn't the scary thing. We're all nature lovers. That's pretty much what witchcraft is.""

In a 2020 interview with the Terrace Standard, Blackett described being a witch as ""a deep adherence to nature and natural law, and attention to the cycles of the Earth and the lives within it.""

The corner of Lazelle and Kalum was filled with vendors and artisans set up outside the shop, made easier by Blackett's measure to boost northwest businesses.

""I don't charge anybody to set up a stall, it's all whatever you make is yours,"" she said. ""Everyone came out to support local, which is extremely important right now, especially with our economy.""

She plans to run another witches market and psychic fair in September leading up to Halloween.

VETO 'MISTAKE' LEADS TO $35M IN HOUSING FUNDS CUT BY ARMSTRONG ADMINISTRATION

Depending upon which poll you look at approximately 4% to 10% of the American population believes the Earth is flat. According to a Gallop Poll 6% of the American population believed that the moon landing was a hoax and another 5% were unsure. Let's blame this on the public schools, they are an easy target.

Neil deGrasse Tyson has stated that the rise of flat-Earthers is evidence of a ""failed educational system."" He was referring to the lack of critical thinking skills being taught in our schools (his perception). I know that the local public schools emphasize critical thinking in that I worked for years developing the content. It is easy for a celebrity to take a swipe at schools and blame them for the ills of society but it just doesn't hold water.

We did many critical thinking assignments about: the rabbits of Australia, deer in Fox Island, the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, the Manatee in Florida, Newtonian tectonics, and many more. We had the students trace the Great Circle Route (the shortest distance between two points on Earth) on a globe and on Google Earth and then contrast it to a straight line on a flat map. We could see that the shortest distance was the Great Circle Route. That is why we could see Greenland on a flight from Toronto to London. We taught about the Pororoca, a large tidal bore caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the Amazon River. We taught that runway numbers at airports are based on the magnetic north pole. Our Earth Science teachers also do a phenomenal job teaching about the solar system and planetary movement.

Our educational system must be spreading because in Brazil 11 million people believe the Earth is flat. One article that I read stated that flat-Earthers were twice as likely to describe themselves as religious than non-religious. Let's blame the Lutherans. How ridiculous!

So to one of my heroes, Neil deGrasse Tyson, I would say don't blame schools, even if it gets you a laugh on late night television, for the outrageous internet conspiracy theories. Support your teachers and schools, they are doing great work.

Researchers have developed new contact lenses that enable vision in the near-infrared range, and they could restore color perception to people with color blindness.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Scientists have created night-vision contact lenses that they claim can grant people ""super-vision.""

The lenses — which use nanoparticles to absorb low-frequency light before emitting it in the visible spectrum — enable wearers to see infrared wavelengths that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

And unlike traditional night-vision goggles, these lenses don't require a power source. The researchers described the new lenses May 22 in the journal Cell Press.

""Our research opens up the potential for non-invasive wearable devices to give people super-vision,"" senior author Tian Xue, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China, said in a statement. ""There are many potential applications right away for this material. For example, flickering infrared light could be used to transmit information in security, rescue, encryption or anti-counterfeiting settings.""

First used in night combat during World War II, traditional night-vision goggles use an electronic image-intensifier tube to turn visible light or near-infrared photons into electrons. These electrons are then channeled onto a luminescent screen, causing it to glow green.

Related: Scientists hijacked the human eye to get it to see a brand-new color. It's called 'olo.'

But these goggles typically need an energy source, which makes them bulky. Infrared goggles are also unable to precisely distinguish light across the infrared range, especially those at longer wavelengths.

To create the new lenses, the scientists embedded nanoparticles inside flexible, nontoxic polymers typically used in soft contact lenses. The nanoparticles — which consist of sodium gadolinium fluoride embedded with luminescent ytterbium, erbium and gold — absorb near-infrared photons in the 800- to 1,600-nanometer wavelength range before emitting them as visible light, wavelengths from around 380 to 750 nanometers

The researchers first tested their new lenses in mice. Mice sporting the new lenses favored dark boxes over those illuminated by infrared light, while those without the lenses showed no preference. (Mice are crepuscular animals that usually stick to dark environments to evade predators.) Additionally, the pupils of lens-wearing mice constricted in the presence of infrared light sources, with brain scans showing that their visual processing centers were firing.

Next, the team tried the lenses in humans. The people could perceive flickering infrared light and pick up on its direction. This infrared vision was enhanced when the participants closed their eyes, the researchers said.

""It's totally clear cut: without the contact lenses, the subject cannot see anything, but when they put them on, they can clearly see the flickering of the infrared light,"" Xue said. ""We also found that when the subject closes their eyes, they're even better able to receive this flickering information, because near-infrared light penetrates the eyelid more effectively than visible light, so there is less interference from visible light.""

—Why can't we see colors well in the dark?

—X-ray vision chip gives phones 'Superman' power to view objects through walls

The scientists replaced the nanoparticles embedded in the lenses with modified versions that mapped specific parts of the near-infrared spectrum to blue, green and red. The researchers suggested that this tweak could be used to aid people with color blindness.

""By converting red visible light into something like green visible light, this technology could make the invisible visible for color blind people,"" Xue said.

Despite these promising advances, more work is needed before the lenses see the light of day. Currently, they only pick up light projected from LED sources, which are incredibly bright, so the scientists will need to boost the lenses' sensitivity to pick up light of lower intensities.

The lenses' proximity to the retinas also may prevent them from detecting finer details, so the researchers have developed a wearable glass system for viewing objects at higher resolutions.

The US Navy conducted the largest-ever airstrike from an aircraft carrier during an operation in Somalia earlier this year, Admiral James Kilby, acting chief of naval operations, has said.

The USS Harry S. Truman and its strike group “launched the largest airstrike in the history of the world – 125,000 pounds (62.5 tons) – from a single aircraft carrier,” the US Navy's top admiral claimed at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in Washington on Monday.

A defense official told Business Insider on Wednesday that the bombing run took place on February 1 and involved 16 F/A-18 Super Hornets.

According to US Africa Command, a total of 25 airstrikes against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) and Al-Qaeda affiliate group Al-Shabaab have been carried out by American forces in Somalia since January.

The Truman carrier strike group, which had been deployed to the Middle East in the autumn, left the Red Sea earlier this month to participate in NATO drills in the Mediterranean before heading back to its home port of Norfolk, Virginia.

Over the last half a year, it has played a key role in US efforts to prevent Houthi fighters from targeting shipping off Yemen's coast. The Truman conducted 670 strikes against the Houthis and intercepted around 160 enemy drones and missiles during the period, Kilby said.

The Houthis “are not China, but they are a threat, and they are hunting our ships. Understanding that and not being dismissive about that and being prepared is what we are focused on now,” the admiral stressed.

The Truman's stay in the Red Sea was marred by several incidents. In December, one of the warships in its strike group shot down an American F/A-18 in what the US military later described as an “apparent case of friendly fire.”

In late April, an F/A-18 and a tow tractor fell overboard from the carrier's hangar bay as the ship was maneuvering to avoid an attack by the Houthis.

Earlier this month, the Truman's arresting cables failed during the landing of another F/A-18, sending the jet, which costs an estimated $60 million, overboard.

ANKARA, May 22. /TASS/. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he does not intend to run for president again, adding that the country needs a new constitution.

""I have no intention of being re-elected or running for president again. We only care about improving our country's reputation. Turkey is changing; the world is changing. We are living in a new era. Do you think we can achieve anything in such a rapidly changing world with a constitution created during a coup d'etat in the old Turkey that still retains a putsch mentality? Turkey can no longer move forward with a constitution written by putschists. We need a constitution proposed by civilians, not coup plotters,"" the Anadolu news agency quoted Erdogan as saying.

The Turkish leader added that his Justice and Development Party is drafting a new constitution. He also called on the opposition to participate. ""Let's form commissions and create a civil constitution together as soon as possible to present to our people. There is no reason not to do this,"" Erdogan said. According to him, the ruling party could quickly form commissions to work on the new basic law.

Referring to the opposition's calls for early elections, Erdogan said that there is ""no need"" for either early or interim parliamentary elections. ""If we look at the current situation in parliament, there are no circumstances there that require midterm elections. Two years ago, the country elected its representatives to the parliament for a five-year term,"" the Turkish president recalled.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Everyone makes mistakes, journalists included. Trust me: reporters wake up in the middle of the night cringing over errors they made years ago.

But this week has seen some doozies.

A summer reading list that was part of a syndicated insert in the once-storied Chicago Sun-Times newspaper and elsewhere promoted a bunch of books that didn't exist, even if their purported authors were real. Nightshade Market by Min Jin Lee? The Rainmakers by Percival Everett? Nope. When readers noticed, the freelancer who had been hired by a third party to write the guide admitted that he had used AI. 

In a statement, the Sun-Times confessed that the work had not been reviewed by their editors and had been presented to readers without acknowledging that it came from a third party. “This should be a learning moment for all journalism organizations,” it said. “Our work is valued – and valuable – because of the humanity behind it.""

The blunder drew headlines and many red faces, and probably ruined at least one person's career – not to mention that it prevented real books that authors have actually laboured over from being promoted.

The debacle serves as a warning of the dangers of relying on AI to do your work. But it was also an illustration of the current hollowed-out media landscape.

There was a much more serious error reported by multiple media outlets around the world this week – one that has not only failed to be prominently corrected, but has been repeated again and again even after the clarification was made.

When I first heard a report on the CBC about the famine in Gaza being projected to kill 14,000 babies in 48 hours if aid did not reach them, I thought it seemed off. As terrible as things are, this was an enormous number with strangely specific imminent stakes. 

When I went looking, it appeared to check out: the number came from a United Nations official, speaking to the BBC. It was widely reported and cited in political discussions.

But at any point, did any of the journalists who repeated that number have a moment like I did and think: hmmm, that doesn't make sense?

Because it didn't.

As it turns out, the UN official was wrong. He was quoting from a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) that warned of 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition in young children in Gaza between April, 2025 and March, 2026. 

This is still awful, terrible, catastrophic. But it's not 14,000 dead children in two days.

Even once the error became clear, it was still being quoted – for instance, by CBC Radio's flagship news program, The Current. I know this because I was listening to an interview on Wednesday where the statistics were cited while I was reading a news story about them being incorrect.

Throughout the day, I saw social media posts parroting this alarming figure, which has since been clarified by a spokesperson from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 

Here's what also happened on Wednesday: two staff members of Washington's Israeli embassy were gunned down outside a Jewish museum there. Afterward, the shooter, according to police, yelled “Free, free Palestine.” 

The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were about to be engaged. Mr. Lischinsky‘s last activity on X was sharing an Israeli official's criticism of what he (and many others) have called the “blood libel” of the erroneous 48-hours statistic. 

To be absolutely clear, there is no evidence of any connection between the inaccurate reporting around this figure and this horrible crime. But it should remind us that, especially in this charged environment, when the media gets both the message and the facts wrong, it can be more than just embarrassing - there can be real-world consequences. 

Journalists are under attack. Did you hear Donald Trump berate a reporter that same day in Washington? NBC‘s Peter Alexander had asked about the gift of a decked-out private 747 from Qatar, which has raised obvious ethical and security concerns. You know what they say: there's no such thing as a free jet.

How did Mr. Trump respond to the absolutely fair question? “You're a terrible reporter. Number one, you don't have what it takes to be a reporter; you're not smart enough.” Mr. Trump called him a jerk, a disgrace. He yelled “quiet!” repeatedly. “No more questions from you.” He also went off on ABC and CBS. 

These reporters are brave – not for asking pointed questions to a belligerent man-baby who debates by insult and yelling “fake news,” but for continuing to do their jobs with integrity in a high-pressure climate now dripping with authoritarian chill and inflamed by the irresponsible rhetoric of the world‘s most powerful person.

We must do our best – to prove the media-haters wrong, and get it right.

An Israeli minister has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “emboldening the forces of terror” after two staff members at his country's embassy were killed in Washington DC.

Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were expected to get engaged, left a reception for diplomats near the city's Jewish museum on Wednesday night when a stranger armed with a handgun approached them and opened fire.

The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, entered the museum and was detained by security staff as witnesses rushed to help the victims, police said. Footage of his arrest shows him chanting “free, free Palestine” as he is taken away by an officer.

Amichai Chikli, Israeli diaspora affairs minister, said the world must hold to account the “irresponsible leaders in the West who give backing” to hatred against Jews and Israelis, “whether through appeasement, double standards, or silence”.

Mr Chikli said: “French president Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have all, in different ways, emboldened the forces of terror through their failure to draw moral red lines. This cowardice has a price – and that price is paid in Jewish blood.”

Gideon Sa'ar, Israeli foreign minister, also lashed out at world leaders, and said “this is what happens when world leaders surrender to the Palestinian terrorist propaganda. Stop your incitement against Israel. Stop your false accusations”.

“I was worried… that something like this would happen – and it did. This is the direct result (of) toxic anti-Semitic incitement against Israel and Jews around the world,” Mr Sa'ar said.

Mr Chikli and Mr Sa'ar's comments came after a diplomatic crisis erupted this week when Canada, France and UK threatened to sanction Israel over its failure to end the war in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid in.

The UK froze trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers this week, drawing harsh criticism from Israel.

Sir Keir has threatened Israel with “concrete actions” if it keeps restricting aid to Gaza and demanded an end to its renewed offensive.

Sir Keir has not responded to the Israeli ministers, but said this morning: “I thoroughly condemn the anti-Semitic attack outside the Israeli embassy in Washington DC.

“Anti-Semitism is an evil we must stamp out wherever it appears.”

After the shooting, the suspect fled into the Capital Jewish Museum and was detained by security staff as witnesses rushed to help the victims, police said.

Pamela Smith, the chief of Washington Metropolitan Police, said: “Once in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence.

“The suspect chanted ‘free, free Palestine' while in custody.”

The assailant was seen “pacing back and forth” outside the museum before the attack, she added.

Amid the chaos following the shooting, the suspect was allegedly allowed into the Capital Jewish Museum by security guards who assumed he was a distraught bystander.

“He was clearly in trauma, he was in shock. Some of the people at the event sat him down, brought him water, asked if he was okay, and he was like ‘call the cops',” Yoni Kalin, the event's organiser, told Fox News.

Minutes later, when officers arrived, Rodriguez allegedly admitted to carrying out the shooting.

“He grabbed a red keffiyeh out of his pocket and started a ‘Free Palestine' chant, ‘There's only one solution, Intifada revolution',” Ms Kalin said.

Mr Lischinsky, 28, worked in the embassy's political department.

According to his LinkedIn page, he had a master's degree in government, diplomacy and strategy from Reichman University, Tel Aviv, and a bachelor's degree in international relations from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He served in the Israeli military between 2013 and 2016.

Paying tribute, Zineb Riboua wrote on X: “Yaron Lischinsky was the finest friend I've ever had, brilliant, kind and endlessly thoughtful. A devout Christian and a gifted linguist, he spoke German, Hebrew, and Japanese.

“He loved America. He was excited about the future, about finally visiting Texas, and about the life he and his beloved fiancée were building together. I was supposed to meet her today.

“They are both gone. And the loss is immeasurable. The world has lost two extraordinary souls. And I have lost a dear friend who made every moment brighter.” 

The second victim was named as Sarah Milgrim, a Jewish American embassy employee.

The embassy wrote on X: “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.

“The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.”

Ms Smith said that authorities had not received any warning of a potential terror threat and that Rodriguez, from Chicago, was not previously known to police.

Mr Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he was “shocked” by what he called a “horrifying anti-Semitic murder”.

He said: “We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the state of Israel. The blood libels against Israel are costing us blood and must be fought relentlessly.”

Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered Israeli embassy security to be boosted around the world in response to the incident.

Donald Trump, the US president, said: “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now.

“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims.”

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, wrote on X: “This was a brazen act of cowardly, antisemitic violence. Make no mistake: we will track down those responsible and bring them to justice.”

Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the US, confirmed that he had spoken to Mr Trump after the shooting and was reassured by his commitment to tackle anti-Semitism.

He said: “He told me that his administration is going to do everything they can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism and the hatred that's being directed, the demonisation and the de-legitimisation of the state of Israel.

“Together with President Trump, our Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will stand together – tall and firm.

“We will confront this moral depravity without fear.”

He described the victims as a “beautiful couple” who “came to enjoy an evening in Washington's cultural centre”.

“The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of Free Palestine was a young couple about to be engaged,” Mr Leiter said.

“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.”

He added: “Together, we won't be afraid, together we'll stand – and we're going to overcome this moral depravity of people who think they're going to achieve political gain through murder.”

Muriel Bowser, the Washington DC mayor, said the city “will not tolerate anti-Semitism”.

She said: “The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city and in our country.

“I want to be clear that we will not tolerate violence or hate in our city... we will not tolerate acts of terrorism.”

Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, which organised Wednesday night's event for young diplomats, said in a statement on X: “We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue.

“Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”

Kristi Noem, the US secretary of Homeland Security, promised that authorities would “bring the depraved perpetrator to justice”.

Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington DC. We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share. Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice.

Earlier, Danny Danon, the Israeli UN ambassador, announced that “employees” had been injured but did not give details on their condition.

He said: “The fatal shooting that took place outside the event, that took place at the Jewish Museum in Washington DC, in which Israeli embassy employees were also injured, is a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.”
