Almost all of those interviewed for the report said officials ignored their repeated attempts to request asylum.

Dozens of non-Costa Rican nationals who were deported to Costa Rica by the Trump administration in February say they did not receive an asylum screening interview before being expelled, according to a report released by Human Rights Watch on Thursday.

The report alleges that the U.S. government did not follow the “minimal, if deficient” protections around the right to seek asylum and the right not be returned to harm, and kept those expelled in “inhumane conditions” while they were detained in the United States.

The report explores one instance of the Trump administration expelling migrants to a country besides their country of origin, a tactic the administration has repeatedly reached for as part of its immigration crackdown.

In the report, Human Rights Watch calls on the U.S. government to stop expelling or transferring noncitizens to third countries.

In February, Costa Rica received two flights with 200 deportees, including 81 children, from the U.S. as part of an expulsion agreement, the details of which have not been disclosed, according to the report.

“I genuinely think the [U.S.] authorities treated us so poorly, held us in those horrendous, degrading conditions, to force us to sign those volunteer deportation papers as fast as possible and maybe also to tell others, so that people would be scared to seek asylum, to come to the U.S.,” said one 33-year old woman from Russia who was deported to Costa Rica.

In some cases, U.S. officials separated families when carrying out the expulsions to Costa Rica. In one instance, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sent an Iranian man and his daughter to Costa Rica but kept the girl's stepmother in the U.S., according to the report.

The United States expelled 200 third-country nationals, including 81 children, to Costa Rica on two flights at the end of February 2025.They were fleeing war, persecution, or other serious threats. In a new report, HRW documents the US expulsions: https://t.co/M5Jd088Sxq pic.twitter.com/AAYo2wUqFB

Human Rights Watch interviewed dozens of the migrants sent to Costa Rica and heard stories from those people that, “if true, indicate that people fled persecution based on factors such as ethnicity, religion, gender, family associations, and political opinion.”

U.S. law guarantees the right to apply for asylum, and while many of those who spoke to Human Rights Watch appeared to have strong claims, only two out of 36 people interviewed by the group had a screening interview for asylum in the U.S. before being deported to Costa Rica. Almost all of the 36 people said U.S. officials ignored their repeated attempts to request asylum, per the report.

Some of the people whom Human Rights Watch spoke to had been in Mexico and made appointments to present themselves at a U.S. point of entry to seek asylum through an application developed by CBP, CBP One. When the Trump administration canceled all pending appointments through CBP One, some went to U.S. checkpoints to request asylum, while others crossed irregularly, such as by climbing over or through gaps in the border wall and then sought out or “waited for” U.S. border agents, according to the report.

Once apprehended, those who spoke to Human Rights Watch reported conditions such as freezing temperatures, little access to showers, and families being separated while being held at immigration processing centers.

“In every case documented by Human Rights Watch, DHS expelled people to Costa Rica without following the deportation processes set forth in U.S. law — not even the streamlined process known as ‘expedited removal,'” according to the report, referencing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. “Instead, acting under the purported authority of a presidential proclamation, DHS agents sent people to Costa Rica, a country of which they are not nationals and to which they had no intention of traveling.”

“These summary expulsions violated the right to seek asylum and the right to a fair hearing and other due process protections prior to deportation, in violation of statutory and constitutional guarantees and international treaties ratified by the United States,” the report states.

The people interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported that they were not given the necessary documents required to be issued during a deportation proceeding. They reported being taken to an airfield and given no explanation until they were about to board the plane to Costa Rica.

Human Rights Watch says those deported were then initially subject to arbitrary detention in Costa Rica, and in practice they were not allowed to freely leave the center where they were being held except under certain circumstances. The Costa Rican government says they were not “detained” and indicated instead that freedom of movement was limited for their own safety, according to the report.

In April, officials in Costa Rica told them they could obtain a humanitarian permit that would give them 90 days to apply for asylum in Costa Rica or leave the country.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Truthout is appealing for your support to weather this storm of censorship. Our critical fundraising campaign ends at midnight, and we still need to find 180 new monthly donors before the deadline. Will you be one?

As independent media with no corporate backing or billionaire ownership, Truthout is uniquely able to push back against the right-wing narrative and expose the shocking extent of political repression under the new McCarthyism. We're committed to doing this work, but we're also deeply vulnerable to Trump's attacks.

Your support during our fundraiser (just a few hours left!) will help us continue our nonprofit movement journalism in the face of right-wing authoritarianism. Please make a tax-deductible donation today.

US politics live – latest updates

The Trump administration has said it is halting Harvard University's ability to enroll international students and has ordered existing international students at the university to transfer or lose their legal status.

On Thursday, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration notified Harvard about its decision following ongoing correspondence regarding the “legality of a sprawling records request”, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The records request comes as part of an investigation by the homeland security department in which federal officials are threatening the university's international student admissions.

The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted a copy of the letter on X, formerly known as Twitter. In it Noem said: “I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked.”

“The revocation of your Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification means that Harvard is prohibited from having any aliens on F- or J-nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic school year. This decertification also means that existing aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status must transfer to another university in order to maintain their nonimmigrant status,” Noem continued.

Noem justified the decision by saying: “This action should not surprise you and is the unfortunate result of Harvard's failure to comply with simple reporting requirements … Consequences must follow to send a clear signal to Harvard and all universities that want to enjoy the privilege of enrolling foreign students, that the Trump administration will enforce the law and root out the evils of anti-Americanism and antisemitism in society and campuses.”

The former governor of South Dakota also accused Harvard of “fostering violence, antisemitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist party on its campus”.

In a separate press release, the homeland security department said: “Secretary Noem is following through on her promise to protect students and prohibit terrorist sympathizers from receiving benefits from the US government.”

A Harvard spokesperson called the government's action “unlawful” in a statement to the Guardian on Thursday.

“We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university – and this nation – immeasurably,” the spokesperson said.

“We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.”

Leo Gerdén, an international student from Sweden, called the announcement “devastating” in the university newspaper Harvard Crimson.

“Every tool available they should use to try and change this. It could be all the legal resources suing the Trump administration, whatever they can use the endowment to, whatever they can use their political network in Congress,” Gerdén said, adding: “This should be, by far, priority number one.”

The university currently hosts nearly 6,800 international students, with many being on F-1 or J-1 visas, according to university records. International students make up about 27% of the university's population.

The latest decision from the homeland security department comes amid growing tensions between federal officials and Harvard over the Trump administration's claims that the university has implemented inadequate responses to antisemitism on its campus.

The Trump administration terminated a further $450m in grants to the university in May, following an earlier cancellation of $2.2bn in federal funding.

A Trump-appointed antisemitism taskforce has pointed to “just how radical Harvard has become” as nationwide anti-war protesters – including students – demonstrated against Israel's deadly onslaught on Gaza, which has killed at least 53,000 Palestinians in the last year and a half.

The Trump administration has also ordered the university to dismantle its diversity, equity and inclusion programming, restrict student protests, and disclose admission details to federal officials.

In response to the federal cuts, the university – with an endowment of more than $53bn – filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

Harvard's president, Alan Garber, said in April that “no government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue”.

Garber also said: “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights … The administration's prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard's first amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government's authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production and dissemination of knowledge.”

            Russian armed forces are creating a “security buffer zone” along the border between Russia and Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.
    


            “I have already said that a decision was made to create the necessary security buffer zone along the border. Our armed forces are currently solving this problem. Enemy firing points are being actively suppressed, the work is underway,” Putin said.
    


            Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said the plan was “aggressive” and demonstrated that “Russia is the obstacle of peace efforts now.”

Ukraine, Russia say drone strikes continue after Trump-Putin call



            Thursday's announcement was made ahead of an expected prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia on Friday – an outcome of last week's face-to-face talks in Turkey, the first time the two countries have held direct talks at any level in three years.
    


            The Russian president previously raised the possibility of creating a “buffer zone” in March during a visit to Russia's Kursk region. He doubled down on the border plan during a meeting on Thursday with members of the government, during which he discussed the need to “restore and rebuild everything that was destroyed” in the border region.
    


            “(We must) help people return to their native villages, settlements, (and) where security conditions allow, restore all transport and other infrastructure,” Putin added.
    


            The Russian leader is planning on hosting a dedicated meeting to discuss the “restoration” projects, Russian state media reported on Thursday.
    


            The announcement comes days after Putin visited Russia's Kursk region for the first time since claiming to have completely retaken the region from Ukrainian forces, state media reported on Wednesday.
    


            Twelve civilians – including two children – were injured in a Ukrainian strike on the town of Lgov in Kursk, the region's acting governor said Thursday. According to an initial assessment, four vehicles, two houses and one apartment building were also damaged in the “massive” strike, the official said.
    


            The Russian leader discussed the new buffer zone with municipal officials during his visit to the region, according to a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, published Wednesday.
    


            The report claims that Putin was asked by a local official to create the buffer zone in Sumy region, to which Putin asked how many kilometers deep the zone should be.
    


            Putin also said during his visit that Ukrainian forces were trying to move toward the Russian border, according to RIA Novosti news agency.

            Kyiv launched its offensive into the Russian border territory last August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – and had held control of parts of the region until late last month. Kyiv had intended on using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks.
    


            Such dialogue did not materialize until last week, when teams from Kyiv and Moscow met in person in Turkey to begin discussing an end to the war and agreed upon a prisoner exchange – 1,000 people from each side.
    


            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia had received Ukraine's proposed list of prisoners of war to be exchanged in Friday's expected swap, according to Russian state media.
    


            “Yes, indeed, we have received it now,” Peskov was reported as saying when asked about the Ukrainian list.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X Thursday that Ukraine is “clarifying the details for each individual included on the lists submitted by the Russian side.”
    


            “The agreement to release 1,000 of our people from Russian captivity was perhaps the only tangible result of the meeting in Türkiye. We are working to ensure that this result is achieved,” Zelensky posted.

Everyone makes mistakes, journalists included. Trust me: reporters wake up in the middle of the night cringing over errors they made years ago.

But this week has seen some doozies.

A summer reading list that was part of a syndicated insert in the once-storied Chicago Sun-Times newspaper and elsewhere promoted a bunch of books that didn't exist, even if their purported authors were real. Nightshade Market by Min Jin Lee? The Rainmakers by Percival Everett? Nope. When readers noticed, the freelancer who had been hired by a third party to write the guide admitted that he had used AI. 

In a statement, the Sun-Times confessed that the work had not been reviewed by their editors and had been presented to readers without acknowledging that it came from a third party. “This should be a learning moment for all journalism organizations,” it said. “Our work is valued – and valuable – because of the humanity behind it."

The blunder drew headlines and many red faces, and probably ruined at least one person's career – not to mention that it prevented real books that authors have actually laboured over from being promoted.

The debacle serves as a warning of the dangers of relying on AI to do your work. But it was also an illustration of the current hollowed-out media landscape.

There was a much more serious error reported by multiple media outlets around the world this week – one that has not only failed to be prominently corrected, but has been repeated again and again even after the clarification was made.

When I first heard a report on the CBC about the famine in Gaza being projected to kill 14,000 babies in 48 hours if aid did not reach them, I thought it seemed off. As terrible as things are, this was an enormous number with strangely specific imminent stakes. 

When I went looking, it appeared to check out: the number came from a United Nations official, speaking to the BBC. It was widely reported and cited in political discussions.

But at any point, did any of the journalists who repeated that number have a moment like I did and think: hmmm, that doesn't make sense?

Because it didn't.

As it turns out, the UN official was wrong. He was quoting from a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) that warned of 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition in young children in Gaza between April, 2025 and March, 2026. 

This is still awful, terrible, catastrophic. But it's not 14,000 dead children in two days.

Even once the error became clear, it was still being quoted – for instance, by CBC Radio's flagship news program, The Current. I know this because I was listening to an interview on Wednesday where the statistics were cited while I was reading a news story about them being incorrect.

Throughout the day, I saw social media posts parroting this alarming figure, which has since been clarified by a spokesperson from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 

Here's what also happened on Wednesday: two staff members of Washington's Israeli embassy were gunned down outside a Jewish museum there. Afterward, the shooter, according to police, yelled “Free, free Palestine.” 

The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were about to be engaged. Mr. Lischinsky‘s last activity on X was sharing an Israeli official's criticism of what he (and many others) have called the “blood libel” of the erroneous 48-hours statistic. 

To be absolutely clear, there is no evidence of any connection between the inaccurate reporting around this figure and this horrible crime. But it should remind us that, especially in this charged environment, when the media gets both the message and the facts wrong, it can be more than just embarrassing - there can be real-world consequences. 

Journalists are under attack. Did you hear Donald Trump berate a reporter that same day in Washington? NBC‘s Peter Alexander had asked about the gift of a decked-out private 747 from Qatar, which has raised obvious ethical and security concerns. You know what they say: there's no such thing as a free jet.

How did Mr. Trump respond to the absolutely fair question? “You're a terrible reporter. Number one, you don't have what it takes to be a reporter; you're not smart enough.” Mr. Trump called him a jerk, a disgrace. He yelled “quiet!” repeatedly. “No more questions from you.” He also went off on ABC and CBS. 

These reporters are brave – not for asking pointed questions to a belligerent man-baby who debates by insult and yelling “fake news,” but for continuing to do their jobs with integrity in a high-pressure climate now dripping with authoritarian chill and inflamed by the irresponsible rhetoric of the world‘s most powerful person.

We must do our best – to prove the media-haters wrong, and get it right.

White House press secretary says Trump is ‘saddened and outraged' by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC

Suspect's home raided after shooting of Israeli embassy staff

Lawmakers condemn antisemitism after DC shooting

Explained: what we know so far

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, is briefing the media now She starts by saying Donald Trump is “saddened and outraged” by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC last night.

She adds:

The department of justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator of this to the full extent of the law.

In a preview of coming events, Leavitt looks ahead to Trump's birthday, which coincides with the US army turning 250. She says:

The president will further honour our military on June 14, when he hosts the 250th anniversary of the United States Army with a grand military parade.
  President Trump will be joined by veterans, active-duty troops, wounded warriors, Gold Star families and patriotic Americans from across the country.

Trump will attend the G20 summit in Canada from 15 to 17 June, Leavitt confirms.

Leavitt says “hatred has no place in the United States”.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), the US's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has condemned political violence as “completely unacceptable” after a deadly attack on Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC, and said that the crime does not reflect or represent the millions of Americans peacefully advocating for an end to US support for the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza.

In a statement, Cair said:

We condemn last night's deadly attack on Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC.

While millions of Americans feel extreme frustration at the sight of the Israeli government slaughtering Palestinian men, women and children on a daily basis with weapons paid for with our taxpayer dollars, political violence is an unacceptable crime and is not the answer.

Such violence only undermines the pursuit of justice. Peaceful protest, civil disobedience and political engagement are the only appropriate and acceptable tools to advocate for policy change in our nation, including an end to US support for the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza.

Yechiel Leiter, a hardline supporter of Israel's war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank, also told reporters:

Israel has a right to exist that goes back over 3,000 years, long before there was anything called Palestine as a geographic location. There was Israel, the people of Israel and the land of Israel.

We've come home, we plan to stay there, and we're not going to be intimidated by the violence of those screaming on behalf of Palestine.

For the uninitiated, here's more about Leiter from my colleague Andrew Roth:

The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, is speaking to reporters near the scene of the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers last night in Washington DC.

He says Donald Trump just spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu.

He repeats the claim that there has been a wave of violent antisemitism across US university campuses.

Leiter claims last night's shooting was “done in the name of a political agenda to eradicate the state of Israel”.

He says it is part of a war “to demonise, delegitimize, eradicate the right of the state of Israel to exist”.

A Republican push to dismantle clean energy incentives threatens to reverberate across the US by costing more than 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households and threatening to unleash millions more tonnes of the planet-heating pollution that is causing the climate crisis, experts have warned.

A major tax bill moving through the Republican-held House of Representatives will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US.

Under the reconciliation bill, tax credits for cleaner cars will end this year, with incentives for wind, solar and even nuclear energy projects scaled down and then eliminated by 2032. Clean energy manufacturing tax credits will be axed by 2031, while Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances will get no further subsidy after the end of this year.

“This bill is worse than what people envisioned – it pulls the rug out from facilities banking on these incentives, it raises everyday household costs by hundreds of dollars and undercuts any sort of action on climate change,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan climate policy thinktank.

“You can't overstate how significant this will be in weakening the US's position. With inflation, tariffs and rising electricity use, it really couldn't come at a worse time. It's a really damaging bill.”

Facing a barrage of false claims from Donald Trump that white people were being persecuted in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa remained composed, pushed back politely and even tried to joke with Trump, earning him praise back home, reports Reuters.

Ramaphosa may have drawn on his experience as the African National Congress's lead negotiator in talks that led to the peaceful end of apartheid in 1994 during yesterday's chaotic televised confrontation, in which he managed to avoid a Zelenskyy-level bust-up in the Oval Office. The ANC said of the South African president:

His conduct was in keeping with the proud diplomatic tradition of President Nelson Mandela.

Repeatedly interrupted by Trump, Ramaphosa calmly challenged claims that minority Afrikaners were the targets of a “white genocide”, the once fringe theory has been exponentially amplified by Trump and his South African-born ally Elon Musk.

The way he handled Trump's onslaught was mostly drawing praise back home on Thursday. Author Pieter du Toit said:

President Ramaphosa did well to maintain a calm demeanour and he did well to stick to the facts as close as possible.

Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said Ramaphosa kept sight of the bigger picture and did not take the bait.

There was never a sense of arrogance on the side of Ramaphosa. He managed his emotions in a tactful way.

Ramaphosa's extensive network was evident in the Oval Office, where he was accompanied by luxury goods billionaire Johann Rupert, South Africa's richest man, and by champion golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen. “It was pragmatic of him to bring the golfers and Rupert, they are the sort of people Trump likes to speak with,” said Mathekga.

That pragmatism extended to inviting the three men and agriculture minister John Steenhuisen, all of whom are white, to address Trump, who listened to them without interrupting - in contrast to how he treated Ramaphosa.

At the start of the meeting, Ramaphosa complimented Trump on his changes to the Oval Office decor, offered him a 14-kg book on South African golf courses and joked about having worked on his own golf so he could take on Trump, who loves the sport.

Even after Trump began his attacks and played a video that falsely purported to show thousands of graves of white farmers in South Africa and flipped through printouts of news stories he claimed were of white people killed in the country, Ramaphosa tried to defuse tensions with humour.

With Trump raging at a reporter for asking about a luxury jet he has accepted as a gift from Qatar, Ramaphosa interjected: “I am sorry I don't have a plane to give you.” Trump appeared unamused. “I wish you did,” he said, before resuming his attacks.

Mahmoud Khalil, the detained Palestinian activist, was allowed to hold his one-month-old son for the first time after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's efforts to keep the father and infant separated by a plexiglass divider, reports the Associated Press.

The visit today came ahead of a scheduled immigration hearing for Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Columbia University graduate who has been held in a Louisiana jail since 8 March.

His request to attend his son's 21 April birth was denied last month by Ice. The Trump administration then aimed to block Khalil from a “contact visit”, only permitting him to meet with his wife and son from behind a barrier. The government claimed that allowing the trio to meet in the same room could present a security risk.

After days of legal fighting, triggering claims by Khalil's attorneys that he is being subject to political retaliation by the government, a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz, intervened last night, allowing the meeting to go forward on Thursday morning.

Farbiarz is currently considering Khalil's petition for release as he appeals a Louisiana immigration judge's ruling that he can be deported from the country.

Federal authorities have not accused Khalil of a crime, but have sought to deport him on the basis that his prominent role in protests against Israel's war in Gaza may have “undermined US foreign policy interests”.

Khalil is scheduled to appear before that immigration judge, Jamee Comans, for a routine hearing later today. His attorneys said it was unclear whether the baby would be permitted to attend the hearing.

Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, co-founder of the Mizrahi Family Charitable Fund and friend and colleague of Sarah Milgrim, one of the two Israeli embassy staffers shot dead last night in Washington DC, says she has a “broken heart” in a tribute she wrote to Milgram published in the Times of Israel.

Sarah was a young, passionate, and brilliant environmental advocate. She worked on climate and sustainability issues at the Embassy of Israel in Washington, DC, and was deeply committed to building a more peaceful and sustainable world.

Just eight days ago, I spoke with her about an upcoming climate initiative. She was full of energy and optimism. Recently, I attended an Earth Day event she co-organized, which featured Israeli environmental nonprofit leaders. Her leadership shone through – bright, compassionate, and determined.

She added that Milgrim “truly embodied the Jewish value of tikkun olam – repairing the world. Her loss is devastating not only to her family and friends but to the entire global environmental and Jewish communities.”

In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that his “Big, Beautiful Bill … is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!” after the bill's passage in the House.

The president wrote that the bill “includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for the Golden Dome.”

He added that the “Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination”.

The American Osteopathic Association said it was “shocked and saddened” over the deaths of two Israeli embassy staff members. The suspect in the shooting, Elias Rodriguez, was an employee of the American Osteopathic Information Association, the statement said.

“We were shocked and saddened to learn that an AOIA employee has been arrested as a suspect in this horrific crime,” the statement reads. “Both the AOIA and AOA stand ready to cooperate with the investigation in any way we can. As a physician organization dedicated to protecting the health and sanctity of human life, we believe in the rights of all persons to live safely without fear of violence.”

A federal judge has blocked Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs.

US district judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump's goal to dismantle the department.

The injunction was requested in a lawsuit filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts and the American Federation of Teachers, along with other education groups.

The groups argued that the layoffs amounted to an illegal shutdown of the education department. They said it left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including supporting special education, distributing financial aid and enforcing civil rights laws.

FBI agents were present this morning at the Chicago apartment where Elias Rodriguez, the man whom authorities suspect of shooting and killing two Israeli Embassy workers, reportedly lived, the New York Times reported.

Agents blocked the sidewalk in front of the apartment building, and some were seen going in and out of the apartment, including two agents in full tactical gear. Bomb technicians were also reportedly present at the scene.

The Times reports that in the window of the apartment where Rodriguez lived were two signs related to Palestine. One sign read “Justice for Wadea,” a reference to the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy killed in Chicago two years ago. Another sign read “Tikkun Olam means free Palestine.” (Tikkun Olam is a Hebrew phrase that means “repairing the world.”)

The Israeli leader endorsed Trump's plan for the forced displacement of all Palestinians from Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israel will not end its genocide in Gaza until it achieves its goal of the total forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, as outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump in his “Riviera” plan that experts say would violate international law.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Netanyahu said that the goal of the current offensive is for Israel to control “all” of Gaza, and for the region to be demilitarized. He said that the only way Israel will end its assault is if Palestinians in Gaza are totally disarmed and Trump's plan is realized — meaning that Gaza will be emptied of Palestinians, either by death or expulsion.

Netanyahu's comments were made in the context of stalled ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with the Israeli leader seemingly setting the implementation of the plan as a condition for negotiations. In other words, Netanyahu has said that Israel will not agree to stop its slaughter until it can declare total victory.

“I am ready to end the war on clear terms that will ensure Israel's security — all the hostages returned home, Hamas lays down its weapons, its leadership is overthrown, Gaza is completely demilitarized and the Trump plan is implemented,” Netanyahu said. He added that he would be open to a temporary ceasefire, but only for a captive release.

Hamas said that Netanyahu's statements are yet another way of sabotaging any negotiations over a ceasefire agreement and guaranteeing that there will be no captive exchange. 

Trump's plan, unveiled in February, would remove all Palestinians from Gaza and turn the Strip into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” creating a luxury vacation spot on the remains of Israel's genocide. Top human rights experts have said that the plan is outrageous and represents forced displacement, a crime worse than ethnic cleansing.

Netanyahu called Trump's plan “brilliant” and “revolutionary” in his remarks. 

The plan somewhat clashes with Netanyahu's plan for Israel to wrest total control over the Strip, with Trump having suggested that the U.S. will take control of the region. 

This is a far-fetched idea, though Netanyahu said that Israel is preparing to implement a plan unveiled recently for the Israeli military to collaborate with U.S. contractors to supposedly distribute aid to Palestinians in Gaza. This plan has been widely denounced by humanitarians, who would be kicked out of the Strip and replaced by world powers whose goal is not to serve the people of Gaza, but to seize further control over Palestinian land and advance the genocide.

Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were shot dead outside the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday night

The two victims of the shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC on Wednesday night have been identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two employees of the Israeli embassy.

The country's ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told reporters the two were in a relationship and Lischinsky had “purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem”.

Tal Naim Cohen, a spokesperson for the embassy, said in a social media post addressed to the pair that “words cannot begin to describe the heartbreak and sorrow. Just this morning, we were still laughing together by the coffee corner – and now, all that remains is a picture … Instead of walking you down the aisle, we are walking with you to your graves. What an unbearable loss.”

Lischinsky was a German-born Israeli who worked in the political department of the Israeli embassy in Washington.

One of his former professors at the Argaman Institute, Ronen Shoval, said Lischinsky was a devout evangelical Christian who had “decided to tie his life to the fate of the Jewish people” and committed his life to Israel. He grew up in Nuremberg but moved to Israel when he was 16, and according to the bio on his Times of Israel blog he had a master's degree in government, diplomacy and strategy from Reichman University and a bachelor's in international relations from the Hebrew University.

Speaking to CNN, Nissim Otmazgin, humanities dean at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said Lischinsky truly “became an Israeli” after moving from Germany.

“In many ways, I think for me, he symbolizes the hope of Israel … Young people – idealistic – that are going abroad, studying about different cultures, and trying to do good for their country. So in this sense, it is not only a personal tragedy, it's also kind of public tragedy.”

The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said on X that Lischinsky was born in Nuremberg and that he ‘‘was a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause”.

The German-Israeli Society, paid tribute to Lischinsky as “an open, intelligent and deeply engaged person, whose interest in German-Israeli relations and promoting peaceful coexistence in the Middle East radiated to all those around him”.

Lischinsky had written on his LinkedIn page: “I'm an ardent believer in the vision that was outlined in the Abraham Accords and believe that expanding the circle of peace with our Arab neighbors and pursuing regional cooperation is in the best interest of the state of Israel and the Middle East as a whole. To this end, I advocate for interfaith dialogue and intercultural understanding.”

Lischinsky's Instagram bio featured a yellow ribbon to mark solidarity with the hostages who were kidnapped during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack which prompted Israel's deadly onslaught on Gaza.

On LinkedIn, Lischinsky marked Israel's Independence Day a week ago, saying: “We cannot heal until our brothers and sisters who are held captive in Gaza are finally home … We are deeply grateful for the historic alliance with the United States and the great American people, who have stood by our side and have been close partners in these efforts.”

In his final post on social media hours before the attack, Lischinsky had shared a post from Israeli ambassador Amir Weissbrod accusing UN officials of engaging in “blood libel” over claims that 14,000 children faced starvation in Gaza.

In a statement on Thursday, the American Jewish Committee said that Lischinsky had “shared how excited he was to be going back home to spend the Jewish holiday of Shavuot with his family in Israel”.

Milgrim, an American employee of the embassy, organised visits and missions to Israel. She was also a volunteer at Tech2Peace, an advocacy group training young Palestinians and Israelis and promoting dialogue between them.

Milgrim reportedly grew up in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park. She held a master's degree in international studies from American University and another in natural resources and sustainable development from the United Nations University of Peace.

After swastikas were painted at her high school during her senior year, she told a local news station at the time: “I worry about going to my synagogue and now I have to worry about safety at my school and that shouldn't be a thing.”

In a post on LinkedIn earlier this year, Milgrim uploaded a photo herself, Lischinsky and Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel. “I had the honor of meeting the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog! Thank you for visiting DC and for the work you do to combat anti-semitism while being a voice for unity,” she wrote.

“Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues,” the embassy said in a social media post. “They were in the prime of their lives. This evening, a terrorist shot and killed them as they exited an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in DC.

Tech2Peace, an advocacy group training young Palestinians and Israelis and promoting dialogue between them, said Milgrim was an active volunteer who “brought people together with empathy and purpose”.
 “Her dedication to building a better future was evident in everything she did,” it said. “Her voice and spirit will be profoundly missed.”

Meanwhile, the American Jewish Committee said that Milgrim was a “beloved member of the AJC-Mimouna Michael Sachs Fellowship for Emerging Leaders community, where she joined other American, Israeli, French and Moroccan leaders focused on advancing relations in the Middle East and north Africa”.

Speaking to the Jerusalem Post, Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, founder of the Israel Project non-profit, said Milgrim was a “wonderful leader”.

“She was smart, high energy, kind, and passionate about tikkun olam [fixing the world] … Recently, I was at a climate event she organized; just last week, I was on the phone with her to do more climate work. She was amazing and had a bright future.”

In a statement to the New York Times, Milgrim's father, Robert Milgrim, said that he got a news alert about the shooting last night as he was getting ready for bed.

“I pretty much already knew,” he said, adding: “I was hoping to be wrong.

“The ironic part is that we were worried for our daughter's safety in Israel … but she was murdered three days before going,” he continued.

MOSCOW, May 22. /TASS/. A decision has been made to establish a security buffer zone along the Russia-Ukraine border, Russian troops are currently engaged in implementing this initiative, President Vladimir Putin announced during a meeting with government officials.

"We have approved the creation of a necessary security buffer zone along our borders. Our armed forces are actively working to accomplish this task," Putin stated.

He emphasized that, given the recent developments in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions, immediate efforts are required to restore and rebuild areas affected by recent events. This includes assisting local residents in returning to their native villages, provided security conditions allow. Furthermore, it is essential to rehabilitate transportation networks and other infrastructure, ensure the smooth operation of industrial and agricultural enterprises, and support entrepreneurs and their employees.

My lived experience of Chile under Pinochet's dictatorship drives my opposition to the current US crackdown on dissent.

My lived experience of Chile under Pinochet's dictatorship drives my opposition to the current US crackdown on dissent.

On May 13, UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher delivered a harrowing account of the genocide in Gaza. Before he started, he asked the audience “to reflect for a moment on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza.”

As has been the case before, students across the world are leading the way. For over a year, from California to New York, college students have resorted to different forms of protest — encampments, walkouts, calls to sanction, boycott and divest, even hunger strikes — to condemn Israel's genocide in Gaza and rightly express their anger and horror in the face of these human rights violations. Encampments, walkouts, boycott campaigns and hunger strikes — these are all popular nonviolent protest tactics that civil society has used before.

I was born in Chile during Augusto Pinochet's infamous civic-military dictatorship. I have written elsewhere about the inventive practices Chilean civil society conceived to denounce the dictatorship's forced disappearances, acts of torture, and other human rights violations. One strategy devised in the late 1970s by the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared to make their plight more visible was to chain themselves to the fences of prominent institutional buildings in downtown Santiago (the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean headquarters building, the Courts of Justice, and others) with photographs of their beloved ones pinned to their chests. Chained, they shouted, chanted and posed for the cameras — freelance photojournalists were always alerted about these planned actions. I thought about this last month, when I read that a group of Jewish students had chained themselves to the fence of Columbia University to protest the illegal arrest of graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on March 8, right outside his university housing.

On May 8, City University of New York (CUNY) students and members of the CUNY community staged a demonstration at Brooklyn College to protest against the genocide in Gaza, which has been ongoing for over 600 days now and where, according to reports by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification System, over 71,000 children below the age of 5 are experiencing acute malnutrition, half a million people are being starved to death and the whole population is on the brink of famine. As part of the demonstration, students erected an encampment on the East Quad of the campus.

I did not personally witness what happened at Brooklyn College, but in the last few days, I have viewed dozens of videos and photographs, read written accounts by participants in the encampment and talked to colleagues who were present that day and witnessed the police repression in the evening. I also read an email that Brooklyn College President Michelle J. Anderson sent to the Brooklyn College community on May 9. As a CUNY worker and tenured faculty, I feel compelled to respond to the draconian measures the CUNY administration has adopted to suppress our students' constitutional rights in this moment.

In her May 9 letter, President Anderson indicates that CUNY “has a zero-tolerance policy for encampments” and quotes the Brooklyn College Events Protocol, which states, “semi-permanent, or permanent structures – such as stages, booths, canopies, tents, bouncy houses or other party rentals, or any constructions – are prohibited unless an organization obtains explicit permission.” She then adds, “protesters here had no permission to erect tents on the East Quad.” This same argument was rehearsed by college administrators to justify the violent clearing of students' Gaza solidarity encampments a year ago.

This kind of reasoning raises the question: What are the costs, the material consequences for our students, of so-called “zero-tolerance policies”? Last spring, fellow colleagues argued that the prosecution of the CUNY community members who participated in the City College (CCNY) Gaza solidarity encampment last spring could set a dangerous “legal precedent for prosecuting pro-Palestinian activism across the U.S.” Given the current context, when immigration laws are being weaponized and a simple arrest can lead to being caged indefinitely, and even deported with no due process, the criminalization of college encampments becomes even more dangerous.

The last thing we need is for universities to become the police force or the armed extension of an administration that does not seem concerned with hiding its authoritarian and fascist traits.

The “Henderson Rules” are a body of university regulations adopted by the CUNY Board of Trustees in 1969, partly in response to the students protests at CCNY, and they have been amended twice since then. The first two paragraphs mention the word “sanctuary” repeatedly to describe the university as a space where academic freedom has been traditionally honored and vigilantly guarded. Henderson Rules also state that this principle “cannot be invoked by those who would subordinate intellectual freedom to political ends, or who violate the norms of conduct established to protect that freedom.”

“Sanctuary” is a capacious concept, an aspirational principle that even today “remains unbounded by a legal definition,” as author A. Naomi Paik suggests in Bans, Walls, Raids, Sanctuary. This means, among other things, that sanctuary is not a given; it must be enacted and practiced. One of the principles of sanctuary is “do no harm.” I wonder, then, who inflicted harm on whom on May 8? I do not think we can say CUNY is a sanctuary of academic freedom if college administrators think it is justified to call on agents of the NYPD Strategic Response Group to violently crash a student-led protest comprising a few tents, Palestinian flags, posters and chants denouncing a heinous genocide. While watching a video of a protestor holding a Palestinian flag being punched in the face and shoved to the ground by several agents, I wondered, who is subordinating intellectual freedom to political ends here? Who is violating the norms of conduct?

In the past few months, activists, scholars and media outlets have been drawing parallels between the forced disappearances carried out by civic-military dictatorships in Latin America during the ‘70s and ‘80s and the kidnappings and deportations ICE is carrying out under the current Trump administration. This is not the only parallel to be drawn. As some readers may know, under Pinochet's dictatorship, the armed forces took control of all universities — military officials were appointed rectors and university administrators; university faculty and staff were suspended or dismissed; and scores of students were expelled, kidnapped, tortured, and, in some cases, disappeared or executed. This is a cautionary tale. The last thing we need is for universities to become the police force or the armed extension of an administration that does not seem concerned with hiding its authoritarian and fascist traits.

After the Trump administration stated that it would ignore the sanctuary status of sensitive locations (including hospitals, houses of worship, courts, schools and universities), workers organized to demand that their administrators put clear procedures in place to prevent ICE agents from entering buildings and sensitive premises without judicial warrants. I was involved in the efforts to make sure my campus adopted such measures. But, of course, this is not enough. Pledges to not let ICE agents inside a college campus mean nothing if the next minute the police can be called onto campus to suppress students demonstrating.

In this moment, what we need is a sanctuary university that is willing to defend its community members' constitutional rights, including their right to free assembly. A sanctuary university that is ready to protect them against any authoritarian measure, not a university that exposes its students to more danger by enabling the presence of immigration enforcement agents or local police on campus, as happened at Brooklyn College.

Ukraine has brought nine more children from Russian-occupied territories to Ukrainian-controlled areas, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said on May 22.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has identified over 19,500 children who have been forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories. So far, only around 1,300 of them have been safely brought to Ukrainian government-controlled territory. 

Among the rescued children is a girl whose life was in danger due to the lack of adequate medical care in the occupied territories, and a boy who, along with his mother, was locked in a basement by Russian forces while his father was tortured in a nearby room, Yermak said.

Others include two sisters who didn't leave their home for nearly three years because of constant shelling and the presence of Russian tanks, and a teenage girl who was cut off from online schooling due to communication blockades imposed by Russian forces.

"These children lived through horrors," Yermak said in a statement. "We are fulfilling the president's task: to bring all children back home."

The rescue mission was conducted as part of Bring Kids Back UA, a national initiative spearheaded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and coordinated by his office to return deported children to their families and communities.

Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories are placed in families or Russian camps, where they are known to be subjected to intense anti-Ukrainian propaganda, and at times, military training. 

Kyiv has repeatedly stated that returning all these children is a key condition for any future peace agreement with Russia.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has also taken up the matter. In March 2023, it issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their involvement in abductions.

On May 8, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Russia's forcible deportation and Russification of Ukrainian children, calling it a "genocidal strategy" aimed at erasing Ukrainian identity and demanding the unconditional return of all abducted minors.

Ukrainian defense manufacturers have issued a public letter to President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to lift export restrictions on domestically produced military-grade equipment, particularly drones, to help the sector grow and integrate better into Europe's security architecture. 

The open letter, signed by leading representatives of Ukraine's defense-industrial sector, highlights the strategic potential of the country's homegrown military technologies, from drones to electronic warfare systems, and calls for decisive political action to authorize the controlled export of surplus weaponry to allied nations.

"It is time to demonstrate that Ukraine is capable of being not only a party that receives international support, but also a full-fledged partner that exports security through cooperation, technology, and its own experience," the letter reads. 

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine's defense sector — and its drone industry in particular — has exploded. More than 200 drone companies have emerged, many producing cheap, adaptable systems that have reshaped modern warfare. Industry leaders have previously said many smaller firms are burning through capital with no lifeline in sight.

Under the current laws, drones and other dual-use military goods require a permit from the State Export Service. But drone producers earlier told the Kyiv Independent that those waivers are nearly impossible to obtain — even for companies the government cannot afford to contract. The system, they say, blocks access to global markets just as foreign demand is surging.

"As Europe grapples with transatlantic uncertainty and armed conflicts escalate worldwide, our strategic partners are actively seeking to strengthen their defense capabilities through innovative and affordable technological solutions," the letter reads.

"And here, Ukraine holds a unique advantage. Our defense industry — evolving under constant battlefield conditions — is already producing the technologies the world is looking for."

Kateryna Mykhalko, executive director of Tech Force in UA, told the Kyiv Independent in May 2024 that Ukraine manufactures a lot of drones, but "not all of them can be used in the army." 

"Export is one way to ensure that companies do not go bankrupt, develop their R&D, and perhaps in the future the military will need their products," she said. 

Ukraine's defense industry was capable of producing up to $20 billion in equipment in 2024, but the government could fund only half, then-Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin Minister said in May of last year.

An Israeli minister has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “emboldening the forces of terror” after two staff members at his country's embassy were killed in Washington DC.

Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were expected to get engaged, left a reception for diplomats near the city's Jewish museum on Wednesday night when a stranger armed with a handgun approached them and opened fire.

The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, entered the museum and was detained by security staff as witnesses rushed to help the victims, police said. Footage of his arrest shows him chanting “free, free Palestine” as he is taken away by an officer.

Amichai Chikli, Israeli diaspora affairs minister, said the world must hold to account the “irresponsible leaders in the West who give backing” to hatred against Jews and Israelis, “whether through appeasement, double standards, or silence”.

Mr Chikli said: “French president Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have all, in different ways, emboldened the forces of terror through their failure to draw moral red lines. This cowardice has a price – and that price is paid in Jewish blood.”

Gideon Sa'ar, Israeli foreign minister, also lashed out at world leaders, and said “this is what happens when world leaders surrender to the Palestinian terrorist propaganda. Stop your incitement against Israel. Stop your false accusations”.

“I was worried… that something like this would happen – and it did. This is the direct result (of) toxic anti-Semitic incitement against Israel and Jews around the world,” Mr Sa'ar said.

Mr Chikli and Mr Sa'ar's comments came after a diplomatic crisis erupted this week when Canada, France and UK threatened to sanction Israel over its failure to end the war in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid in.

The UK froze trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers this week, drawing harsh criticism from Israel.

Sir Keir has threatened Israel with “concrete actions” if it keeps restricting aid to Gaza and demanded an end to its renewed offensive.

Sir Keir has not responded to the Israeli ministers, but said this morning: “I thoroughly condemn the anti-Semitic attack outside the Israeli embassy in Washington DC.

“Anti-Semitism is an evil we must stamp out wherever it appears.”

After the shooting, the suspect fled into the Capital Jewish Museum and was detained by security staff as witnesses rushed to help the victims, police said.

Pamela Smith, the chief of Washington Metropolitan Police, said: “Once in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence.

“The suspect chanted ‘free, free Palestine' while in custody.”

The assailant was seen “pacing back and forth” outside the museum before the attack, she added.

Amid the chaos following the shooting, the suspect was allegedly allowed into the Capital Jewish Museum by security guards who assumed he was a distraught bystander.

“He was clearly in trauma, he was in shock. Some of the people at the event sat him down, brought him water, asked if he was okay, and he was like ‘call the cops',” Yoni Kalin, the event's organiser, told Fox News.

Minutes later, when officers arrived, Rodriguez allegedly admitted to carrying out the shooting.

“He grabbed a red keffiyeh out of his pocket and started a ‘Free Palestine' chant, ‘There's only one solution, Intifada revolution',” Ms Kalin said.

Mr Lischinsky, 28, worked in the embassy's political department.

According to his LinkedIn page, he had a master's degree in government, diplomacy and strategy from Reichman University, Tel Aviv, and a bachelor's degree in international relations from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He served in the Israeli military between 2013 and 2016.

Paying tribute, Zineb Riboua wrote on X: “Yaron Lischinsky was the finest friend I've ever had, brilliant, kind and endlessly thoughtful. A devout Christian and a gifted linguist, he spoke German, Hebrew, and Japanese.

“He loved America. He was excited about the future, about finally visiting Texas, and about the life he and his beloved fiancée were building together. I was supposed to meet her today.

“They are both gone. And the loss is immeasurable. The world has lost two extraordinary souls. And I have lost a dear friend who made every moment brighter.” 

The second victim was named as Sarah Milgrim, a Jewish American embassy employee.

The embassy wrote on X: “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.

“The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.”

Ms Smith said that authorities had not received any warning of a potential terror threat and that Rodriguez, from Chicago, was not previously known to police.

Mr Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he was “shocked” by what he called a “horrifying anti-Semitic murder”.

He said: “We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the state of Israel. The blood libels against Israel are costing us blood and must be fought relentlessly.”

Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered Israeli embassy security to be boosted around the world in response to the incident.

Donald Trump, the US president, said: “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now.

“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims.”

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, wrote on X: “This was a brazen act of cowardly, antisemitic violence. Make no mistake: we will track down those responsible and bring them to justice.”

Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the US, confirmed that he had spoken to Mr Trump after the shooting and was reassured by his commitment to tackle anti-Semitism.

He said: “He told me that his administration is going to do everything they can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism and the hatred that's being directed, the demonisation and the de-legitimisation of the state of Israel.

“Together with President Trump, our Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will stand together – tall and firm.

“We will confront this moral depravity without fear.”

He described the victims as a “beautiful couple” who “came to enjoy an evening in Washington's cultural centre”.

“The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of Free Palestine was a young couple about to be engaged,” Mr Leiter said.

“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.”

He added: “Together, we won't be afraid, together we'll stand – and we're going to overcome this moral depravity of people who think they're going to achieve political gain through murder.”

Muriel Bowser, the Washington DC mayor, said the city “will not tolerate anti-Semitism”.

She said: “The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city and in our country.

“I want to be clear that we will not tolerate violence or hate in our city... we will not tolerate acts of terrorism.”

Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, which organised Wednesday night's event for young diplomats, said in a statement on X: “We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue.

“Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”

Kristi Noem, the US secretary of Homeland Security, promised that authorities would “bring the depraved perpetrator to justice”.

Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington DC. We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share. Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice.

Earlier, Danny Danon, the Israeli UN ambassador, announced that “employees” had been injured but did not give details on their condition.

He said: “The fatal shooting that took place outside the event, that took place at the Jewish Museum in Washington DC, in which Israeli embassy employees were also injured, is a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.”

Editor's Note: Find the latest coverage of the Capital Jewish Museum shooting here.



            Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, Wednesday night, authorities said.
    


            The slain staffers, who the Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs named as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were a couple who officials say were soon to be engaged.
    


            The two were attending an event for young professionals at the Capital Jewish Museum hosted by the American Jewish Committee. At around 9 p.m. outside the museum, they were approached by a gunman who opened fire and killed them, officials said.
    


            The suspect, whom DC police identified as 30-year-old Chicago native Elias Rodriguez, pretended to be a bystander after the shooting, an eyewitness told CNN.
    


            When police arrived, the man turned himself in and shouted “Free, Free Palestine” while being handcuffed. He is currently in custody, according to authorities. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the man “implied that he committed the offense.”
    


            The shooting, which took place in the heart of the Hill, has shaken the Jewish community at a time of heightened global tensions, as US-led attempts to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas remain unsuccessful and fighting in Gaza continues.
    


            Tensions are also high across US college campuses where hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested amid polarized debates over the right to protest Israel's military actions and accusations of antisemitism.

2 Israeli Embassy staff members killed outside Jewish museum in Washington, DC



            “We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters late Wednesday.
    


            “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA,” President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims.
    


            Rodriguez is being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X.
    


            “Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” Bongino said.
    


            Ted Deutch, the CEO of the AJC, described the shooting “an unspeaking act of violence.”
    


            “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families,” he said.
    


            Police Chief Smith said Rodriguez was allegedly seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four and shooting two of them with a handgun.
    


            The 30-year-old later retreated inside the museum, where he was eventually detained, according to Smith.
    


            According to Sara Marinuzzi, an eyewitness who spoke with CNN, the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once inside the building and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming responsibility for the attack.
    


            Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard Rodriguez say, “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.”
    


            Rodriguez, who was taken into custody on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” according to eyewitness Yoni Kalin.
    


            Kalin was at the museum attending the same event organized by the AJC when he heard shots rang out. “At first I didn't recognize them as gunshots,” he told CNN over the phone.
    


            Moments later, a man entered the museum appearing to be a witness, according to Kalin. He recalled the man sitting in the museum but not interacting with many people present at the event. Ten minutes later, when police entered the building, the man appeared to confess to shooting, telling officers, “I did this, I did this for Palestine,” according to Kalin.
    


            “It's horrible,” Kalin said. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.”
    


            Kalin added that between the shooting and the arrest, Rodriguez appeared shaken up. People approached the suspect to offer him water and check if he was okay, he said.
    


            Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, which was organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza. He added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event.
    


            “I'm still in shock,” Kalin told CNN. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn't get us where we need to be” he added.
    


            When officers arrived on the scene minutes after the shooting, they found “one adult male and one adult female unconscious and not breathing,” Smith told reporters late Wednesday. “Both victims succumbed to their injuries,” she said.
    


            “We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington,” the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a post on X in the early hours of Thursday.
    


            “We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read.
    


            “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also said in a social media post Thursday. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” Leiter earlier shared with reporters that the couple was about to be engaged.
    


            “A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” he said.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, expressed his condolences to the families of the young couple.
    


            “My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said.

A scene from North of North.jasper savage/CBC/APTN/Netflix

One of the hottest new television shows of the year is North of North, which just got renewed for its second season on CBC, APTN and Netflix. The Nunavut-set comedy stars Anna Lambe as Siaja, a plucky, young Inuk mother.

In a supporting role is the show's soundtrack, which mixes originals songs and Inuktitut covers by Inuk artists with classic pop recorded by Britney Spears, Stevie Nicks, Alanis Morissette and more.

North of North music supervisor Michael Perlmutter, who just won a Canadian Sync Award for best soundtrack in a comedy series, spoke to The Globe and Mail about the unique role the music plays in connecting north and south.

You collaborated with North of North show runners Stacey Aglok MacDonald and Alethea Arnaquq-Baril on the show's music concept. Can you talk about those early discussions?

Early on, it felt like music was going to be a character. It wasn't an afterthought. They wanted to work with Inuk artists, and show the Inuit music world to the rest of the world. We also wanted to show that an Inuit community was still connected with the rest of world. So, we used songs by Britney Spears, Caroline Polachek, Alanis Morissette, the list goes on. 

What about using music to support characters, such as the lead, Siaja?

The idea was to create a fun, upbeat, female-centric mix. Siaja is an independent Inuk woman, super fun and super driven. We were connecting a lot of dots through her character. So we have Riit's cover of Dua Lipa's Levitating and Angela Amarualik‘s cover of Kelis's Milkshake. And you're probably familiar with Elisapie, who covers Stevie Nicks's Dreams.

I did notice a character wearing an Elisapie T-shirt. Her Inuktitut version of Dreams was previously recorded, but, elsewhere, you had Inuk musicians recording covers specifically for the show. How common is that?

I don't know if it's standard in the business, but in the last five or ten years I think you're seeing it a bit more. For each one, we find the right artist, we find a producer and we have a creative conversation on how we want it to sound. Riit's Levitating turned out to be super cool. 

There are time constraints as well, right?

It's a creative choice, if you have the time. And we had it. That's the key. But it all depends on the project. With this show, it was hand in glove

Using a song is one thing, covering it in a different language is another. How hard was it to secure the rights for the songs?

We wrote the rightsholders long letters about what we were doing and what the show is about. We also sent lyrics in Inuktitut that had been translated. In the case of Levitating, we had to get Dua Lipa's approval and also the approval of the other songwriters. They were really excited about the idea.

Did the Netflix money allow you to afford all these songs? How big was the song licensing budget?

That's a state secret. I would say that there was a budget. Because we had incredible support from all three networks involved, we were able to afford these songs. The cost is not as astronomical as you may think. We let them know we have X amount of dollars. We negotiate with them. We explain what the show is about. This was a project people could get behind. 

You say people. Do you think the Dua Lipas and Alanis Morisettes are involved in the process, or is it their managers, labels and publishers?

We know Dua Lipa saw the request. We think Alanis knew about it. Caroline Polachek's camp seemed excited by it. 

Now that the show is a hit and has been renewed for a second season, does the dynamic shift? Are you getting pitched by publishers now?

Publishers, labels, mothers, daughters, dog walkers, friends, cousins, they all want to be on a successful show. I've had emails already, suggesting a playlist for the second season. I'm not really responding to those just yet. 

Let's discuss the creative thinking behind a couple of the songs, starting with Levitating, in the first episode.

You're coming into the show. You're seeing the North for the first time and it's beautiful. We wanted something that reflected Siaja's state of mind. She's full of hope and full of love. She wants to celebrate life.

How about the string quartet cover of Keane's Somewhere Only We Know?

Siaja has what might be a fever dream. She's running toward a man, and we have this beautiful, romantic piece supporting that scene. We're having a little fun with it, but it's not necessarily ironic.

The show's use of music reminds me of Northern Exposure. But where that show had a theme song, yours doesn't. Why not?

What Stacey and Alethea wanted to do was use a different theme song every episode, whether it plays for five seconds at the beginning or whether it rolls into the next scene for another 15 seconds. It's all to give it a different flavour and a different feel. Not that there's anything wrong with the same 30-second song every episode. We just wanted a surprise of some kind. You don't know what you're going to get.

Newsom issues rallying cry as GOP-controlled Senate votes to reverse EPA waiver and prevent state setting own rules

California has long been one of the nation's pre-eminent eco-warriors, enacting landmark environmental standards for cars and trucks that go much further than those mandated by the federal government. Vehicles across the country are cleaner, more efficient and electric in greater numbers because of it.

But that could all change if Donald Trump and his Republican allies manage to revoke the state's ability to set its own, stricter emissions standards amid a White House crusade to combat climate-friendly policies.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets and updates its own federal standards for all states on smog and emissions from cars and trucks, which the Biden administration made even stricter last year, saying they will save American drivers thousands in fuel costs and maintenance over the life of a vehicle.

But for decades, California has been granted the ability to make those rules even stricter to help address some of the worst smog and air quality issues in the nation, which are linked to a host of health effects that disproportionately affect people of color.

On Wednesday, the Senate voted to reverse the waivers, in move that prompted fury from Democrats who call it a “nuclear” option, calling it an unprecedented, and illegal, use of the statute. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian have agreed, saying EPA waivers are not subject to the review law.

The House approved similar resolutions earlier this month. The resolutions now go to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign them.

“This move will harm public health and deteriorate air quality for millions of children and people across the country,” said Senators Alex Padilla, Sheldon Whitehouse and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, in a statement.

Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, emphasized California's ability to mandate strict emissions standards for cars, trucks and buses had existed for nearly 60 years, noting the state had been granted more than 75 waivers under Republican and Democratic presidents.

Among the waivers include rules to increase the share of electric vehicles each year among all new car and truck sales, as well as mandates that auto companies introduce progressively cleaner vehicles.

She described the waivers as a “quadruple win”, benefiting public health, air quality, drivers' pockets and the economy as a whole.

“These waivers are not new or novel,” Harris said in an interview. “California has historically been innovators in systems to help produce cleaner air and stymying California's ability is a direct attack on our ability to limit pollution and health harming pollutants in the air.”

She added revoking the waivers would immediately lead to an increase in pollution on the nation's roadways.

More than a dozen states follow California's lead on emissions standards, according to the California air resources board. The standards now cover nearly 40% of new light-duty vehicle registrations and more than a quarter of heavy-duty vehicles like trucks across the entire US.

Automakers have largely followed California's emissions standards as well so they can continue to sell cars there, as the state equates to the fourth-largest economy on the planet.

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, upped the ante in the nation's environmental future in 2020, declaring his state would ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Eleven states have also joined California's plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by the 2035 deadline, a reality that has spooked major car companies.

Joe Biden's administration approved the plan at the end of his term. Trump, however – a vehement opponent to many of the nation's climate efforts – has vowed to see them reversed.

“California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world, with mandates to move to all electric cars,” Trump said during his campaign last year. “I will terminate that.”

Newsom on Wednesday cast the battle as a nail in the coffin for the American car industry and decades of public health advancements.

“The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean-air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” he challenged Republicans in a statement. “Will you side with China or America?”

The Senate's decision may have sweeping effects far beyond the state's borders.

Harris said she recently pulled up pictures of what air quality looked like in cities around the country in the 1960s before the Clean Air Act, the seminal environmental law that regulates the nation's air quality, was in effect. She described normal levels of smog in California as blanketing the state similar to the apocalyptic clouds of wildfire smoke that have descended during recent fire seasons.

The American Lung Association also found last month that Los Angeles remained the country's smoggiest city for the 25th time in 26 years of tracking, despite decades of improvements in air quality.

“I think we have forgotten about what our air used to look like,” Harris said. “We take it for granted because it's a policy that's been around for so long we don't really recognize those direct benefits.

“There is still a long way to go, we have not succeeded in fully cleaning up our air yet,” she added. “These types of policies help ensure we are moving in a positive direction.”

U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not ready for peace in Ukraine because he believes he is winning the war, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 22, citing three undisclosed sources.

Trump's reported statement marked the first time he acknowledged to European leaders what they and Kyiv have long maintained — the Kremlin has no intention of ending its full-scale war against Ukraine.

The conversation on May 19 reportedly included President Volodymyr Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Earlier the same day, Trump held a phone call with Putin, days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials.

European leaders on the call reportedly seemed "surprised" that Trump was "relatively content" with what he heard from Putin, Axios reported on May 20.

Despite U.S. efforts, Putin has shown little willingness to compromise to achieve a settlement. After the call, Putin reiterated Russia's maximalist demands, denying full ceasefire agreement.

Since taking the office in January, Trump has been inconsistent in his rhetoric toward the Russian leader, at times voicing frustration with the stalled peace efforts but mostly avoiding direct criticism of Putin.

Although Trump now seems to recognize that Putin is not prepared to pursue peace, the White House so far has not yet imposed new sanctions or taken direct steps to penalize Russia, despite growing frustration among allies.

Ukraine accepted the U.S.-backed unconditional 30-day ceasefire when Washington first proposed it on March 11. Russia rejected the proposal and continued its attacks.

North Korean state media reported a “serious accident” during the attempted launch of a 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday.

The country's leader, Kim Jong-un, attended the side-launch ceremony at the Chongjin Shipyard. He observed the incident and issued a stern rebuke, news outlets said.

According to reports, the slide system beneath the ship's stern activated prematurely, resulting in a failure of the slides to move in parallel and damage to the vessel. Officials attributed the incident to “inexperienced command and operational carelessness.”

Kim condemned the mishap as an unacceptable act of criminal negligence and ordered immediate repairs. He instructed that the warship be fully restored before a major meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in June. The government reportedly views the failure as a political embarrassment with implications for the country's global image.

No photos or video footage of the incident have been released by Pyongyang.

South Korea's military confirmed it has been monitoring the construction of the destroyer, adding that the ship appeared to be partially capsized following the failed launch.

Last month, North Korea unveiled a new destroyer, the Choe Hyon, and conducted a weapons demonstration shortly afterward. According to reports, the warship fired cruise missiles designed to strike targets at various ranges, an anti-aircraft missile, and a 127mm automatic gun during the test.

SHANGHAI, May 22. /TASS/. Algeria has officially joined the New Development Bank (NDB) under BRICS, the bank's President Dilma Rousseff announced.

"On behalf of the New Development Bank, I truly congratulate Algeria on joining the bank," the NDB press service quoted her as saying. "Algeria plays an important role not only in the economy of Northern Africa, but also on a global scale, and will definitely contribute to enhancing the NDB's position in the global financial arena," Rousseff emphasized.

According to the NDB president, the financial organization is ready to cooperate with Algeria in the field of investment. "Together with Algeria, we will work to finance impactful projects that drive progress, improve lives, and contribute to development," she emphasized.

For his part, Algerian Finance Minister Abdelkarim Bouzerd said that the country's accession to the BRICS bank "will create promising opportunities for collaboration and mutual support." "This membership is a testament to our belief in this institution's vital role in financing global development, and its status as a key player capable of providing alternative and innovative solutions to promote the growth and resilience of its member countries' economies," the minister noted.

The New Development Bank was established by the BRICS countries based on an intergovernmental agreement signed at the sixth summit in Fortaleza in July 2014. Its goal is to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other developing countries.

            An Indian passenger jet that encountered a hailstorm mid-flight and left passengers terrified, made a safe landing, despite significant damage to the plane.
    


            The IndiGo plane was traveling from Indian capital New Delhi to Srinagar, the largest city in India-administered Kashmir on Wednesday – a flight that typically takes about an hour and a half – when it was met with “a sudden hailstorm en route,” according to a statement from IndiGo.
    


            “The flight and cabin crew followed established protocol, and the aircraft landed safely in Srinagar,” it said.
    


            The statement did not specify what damage the plane encountered but photographs of the aircraft show a large hole in the nose.
    


            Delhi experienced widespread rain, lightning, and thunderstorms Wednesday night.
    


            Video taken by a passenger, Sheikh Samiullah, and posted to X shows widespread panic and fear the moment the plane encountered the hail, causing severe turbulence that rattled the inside of the aircraft.
    


            People can be heard screaming and children can be heard crying as the plane shakes violently.
    


            The flight was going smoothly and passengers assumed they would arrive in Srinagar within 30 minutes when the pilot made a fasten seatbelt announcement, Samiullah told the Press Trust of India news agency.
    


            “There was so much turbulence that I thought it was my last flight. Everyone thought we would crash. It was such a traumatic experience,” he said.
    


            “I am a frequent flier, but I've never experienced anything like this. We are very thankful to the pilot for landing safely.”

            Samiullah described his shock at seeing the plane's condition when he got off.
    


            “After we deboarded and saw the plane's damage, it was even more traumatic,” he said. “I wish no one goes through an experience like this.”
    


            Incidents like these are not uncommon, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general of the US Department of Transportation.
    


            Hail can cause significant damage to planes, including breaching the nose and damaging the windshield, but despite this, many planes have been able to land safely, she said.
    


            Sometimes bad weather doesn't show up on the radar “and you're in the hail before you know it,” Shiavo said.
    


            “There have been other planes where the hail has beaten the nose in or beaten pieces of the nose off. And while (the plane) can lose equipment, the important thing is they still have the control.”
    


            Shiavo described how the pilot would have had to manually fly the plane in a “stressful” situation.
    


            “The performance of the plane will be impacted (by the hail). They have to make sure they keep it under control,” she said. “And of course, they have to worry if more can go wrong other than losing the nose… It'll be a very stressful event but it's amazing the planes… can make it through that.”
    


            Incidents of severe turbulence have made headlines in the past, including one from Singapore Airlines last year, when a passenger died and more than 70 were injured.

WASHINGTON, May 22. /TASS/. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has confirmed the death of two employees of the Israeli embassy as a result of a shooting incident near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.

"Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington DC. We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share," she wrote on her X page. "We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice."

According to Associated Press, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Danny Danon has condemned the shooting as a "depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism."

CBS News reported earlier, citing law enforcement sources, that an Israeli diplomat and a woman accompanying him were shot and killed when they were leaving the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday evening. Several other embassy employees were wounded.

A suspect has been detained after two members of the Israeli Embassy in Washington were shot and killed on May 21 while leaving an event at a Jewish museum, police said.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar identified the victims as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. Lischinsky was a research assistant, and Milgrim organized visits and missions to Israel, he said.

 Nikita Lalwani and Sam Marullo

The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act was the United States' most ambitious foray into industrial policy in more than half a century. The bill included roughly $50 billion to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry, which had been hollowed out over decades as manufacturing migrated overseas. Industrial policy, long eschewed in policy circles, had come back in vogue as a way to strengthen supply chain resilience for industries critical to economic and national security. Moving the legislation through Congress required a multiyear process that involved lengthy negotiations and complex maneuvering. But passing the law was just the beginning. As soon as it was signed, the action moved from Congress to the Department of Commerce, which had to figure out, quickly and with little room for error, how to stand up a new office and infrastructure to deliver on its aims.

Washington was out of practice when it came to industrial policy, which the United States had largely abandoned since the Cold War. So there was no playbook available to the new CHIPS Program Office, which was established to administer the bill's $39 billion in semiconductor manufacturing incentives (another $11 billion or so was for semiconductor-related research and development). Where possible, the office drew lessons from past large-scale grant and loan initiatives, such as the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program; the 2009 Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, which bailed out automakers; and the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, which has financed more than $40 billion in clean energy and advanced transportation projects. But much of the time, the program was building the plane as it flew.

It's too early to pass a final judgment on how well it did: the semiconductor industry is fast-moving and cyclical, and many projects are just getting underway. But the program has made real progress. In two and a half years, it has unlocked more than $450 billion in private investments, helped support the construction of 17 new semiconductor fabrication plants (known as fabs), and made the United States the only country to secure manufacturing commitments from the world's five leading chip manufacturers. When the CHIPS Act was passed, the United States produced none of the most advanced logic or memory chips, the hardware used in smartphones, laptops, and powerful AI systems; it is now projected to produce 20 percent of the world's leading-edge logic chips by 2030 and ten percent of its dynamic random-access memory chips by 2035.

CHIPS set itself up for success in part thanks to clever statutory drafting and early choices on hiring, goal setting, and structure. Amid bipartisan consensus to expand industrial strategy beyond CHIPS, future programs would do well to learn from its example. Of course, there is no one way to do industrial policy, and the details will vary by sector and circumstance, but one constant is that large federal programs require the government to work quickly, efficiently, and well. That requires establishing nimble and dynamic teams with sophisticated expertise; building productive and transparent relationships with industry, other governments, and the general public; and figuring out how to overcome sources of delay—within government and outside it—that make it hard to build new things. Most important, industrial policy requires clarity of purpose: a concrete set of specific objectives to guide investments and against which to measure success.

The first days of any new program are when the most critical decisions are made. For CHIPS, having a director that did not require Senate confirmation was an early advantage, since it meant that Michael Schmidt—whom Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo tapped to head the office—was able to get working right away. Requiring a Senate-confirmed leader for an industrial policy program would, in most cases, be a mistake: confirmation takes a long time and can dissuade people from taking on the role. During the Biden administration, confirmations took an average of 192 days from official submission—nearly three times as long as they took under President Ronald Reagan. That is time an industrial policy program cannot afford to waste.

Most government programs take months to get off the ground. In its first few months, however, the CHIPS team released its first funding opportunity for commercial chip fabs, published an investments strategy paper, and hired dozens of staff across investments, strategy, legal, and external affairs. Raimondo also appointed a chief investment officer with private-sector investment experience and credibility with large industry players to work with Schmidt. Hiring from the private sector was essential for an industrial policy program intended to go toe to toe with some of the biggest, most sophisticated companies in the world. At the same time, the point of industrial policy is to meet economic and national security objectives, not just earn market returns. So the CHIPS team also needed staff that could evaluate deals based not just on financial terms but also by judging whether they would improve supply chain resilience, meet the needs of the defense industrial base, and strengthen cybersecurity.



Hiring for these roles is easier said than done. By broad consensus, federal hiring is a mess. In 2024, it took the government more than 100 days, on average, to hire new employees. But even that number understates the problem because it includes various forms of expedited hiring that are often not possible. Typical government hiring, through competitive public job announcements, takes significantly longer. What's more, federal offices responsible for screening résumés rarely have the financial and technical expertise to evaluate applicants for specialized jobs and tend to review résumés more for consistency with the wording of the job announcement than for the substantive qualifications needed for the role. That's one reason that, according to Jennifer Pahlka, who helped found the U.S. Digital Service, roughly half of all competitive federal job announcements fail, resulting in no hire.

The Office of Personnel Management, the independent agency that oversees the federal workforce, should systematically overhaul and improve government hiring. But in the meantime, high-priority programs need to be creative to get good people in the door quickly. For CHIPS, bureau heads in the Commerce Department temporarily loaned staff to get the nascent office off the ground. To build up its full-time staff, meanwhile, the CHIPS Office sought permission from the OPM to use two expedited hiring authorities that were critical to the program's success: direct hiring, which bypasses most HR screenings, and excepted service hiring, which allows managers to hire without HR involvement. CHIPS hired more than 150 people using expedited authorities. The CHIPS Act itself also included a special hiring pathway, allowing the program to recruit its most senior staff quickly and pay them above-standard government rates.

For industrial policy to work well, recruiting is essential. The government needs to draw sharp minds from finance, industry, and other federal agencies. For workers in the private sector, a federal job means much lower pay; it might also mean long commutes or relocation to Washington. During the early months of the CHIPS program, CHIPS relied on personal outreach from Raimondo and from office leadership. Their pitches were simple: get in on the ground floor of a once-in-a-generation experiment in industrial policy. When the ask was made directly, most people said yes.

Equally important to staffing is developing an investment strategy—figuring out what, exactly, the United States is buying with its congressional funding. This strategy should be clear, provide concrete goals and metrics, and be accessible to the public so that Americans can judge whether the program is succeeding on its own terms and whether those terms are the right ones. Such a strategy, although hardly unique to industrial policy, is critical for a program's operational and political success. Not every worthy project can receive funding. By specifying clear criteria by which applications for funding would be evaluated and by publishing a vision of success that set specific production objectives across the semiconductor industry, the CHIPS office could manage expectations for stakeholders both within and outside government.

Importantly, the vision for success served as a guide to actual investment decisions. CHIPS tasked teams to evaluate how every potential deal would advance the program's aims. In working on individual deals, however, it's easy to get caught up in negotiations with specific companies over minute details and lose sight of the bigger picture. To offset that effect, the office also established an investment committee, composed of CHIPS leadership and a few outside experts, whose job was to recommend deals to a committee of senior Commerce Department leaders based on a portfolio-level view of the office's investments. To manage industry expectations and ensure that there was enough money for a broad array of projects, CHIPS made clear that successful applicants would generally receive grants worth no more than 15 percent of a project's capital expenditures.

A successful industrial policy also must incorporate foreign, state, and local governments. Foreign governments matter because modern goods have complex global supply chains and are sold into global markets. Industrial policy is not about onshoring all production to the United States. Even had that been the goal for CHIPS, $39 billion would not have been enough. Instead, industrial policy should identify which components must be made in the United States and work with friendly partners to create robust and resilient global supply chains for those that cannot be. For CHIPS, those partners included Costa Rica, Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Taiwan, many of which had their own chip subsidy programs. To avoid duplicative efforts and to prevent companies from playing countries off each other in search of the highest award, CHIPS hired an international team responsible for monitoring global subsidies, developing a global strategy, and working with the White House and State Department to communicate or reinforce specific requests of foreign partners. CHIPS also developed close relationships with state and local governments, which provided their own subsidies in addition to controlling site selection and various permitting levers.

The same political will that drove the passage of CHIPS—and which may drive future industrial policy bills—also created a demand for fast results. But government processes rarely move quickly, and there are lots of opportunities for outside players—other agencies, courts, and Congress—to slow momentum. 

Government differs from the private sector in the sheer number of actors that can impede progress. To be sure, officials outside an industrial policy program—in a legislative affairs office, on a communications team, or at the National Security Council—can spot gaps or missing priorities. But although many of them know the importance of their functions, few are able to trade off between them—to decide, for example, when a national security imperative outweighs a labor concern, or vice versa. Resolving such disagreements can slow things down. CHIPS was largely able to avoid such delays thanks to a statute that granted substantial discretion to Commerce and a funding process that gave the CHIPS office the flexibility to make policy tradeoffs during negotiations.

Other programs may not be so lucky. It could help for them to have a full-time coordinator at the White House, as CHIPS did, tasked with moving the program forward and resolving conflicts before they resulted in significant delay. A White House coordinator can also help ensure a comprehensive approach to industrial policy that aligns funding with other tools, such as export controls, tariffs, and government procurement.



Courts can serve as another source of delay. In theory, nearly any program decision can eventually be litigated in court, and even if no suit is ultimately filed, processes are designed in the shadow of potential litigation. Consider the National Environmental Policy Act, a law that requires the federal government to evaluate possible environmental impacts of proposed action. NEPA reviews come on top of ordinary permitting requirements and apply only to federal projects. Although well intentioned, such reviews can take years, and if an opponent of the project sues, even longer. The original version of CHIPS required NEPA reviews for CHIPS projects; to comply, the office built an environmental team and published a 200-page programmatic environmental assessment. This strategy would have sped up reviews, but it would still have been vulnerable to lawsuits and considerable delay. In the end, two years after passing the CHIPS Act, Congress exempted most CHIPS projects from NEPA, easing this burden. But including a NEPA waiver in the initial law, and broadening it to cover all projects, would have saved a lot of time and effort. 

Congress can also act as a source of friction. Ideally, the statute that creates any new program will include sufficient money and authorities to achieve its goals, but that is not always the case. Asking Congress to address an urgent need can take months or even years, as was the case for the NEPA exemption for CHIPS projects. Careful legislative drafting—including waivers of other laws when necessary—can make a big difference. Appropriating the entire budget of the program up front can help a program make long-term plans without worrying about political disruptions.

Finally, state and local governments can create permitting bottlenecks, which lead to years of delay. States want to win big projects, however, so the best approach to such obstacles is to set up a competitive dynamic among them. CHIPS, for its part, explicitly rated applications based on how quickly they could be constructed, including permit timelines. This created incentives for interested states to strengthen their processes and adopt reforms, such as creating fast tracks and a single permitting point of contact for a project. CHIPS also engaged early and often with local governments to break through logjams when they arose.

When making difficult decisions, the U.S. government often justifies outcomes by reference to a scrupulously fair, diligent, and transparent process. Such processes often lead to the right outcomes, and strictly following them can help protect ambitious government programs from legal consequences and reputational harm when some investments inevitably fail. But they can also be inflexible, counterproductive, and time-consuming. A successful program thus hews to standard rules where appropriate but seeks workarounds where necessary.

Take, for example, the rules governing federal grants. The rules run 180 pages long with 12 appendices, and it can be difficult to parse what is mandatory and what is merely standard practice. Because many of these rules are ill suited to ambitious industrial policy, Commerce appealed to Congress to include in the bill a special exemption from grant rules known as “other transaction authority.” A typical government grant simply reimburses applicants for the cost of their activities, which means that negotiations over cost are limited if they happen at all. But CHIPS wanted to have holistic negotiations with companies over how many and what kind of fabs companies would build and how much funding the government would provide—an iterative process that was critical to ensuring projects met ambitious economic and national security goals. Unlike the traditional government grants process, in which applicants set project scope, most CHIPS negotiations involved pushing applicants to build more, which paid off handsomely when companies such as TSMC agreed to construct additional fabs in the United States.

Another source of procedural delay are statutes such as the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires two separate comment periods to evaluate the necessity and burden of providing information to the public, making it difficult to quickly announce funding opportunities. Procurement laws, meanwhile, can require months-long competitions among potential bidders before a program can purchase outside services. A critical job for early staff is to identify and, to the extent possible, work around such obstacles by leveraging statutory exceptions and other available “fast track” procedures.

Finally, designing an industrial policy involves difficult tradeoffs between speed and nuance. One example is the complex process the CHIPS office designed to determine grant subsidies, which included calculating the rate of return for proposed projects. To avoid wasting taxpayer dollars, CHIPS deal teams sought to bring the rate of return for CHIPS projects close to the company's standard rate of return. But rate of return is a difficult number to model, and small changes in assumptions can lead to big changes in the result. A simpler approach might have opened negotiations over grant size at a fixed percentage of total costs, avoiding drawn-out debates over model assumptions. Such an approach, however, would have been less accurate and might have resulted in overpaying companies that could have executed projects with less government money. CHIPS calculated that a more involved process was worth it for larger fab projects, particularly to signal to the biggest companies that the team was ready for serious, financially sophisticated negotiations. When it came to designing a funding process for semiconductor suppliers, which are smaller and sometimes less well-resourced than other program applicants and for which long negotiations are impractical, CHIPS followed the simpler approach, fixing most awards at ten percent of the project's capital expenditures.

CHIPS was not without its critics. The program faced early pushback, for example, for embodying “everything-bagel liberalism”—an attempt to shoehorn too many social and economic goals into a national security program. When the first funding opportunity was published in February 2023, critics took issue with language that encouraged labor agreements and required applicants requesting more than $150 million to submit a plan to provide childcare to their workforce. There were no signs that the language deterred companies from participating, and many companies spoke publicly about the need for affordable childcare options to meet workforce demands. But the blowback sapped some of the bipartisan support for the program, and the Trump administration has resurfaced some of the criticisms. This is not to say industrial policy programs should never include additional policy requirements, but these should always be in service of the overall goal: onshoring sufficient production capacity for technologies critical to economic and national security.

In addition, getting early design choices right does not inoculate a program against issues down the line. This is especially true for programs, such as CHIPS, that target a cyclical and sometimes unpredictable industry. When Intel's stock took a nosedive in 2024, for example, the CHIPS team had to scramble to finalize a deal with the company to secure important projects while safeguarding taxpayer money in the event of the company's collapse. NEPA delays remain a concern for projects that were not exempted from its reviews. And some external statutory requirements, such as retroactive prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act, have slowed and complicated funding negotiations.

Doing industrial policy well is not easy. It requires scaling up production quickly and carving out a place in government that can act like a private-sector startup by staffing up, implementing new processes, and finding creative ways to avoid delays. The U.S. government, bogged down by rules and bureaucracy, is not the ideal home for a startup. But with the right playbook, it can become a more hospitable one. As CHIPS demonstrated, policymakers need to make government an attractive place to work for people from finance and industry, identify and mitigate sources of delay, and measure success against clear and definable metrics. At the same time, policymakers should push for structural reforms to make government work better. Under the best of circumstances, industrial policy is an uphill battle. Making smart early decisions can make the climb a little easier.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the media after President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill' was passed by the House.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday declared that the Democratic Party "has never been more radical and out of touch with the needs of the American people" after voting against President Donald Trump's "one big, beautiful bill." 

Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package was passed by the House of Representatives by a razor-thin 215-214 vote early this morning.  

"Every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted against all of these common-sense and massively popular policies. The Democrat Party has never been more radical and out of touch with the needs of the American people," she said. "The one big, beautiful bill is the final missing piece toward ushering the Golden Age of America. The Senate should pass this as quickly as possible and send it to President Trump's desk for a final signature." 

Leavitt hailed the legislation as "delivering the largest tax cut in American history for middle-class families, the working class and small businesses." 

The Trump administration and Republicans hope to reduce the national debt with the bill by cutting approximately $1.5 trillion in government spending. The U.S. government is over $36 trillion in debt and has spent $1.05 trillion more than it has collected in the 2025 fiscal year, according to the Treasury Department.

Leavitt also said it will "permanently secure the border by delivering the largest border security investment in history, funding at least 1 million annual removals of illegal aliens to carry out the largest deportation campaign ever, finishing the Trump border wall and giving pay raises and bonuses for our incredible ICE and Border Patrol agents."

Two House Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the bill — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio. 

When asked by a reporter Thursday if Trump thinks both lawmakers should be primaried, Leavitt said, "I believe he does."

"And I don't think he likes to see grandstanders in Congress. ‘What's the alternative?' I would ask those members of Congress. Did they want to see a tax hike? Did they want to see our country go bankrupt?" Leavitt continued. 

"That's the alternative by them trying to vote no. And the president believes the Republican Party needs to be unified. And the vast majority of Republicans clearly are, and are listening to the president. They are trusting in President Trump, as they should, because there's a reason he's sitting in this Oval Office. It's because he's the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party, not just a president for Republicans, but all Americans," she added.

"The president's approval rating is at an all-time high right now. That's because he knows how to deliver, and Republicans like Thomas Massie and others should take note," Leavitt also said.

From F1 influencers to Taylor Swift, WAGs are in a new golden age. So why do they feel so old-fashioned?﻿

by  Kyndall Cunningham

Don't call Kylie Kelce a WAG. The acronym for the “wives and girlfriends” of professional athletes rankles the podcaster, who first rose to fame as the wife of retired Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce. As she explains, the phrase suggests that “your spouse's profession swallows you up as well.”

But many in the media are heralding this moment as a “new era” for WAGs, and Kelce is just one of several famous women who are at the fore of this renaissance: Everyone from TikToker Alix Earle, who is dating Miami Dolphins player Braxton Berrios, to Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles — unquestionably the more famous athlete — who is married to the Chicago Bears' Jonathan Owens. Then there's Taylor Swift, one of the most successful musicians on the planet, who, thanks to her relationship with Kylie's brother-in-law Travis Kelce, has become the ultimate symbol of the new WAG.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Meanwhile, a host of lesser-known women are experiencing their first taste of fame through their relationships with tennis players, Formula 1 race-car drivers, and even pole vaulters. A sizable number have leveraged their romantic lives to receive brand deals, podcasting opportunities, and magazine profiles.

By and large, our understanding of WAGs is rapidly evolving to acknowledge their own social and economic power. They've transformed from tabloid punching bags to an appealing status symbol. Still, the continued use of the term does raise some complicated questions: Why are we so interested in defining these women, some of whom are independently successful, by their relationships to men? And what does it mean that they might be raking in more attention and financial opportunities than some female athletes? 

The public's fascination with WAGs isn't new. The acronym originated across the pond in the early 2000s to describe the wives and girlfriends of English footballers. British tabloids and football fans alike lambasted women — celebrities in their own right — like former Girls Aloud member Cheryl Cole and former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham for their partying, extravagant spending, and flashy, maximalist looks. When the England national football team lost the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their partners were blamed in the press for the defeat. 

In the United States, being a WAG could be an equally dangerous public position. From Jessica Simpson to the Kardashians, they've been painted as distractions, attention-seekers, and bearers of bad luck. 

Over the past two decades, though, a WAG has become less of an involuntary title and more of an identity that some women are willing to cultivate, given that it can come with its own rewards.

This modern version of WAG-dom can be credited to early 2010s reality shows like WAGS, Basketball Wives, and La La's Full Court Life. These platforms allowed these women — some anonymous before they entered into relationships with athletes — to craft their own public narratives and become notable personalities on their own. 

For years now, Ayesha Curry, wife of Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, has modeled what it means to be a “WAG influencer,” embracing her public relationship with her spouse while building a separate career as a successful cookbook author and host. 

Since then, WAG influencers have become a welcome staple of certain sports cultures. Formula 1 has exploded in recent years, with a small part of that popularity owed to the sport's stylish other halves. Since 2017, female viewership has grown from 8 percent to 40 percent. This has been largely credited to the popular Netflix series Formula 1: Drive to Survive, which put a spotlight on the personal lives of drivers and, naturally, their partners. 

Lily Herman, who writes the F1 newsletter Engine Failure, says that the current popularity of WAG influencers in Formula 1 can be credited to the former partners of a few young popular drivers from 2019 to 2022, like Carlos Sainz's girlfriend Isa Hernáez and Charles Leclerc's girlfriend Charlotte Sine, who were both featured on Drive to Survive. In 2022, Sine was the first WAG in the sport to explicitly use her access to the F1 circuit as a part of an ad campaign for the skincare brand Sunday Riley.

“They were around during an era where the sport saw a lot of growth in its younger fan base, especially among teen girls and younger women, and there was a new wave of interest in these young drivers' personal lives,” Herman says. 

These women have inspired fan pages, Tumblr accounts, and subreddits dedicated to their relationships, fashion, and rumored drama. Lately, the organization has fully embraced WAGs as recognizable supporting characters in the F1 universe, featuring them on social media and including them on chyrons during racing broadcasts. 

Tennis has tried to replicate the WAG-to-influencer pipeline too, although the sport and its fans are still warming up to the presence of outside partners. Morgan Riddle, who's dating highest-ranked American male player Taylor Fritz, has been making get-ready-with-me videos for tournaments and vlogging about her life on the tennis tour since 2022. Ayan Broomfield, a former college tennis player who's dating Frances Tiafoe, and influencer Paige Lorenze, who's dating Tommy Paul, have mimicked the same career path, broadcasting their lives as WAGs on social media. 

Herman says that WAGs play a role in “adding dimension” to their male partners, contributing to the marketability of both. “Fritz is pretty bland as a public figure without his girlfriend,” Herman says. “She's done way more in her work as an influencer and content creator to make him seem multidimensional than he has through solo interviews and profiles.”

It certainly benefits younger, newer WAGs who are already powerful women. Biles and Swift have joined their ranks and seem to take pride in the role. Beckham, now a successful fashion designer, has also played a role in igniting a nostalgia for WAGs, thanks to the popular 2023 Netflix docuseries Beckham. 

In our current political climate, the WAG boom raises interesting questions. Research shows that some Gen Z-ers are identifying as more conservative than their parents. “Trad wife” content abounds online. Where do WAGs fit in? 

WAG influencers share some obvious similarities to tradwife influencers, women who've created lucrative identities and even businesses by perpetuating conservative ideas of marriage and motherhood. In a Substack essay, sports writer Frankie de la Cretaz argues that WAGs are essentially the tradwives of men's sports: “No matter how many businesses a WAG starts or how many charities she runs, she still embodies a heteronormative idea of family and a woman's place in society.” 

It's hard to get around the fact that most WAGs are initially famous for their association with a male partner, although they may ultimately transcend that attachment (see Kelce's complaint about being called a WAG and consider that her podcast, Not Gonna Lie, briefly dethroned The Joe Rogan Experience when it debuted in 2024).

WAGs are gaining visibility while the most talented female athletes are still fighting for wage parity and struggling to land brand deals.

But even attempts to define WAGs outside of their relationships come off a bit shallow. Stories about how these women are impacting sports largely focus on their brand deals and follower counts. When we celebrate the influence of WAGs, we're mostly talking about their ability to turn other women into consumers and spectators, not athletes. 

Meanwhile, WAGs are gaining visibility while the most talented female athletes are still fighting for wage parity and struggling to land brand deals. Back in March, Australian tennis pro Daria Saville made a TikTok about the lack of sponsorships she and other female pros receive compared to tennis WAGs. “Female tennis players are not getting those brand deals,” she said. “It's actually tennis WAGs that fit into the ‘aesthetic' rather than, us, sweaty tennis players.” 

De la Cretaz tells Vox that the WAG boom echoes the mainstream platforming of tradwives. “It's an extension of “girlboss” feminism, the idea that promoting women regardless of what that looks like is somehow good for women,” de la Cretaz says. “It's also this idea that whatever you're choosing is valid, even though those choices don't exist in a vacuum.” 

The most visible WAGs are still predominantly in straight relationships, and a large part of being one still involves affirming a male athlete's heterosexuality. As journalist Kira Cochrane wrote in a 2010 piece for The Guardian about football WAGs, “consciously or not, the women know their role is to boost their partner's masculinity.” She added that their often highly feminized presentation “underlines [their] status as possessions, part of the package for footballers.” 

WAGs, with their new clout and influence, haven't exactly gotten a total makeover. Rather, their hustle has grown more appealing. After all, they represent all the things women are encouraged to be in a time when mainstream culture is trending more conservative. They're tradwives. They're girlbosses. They're stylish and beautiful. Most of all, they're sitting on the sidelines.

Senior advisor for ‘Make America Healthy Again' Calley Means discusses how the Health and Human Services Department is cutting some artificial dyes from the food supply on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

President Donald Trump's Make America Healthy Again Commission released its anticipated report assessing chronic diseases that have gripped U.S. youths in recent years, pinning blame for a spike in childhood issues on a host of variables stretching from ingesting foods with added chemicals to an increase in prescribing pharmaceuticals to young kids. 

"After a century of costly and ineffective approaches, the federal government will lead a coordinated transformation of our food, health, and scientific systems," the report, released Thursday and reviewed by Fox News Digital, outlined. "This strategic realignment will ensure that all Americans—today and in the future—live longer, healthier lives, supported by systems that prioritize prevention, wellbeing, and resilience." 

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. serves as chair of the commission and attended a call with the media earlier Thursday, when he explained that the report is a "diagnosis" of the state of U.S. health, and that the "prescription" for the ongoing issues will be released in 100 days at the end of August in the form of policy recommendations for the federal government. 

The report's findings include teenage depression nearly doubling from 2009 to 2019, more than one-in-five children over the age of 6 being considered obese, one-in-31 children diagnosed with autism by age 8 and childhood cancer spiking by 40% since 1975.  

TRUMP'S 'MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN' COMMISSION TO TARGET AUTISM, CHRONIC DISEASES

"Over 40% of the roughly 73 million children (aged 0-17) in the United States have at least one chronic health condition, according to the CDC, such as asthma, allergies, obesity, autoimmune diseases, or behavioral disorders," the report stated. "Although estimates vary depending on the conditions included, all studies show an alarming increase over time."

Chronic diseases have a chilling effect on national security, commission members said in a Thursday morning phone call with the media. Roughly 75% of America's youth aged 17–24 do not qualify to serve in the military due to obesity, asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases or behavioral disorders, they said. 

"We now have the most obese, depressed, disabled, medicated population in the history of the world, and we cannot keep going down the same road," Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary said in the phone call with the media. "So this is an amazing day. I hope this marks the grand pivot from a system that is entirely reactionary to a system that will now be proactive."

MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN: TIMELINE OF THE MAHA MOVEMENT

The report itself pointed to a handful of variables leading to what Kennedy and other Trump administration leaders called a "chronic disease crisis," including a "food system (that) is safe but could be healthier;" exposure to environmental chemicals such as pesticides outside or microplastics in food consumed; as well as a culture shift that moved kids from playing outside to being glued to their phones or tablets. 

"American children are highly medicated — and it's not working," the report added of another variable compounding the chronic health issues. 

The report found that prescribing medication to children has skyrocketed in recent history, such as a 250% increase in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder prescriptions between 2006 and 2016 despite scientific evidence that the prescriptions did not "improve outcomes long-term," as well as a 1,400% increase between 1987 and 2014 for antidepressant prescriptions for kids, and 800% increase in antipsychotic medications for children between 1993 and 2009.

"These time trends significantly outpace more moderate increases seen in other developed countries," the report found. "Psychotropics for ADHD are one example, prescribed 2.5 times more in US than in British children, and 19 times more than in Japanese youth. The crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in children is therefore both empirically evident, and proportionally specific to American youth." 

While the report detailed that fluoride, which is a water additive frequently used to protect teeth from decay and cavities, was found to have a "statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children." The EPA, the report said, is in the midst of reviewing fluoride data to potentially enact "revisions to the federal drinking water standard."

By 2022, more than 60% of Americans — more than 70% of those on public water systems — were consuming fluoridated water, the report said. 

A 2025 systematic review published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzing 74 high-quality studies, found a statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children. The EPA is currently conducting a review of additional research that will inform any potential revisions to the federal drinking water standard. 

FDA'S LATEST MAHA MOVE WOULD WIPE OUT KIDS' FLUORIDE PRESCRIPTIONS AS HEALTH RISK EVIDENCE MOUNTS

Director of the National Institutes of Health Jay Bhattacharya shared during the press call that the report underscores that America's next generation of children are less healthy than their parents and will subsequently live shorter lives if not addressed. 

"What the report says is that the next generation of children will live shorter lives than their parents," he said. "For me as a parent, that is absolutely shocking. The implication is that whatever is happening to our kids, the food that they eat, the environmental exposures they face, the medicines that they take to address the fact that they're sick are not translating over into making them healthier. And in fact, they are less healthy than their parents were at the same age."

The report found, "Despite outspending peer nations by more than double per capita on healthcare, the United States ranks last in life expectancy among high-income countries — and suffers higher rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Today's children are the sickest generation in American history in terms of chronic disease and these preventable trends continue to worsen each year, posing a threat to our nation's health, economy, and military readiness."

The Trump officials stressed on the call that America's food system is "100% safe," but that it could be even healthier, such as shifting from "ultraprocessed foods" that contain added "sugars, chemical additives, and saturated fats, while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables."

Kennedy added that the "holistic" review of U.S. health as it relates to children includes promoting a strong economy, citing that "weak economies kill people."

The report "represents an invitation to the American people and the American press to have a complex conversation about a nuanced subject, including that environmental policy, good economic policy and good public health policy are ultimately 100% aligned," Kennedy said on the press call. 

"The reason for that, particularly regarding public health, is that a strong economy is a social determinant of public health," he continued. "Weak economies kill people. They make people sicker. Large public deaths make people sicker. These are all social determinants. And we learned during COVID that you can't isolate the economy from the public health policy."

Trump signed an executive order in February establishing the commission, chaired by Kennedy and joined by other agency leaders such as EPA chief Lee Zeldin, USDA's Brooke Rollins and VA Secretary Doug Collins. The executive order directed the commission to release "an assessment that summarizes what is known and what questions remain regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, and include international comparisons."

The commission will release its next report advising on how to tackle chronic health issues in the next 100 days, which falls on Aug. 30.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republican leadership celebrated passing President Donald Trump's ‘one big, beautiful bill' on Thursday morning.

House Republicans took a victory lap Thursday morning after passing President Donald Trump's "one big, beautiful bill." 

"It's finally morning in America again," House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed 215 to 214. All Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, voted against the bill. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., voted "present."

"Today, the House has passed generational, truly nation-shaping legislation to reduce spending and permanently lower taxes for families and job creators, secure the border, unleash American energy dominance, restore peace through strength and make government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans," Johnson added.

The bill is a victory for Trump and House Republicans, who overcame policy disagreements to deliver on Trump's key campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts and no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security.

"We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation. We stand ready to continue our work together to deliver on the one big, beautiful bill, as President Trump named it himself. We're going to send that to his desk. We're going to get there by Independence Day, on July 4th, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America," Johnson said. 

House leaders took turns Thursday thanking Republicans for rallying together to pass the bill.

"Democrats made it very clear they didn't want to have any part in helping get America back on track again, but we were never fettered when this bill could have failed 10 times over. We said we were going to get this done, and failure is not an option. And we meant it," said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.

Trump celebrated his victory on Thursday in a Truth Social post. 

"Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time to waste," Trump wrote. 

The multitrillion-dollar bill includes provisions to advance Trump's "America First" agenda by lowering taxes, securing the border, increasing national defense, reforming Medicaid and slashing Biden-era energy policies. 

The bill aims to make a dent in the federal government's spending trajectory by cutting roughly $1.5 trillion in government spending elsewhere. The U.S. government is still more than $36 trillion in debt and has spent $1.05 trillion more than it has collected in the 2025 fiscal year, according to the Treasury Department.

"Take this as a lesson. Don't bet against the House Republicans. We've shown, time and time again, that we deliver for the American people, especially when it matters most. By taking hold of this historic opportunity, I truly believe we've unlocked the opportunities for generations to come," House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said. 

Republicans on Thursday slammed their House Democratic colleagues for delaying the bill's passage — down to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' 30-minute "magic minute" before House votes.

"Democrats voted to put Americans last, and it's a shame. But thank God for House Republicans, and thank God for our president, Donald J. Trump," said GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich.

But the "big, beautiful bill" still has a big hurdle ahead. The Senate is tasked with passing its own version of the bill, and Republican leaders are hoping to send the bill to Trump's desk by the Fourth of July. 

Senate Republicans have already signaled they expect to make changes to the bill when it reaches the upper chamber, despite House GOP leaders publicly urging them to amend as little as possible.

A significant number of senators have voiced concern over the extent of Medicaid and SNAP cuts proposed by the House. Meanwhile, raising the SALT deduction cap could face resistance in the Senate, where no Republicans represent blue states — unlike in the House, where districts in New York and California are key to the GOP majority.

And Senate Democrats are already piling on the criticism of Trump's "big, beautiful bill."

"This is not one big, beautiful bill. It's ugly. There's nothing beautiful about stripping away people's healthcare, forcing kids to go hungry, denying communities the resources they need, and increasing poverty," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Thursday.

One of the GOP justices must have defected in a case about religious schools, but the Court didn't reveal who it was.

by  Ian Millhiser

Surprise!

The Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it is unable to decide a case asking it to force states to fund religious charter schools. The justices split 4-4 in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. That means that an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision holding that the state should not and cannot fund a Catholic charter school stands, and there can be no religious public schools — for now.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

At oral arguments in Oklahoma, this case appeared likely to be the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions mandating government funding of religious education. Most notably, in Carson v. Makin (2022), the Court held that states that offer private school tuition vouchers must allow those vouchers to be used to pay tuition at religious schools. 

Oklahoma involved a proposed charter school known as St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which hoped to become the first religious public school in the country. While Carson held that states that fund private education must include religious schools in that funding, charter schools are considered public under both Oklahoma and federal law. Both federal law and the laws of 46 states also require charter schools to be non-religious.

Though Thursday's non-decision in Oklahoma means that this long-standing regime guaranteeing public schools remain secular institutions is still in effect, it is far from clear whether this regime will last. Though Barrett, a Republican who voted in the majority in Carson, did not say why she recused herself from the Oklahoma case, USA Today notes she “is close friends with the Notre Dame Law School professor who was an early legal adviser to the Catholic Church in Oklahoma.” Before joining the bench, Barrett was a tenured professor at Notre Dame's law school.

It is likely that proponents of religious charter schools will simply try again to create such a school, this time without doing so in a way that causes Barrett to recuse. If Barrett is present for those future arguments and applies similar reasoning to the decision she joined in Carson, she could easily be the fifth vote for religious charter schools. 

The Court also did not reveal in its very brief order resolving the Oklahoma case how each justice voted, but based on their past decisions and their comments at oral arguments in Oklahoma, it is extremely likely that all of the Court's three Democrats voted against allowing religious public schools. That means one of the five Republicans who were not recused from this case, all of whom joined the majority in Carson, defected. Because none of the justices explained why they voted as they did in Oklahoma, we also do not know why this defection happened.

In any event, Thursday's non-decision means that the status quo remains in effect. Religious charter schools remain unlawful, for now. But it is far from clear whether they will remain so in the future.

A federal judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs. It marks a setback to one of Trump's major campaign promises.

Leavitt used her press briefing to attack by name the federal judge who ruled that the White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries, calling Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston a “liberal activist” and accusing the jurist of threatening U.S. diplomatic relationships.

“Judge Brian Murphy is not the secretary of State. He is not the secretary of defense or the commander in chief. He is a district court judge in Massachusetts. He cannot control the foreign policy or the national security of the United States of America, and to suggest otherwise is being completely absurd,” Leavitt said.

The president will take part in a gathering in Calgary, Canada, from June 15 to June 17 with leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had spoken to Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice will prosecute the alleged gunman to the “fullest extent” of the law.

Leavitt said “hatred has no place in the United States of America” under Trump.

She said the entire White House staff was “praying for the victims' friends and families at this unimaginable time.”

Instead, Melania Trump said Thursday, she used artificial intelligence to generate a replica of her voice reading her memoir, “Melania.”

The 7-hour-long voiced read was created with technology from ElevenLabs, a startup that has helped other people mimic their own voices when medical issues rob them of their speech.

The company's technology also was used to make the audio behind AI robocalls imitating former President Joe Biden that misled voters during the 2024 election.

The first lady's embrace of AI for her book comes as her husband has said he wants to limit regulations on the technology that could hinder innovation. The president and first lady also recently signed the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including through AI deepfakes.

As House Republicans passed their multitrillion-dollar budget bill overnight, 562 state lawmakers signed a letter to Congressional leadership urging them not to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood and calling the organization “an integral and irreplaceable part of the health care system.”

“‘Defunding' Planned Parenthood blocks patients from getting the care they need and increases health care costs for everyone,” the letter said.

Anti-abortion groups have long taken aim at Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding through a mounting initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood.

The federal Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization's 2023 annual report. Contraceptive services and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections make up the vast majority of its medical care. It also performs more cancer screening and prevention procedures than abortions, according to the report.

That's according to an American official familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss an upcoming private diplomatic meeting.

Witkoff and the State Department's director of policy planning Michael Anton will attend Friday's talks in Rome that had been announced earlier by Oman's foreign minister whose country has been mediating the talks, the official said.

The talks, which will be the fifth round of direct and indirect discussions, are expected to be held at the Omani embassy in the Italian capital.

The U.S. Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and plans to stop making the coin when those run out, a Treasury official confirmed Thursday.

The move is expected to produce an immediate annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the news.

In February, President Trump announced he ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin.

Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

The five organizations that had grants terminated by the U.S. Department of Justice in April are suing the department and Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the cancellations unconstitutional and asking that the money be reinstated.

The lawsuit filed late Wednesday by the Vera Institute of Justice, the Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action, FORCE Detroit and Health Resources in Action, asks a federal judge to vacate the midstream grant cancellations.

They ask the court to award class status to the awardees for the more than 360 grants initially worth $820 million that were canceled last month, naming both the Office of Justice Programs and its acting agency head as additional defendants.

The federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump's executive order to shut down the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs.

U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump's goal to dismantle the department. It marks a setback to one of the Republican president's campaign promises.

The dinner Trump is hosting at his suburban Washington golf club is for top investors in a meme coin controlled by his family.

Sen Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, says the dinner means “in effect putting a for sale sign on the White House.”

“It's auctioning off access,” Blumenthal said on a press call.

The senator said those attending Thursday night's dinner don't have to file any federal paperwork — despite enriching the Trump Organization — because crypto currency isn't regulated like traditional campaign donations.

Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said during a contentious House hearing earlier this month, “Never in American history has a sitting president so blatantly violated the ethics laws.”

In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims and with the Israeli people over the attack.

The UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel in a U.S.-brokered deal in 2020, the first of the so-called Abraham Accords that Israel eventually concluded with four Arab nations.

Netanyahu “told the families that he shares in their deep sorrow, together with the entire Jewish People,” his office said in a statement.

The prime minister also spoke with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, his office said.

“It is just a horrific tragedy, an act of terror, and another way in which we have to recognize Jewish people all over the world are being singled out for these kind of horrible attacks,” U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said in an interview on Fox & Friends.

Huckabee went on to push back against critics of Israel's execution of the war in Gaza, blaming Hamas for the war dragging on.

“We've got a lot of ignorant, idiotic people who don't seem to understand the difference between right and wrong,” Huckabee said. “It shouldn't be that complicated.”

It seems like a triumph for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought mainstream acceptance: Top investors in one of President Trump's crypto projects invited to dine with him at his luxury golf club in Northern Virginia on the heels of the Senate advancing key pro-crypto legislation and while bitcoin prices soar.

But Thursday night's dinner for the 220 biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin has raised uncomfortable questions about potentially shadowy buyers using the anonymity of the internet to buy access to the president.

While Democrats charge that Trump is using the power of the presidency to boost profits for his family business, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts worry that the president's push into meme coins isn't helping their efforts to establish the credibility, stability and legitimacy they had thought his administration would bring to their businesses.

The president in his morning social media posting praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican leadership for getting his major tax bill through the lower chamber.

Now, he's pushing Senate Republicans to get moving and notch a political win on Democrats.

“it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!” Trump said. “There is no time to waste. The Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination.”

The group says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to one-third of its health centers closing.

Planned Parenthood said about 200 centers are at risk — most of them in states where abortion is legal. The nation's largest abortion provider also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening. State Medicaid money covers abortion in some states, but not others.

“We're in a fight for survival — not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,” Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the provision, saying in a statement, “Congress took a big step toward stopping taxpayer funding of the Big Abortion industry.”

The U.S. Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal.

The institute's acting president, George Moose, entered the organization's headquarters with private security and the institute's outside attorney for the first time since being escorted off the premises during the DOGE takeover. Moose and most of the institute's board were fired in March, part of the mass slashing of the federal workforce spearheaded by Musk.

The institute and many of its board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and stop DOGE from taking over its operations. U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell's opinion on Monday reversed DOGE's actions.

Speaking after a short examination of the headquarters, Moose said all appeared to be in order.

Republicans made one last round of revisions before the bill reached the House floor, boosting the state and local tax deduction to win over centrists and speeding up the work requirements in Medicaid to win over those who didn't believe the bill did enough to curb spending.

Here's a look at what's in the legislative package, which is expected to undergo more changes when it goes to the Senate:

▶ Read more about what's inside the bill

House Republicans stayed up all night to pass their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package, with Speaker Mike Johnson defying the skeptics and unifying his ranks to muscle Trump's priority bill to approval Thursday.

With last-minute concessions and stark warnings from Trump, the Republican holdouts largely dropped their opposition to salvage the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that's central to the GOP agenda. The House launched debate before midnight and by dawn the vote was called, 215-214, with Democrats staunchly opposed. It next goes to the Senate.

“To put it simply, this bill gets Americans back to winning again,” said Johnson, R-La.

The outcome caps an intense time on Capitol Hill, with days of private negotiations and public committee hearings, many happening back-to-back, around-the-clock. Republicans insisted their sprawling 1,000-page-plus package was what voters sent them to Congress — and Trump to the White House — to accomplish. They believe it will be “rocket fuel,” as one put it during debate, for the uneasy U.S. economy.

Gilgeous-Alexander was announced Wednesday as the NBA's Most Valuable Player, the Canadian's first time winning the award. It's now seven straight years that a player born outside the U.S. won MVP, extending the longest such streak in league history.

And when it happened, Gilgeous-Alexander said a life of moments — getting cut, traded, overlooked, celebrating, the wins, the good times — all flooded into his mind.

“I don't think there's enough emphasis on how much off the court influences on the court,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “And once I became better off the court my career started to skyrocket. It's no coincidence.”

It ultimately was a two-person race. Gilgeous-Alexander got 71 first-place votes and 29 second-place votes; Denver's Nikola Jokic got the other 29 first-place votes and the other 71 second-place votes.

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, getting 88 of the 100 possible third-place votes.

Gilgeous-Alexander — the No. 11 pick in the 2018 draft — averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game this season, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record. The Thunder outscored teams by 12.9 points per game, the biggest margin in league history.




He becomes the second Canadian to win MVP; Steve Nash won it twice.

“He set the foundation,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of Nash. “He was the first Canadian basketball player I knew of. And without seeing guys go to the NBA from Canada, it wouldn't have been as much of a dream as it was for us as kids growing up. So, to be in a conversation with a guy like that and what he has meant to not only basketball but to the country of Canada, it's special.”

And Gilgeous-Alexander is the first guard to win MVP since James Harden in 2018.

“His value is his confidence,” Oklahoma City's Kenrich Williams said of Gilgeous-Alexander, his Thunder teammate for the last five seasons. “His confidence that he has in himself and the confidence that he instills in every one of his teammates, including the coaches.”

Jokic — a winner of three of the last four MVP awards — was second, despite a season for the ages. He averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game, the first center to average a triple-double and the first player since all those stats were tracked to finish in the NBA's top three in all three of those categories.

It was the sixth instance of a player finishing a season averaging a triple-double — at least 10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds per game. Russell Westbrook did it four times and Oscar Robertson once, but only one of those triple-double seasons led to an MVP win.

“He's a special player,” Jokic said of Gilgeous-Alexander earlier this week when the Thunder eliminated the Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. “His shot selection, his shot capability ... he's always there. He's a special player.”

Antetokounmpo, who averaged 30.4 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, was third. He started this run of international players winning MVP; Antetokounmpo, of Greek and Nigerian descent, won in 2019 and 2020.

Jokic, a Serbian, won in 2021, 2022 and 2024. And Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, who was born in Cameroon but since became a U.S. citizen, won the award in 2023.

Now, it's Gilgeous-Alexander — a son of Ontario, where hockey reigns — carrying the MVP flag. He was fifth in the voting two years ago, second behind Jokic last year, and used being so close to the award as fuel this season.

“There are voters every year. That will never change,” Gilgeous-Alexander said on TNT during the broadcast when the results were revealed. “And last year, all it meant was that more people thought I shouldn't have won than should have won. This year I wanted to change the narrative and have it flipped. I think I did a good job of that.”

Boston's Jayson Tatum was fourth, Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James was sixth — the 20th time in his 22-year career that he got some MVP votes.

Detroit's Cade Cunningham and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards tied for seventh, Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth and three players — the Los Angeles Clippers' Harden, New York's Jalen Brunson and Cleveland's Evan Mobley — tied for 10th.

The MVP award, like most other NBA honors, was voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly before the start of the playoffs.

The other awards that were part of that voting process and have already been unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning coach of the year, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels winning most improved player, San Antonio's Stephon Castle winning rookie of the year, Cleveland's Evan Mobley winning defensive player of the year, New York's Jalen Brunson winning clutch player of the year and Boston's Payton Pritchard winning sixth man of the year.

Other awards announced by the league since the end of the regular season: Golden State's Stephen Curry won the Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year award, Warriors teammate Draymond Green won the hustle award, Oklahoma City's Sam Presti won executive of the year and Boston's Jrue Holiday won the sportsmanship award for the second time in his career as well as the league's social justice award.

The award came at a price for Gilgeous-Alexander, who is in line for an extension that will easily top $300 million and could even see him make about $1 million per regular-season game in 2030-31 and 2031-32.

He promised teammates watches if he won the MVP; those guys have those watches now, and they deserve all that and more, he said. 

“This is nothing compared to what they've been to me,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I would rather have the MVP over a Rolex every day of the week and without them, I wouldn't have the MVP.”

Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke reports on the latest religious liberty case before the Supreme Court on 'Special Report.'

An evenly divided Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against a religious school that sought public funding from the state of Oklahoma. 

In a 4-4 vote, the justices upheld the Oklahoma State Supreme Court's decision that for St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma City to receive public funds would be unconstitutional. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had recused herself from the case. 

The court issued a one-sentence ruling upholding the lower court's decision, saying only: "The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court."

Oklahoma has argued that providing state funds for a religious charter school violates the First Amendment.

The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board approved St. Isidore's contract request in June 2023, making them eligible to receive public funds. The school agreed that it would be free and open to all students "as a traditional public school," and would comply with local, state and federal education laws.

But St. Isidore also indicated that the school "fully embraces the teachings" of the Catholic Church and participates "in the evangelizing mission of the church."

Its ability to receive state funding was later blocked by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that using the funds for a religious school was in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond sued to block the approval of the school's state charter, calling it an "unlawful sponsorship" of a sectarian institution, and "a serious threat to the religious liberty of all four-million Oklahomans." 

That argument was appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in October.

In more than two hours of wide-ranging oral arguments last month, justices appeared split along ideological lines over whether to allow St. Isidore to become the first religious charter school in the U.S. 

The justices focused on two questions during the oral arguments: First was whether charter schools should be treated as public schools, which are considered extensions of the state and therefore subject to the Establishment Cause and its ban establishing or endorsing a religion; or if the school should be considered a private entity or contractor, which was the argument made by St. Isidore.

The second question was whether Oklahoma's actions violated the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution, by placing what the school argues is an undue burden on its religious mission.

The decision comes as the Supreme Court's conservative majority has, in recent years, ruled in favor of allowing taxpayer funds to be allocated to some religious organizations to provide "non-sectarian services" such as adoption services or food banks.

In this case, the justices debated what limits on curriculum supervision and control would be placed on the religious charter school, if its contract with the state was allowed to move forward.

Justices Kentanji Brown Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kegan pressed attorneys for the school on how they would treat students with different religious backgrounds who might opt to attend.

There is no indication of how each justice ultimately voted.

Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, tells Fox News Digital Democrats will ‘hold Republicans accountable' over President Donald Trump's budget bill.

House Republicans are celebrating the major victory they delivered early Thursday morning for President Donald Trump.

Minutes after the GOP majority in the House of Representatives stood nearly entirely united to pass Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package by a razor-thin 215-214, Speaker Mike Johnson touted that "the House has passed generational, truly nation-shaping legislation."

Johnson predicted the measure would, among other things, "reduce spending and permanently lower taxes for families and job creators … and make government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans."

And Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota said that House Republicans have "shown time and time again that we deliver for the American people, especially when it matters most."

HOW TRUMP'S SWEEPING BILL PASSED THROUGH THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

But with Republicans clinging to a fragile House majority, Democrats view the House passage of what's called Trump's "One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act" as political ammunition as they aim to win back control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections.

Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin, in deriding the legislation, pledged that "Democrats will do everything we can to kick those who are responsible for this bill out of office. We have Americans at our side. This vote will cost many, many Republicans their seats in the midterms."

And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington State said in a Fox News Digital interview ahead of the final House vote that "we're going to hold Republicans accountable, and there will be a price to pay."

But the rival National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) disagrees.

"House Democrats just signed their own political death warrant. Voters won't forget how they betrayed working families. And Republicans won't let them," NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella argued in a statement.

The GOP-crafted measure is stuffed full of Trump's campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. It includes extending his signature 2017 tax cuts and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay, providing billions for border security and codifying his controversial immigration crackdown.

The measure, if signed into law, would likely even further fuel the nation's massive budget deficit. The national debt currently sits at $36,214,475,432,210.84, according to Fox Business' National Debt Tracker. 

The massive package now heads to the Senate, where Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the chamber, said that "this is not one big, beautiful bill. It's ugly."

As Democrats attack the measure, they're highlighting the GOP's proposed restructuring of Medicaid—the nearly 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans.

FIRST ON FOX: THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SAY THEY ‘STAND UNITED' IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP'S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The changes to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire later this year. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulatory requirements for those seeking Medicaid coverage. Among them are a new set of work requirements for many of those seeking coverage.

"Let's be clear, all Republicans are talking about right now is how many people and how fast they're going to take away healthcare. They have these huge cuts to Medicaid, 14 million people lose healthcare across the country, and they're talking about how fast they can do that," said DelBene.

Schumer argued that "there's nothing beautiful about stripping away people's healthcare, forcing kids to go hungry, denying communities the resources they need, and increasing poverty."

And Martin claimed that "the GOP budget will decimate local communities, blow an economic hole in rural America, and make us into a nation governed by and for a handful of elites."

House Republicans push back against the Democrats' attacks and say what they are doing is putting an end to waste, fraud and abuse currently in the Medicaid system, so the program can work for the public in the way that it was intended.

They call any talk that they are cutting aid to mothers, children, people with disabilities and the elderly a "flat out lie."

And NRCC chair Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina told Fox News Digital in a statement ahead of the vote that "Republicans are ending waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid so the most vulnerable get the care they need."

"Democrats are lying to protect a broken status quo that lets illegal immigrants siphon off billions meant for American families. We're strengthening Medicaid for future generations by protecting taxpayers and restoring integrity," Hudson added.

Dating back to last year's presidential campaign, Trump has vowed not to touch Medicaid. On Tuesday, as he made a rare stop on Capitol Hill to meet behind closed doors with House Republicans in order to shore up support for the bill, Trump's message to fiscally conservative lawmakers looking to make further cuts to Medicaid was "Don't f--- around with Medicaid."

While there are divisions between Republicans over Medicaid, and a chasm between the two major parties over the longstanding entitlement program, there is one point of agreement: This issue will continue to simmer on the campaign trail in one form or another long after the legislative battles on Capitol Hill are over.

LONDON (AP) — Apple users are starting to get ways out of the iPhone maker's so-called “walled garden.” 

For years, the company blocked app developers from informing people about how to pay for a subscription or service that didn't involve going through its own iOS App Store. 

Some apps didn't like this. It's the reason you weren't able to pay for your Spotify subscription from the app. 

But all that changed last month, when U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a scathing decision against Apple that promises to shake up the iPhone app payment ecosystem. 

She ordered Apple to tear down the barriers around its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to provide links to alternative options. She also ordered Apple to stop preventing app makers from communicating directly with users through their apps to let them know about deals and offers. She told Apple not to impose new commissions on purchases made outside the App Store. 

Some companies, including Spotify, moved quickly to capitalize on the judge's demand with app updates. 

Here's a look at how iPhone users — at least those in the United States — can make the most of the changes: 




Spotify customers previously had to go to its website to pay for a music streaming subscription. That's because Spotify long ago removed the in-app payment option in protest against Apple's practice of requiring that digital subscriptions be bought only through iOS apps while taking a commission of up to 30%. 

Following a U.S. app update, Spotify said users “can finally see how much something costs in our app, including pricing details on subscriptions and information about promotions that will save money.” 

If you're a Spotify listener, you can now scroll through various subscription plans on the app to see their prices. Free users who want to upgrade to a premium subscription can sign up by tapping a button directly in the app. Existing premium users can easily switch to a different subscription level, also by simply tapping a button. 

And in another update, the company said users can also view individual audiobook prices and buy them within the Spotify app. Premium subscribers will also be able to buy “top up” hours for audiobook listening if they've maxed out their 15 free listening hours each month. 

Gamers can rejoice. Five years after Apple ousted Fortnite for trying to introduce a direct payment plan to bypass the App Store, the popular game is back on iOS. 

The comeback appeared in jeopardy after Apple initially refused to approve Fortnite's bid before Apple relented this week, clearing the app for U.S. users. It's also back in the European Union, where alternative app marketplaces have been mandated since last year. 

Fortnite maker Epic Games had previewed the updated app's new payment buttons to let players buy V-bucks currency to spend on character “cosmetics” like outfits, wraps for weapons or dance movements known as “emotes.” One button leads to Apple's in-app purchasing system while the other is for Epic's own payment system, which can earn players up to 20% extra V-bucks for their accounts.

Amazon has updated its Kindle app to add a button so that users can more easily buy books directly from their iPhones. 

Previously, users could only look up books and download a sample on the app, but did not have an option to buy directly. They had to open up their web browser and log in to their Amazon accounts to make the purchase, or else buy it from a Kindle reader. 

Now, U.S.-based readers can tap the new ‘Get Book' button in the Kindle iOS app, which the ecommerce giant says will take them directly to their mobile web browser to complete the purchase.

“We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible,” Amazon said in a statement. 

If you support online creators by paying for their podcasts, videos, music or other content on Patreon, you've now got the option to bypass Apple when buying subscriptions. 

The subscription platform updated its iOS app so that fans in the U.S. purchasing memberships have the option to skip Apple's checkout option that includes a 30% fee and instead use Patreon's own checkout option. 

The update app lets fans pay directly from the Patreon app by tapping the Join button. You can use credit cards, PayPal, Venmo or even the Apple Pay mobile wallet. There's still the option to stick with Apple's in-app purchasing system — displayed less prominently underneath the Join button — which will include Apple's fees, according to screenshots posted on Patreon's website. 

Patreon said the update doesn't apply to fans in other countries. However, it does mean creators based outside of the U.S. whose fans are in the country will be able to access the new payment option. 

The platform said that based on Apple's feedback, eventually it will move its alternative checkout method to an external browser so it can continue to avoid adding the extra fees.

American tennis player Danielle Collins had some choice words for the cameraman during her Internationaux de Strasbourg match against Emma Raducanu on Wednesday afternoon.

Collins was in the middle of a changeover when she felt the cameraman's hovering was a bit too close for comfort in the middle of the third and defining set. She got off the bench and made the point clear.

"I need to get water. We're on a changeover. You don't need to be that close to me, and you don't need to be on top of Emma. It's wildly inappropriate," Collins said. "It's not that difficult to give space."

The camera was kept on Collins as she filled up her water bottle with Raducanu in the shot to the right.

Collins ended up winning the match 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, and is set to take on Anna Kalinskaya in the quarterfinals of the tournament.

Raducanu weighed in on what she heard from Collins during her outburst.

"I was standing up because I did not want to sit down in the third set because of my back," Raducanu said, via The Tennis Gazette. "I was staying standing because it was a bit more comfortable, and then she came to fill her bottle up and was just saying how the cameraman was really close and felt a bit inappropriate, but that is all she was saying."

﻿What wouldn't Jesus do?

by  Aja Romano

It's a provocative idea: that empathy — that is, putting yourself in another person's proverbial shoes, and feeling what they feel — is a sin. 

The Bible contains repeated invocations from Jesus to show deep empathy and compassion for others, including complete strangers. He's very clear on this point. Moreover, Christianity is built around a fundamental act of empathy so radical — Jesus dying for our sins — that it's difficult to spin as harmful. 

Yet as stunning as it may sound, “empathy is a sin” is a claim that's been growing in recent years across the Christian right. It was first articulated six years ago by controversial pastor and theologian Joe Rigney, now author of the recently published book, The Sin of Empathy, which has drawn plenty of debate among religious commentators. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

In this construction, empathy is a cudgel that progressives and liberals use to berate and/or guilt-trip Christians into showing empathy to the “wrong” people. 

Had it stayed within the realm of far-right evangelicals, we likely wouldn't be discussing this strange view of empathy at all. Yet we are living in an age when the Christian right has gained unprecedented power, both sociocultural and political. The increasing overlap between conservative culture and right-leaning tech spaces means that many disparate public figures are all drinking from the same well of ideas — and so a broader, secular version of the belief that empathy is a tool of manipulation has bubbled into the mainstream through influential figures like Elon Musk.

The proposition that too much empathy is a bad thing is far from an idea that belongs to the right. On Reddit, which tends to be relatively left-wing, one popular mantra is that you can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. That is, too much empathy for someone else can erode your own sense of self, leaving you codependent or open to emotional abuse and manipulation. 

That's a pretty standard part of most relationship and self-help advice — even from some Christian advice authors. But in recent months, the idea that empathy is inherently destructive has not only become a major source of debate among Christians, it's escaped containment and barreled into the mainstream by way of major media outlets, political figures, and influencers.

The conversation began with an incendiary 2019 essay by Rigney, then a longtime teacher and pastor at a Baptist seminary, in which he introduced “the enticing sin of empathy” and argued that Satan manipulates people through the intense cultural pressure to feel others' pain and suffering. 

Rigney's ideas were met with ideological pushback, with one Christian blogger saying it “may be the most unwise piece of pastoral theology I've seen in my lifetime.” As his essay incited national debate, Rigney himself grew more controversial, facing allegations of dismissing women and telling one now-former Black congregant at his Minneapolis church that “it wouldn't be sinful for him to own me & my family today.” (In an email to Vox, Rigney denied the congregant's version of events.) Rigney also has a longtime affiliation with Doug Wilson, the leader of the Reformed Christian Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. 

In practice, what Rigney is typically decrying is any empathy for a liberal perspective or for someone who's part of a marginalized community.

Now well-known for spreading Christian nationalism, and for allegedly fostering a culture of abuse (allegations he has denied), Wilson's infamy also comes from his co-authored 1996 essay “Southern Slavery: As It Was,” in which he claimed that “Slavery produced in the South a genuine affection between the races that we believe we can say has never existed in any nation before the War or since.” (“My defense of the South does not make me a racist,” Wilson said in 2003.) Rigney appeared on Wilson's 2019 podcast series Man Rampant to discuss empathy; their conversation quickly devolved into decrying fake rape allegations and musing that victims of police violence might have “deserved to be shot.” 

In an email, Rigney told me that both he and Wilson developed their similar views on empathy from the therapist and Rabbi Edwin Friedman, whose posthumously published 1999 book, A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix, has influenced not only family therapy but conservative church leadership and thought. In the book, Friedman argues that American society has devalued the self, leading to an emotional regression and a “low pain threshold.” Alongside this he compares “political correctness” to the Inquisition, and frames a “chronically anxious America” as one that is “organize[d] around its most dysfunctional elements,” in which leaders have difficulty making tough decisions. This correlation of emotional weakness with societal excess paved the way for Rigney to frame empathy itself as a dangerous weapon. 

Despite using the incendiary generalization, “empathy is sin,” Rigney told me that it is not all empathy that is sinful, but specifically “untethered empathy.” He describes this as “empathy that is detached or unmoored from reality, from what is good and right.” (An explanation that begs definitions for “reality,” “good,” and “right.”)

“Just as ‘the sin of anger' refers to unrighteous or ungoverned anger, so the sin of empathy refers to ungoverned, excessive, and untethered empathy,” Rigney told me. This kind of unrestrained empathy, he writes, is a recipe for cultural mayhem. 

In theory, Rigney argues that one should be “tethered” to God's will and not to Satan. In practice, what Rigney is typically decrying is any empathy for a liberal perspective or for someone who's part of a marginalized community. When I asked him for a general reconciliation of his views with the Golden Rule, he sent me a response in which he brought up trans identity in order to label it a “fantasy” that contradicts “God-given biological reality,” while misgendering a hypothetical trans person. 

Despite receiving firm pushback from most religious leaders (and indeed most people) who hear about it, Rigney's argument has been spreading through the Christian right at large. Last year, conservative personality and author Allie Stuckey published Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion, in which she argues that “toxic empathy is a dangerous guide for our decisions, behavior, and public policy” while condemning queer people and feminists. “Empathy almost needs to be struck from the Christian vocabulary,” Josh McPherson, host of the Christian-centered Stronger Man Nation podcast and an adherent of Wilson and Rigney's ideas, said in January, in a clip that garnered an outsize amount of attention relative to the podcast episode itself. 

That same month, Vice President JD Vance struck a nerve with a controversial appearance on Fox News in which he seemed to reference both the empathy conversation and the archaic Catholic concept of “ordo amoris,” meaning “the order of love.” As Vance put it, it's the idea that one's family should come before anyone else: “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country,” he said. “And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” In a follow-up on X, he posted, “the idea that there isn't a hierarchy of obligations violates basic common sense.” 

Vance's statements received backlash from many people, including both the late Pope Francis and then-future Pope Leo XIV — but the controversy just drove the idea further into the mainstream. As part of the odd crossover between far-right religion and online reactionaries, it picked up surprising alliances along the way, including evolutionary biologist turned far-right gadfly Gad Saad. In January, Saad, applying a survival-of-the-fittest approach to our emotions, argued against “suicidal empathy,” which he described as “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets.” (Who are the wrong targets according to Saad? Trans women and immigrants.)

In a February appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Elon Musk explicitly referenced Saad but went even further, stating, “The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy — the empathy exploit. They're exploiting a bug in Western civilization” — the “they” here being the left wing. “I think empathy is good,” Musk added, “but you need to think it through, and not just be programmed like a robot.” 

By March, mainstream media had noticed the conversation. David French had observed the “strange spectacle” of the Christian turn against empathy in a column for the New York Times. In April, a deep-dive in the Guardian followed. That same month, a broad-ranging conversation in the New Yorker with Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, led to interviewer Isaac Chotiner pressing him about why empathy is bad. The discussion, of deported Venezuelan immigrants wrongfully suspected of having gang tattoos, led to Mohler saying that “there's no reason anyone other than a gang member should have that tattoo.” (Among the tattoos wrongly flagged as gang symbols were the words “Mom” and “Dad” on the wrists of one detainee.)

The connective tissue across all these disparate anti-empathy voices is two-fold, according to Christian scholar Karen Swallow Prior. Prior, an anti-abortion ethicist and former longtime Liberty University professor, singled out the argument's outsize emphasis on attacking very small, very vulnerable groups — as well as the moment in which it's all happening.

“The entire discourse around empathy is backlash against those who are questioning the authority of those in power,” she told me, “not coincidentally emerging in a period where we have a rise in recognition of overly controlling and narcissistic leaders, both in and outside the church.” Those people “understand and appreciate empathy the least.”

“Trump made it okay to not be okay with culture,” Peter Bell, co-creator and producer of the Sons of Patriarchy podcast, which explores longstanding allegations of emotional and sexual abuse against Doug Wilson's Christ Church, told me. (Wilson has denied that the church has a culture of abuse or coercion.) “He made it kind of cool for Christians to be jerks,” Bell said. “He made the unspoken things spoken, the whispered things shouted out loud.”

Prior believes that the argument won't have a long shelf life because Rigney's idea is so convoluted. Yet she added that it's born out of toxic masculinity, in an age where stoicism, traditionally male-coded, is increasingly part of the regular cultural diet of men via figures like Jordan Peterson. That hypermasculinity goes hand in hand with evangelical culture, and with the ideas Rigney borrowed from Friedman about too many emotions being a weakness. In this framing, emotion becomes non-masculine by default — i.e., feminine.

“Everybody's supposed to have sympathy for the white male, but when you show empathy to anyone else, suddenly empathy is a sin.”

That leads us to the grimmest part of Rigney's “untethered empathy” claims: the way he explicitly genders it — and demonizes it — as feminine. Throughout his book, he argues that women are more empathetic than men, and that as a result, they are more prone to giving into it as a sin. It's an inherently misogynistic view that undermines women's decision-making and leadership abilities. 

Though Rigney pushed back against this characterization in an email to me, arguing that critics have distorted what he views as merely “gendered tendencies and susceptibility to particular temptations,” he also couldn't help reinforcing it. “[F]emale tendencies, like male tendencies, have particular dangers, temptations, and weaknesses,” he wrote. Women thus should recognize this and “take deliberate, Spirit-wrought action to resist the impulse to become a devouring HR department that wants to run the world.”

As Prior explains, though, Rigney's just fine with a mythic national human resources department, as long as it supports the status quo. “Everybody's supposed to have sympathy for the white male,” she said, “but when you show empathy to anyone else, suddenly empathy is a sin.”

What's heartening is that, whether they realize what kind of dangerous extremism undergirds it, most people aren't buying Rigney's “empathy is sin” claim. Across the nation, in response to Rigney's assertion, the catchphrase, “If empathy is a sin, then sin boldly” has arisen, as heard in pulpits, seen on church marquees, and worn on T-shirts — a reminder that it takes much more than the semantic whims of a few extremists to shake something most people hold in their hearts.

When CNN's Jake Tapper went on his book tour, he probably did not expect it to turn into an apology tour instead. Yet that is what has happened as his media blitz has quickly given way to mea culpas. 

“Knowing what I know now, obviously I feel tremendous humility about my coverage,” Tapper confessed to Megyn Kelly when he joined her influential podcast to discuss the book he co-authored with Alex Thompson, a reporter for Axios, about the age-related decline of former President Joe Biden and its cover-up.

“That Lara Trump interview, for example — she saw something that I did not see at the time,” Tapper continued. “100%. And I own that.” Here, Tapper is referring to a 2020 interview he did with Lara Trump in which he accused her of ridiculing Biden's stutter at an event. She replied that she “had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter. I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline.”

“You are so amazing,” Tapper shot back. “‘A cognitive decline.'” The CNN anchor now says he apologized to Lara Trump “months ago.” He added, “But yeah, I mean, of course, I look back at my coverage with humility. And I wish I had covered the issues of age and acuity — but I wish I had covered them much more.”

The reappraisal of Biden's physical and mental abilities while in office is really primarily a media story. Yes, Biden was enabled by people around him, including his family and White House staff. They took steps to limit the exposure of his infirmities to Beltway elites and the general public. The former president himself was stubborn, an 82-year-old man clinging to a job he had been campaigning for since at least 1987, and asking voters to allow him to keep it past his 86th birthday.

But it was the task of the press to report facts that would help voters understand whether Biden was up to doing that highly coveted job. While voters came to doubt Biden's fitness to serve, according to numerous polls, there was little appetite for covering these stories outside of conservative media. (In giving him an award for his 2024 coverage of Biden, the White House Correspondents Association seemingly acknowledged Thompson was a rare exception to the rule.) 

The steady stream of new accounts examining Biden's limitations as president, including the Tapper-Thompson Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, contains revelatory details and interesting color. But they don't reach conclusions about Biden's condition that are markedly different from those most voters, including many rank-and-file Democrats, arrived at on their own simply by watching him. And they put the blame on Democratic politicians and Biden aides more than the media.

Reading the Washington Examiner would have helped voters gain insight into Biden's age problem years before the current flood of books only now being published after he left office. “Whatever their differences, the two front-runners in the Democratic presidential race, Joe Biden, born November 20, 1942, and Bernie Sanders, born September 8, 1941, share one common trait: They are too old to be president,” chief political correspondent Byron York wrote in April 2019. 

“And that fact is, Biden, now 77, has clearly slowed down,” York wrote in late July 2020. “He does not appear to be as vigorous as he was during his 44 years in the federal government. … At the moment, Biden is facing very little commentary and criticism about his age. There was more discussion of age when Republican John McCain, who would have been 72 had he been elected, ran in 2008, and when Republican Bob Dole, who would have been 73, ran in 1996. But Biden, who would be 78, attracts less talk.”

Editor-in-Chief Hugo Gurdon described Biden as “an old man in a new world” in March 2020. “The problem with bygone eras, however, is that they are bygone,” he wrote. “There is no going back. Biden is avowedly yesterday's man; his rhetoric is all about (dubious) past achievements.”

“President Joe Biden's great age and concomitant physical and mental decline have been subjects of intensifying contention since before Democrats first chose him as their leader in 2020,” Gurdon wrote in late 2023, nearly 190 days before Biden's catastrophic debate with President Donald Trump. “Back then, he was only — only! — 77 years old. Now, he is 81, and if he is reelected, he'll swear his oath of office at the age of 82. If he makes it through a second term, he'll quit the White House at 86.”

Gurdon added that Biden's “aides and first lady Jill Biden do their best to manage his schedule and lighten his load. They want to reduce his commitments, so he doesn't tire himself out, thereby cutting down on opportunities for him to embarrass himself and the rest of us at our choice of president.”

David Freddoso wrote for the Washington Examiner magazine in February 2024 about how some progressive Democrats saw Biden's deficits as an asset.  Their case was “that Biden does not matter. He might have the title of president, but it is the young, radical aides from the Obama era who are really running the country in his name.”

Megyn Kelly, her former colleagues at Fox News, and many others in conservative media raised similar questions about Biden. Only intermittently do they escape that bubble. 

“Could Democrats and their allies in America's newsrooms have nudged or even muscled Biden out of office?” Noah Rothman asked in National Review in September 2023. “A president who wants to remain president is extremely difficult to dislodge from office. But it's not impossible to imagine a popular groundswell in which the press, backed by supermajorities of Democrats, had successfully applied all its leverage with the aim of convincing Biden to bow out at the end of his first term.”

At the time, Rothman thought the Democrats' and the legacy media's moment had passed. But this exact scenario unfolded much as he described it in the aftermath of Biden's dreadful June 27, 2024, debate showing. That's when the press as a whole, without any “conservative” qualifier, turned sharply against Biden as it appeared he was not up to beating Trump a second time.

One issue was surely that Democratic sources were then willing to come out of the woodworks to talk about their own experiences with — or lack of unfiltered access to — Biden. Olivia Nuzzi's New York magazine piece came out seven days after the debate. There was clearly some reporting in the can. 

When the Wall Street Journal's Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes reported in early June 2024 that Biden was “slipping” behind closed doors — one of the White House's defenses of Biden was how sharp he was in private settings, conveniently outside the cameras' view — many of the on-the-record sources were Republicans and Democrats disputed the story. After the debate, some Democrats who had publicly pushed back began calling for Biden to reconsider his reelection campaign. 

Some outlets undoubtedly preferred to have concerns about Biden's age and capacity to run or serve come from Democrats rather than let Republicans repeat their familiar criticisms of “Sleepy Joe.” Man bites dog, Dems bite Biden. After the debate, more Democrats were willing to go on the record with these complaints, and it's likely that editors were more comfortable running what was still on background. 

“The editors who drove a lot of these coverage decisions will remain quiet and hidden,” Axios reporter Marc Caputo wrote on X. “They'll never fess up. They'll never look inward. They'll let the reporters take the criticism for the decisions they made.”

But that doesn't explain the near-uniformity of the coverage decisions, the eagerness to accept the White House's framing of age and decline stories by people who observed Biden more regularly than concerned voters did, or even confident proclamations that Biden was totally fine. The most famous example of the last phenomenon is MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, who was a congressman while Biden was still in the Senate. 

“This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever,” Scarborough asserted in March 2024, after calling the then-president “more than cogent.” The Morning Joe host finally admitted on Wednesday that he was “obviously wrong.” (Albeit with more caveats than he applied to his original statement.)

The obviousness is now being used to defend how Biden was covered. Mark Leibovich unloaded in the Atlantic about “why I think that the ‘cover-up' of Biden's ‘true condition' is beside the point — and why I'm not really vibing with the umbrage-mongering: It's pretty much impossible to ‘cover up' for something that is hiding in plain sight.”

“Democrats could trot out as many White House officials as they wanted to claim I was with the president just this morning, and he was sharp as a tack and running circles around staffers less than half his age,” he continued. “But whenever Biden was allowed to go out in public — a rarity, which itself was a red flag — the public's preexisting consensus about his infirmity was only reinforced.”

Journalistic problems with this take aside, Leibovich sang a different tune in 2023. “It's not just making an issue of Biden's age, it's lying,” he said on a PBS roundtable show. “It's saying he's senile, saying he's demented, saying he's out of it.” Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg responded, “Right. Mentally, he's quite acute.” Leibovich then replied, “It seems like it.”

Fast-forward to May 2025, and now Leibovich writes, “Biden was in no position to keep doing his job given his condition, which had been evident for years to most people paying even casual attention.”

Leibovich, nevertheless, highlights, however tendentiously, an important point: Biden has spoken on television and in public for decades. He was a two-term vice president who, before that, was a senator for 36 years. He was elected president on his third try. His diminishment as a communicator, at least, was obvious to anyone covering him. And Biden's public schedule both suggested that the White House was cognizant of that decline and that there was, as Tapper and Thompson write in their book, “a limit to the hours in which he could reliably function.”

There was nothing former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre or top advisers like Anita Dunn or $4 million man Michael Donilon could really say that would alter what voters — or journalists, for that matter — could see and hear for themselves.

A real test of whether anyone has learned anything will be how the larger media treats questions surrounding Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and transparency about his health while he was still president. Those questions should be handled sensitively, given the severity of Biden's condition, but they still need to be asked and answered forthrightly. 

So far, it has been a mixed bag: a number of nuanced interviews with urologists and other medical experts discussing the odds that Biden's cancer would have appeared so suddenly, but also an at least arguably disproportionate focus on what Trump is saying — almost always “without evidence” — about the matter. Some Democrats have urged that the discussion be “muted” as Biden recovers. But it is still early. 

DEMOCRATS SUGGEST A ‘PAUSE' IN BIDEN HEALTH TALK AFTER CANCER DIAGNOSIS 

“Alex and I are here to say the conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul searching, not just among me, but among the legacy media,” Tapper told Kelly.

She seemed skeptical.

'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Matt Towery and Ari Fleischer discuss President Donald Trump's latest poll numbers.

Four months into his second tour of duty in the White House, President Donald Trump's approval ratings remain slightly underwater.

The president stands at 46% approval and 54% disapproval in a new national survey by Marquette Law School. And Trump is at 42% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll. 

Most, but not all, of the latest national surveys place the president's approval rating in negative territory, with a handful indicating Trump is above water.

Trump has aggressively asserted executive authority in his second term, overturning longstanding government policy and aiming to make major cuts to the federal workforce through an avalanche of sweeping and controversial executive orders and actions, with some aimed at addressing grievances he has held since his first term.

Trump started his second administration with poll numbers in positive territory, but his poll numbers started to slide soon after his late-January inauguration.

But two issues where the president remains at or above water in some surveys are border security and immigration, which were front and center in Trump's successful 2024 campaign to win back the White House.

Trump stands at 56% approval on border security and 50% approval on immigration in the Marquette Law School poll, which was conducted May 5-15.

But Trump's muscular moves on border security and immigration, which have sparked controversy and legal pushback, don't appear to be helping his overall approval ratings.

"Immigration is declining now as a salient issue," said Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll.

Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, said "immigration and especially border security are beginning to lose steam as one of the top-three issues facing the country. Republicans still rate them fairly highly, but Democrats and independents, who had kind of joined the chorus in 2024, have moved on and in particular moved back to the economy as a focal point."

Pointing to Trump, Shaw added that "when you have success on an issue, it tends to move to the back burner."

Contributing to the slide over the past couple of months in Trump's overall approval ratings was his performance on the economy and, in particular, inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former President Joe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.

Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.

But the markets have rebounded, thanks in part to a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff as Trump tapped the brakes on his controversial tariff implementation.

Trump stood at 37% approval on tariffs and 34% on inflation/cost of living in the Marquette Law School poll. And he stood at 39% on the economy and 33% on cost of living in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted May 16-18.

Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist and former RNC and Bush administration official, pointed to last year's election, saying, "The main reason Trump won was to lower prices. Prices haven't lowered, and polls are reflecting that."

"With the exception of gas prices, there hasn't been much of a reduction in prices," Shaw said.

"Prices haven't come down, and it's not clear that people will say the absence of inflation is an economic victory. They still feel that an appreciable portion of their money is going to pay for basic things," he added. "What Trump is realizing is that prices have to come down for him to be able to declare success."

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return.

A federal judge blocked President Donald Trump's administration from firing two Democratic members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board on Wednesday.

Trump fired all three Democratic members of the five-person board in February, resulting in two of them filing a lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton found that allowing unilateral firings would prevent the board from carrying out its purpose.

Walton wrote that allowing at-will removals would make the board "beholden to the very authority it is supposed to oversee on behalf of Congress and the American people."

The oversight board was initially created by Congress to ensure that federal counterterrorism policies were in line with privacy and civil liberties law.

"To hold otherwise would be to bless the President's obvious attempt to exercise power beyond that granted to him by the Constitution and shield the Executive Branch's counterterrorism actions from independent oversight, public scrutiny, and bipartisan congressional insight regarding those actions," Walton wrote.

Trump's firings left just one Republican on the board. The third Democratic member had just two days left in her term when she was removed, and she did not sue the administration.

The two plaintiffs, Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, argued in their lawsuit that members of the board cannot be fired without cause. Meanwhile, lawyers for Trump's administration argued that members of other congressionally created boards do have explicit job protections, and it would therefore be wrong for Walton to create such protections where they are absent.

"The Constitution gives President Trump the power to remove personnel who exercise his executive authority," White House spokesman Harrison Fields told the Associated Press. "The Trump Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue."

The plaintiffs also argued that their firings left just one member on the board, a Republican, and that falls short of the quorum required for the board to function.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A top Romanian court on Thursday validated the results of Romania's presidential election rerun, shortly after rejecting a request to annul the results by the hard-right candidate who decisively lost the race to his pro-European Union opponent.

After deliberations on Thursday, Romania's Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the annulment request, filed on Tuesday by George Simion, in which he alleged that foreign interference and coordinated manipulation affected the vote. 

The Court then validated the results and held a short ceremony attended by the elected President Nicusor Dan, the Bucharest mayor who won the tense runoff, beating Simion with 53.6% of the vote, a margin of more than 829,000 votes. 

“I want to thank the Romanian people who turned out in great numbers for the May elections and, in doing so, gave legitimacy to the new president,” 55-year-old Dan, a mathematician and former civic activist, said at the court during the ceremony. 

“A new chapter is beginning in Romania's recent and contemporary history. I want to assure Romanian citizens that I understand the responsibility of the mandate they have entrusted to me,” he said. “There will be many challenges, and I hope that we will successfully overcome all of them.”

Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, had conceded defeat after losing in the runoff to Dan, but later contested the results. The court said its decision on Thursday is final. 




In his request to annul the election, Simion claimed he had “irrefutable evidence” that France, Moldova and “other actors” meddled in the ballot, but did not present any evidence. He also alleged that “deceased people” had participated in the vote, and that he requested it be canceled on the same grounds as the court's decision last year.

After the court rejected his annulment request, Simion said in a post on Facebook that the Court “has continued the coup!”

“We have no choice but to fight!,” his post read. “I call on you to stand with me, today and in the coming weeks!”

Sunday's tense vote was held months after the same court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu led the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.

The Court's unprecedented decision last year to cancel the election plunged EU and NATO member Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, compounded by a string of crises such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and a significant budget deficit.

Dan is expected to be officially sworn in next week, after which he must also contend with deep societal divisions laid bare by the vote, revealing a country where endemic corruption, inequality and an erosion of trust in traditional institutions and parties have fueled a broad rejection of the political establishment.

“Romanian society has shown wisdom, and I am convinced that in the period ahead, it will continue to push for the positive change that Romania needs,” Dan added Thursday. “I will fight for the strengthening of state institutions ... I will also fight for the country's economic prosperity, I will be a partner to the business environment, and I will be a guarantor of civil liberties.”

Dan will also face the challenge of nominating a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a government — a tall order in a country where strong anti-establishment sentiment led to the emergence of figures like Georgescu and Simion.

Simion capitalized on the furor over last year's annulment and, after coming fourth in the canceled race, allied with Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. In the first-round vote on May 4 in the rerun, Simion won a landslide in a field of 11 candidates to enter the runoff.

Hours after voting opened on Friday for Romanians abroad, Simion accused the government of neighboring Moldova of election fraud, which both Moldovan and Romanian authorities rejected.

In comment to The Associated Press on Sunday, he reiterated claims that people were being illegally transported to voting stations in Moldova, allegedly affecting 80,000 votes. 

More than half a million Moldovans hold Romanian citizenship, and about 158,000 people voted at polling stations set up in Moldova in the second round. Many more dual citizens would also have cast ballots in other countries. 

As a member of the EU and one of the easternmost members of the NATO military alliance, Romania plays a pivotal role in Western security infrastructure — especially since Russia's full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022.

Many observers saw Sunday's vote as crucial to maintaining Romania's place within the network of Western alliances — especially amid fears that the Trump administration is reconsidering its security commitments to the United States' European partners.

Critics of the president's decision to auction off a private dinner via his Trump-branded crypto token were worried about the stunt for a few reasons. At the top of the list: the potential for foreigners to buy access to the sitting president, something the US Constitution explicitly prohibits.
    


            Those concerns, it seems, were well founded. The vast majority of the top holders of Trump's memecoin appear to be based overseas, including the top investor — a Chinese-born crypto mogul who, until recently, was facing civil fraud charges in the United States.
    


            Billed by organizers as the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world,” Thursday's gala is set to take place at the president's private Trump National Golf Club, just outside of Washington, DC, according to an email sent to guests and reviewed by Fortune.



            The guests are expected to include President Donald Trump himself and 220 of the top $TRUMP buyers, who collectively dumped an estimated $148 million over three weeks into the memecoin — a type of crypto product that is functionally useless as a currency or investment vehicle, and one that serious investors avoid because of their tendency to collapse in value.  The top 25 $TRUMP coin holders are eligible for a private White House tour the following day — the kind of access typically reserved for heads of state.

            And because crypto is anonymous by design, the identities of the top investors — who appeared on a public leaderboard with nothing but self-selected three- or four-letter usernames and long, cryptographic digital wallet addresses — aren't easy to pin down.
    


            But an analysis by Bloomberg News found that all but six of the top 25 holders of the $TRUMP memecoin used foreign exchanges that are ostensibly off-limits to anyone living in the US. More than half of the top 220 holders used similar offshore exchanges, Bloomberg found.
    


            Thursday's “ultra-exclusive private VIP reception” is just the latest instance of the Trump administration flouting ethical boundaries between the office and the president's personal profit-seeking. His apparent contempt for such boundaries has angered commentators across the political spectrum.
    


            Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who introduced legislation to ban officials from selling memecoins, said in a hearing this week that the gala “represents a real problem” because there is “clearly a way around the State Department for foreign individuals of significant influence and wealth to be able to directly lobby the president.” And even Republican crypto advocate Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said the event gives her “pause.”
    


            The progressive advocacy group Public Citizen is organizing a protest outside the Potomac Falls, Virginia, golf course on Thursday, and is calling on the Department of Justice and other officials to hold Trump accountable.
    


            “He'd help himself by calling off his Thursday gala,” the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page wrote Tuesday. “If he won't do that, he could at least disclose his crypto contest's winners so Americans know who may be trying to buy access to the President.”
    


            That, too, seems unlikely.
    


            When CNN asked the White House whether a gala guest list would be released, a spokesperson replied with a statement saying: “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.”
    


            Organizers of the auction didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            One publicly known guest is Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur, who wasn't exactly hiding his status. Observers were pretty sure the billionaire was leading the pack when the auction's public leaderboard displayed the username SUN topping the ranks. Sun later confirmed on social media Tuesday that he was “honored” to support Trump and excited to attend the gala “as his TOP fan!”
    


            Trump's reelection and his newfound enthusiasm for crypto came at a fortunate time for Sun, the 34-year-old founder of blockchain company Tron. In 2023, US regulators charged Sun and his company with selling unregistered securities and fraudulently manipulating the price of the digital token Tronix.

            Sun, a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, became the first prominent investor to back the Trump family crypto project, World Liberty Financial, which launched in the fall of 2024. Sun eventually poured at least $75 million into the World Liberty token (which is separate from the $TRUMP token), and he's amassed more than $22 million worth of President Trump's memecoin, based on Wednesday's prices.
    


            All told, Sun's actions, including the buying they sparked from other crypto enthusiasts, have generated an estimated $400 million windfall for the Trump family, according to Forbes.
    


            Then, about a month into Trump's second term, the Securities and Exchange Commission did a 180 on virtually all of its crypto enforcement actions, including the civil fraud charges it had filed against Sun and his company. In February, SEC lawyers asked a federal judge to put the agency's civil fraud case on hold, citing “the public's interest.”
    


            Sun is a polarizing figure, even within crypto. He's known as a showman, having previously spent $4.6 million on a dinner with Warren Buffett (which Sun canceled and rescheduled) and $28 million to join Jeff Bezos aboard Blue Origin's first crewed mission (though Sun had to drop out). Sun, who told Forbes his net worth from his expansive crypto empire is over $40 billion, made headlines last year when he bought a $6.2 million conceptual artwork of a banana duct-taped to a wall. He promptly ate the banana.

            US President Donald Trump's whirlwind visit last week to the Middle East saw a wave of AI dealmaking that could reshape the global technology landscape.
    


            On May 12, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund Public Investment Fund announced the establishment of AI startup Humain. US companies Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm also announced deals to supply chips and partner on AI infrastructure with Humain.
    


            The Trump administration also announced that it would rescind and replace the “AI Diffusion” rule, a Biden-era regulation capping sales of the most advanced chips that was set to take effect on May 15.
    


            On the final leg of the tour, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that they will partner to build a data center complex in Abu Dhabi with 5-gigawatts of capacity – the largest data center cluster outside of the US, according to the Commerce Department. By comparison, the current global market capacity of data centers is approximately 59 gigawatts – according to Goldman Sachs.



            The Trump administration said that it also secured Saudi and UAE investment for data centers located in the US.
    


            In Abu Dhabi, Trump said that the countries had “agreed to create a path for the UAE to buy some of the world's most advanced AI semiconductors from American companies.”
    


            The deals, and new partnerships, could reshape the global AI landscape in myriad ways, according to officials and experts.
    


            “We're still waiting for the full details to emerge, but the scale of some of these announced projects is massive,” says Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, whose focus is technology and international affairs.
    


            In recent years, Beijing and Washington have been vying for supremacy in AI technology that could confer the winner advantages in economic productivity, scientific breakthroughs and national security.
    


            Trump's AI czar David Sacks said in a post on X that the deals are a “game-changer in the global AI race” that will “help to cement American technology as the global standard – before our competitors can catch up.”
    


            Some experts agree that working with the Middle East will fill gaps in current US capabilities. AI models require vast amounts of computing power, commonly referred to simply as “compute,” to train and run. That requires huge amounts of energy.
    


            “We have a huge problem when it comes to fueling our own data center infrastructure in the US,” Mohammed Soliman, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think-tank in Washington-DC, tells CNN.
    


            Growing demand for energy to power data centers has strained parts of the US grid. Although some say the issue can be resolved domestically, others say partnering with the oil-rich Gulf is a wise strategic bet.
    


            “There's not really an immediate [domestic] solution,” Soliman adds, “You need to invest heavily in energy infrastructure, and that takes capital, land, a lot of resources, and time.”
    


            But some are concerned about how the flow of chips to the Gulf will be controlled. On May 19, leading Democrats warned in a letter that “the deals – without any clear and enforceable protections to stop this sensitive technology from falling into China's hands – present an immediate national security threat.”
    


            If chips are given directly to Saudi and Emirati companies, without the right safeguards, it could present national security risks, and the nations could employ them for tasks like autonomous weapons research and development, says Winter-Levy.
    


            In another possible scenario, in which the data centers might be controlled and operated by US tech companies, he says the risks are more limited.
    


            The UAE and Saudi Arabia both have ambitious plans to build AI industries to prepare their economies for a post-oil future.
    


            US authorities say that not working with the Gulf could have increased the risks of a Gulf-China AI alliance. The chip technology of companies like Huawei is quickly advancing. “If we reject them, we will drive them into China's arms,” said Sacks' X post.
    


            While much is still unknown, one thing is clear: The Gulf's role in the global AI landscape is growing.
    


            “This could well see the emergence of the Gulf as the third-biggest power in the AI competition,” says Winter-Levy. “If the countries use the chips to train their own frontier models, the Gulf could move closer to competing with the US on the technology.”
    


            He adds that current talent constraints might hold the region back from competing with current AI leaders US and China.
    


            Experts say the deals mark a new era in US-Gulf relations. “This is going to be a pivotal moment for the way the US-Gulf relationship is defined,” says Soliman. “It's no longer about crude; it's mostly about compute.”
    


            In the Democrats' letter, they urged the administration to make sure “American technology prioritizes the buildout of this critical industry here at home, not abroad.”
    


            But if a situation emerges in the future where a significant amount of US computing power is in the region, said Winter-Levy, it could give Gulf governments “some significant degree of leverage, both over US tech companies but also over US foreign policy more generally.”

In an elaborate battle of Senate procedure, Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) set the stage for California‘s strict emissions standards to be repealed.

The gambit, which unfolded over five hours of voting on Wednesday night, required Thune to establish that Republicans have the authority to undo three environmental waivers granted to California at the end of the Biden administration.

But first, Republicans had to overcome a series of objections raised by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who accused Republicans of setting a filibuster-breaking precedent with their vote.

A vote for repeal would ignore the Government Accountability Office, which determined the waivers are not eligible under a fast-tracking process used to reverse regulations.

However, Republicans argued that the waiver was a peculiar circumstance that needed Senate clarification, and that the GAO had erred by weighing in.

In a 51-46 vote that fell along party lines, Republicans affirmed their ability to repeal the waivers, clearing the way for the first of three to be withdrawn on Thursday morning.

The floor vote reflected a carefully calibrated attempt not to challenge the parliamentarian directly, a prospect that initially prompted GOP concern. The parliamentarian said she would side with the GAO if asked for a ruling.

It also marked an early test of Thune's control of the floor since he became majority leader in January.

Democrats were ultimately unsuccessful as Schumer moved to recess or adjourn the chamber. In one convoluted exchange, he attempted to block Thune by raising a “point of order that points of order are not in order.”

Schumer relented shortly before 11 p.m., but not before warning that Democrats would take an expansive view of the filibuster-skirting Congressional Review Act when they returned to power.

“Make no mistake, Republicans have set a new precedent that will come back to haunt them and haunt this chamber,” Schumer said. “What goes around comes around.”

THUNE IGNORES PARLIAMENTARIAN TO TEE UP CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS VOTE

Thune rebutted Schumer in a Tuesday floor speech announcing the vote and again on Wednesday. In a Washington Examiner op-ed, Thune denied that Republicans were weakening the filibuster and accused the “audacious” GAO of improperly limiting Congress's power.

Both the Trump administration and the GOP-led House have interpreted the waivers as regulations eligible for repeal.

The suspected gunman accused of murdering two Israeli diplomats on Wednesday night allegedly chanted “free, free Palestine” while in the custody of law enforcement officials. The shooting occurred at an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.

A post shared by Jewish Lives Matter (@jewishlivesmatter)

While updating the media about the murders, Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith provided the name of the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, and chronicled the events leading up to the shooting. She said he shot at four people before killing the man and woman whose identities were not initially released, according to reports.

Early Thursday morning, the victims were identified as Israeli Embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.

“Prior to the shooting, a suspect was observed pacing outside of the museum,” Smith said. 

“The suspect chanted, ‘free, free Palestine,' while in custody. The suspect has been identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, Illinois,” Smith added.

She said the victims were about to be engaged, with the male victim recently purchasing a wedding ring and planning to propose during a visit to Jerusalem. 

“The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of ‘free Palestine' was a couple about to be engaged,” Smith said. 

Tal Naim Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said the victims were shot and killed “at close range,” the Times of Israel reported.

Attorney General Pam Bondi visited the crime scene shortly after the news of the murders. She and Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro detailed the incident at a press conference. Pirro will prosecute the case. Bondi condemned the act of violence. 

Bondi posted about the shooting on her X account and said she is praying for the victims. 

I am on the scene of the horrible shooting outside the Washington, DC Capital Jewish Museum with @USAttyPirro. Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more.

Earlier in the night, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also condemned the attack, calling it a “depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism” in a post on X.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) also commented about the attack, saying the “free Palestine” mantra is now associated with “terrorism.”

“‘Free Palestine' isn't resistance,” Mace said. “It's terrorism. And it's being fueled by cowards who excuse it with cheap slogans and scarves.”

“I support all Jews and the state of Israel,” she added. “‘May their memory be a blessing.'”

Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a tribute to Lischinsky and Milgrim on its X account on Thursday morning.

“We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington — Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim,” said the post. “May their memory be a blessing. We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always. Israeli diplomats and representatives around the world stand on the frontlines of Israel's diplomatic efforts — defending the country with their very lives. We will not be deterred by terror. We will continue our mission across the globe, with unwavering commitment to represent Israel with pride.”

Lischinsky, 30, was a research assistant in the political department at the embassy, while Milgrim, 26, organized trips to Israel, according to the Israeli foreign ministry.
    


            • The sole suspect was identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, who chanted “Free, free Palestine” while in custody, police said. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter waited for police to arrive before saying he “did it for Gaza.”
    


            • President Donald Trump said antisemitism, “hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said today that federal and local officials are working together in the probe and the shooter will “be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            The White House said “hatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump” and vowed that the man suspected of killing two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, DC, last night would be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing to reporters today that Trump is “saddened and outraged” over the killing of the embassy workers.
    


                    “The evil of antisemitism must be eradicated from our society,” she said.
                





            She called the two diplomats killed, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, a “beautiful young couple” and talked about their love for each other. They were expected to be engaged, officials said.
    


            Leavitt said she talked to Attorney General Pam Bondi this morning. The Justice Department will be “prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.
    


            Shortly after two Israeli embassy staffers were killed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night, a lengthy letter authorities are investigating as potentially being authored by the suspected gunman was posted to social media advocating for violent retaliation over the war in Gaza.
    


            The letter was posted to an account on X that has a long history of expressing outrage over Israel's treatment of Palestinians. A CNN review of that X account, @kyotoleather, found that it is linked to other accounts with the name and photo of Elias Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago who authorities identified as the suspected shooter and included replies in which other users addressed him by name. Authorities are also investigating whether the account was Rodriguez's, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
    


            The letter posted on Wednesday expressed fury over the “atrocities committed by the Israelis against Palestine” and referenced “armed action” as a valid form of protest – one that is “the only sane thing to do.”
    


                    FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X, that “the FBI is aware of certain writings allegedly authored by the suspect, and we hope to have updates as to the authenticity very soon.”
                





            Police say that Rodriguez approached a group of four people outside the Capital Jewish Museum and opened fire with a handgun shortly after 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, fatally killing two people who worked for the Israeli Embassy. Police detained Rodriguez about 20 minutes after the shooting. As he was detained, video showed him yelling, “Free, free Palestine.”
    


            The letter was posted to X around 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. It is not clear who posted it or if it was a pre-scheduled post set before the incident.
    


            The letter describes the author's anger with a perceived a lack of action from Western and Arab governments to stop Israel's war in Gaza, advocates for armed action and compares it to forms of nonviolent protest.
    


CNN's Sabrina Shulman, Evan Perez and Holmes Lybrand contributed reporting to this post. 



            US President Donald Trump expressed his “deep sorrow” over the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in a phone call with Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu today, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.
    


            Netanyahu also thanked Trump for “the efforts he and his administration are making against manifestations of anti-Semitism in the United States,” it added.
    


                    “The president reaffirmed his commitment to uproot the violent antisemitism that has swept across university campuses in this country,” Israeli Ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter told reporters earlier outside the Capital Jewish Museum today.
                





            CNN has reached out to the White House about the call.
    


            Leiter said he talked to Trump last night and met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and interim DC attorney Jeanine Pirro at the site of the shooting. He said the US president was “very firm in his statement expressing condolence and condemning violence.”
    


This post has been updated with more from the Trump-Netanyahu call. 



            The alleged shooter is expected to make his first appearance today in Federal court later this afternoon, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The suspect was identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, who chanted “Free, free Palestine” while in custody, police said. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter waited for police to arrive before saying he “did it for Gaza.”
    


            Sarah Milgrim, one of the Israeli Embassy staffers killed last night, was “a devoted and active volunteer” for Tech2Peace, an organization that provides entrepreneurial training to young Palestinians and Israelis alongside conflict dialogue.
    


                    “Sarah was a deeply curious person, always seeking to learn and connect. She brought people together with empathy and purpose, and her dedication to building a better future was evident in everything she did. Her voice and spirit will be profoundly missed,” Tech2Peace said in a statement today.
                





            Esti Rozenfeld, CEO of Tech2Peace, told CNN that Milgrim managed two seminars while she worked there, which was an intensive process. She said Milgrim “came here to promote peace, to promote the effort in this beloved land for dialogue, for partnership, for commitment.”
    


            Rozenfeld said plans were in the works for a memorial to honor Milgrim next week. “The community is heartbroken,” she said.
    


            Yaron Lischinsky, the other victim of the shooting, was a “respectful and kind person” who loved books and working in diplomacy, one of his friends from Reichman University in Israel told CNN.
    


                    “We would sit in various coffee shops around Jerusalem, discussing religion, politics, and books,” his friend Jakub Klepek told CNN in a message. “We often exchanged book titles and then jokingly complained about not being able to start new ones because of our university reading lists.”
                





            “What made him stand out was not just his intelligence, but his generosity of spirit,” Klepek said, who also described 30-year-old Lischinsky as a “man of purpose.”
    


            FBI Chicago is “is conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity in the Chicago area in relation to yesterday's tragic shooting in Washington, D.C.,” according to a post on X from the FBI's Washington field office.
    


            Earlier, CNN observed that law enforcement was searching an address in Chicago that appeared to be associated with the suspected shooter.
    


            Law enforcement did not confirm that the address was associated with the shooter but public records appear to show that.
    


            Investigators today are talking to witnesses and poring through the background of the suspect in the Capital Jewish Museum shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers, with the expectation that he will face hate crime and other federal charges, according to people briefed on the investigation.
    


            A so-called manifesto making the rounds online and possibly connected to the suspect is among the information investigators are reviewing, according to multiple law enforcement sources, as members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and Washington, DC's, Metropolitan Police try to determine how the suspect allegedly chose to carry out the attack at the museum event, which is across from the FBI's Washington, DC, field office.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI officials have highlighted the apparent antisemitic connections to the shooting, and members of an antisemitism task force were with Bondi as she visited the site of the shooting today.
    


            Police said the suspect was from Chicago, and it's unclear what if any connections he has with Washington, and how long he has been in the city.
    


            Witnesses have told investigators that the suspect verified with bystanders that the museum was at the location. Organizers of the event did not list its location, which according to the American Jewish Committee's website was available upon registration.
    


            Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's accusation that European officials are inciting antisemitism is “outrageous and completely unjustified,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson said today.
    


            Sa'ar earlier said an atmosphere of “antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement” led to the killings of Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, DC, pointing blame at officials in “many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe.”
    


                    French foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told journalists this accusation was “outrageous and completely unjustified,” adding that “France has condemned, France condemns, and France will continue to always and unambiguously condemn any antisemitic act.”
                





            France denounced the killings of the staffers' killings “in the strongest possible terms,” Lemoine said, describing the shooting as “an antisemitic, heinous, and unacceptable act.”
    


            “Nothing can justify such violence. France reaffirms its absolute rejection of antisemitism in all its forms and is using all means at its disposal to combat this scourge,” he added.
    


Some context: Sa'ar's accusation came with the backdrop of tense diplomatic relations between Israel and European leaders, as both the European Union and the United Kingdom announced measures distancing themselves from Israel over its new military offensive and aid blockade in Gaza.
    


            The UK paused trade negotiations and sanctioned West Bank settlers as Britain's foreign minister slammed Israel's actions in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” Meanwhile, the EU announced it would review its relationship with Israel, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip” as his military roots out Hamas in the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians face starvation due to the Israeli blockade.
    


            The executive director of the Lillian and Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum said they are “heartbroken” by the murders of two Israeli embassy staffers last night.
    


            “We are heartbroken by the murders of Yaron (Lischinsky) and Sarah Milgrim, and send our sincere condolences to their families and friends. May they, and all who grieve this devastating loss, be comforted by their communities,” Dr. Beatrice Gurwitz said.
    


            The two diplomats were shot and killed shortly after leaving an event at the museum.
    


                    “In an act of horrific antisemitic violence, a gunman attacked our beloved community. This tragedy is devastating. Such acts of terror attempt to instill fear, silence voices, and erase history — but we refuse to let them succeed,” she said.
                





            Gurwitz said her team is working to reopen the museum in the coming days “with all necessary security in place, so we can return to telling the story of Jewish Washington for thousands of visitors from around the world.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters in Washington, DC, from the scene of the fatal shooting, said the suspect “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law” and lauded law enforcement for their response.
    


                    “No parents should have to be called and told that their children were violently murdered leaving a religious event at the Jewish Museum,” Bondi said. “That should never happen in this world and not in our country. And this person will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
                





            Bondi declined to comment on where the investigation stands and whether the suspect, who is in custody, is cooperating with authorities. She also declined to say whether the Justice Department would pursue the death penalty in the case.
    


            The attorney general said that federal and local law enforcement are working “hand in hand” to investigate the “horrific” attack, and that the department is “doing everything we can to protect our entire community, and especially our Jewish community.”
    


            Leo Terrell, head of the Justice Department task force to combat antisemitism task force, stood next to Bondi as she spoke to reporters.
    


            Combating extremism and hate crimes will take “a whole of government and whole of society effort,” Brian Levin, the chair of the California Commission on the State of Hate, said today.
    


            Levin, who also leads a research and policy center at California State University, San Bernardino, slammed the Trump administration's moves to cut funding for things like hate crime training for law enforcement and grants related to domestic extremism.
    


                    “We need to have the federal government be a partner. They have cut all the research and they've changed what they're doing with regard to the data,” Levin told CNN.
                





            He said this is a “national security issue” and will require bipartisan support to “renew efforts to protect Jews and Jewish institutions.”
    


            Levin's comments came after two Israeli diplomats were killed in Washington, DC, last night. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter had waited for police to arrive before saying he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Once in custody, the DC gunman chanted: “Free, free Palestine.”
    


            Antisemitism has surged around the globe over the past decade, according to the Anti-Defamation League. A striking 46% of adults across the globe harbor “deeply entrenched” antisemitic attitudes, according to an annual survey conducted by the ADL, published in January.
    


            Levin said one thing that could contribute to these attitudes is “bigoted rhetoric online,” which oftentimes is accompanied by hate crimes. He claimed religious hate crimes specifically have continued to rise.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN that one of the victims of last night's shooting, Yaron Lischinsky, identifies as Jewish, adding that he has a Christian mother and Jewish father. He had worked at the embassy for a little over two years.
    


            The other victim, Sarah Milgrim, an American from Kansas, had started working there shortly after the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel.
    


            Their relationship and love for each other was well-known at the Israeli Embassy, where they met, said the official.
    


                    “It was the cutest love story,” the official said, adding it was “like a poster for a Netflix rom-com.” They would often be seen having lunch together at the embassy.
                





            Lischinsky's plan to propose to Milgrim in Jerusalem was also known, the official said. Milgrim hadn't met Lischinsky's family in Israel yet, and they planned to do that at the same time as getting engaged.
    


            While Lischinsky worked in the embassy's political section, Milgrim helped coordinate a variety of groups' travels to Israel, including political, religious and others, like visitors studying climate change.
    


            A security team has been sent over from Israel to assess the situation and review protocols, as is standard when embassy personnel are attacked around the world. The embassy is also providing support services to personnel in the wake of their colleagues' killing.
    


            There were two other Israeli Embassy staffers who were with shooting victims Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim when they were killed, an Israeli official tells CNN.
    


            Both were young American women, and neither one was injured in the shooting.
    


            KU Hillel, a Jewish student organization at the University of Kansas, said it is mourning the loss of “beloved” alumna Sarah Milgrim and her boyfriend Yaron Lischinsky “with profound sadness.”
    


            Milgrim graduated from the University of Kansas in 2021, according to KU Hillel.
    


                    “Sarah's bright spirit and passion for the Jewish community touched everyone fortunate enough to know her. Those closest to her describe (her) as ‘the definition of the best person,” KU Hillel said in a statement today.
                





            The organization said she served as a member of KU Hillel's Board of Directors and “exemplified the values we hold dear.”
    


            “In the face of such hateful violence, we come together as a community to support one another and to honor Sarah's memory,” the statement continued. “May Sarah and Yaron's memories always be a blessing.”
    


            Milgrim also graduated from American University in 2023 with a Master's degree in International Affairs.
    


            “Sarah was only beginning her life's journey, and it is anguishing that her light was taken away because of hate,” the President of American University Jonathan Alger said in a statement.
    


This post has been updated with the statement from American University. 



            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that he spoke to the parents of the two Israeli embassy staff members killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.
    


                    “The Prime Minister told the families that he shares in their deep sorrow, together with the entire Jewish People,” according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.
                





            Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine,” while being arrested in Washington, DC, last night, authorities said.
    


            Netanyahu also spoke with US Attorney General Pam Bondi, “who promised that the murderer, and everyone who cooperated with him, would be brought to justice,” the statement said.
    


            Veteran Israeli diplomat Ron Prosor said the killing of two embassy staffers in Washington, DC, did not “happen in a warzone” but “in the capital of the free world.”
    


            Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine,” while being arrested in Washington, DC, last night, authorities said.
    


            Prosor, who currently serves as Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in a post on X that Lischinsky was “a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause.”
    


            Prosor called Lischinsky “bright, curious, engaged” and said he “embodied the Judeo-Christian values.”
    


            Lischinsky was born in Nuremberg, Germany, Prosor said, adding that Lischinsky was his master's student at Reichman University in Tel Aviv.
    


            Prosor said he paid his condolences to Lischinsky's parents this morning.
    


Reactions from US politicians to the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, last night continue to pour in, with leaders from across the political spectrum decrying the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members.
    


Here's what some US politicians have said: 



Vice President JD Vance: “My heart breaks for Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, who were murdered last night at the Capital Jewish Museum. Antisemitic violence has no place in the United States. We're praying for their families and all of our friends at the Israeli Embassy, where the two victims worked,” he said in a post on X.
    


US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee: “People here in Israel are devastated,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “I got a call early this morning Jerusalem time from Pam Bondi, the Attorney General. She was at the scene. She gave me a brief on what was going on. I've spoken with the foreign minister. I've spoken with the minister, the Ambassador of Israel to the US and to the father of the young man who lives here in Israel.”
    


Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: “Young Jewish people and diplomats came together in a museum built to honor their shared history but then had to flee gun shots and witness the killing of a young couple. As a Jew who led the building of a museum dedicated to standing up against bigotry and hatred, I know how sacred these places are and what trauma this incident has caused,” he said in a statement.
    


Office of the Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff: “Last night's horrific murder of two Israeli emb(a)sssy staff members was an act of antisemitic terrror, tragic and senseless. I continue to pray for the victims' loved ones. This evil has no place in our world. Rest assured, justice will be served,” he said in a post on X. 



Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro: “Next week, Yaron and Sarah were headed to Jerusalem, where Yaron would propose. I proposed to Lori in Jerusalem under the Montefiore Windmill, and we were married 28 years ago this Sunday. Yaron and Sarah should have had the same opportunity — and a life together far beyond what their murderer cut short. May their memories be a blessing and a call to action for each of us,” Shapiro posted on X.
    


Former Vice President Kamala Harris: “Doug and my prayers are with the loved ones of Yaron and Sarah — two young Israeli diplomats murdered in what appears to be a shocking act of antisemitic violence. I stand with the entire Jewish community in condemning this sickening violence. Antisemitism and violence have no place in our country. We all must come together and fight hatred,” Harris said on X.
    


Former second gentleman Doug Emhoff: “The shocking murder of two young Israeli diplomats in DC is horrifying, heartbreaking and completely unacceptable. Jews must be able to gather without fear or violence. We will not be silent and we will never let antisemitic terror defeat us. May the memory of Yaron and Sarah be a blessing,” he said in a post on X.

            Yaron Lischinsky, one of the Israeli embassy staffers killed last night, dreamed of being a diplomat after studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, according to his former professor.
    


            “Yaron was an outstanding student and a wonderful person,” said Nissim Otmazgin, the Dean of Humanities at the university. “His dream was to become a diplomat. He was actually just starting his new career as a diplomat, he was murdered.”
    


            Otmazgin, who taught Lischinsky in three different courses related to Japanese studies, said he was “an excellent student” and “very much dedicated.” Otmazgin remembers him getting a perfect score on an honors seminar, a sign of how hard he worked.
    


            The professor said Lischinsky truly “became an Israeli” after moving from Germany.
    


            “In many ways, I think for me, he symbolizes the hope of Israel,” Otmazgin said. “Young people — idealistic — that are going abroad, studying about different cultures, and trying to do good for their country. So in this sense, it is not only a personal tragedy, it's also kind of public tragedy.”
    


            “He is the best that Israel can offer,” Otmazgin said.
    


            The United Arab Emirates has denounced the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, DC, last night.
    


                    “The UAE condemns the killing of employees at the Israeli embassy in Washington,” the state news agency WAM Thursday reported in a post on X.
                





            In 2020, the UAE and Israel established relations under the Abraham Accords Peace Agreement with the United States.
    


            Law enforcement are searching an address in Chicago that appears to be associated with the suspected shooter, CNN has observed.
    


            Many law enforcement vehicles were pulling up on the block to allow for others to park in front of the building. The scene remains very active. Currently, there are approximately twenty law enforcement vehicles on scene. Chicago police shut down the street.
    


            Law enforcement has not confirmed that the address is linked to the suspect but public records show it may be associated with him.
    


            The area is in the Albany Park neighborhood on Chicago's north side, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the city.
    


            Earlier on Thursday, Dan Bongino, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in a post on X that the shooting of two Israeli diplomats on Wednesday night “has the full attention of your FBI.”
    


                    “Targeted acts of anti-Semitic violence are typically carried out by spineless, gutless cowards. And the penalties will be harsh as we tighten up this investigation and run down any additional leads. I should have additional updates for you shortly as I head back to FBI HQ,” he said.
                





            The German-Israeli Society, an organization in Germany that promotes relations with Israel, said the Israeli embassy staffer who was killed in Washington, DC, was a founding member of its sister organization, and that he “will be greatly missed.”
    


                    “Yaron Lischinsky was a founding member of the Young Forum of the Israeli-German Society, our sister organization that connects young Israelis and Germans and initiates joint projects,” the German-Israeli Society said in a statement today.
                





            “In this role, he organized numerous political and cultural events in cooperation with the Young Forum of the German-Israeli Society and thus made a significant contribution to strengthening German-Israeli relations,” it said.
    


            Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told lawmakers in the Bundestag today that Lischinsky held both German and Israeli nationality.
    


                    The Society described Lischinsky as “an incredibly warm, intelligent, calm and interested person.” 
                





            He had a passion for photography, and “focused his lens on the special corners and details that others often missed.”
    


            New details continue to emerge about a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, that killed two young diplomats last night.
    


            The suspected shooter is in custody. Eyewitnesses told CNN the suspected shooter waited for police to arrive before saying he “did it for Gaza.”
    


If you are just reading in, here's what you need to know about the shooting: 



CNN's Eugenia Yosef, Michael Schwartz, Nadeen Ebrahim, Catherine Nicholls, Lex Harvey, Diego Mendoza, Jessie Yeung, Teele Rebane, Isaac Yee, Samantha Waldenberg and Elise Hammond contributed reporting to this post.



            Jonathan Epstein, a witness to the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum, told CNN Thursday he initially thought the loud noises at the scene were construction and looked the shooter in the eyes.
    


                    “The event had just wrapped up. A couple of us were touring the galleries upstairs and out of nowhere, we hear a series of loud bangs, just ‘boom, boom, boom,' one after the other. And my friend was like ‘were those gunshots?' And I was like ‘no, no, no that was just construction we're fine,'” Epstein described on “CNN News Central.”
                





            He continued, “Then we went downstairs to the main lobby where the event was held. A man rushed in and said he had dislocated his shoulder, said there were indeed gunshots. Security at the event ushered us quickly back into a safe location behind the main room, and we were there for a few minutes.”
    


            Epstein said he thought it was a “random shooting” in the neighborhood at first. Then he heard a man yell “free Palestine,” in which he said he thought was a just a protester in the area.
    


                    “I had no idea that he was the shooter. I walk out. I see him yelling again. I see security right now, they run, grab him and take him outside and he is still yelling and had no idea he was the shooter we got pretty close I was ten feet away from him, I look him in the eyes and then I stepped back,” he said.
                





            Shooting victim Yaron Lischinsky, one of the Israeli Embassy staffers killed in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night, held a German passport.
    


            Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told lawmakers in the German Bundestag on Thursday that Lischinsky was an Israeli diplomat and held German citizenship.
    


            “I think I speak for the whole House in saying that this has shaken us, that our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the murdered and the members of the Israeli foreign service,” said Wadephul, condemning the “insidious murder” of the couple.
    


            Israel's foreign ministry provided more details about the work of the two victims of the shooting in Washington, DC.
    


            Yaron Lischinsky, 30, was a research assistant in the political department at the embassy.
    


            Sarah Milgrim, 26, organized trips to Israel, according to a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry.
    


            The Embassy of Israel to the USA said in an earlier social media post that “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.”
    


            “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss,” the embassy said.
    


            American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said “our worst fears came true” following the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members at an event the committee hosted on Wednesday night.
    


                    “Last night, really our worst fears came true. This was an event we all look forward to every year that brings together AJC's young leaders,“ Deutch said on Thursday. “This year, the focus was on humanitarian diplomacy. It was on finding ways to work together in an interfaith way across the region to help bring peace.”
                





            He continued, “There were friends and allies of the Jewish community, people from across the diplomatic world. And all of the good feeling was shattered immediately after when these two, when these two beautiful young souls were taken by this murderer.”
    


            Deutch said he was very familiar with both of the victims, telling CNN's “This Morning” that “Yaron is an Israeli Jew. Sarah is an American Jew. Sarah was deeply involved with AJC. She's traveled with AJC. She cared deeply for our work in the diplomatic space. And she and Yaron had a beautiful relationship. It's a tragedy, of the worst magnitude that these beautiful young people were taken from us.”
    


            The former Florida congressman said, “this is a horrific reminder to the Jewish community in the world that antisemitism, often most times, is not violent until it becomes violent.”
    


            Deutch said the reaction to the shooting last night from the Trump administration and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has been strong, but that “everyone has a role to play.”
    


                    “But more than that, it's everyone across society. It's college professors and doctors and lawyers and store owners, all of them standing together saying they're not — we will not tolerate this kind of antisemitism and hatred that can lead to this kind of horrific violence. We have to come together to say that and to give those words real meaning. Everyone has a role to play,” he said.
                





            The Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, outside of which two Israeli embassy staff members were killed in a shooting on Wednesday night, expressed condolences and horror at the violence that took place after an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and horrified by the senseless violence outside the Museum this evening. Our condolences and heartfelt sympathies go to the victims and their families,” the museum said in a statement.
    


            The museum is in downtown Washington DC, several blocks north of the National Mall and near Judiciary Square.
    


            The Hebrew University of Jerusalem expressed “deep sorrow” Thursday over the killing of Israeli embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in Washington, DC.
    


            Lischinsky “was a graduate of the Hebrew University, having completed his degree in International Relations and Asian Studies in 2021,” the university said in a statement Thursday.
    


            “We share in the profound grief of their families and loved ones.”
    


            France's Interior Ministry will tighten security around symbolic Jewish sites throughout the country, following the shooting that happened just outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.
    


            Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau asked regional officials to “tighten security around symbolic sites and to contact representatives of the Jewish community,” according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, citing a comment from the minister's entourage on Thursday morning.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attack in Washington as antisemitic, adding that he extended “our thoughts to the families and loved ones of the victims” to Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
    


            “The murder of two members of the Israeli embassy near the Jewish Museum in Washington is an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity. Nothing can justify such violence,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar blamed an atmosphere of “antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement” for the killings of two staffers of Israel's embassy in Washington, DC.
    


            “There is a direct line connecting antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement to this murder,” Sa'ar said at a news conference on Thursday in Jerusalem. “This incitement is also done by leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe.”
    


            Sa'ar went on to say that there is a concern in European countries for security threats against Israeli missions abroad and the Jewish community. “What is (lacking) I feel is the connection between the atmosphere created – the specific words – and this kind of wave of antisemitism we are facing,” he said.
    


            His comments come amid a tense week in the country's diplomatic relations, as both the European Union and the United Kingdom announced measures distancing themselves from Israel.
    


            The UK paused trade negotiations and sanctioned West Bank settlers, as Britain's foreign minister slammed Israel's operation in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” Meanwhile, the EU announced that it would review its relationship with Israel, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic.”
    


            On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada threatened to take “concrete actions,” including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not stop its renewed military offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza.
    


            Since May 5, Israel has been conducting a new offensive in Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Monday that his country plans to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip.”
    


            IsraAID, an Israel-based non-governmental organization, said the event in Washington, DC, where two Israeli staff members were shot dead was focused on humanitarian aid for Gaza.
    


            The event, where IsraAID members were keynote speakers, “focused on bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israeli-Palestinian and regional collaboration,” the NGO said in a statement Thursday.
    


                    “We, and all the attendees, gathered in the interest of finding practical solutions to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and showing that working together is the only way forward for all the people in the region,” IsraAID said, adding that “the brutal and tragic irony that such an event – motivated by humanitarian principles – was targeted for more violence is heartbreaking.”
                





            On Wednesday, trucks  loaded with humanitarian aid began delivering the first stocks of food and supplies in Gaza, marking the first time any humanitarian supplies have entered the enclave since Israel imposed a complete blockade on the territory in early-March.
    


            The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Wednesday that the aid delivery was “nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza.”
    


            Eyewitnesses described to CNN the shock and confusion that unfolded at the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting an event, when a shooter outside the venue in Washington, DC, killed two staff members of the Israeli Embassy — a couple planning to get engaged.
    


            The event had just ended at around 9 p.m. when gunshots rang out, said attendee Sara Marinuzzi, 28.
    


            The shooting took place outside the building, killing the victims who Israeli officials later identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. They had been leaving an event when the gunman opened fire, police said.
    


            Then, attendees saw a man run into the museum. He seemed shaken, so many assumed he had been a bystander or eyewitness. Several asked if he was injured, and security guards offered him water. He didn't interact much with the other attendees, said 31-year-old attendee Yoni Kalin.
    


                    “I went up to him and asked if he was okay as he muttered ‘call the police' again and again. He said he was okay. Then I asked if he was shot, he said he wasn't,” said Paige Siegel, another attendee.
                





            Marinuzzi also described the man as asking security to call the police, and that he was “having erratic behavior.”
    


            It was only when police arrived, around 10 minutes later, that the man said he was responsible for the crime — stunning those around him. He said, “I did it, I did it for Gaza. Free Palestine!” Marinuzzi recalled.
    


            Siegel was shocked, too. “He was so shaken when I spoke to him that he seemed harmless,” she said.
    


            “It's horrible,” Kalin told CNN. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.”
    


            Police have since identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, 30, from Chicago, Illinois. Rodriguez was not previously known to police, who said they believed he was the sole shooter. As of late Wednesday night, he was being questioned by the FBI and DC police.
    


            Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said he is “very worried” about more attacks on diplomatic missions around the world following the killing of two embassy staffers in Washington, DC.
    


                    “I have been worried for the past few months that something like this would happen and it did, and the list of fallen foreign service members has grown today,” Sa'ar said, speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem on Thursday.
                





            He also said there have been a number of attacks and attempted attacks on Israeli missions around the world, many of which he says have not been reported.
    


            “There is no one week without a terror attacks or attempts (at) terror attacks around the world and usually more than one,” he said in response to a question from CNN.
    


            Sa'ar said he spoke with the father of one of the victims, Yaron Lischinsky, earlier Thursday.
    


                    “I told him that his son was a warrior on our diplomatic front that fell just like a soldier on the battlefield,” Sa'ar said.
                





            He also said he has been in touch with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Israel's Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has ordered the reinforcement of security at Israel's missions worldwide following the attack.
    


            In the early hours of Thursday morning in Washington, DC, investigations are underway into a shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers the night before. The suspect has been detained and identified, with US and Israeli officials condemning the attack.
    


Here's what we know:



The victims: The man and woman killed were identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. The victims were a young couple who planned to get engaged next week in Jerusalem, according to the Israeli ambassador to the UN. They had been leaving an event when the shooting occurred.
    


The attack: The gunman was seen pacing outside the Capital Jewish Museum ahead of the shooting, according to police. Then the gunman approached four people and opened fire with a handgun, killing two. He went inside the museum, where he was detained, police said. Eyewitnesses told CNN he had waited for police to arrive before saying he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Once in custody, he chanted: “Free, free Palestine.”
    


The suspect: Police named the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois. They believe he was the lone gunman and said there was no active threat remaining. He is now being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and the FBI.
    


The investigation: The FBI and DC police have launched their investigation, and the Israeli Embassy is working with law enforcement, authorities said.
    


Reactions: Officials in both the US and Israel have vehemently condemned the shooting and drawn links to antisemitism, describing it as an attack on the Jewish community.
    


            The alleged shooter who gunned down two Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” as he was being taken into custody, according to an eyewitness.
    


            Eyewitness Yoni Kalin, 31, was at the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday night, attending an event organized by the American Jewish Committee, when shots rang out.
    


            Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, which was organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza. Kalin added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event.
    


                    “At first I didn't recognize them as gunshots,” Kalin told CNN in a phone interview.
                





            Moments later a man entered the museum appearing to be a witness, according to Kalin. He recalled the man sitting in the museum but not interacting with many of the people present at the event.
    


            Ten minutes later, when police entered the building, the man appeared to confess to the shooting, telling officers, “I did this, I did this for Palestine,” according to Kalin.
    


            “It's horrible,” Kalin told CNN. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.”
    


            Kalin added that in the period between when the man walked in and before his arrest, people went up to him to offer him water and to check if he was ok.
    


                    “I'm still in shock,” Kalin told CNN. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn't get us where we need to be.”
                





            Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs identified the victims of Wednesday's shooting in Washington, DC as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim.
    


                    “We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington — Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a post to X on Thursday.






            “We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read.
    


            In a separate post, the Israeli Embassy to the US wrote, “Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.”
    


                    “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.”
                





            Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the US, said the couple was about to be engaged.
    


            “A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” he said.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has ordered the reinforcement of security at Israel's missions worldwide following the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, DC on Wednesday.
    


            “My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
    


            “We are witnessing the terrible cost of antisemitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel,” said Netanyahu.
    


            US Attorney General Pam Bondi told Netanyahu that President Donald Trump is “personally involved in managing the response to the attack and that the United States will ensure the murderer is brought to justice,” according to the statement.
    


            She also asked Netanyahu to convey her condolences to the families of the young couple who were killed.
    


            Video obtained by CNN from an eyewitness appears to show the suspect in the deadly shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff yelling, “Free, free Palestine,” as he is taken into custody inside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night.
    


            Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith has identified the suspect in the shooting as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. She said at a news conference the attack is believed to have been carried out by just one person.
    


            The suspect was seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four people and shooting two of them, Smith said. The suspect then went inside the museum, where he was eventually detained.
    


            A separate eyewitness, Sara Marinuzzi, told CNN the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once he was inside the museum and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming he carried out the attack “for Gaza.” Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard him say “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.”
    


            Metadata from the video confirms it was taken on Wednesday night at the Capital Jewish Museum at 9:19 p.m.
    


            Israel's ambassador to the United Nations said his country's embassies are on “high alert” following the fatal shooting of two embassy staff members in Washington, DC on Wednesday.
    


            “It is a very difficult night for all of us here in the United States,” Danny Danon told CNN's MJ Lee.
    


                    “It was an attack against Israel, an attack against the Jewish community, but also an attack against the US itself,” Danon said.
                





            The two embassy staffers who were killed were a couple who planned to get engaged next week in Jerusalem, Danon said. “Unfortunately, that will not happen.”
    


            Danon said world leaders need to do more to stop antisemitic hate crimes.
    


                    “Many leaders worldwide, they condemn antisemitism, and they condemn hate crimes, but they don't do enough to enforce it. We expect actions, not only declarations.”
                





            President Donald Trump expressed his condolences to the victims' families, saying the shooting that killed two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, DC, was “based obviously on antisemitism.” He added: “Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”
    


            Other top US officials also condemned the shooting Wednesday night:
    


            Paige Siegel, an eyewitness on the scene after the shooting in Washington, DC that killed two Israeli Embassy staff members, told CNN she spoke to the suspected shooter before realizing he was the suspect.
    


            The suspect ran into the Capital Jewish Museum after the shooting, where he waited for police to arrive, according to police and multiple eyewitnesses.
    


                    “I went up to him and asked if he was okay as he muttered call the police again and again. He said he was okay. Then I asked if he was shot, he said he wasn't,” Siegel recalled.
                





            “He was so shaken when I spoke to him that he seemed harmless. Obviously I didn't know at the time,” she said.
    


            Siegel said that shortly thereafter, the police arrived and the suspect was apprehended while yelling “Free Palestine!”
    


            Siegel said she is still processing what happened.
    


                    “Here we are, a bunch of Jews lumped in one room for him to pick us off. The terrorist sat on a bench, amongst us,” she said.
                





            Jewish people “cannot allow fear to dictate how we're going to live our lives,” the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington said following Wednesday's fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff.
    


            “It was a young couple about to get engaged and spend the rest of their lives together,” Ron Halber told CNN's MJ Lee.
    


                    “And that some depraved individual thought that shooting down two innocent young Jewish people, Israelis in the middle of Washington DC, was somehow going to accomplish an objective 6,000 miles away is just horrible,” Halber said.
                





            Still, he said, “The Jewish people are resilient. The people of Israel are resilient.”
    


                    “We have to live proud, open, Jewish lives, and take necessary security precautions.”
                





            The suspect named after Wednesday night's deadly shooting is being interviewed by the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police along with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, according to Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino.
    


            Bongino said the shooting happened close to the FBI's Washington Field Office, and that FBI police officers responded immediately and rendered aid after the attack.
    


                    “Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” he wrote on X.
                





            The US Attorney's office is on scene while the FBI reviews evidence at the Washington Field Office, he added.
    


            Israeli officials expressed outrage and offered condolences following a shooting that killed two employees of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC on Wednesday night near the Capital Jewish Museum.
    


            The fatal shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday occurred on the same night as the American Jewish Committee was holding an event for young professionals.
    


            The sold-out “Young Diplomats Reception” is described as an event “bringing together Jewish young professionals (22-45) and the diplomatic community,” according to its Eventbrite page. The event was organized by ACCESS, the American Jewish Committee's division for young professionals.
    


            The two Israeli embassy staff members who were shot dead were leaving an event, according to Pamela A. Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            The theme of this year's Young Diplomats Reception was “turning pain into purpose,” and featured speakers from the Multifaith Alliance and IsraAID, according to the Eventbrite page.
    


                    “Hear from members of the Multifaith Alliance and IsraAID, as they delve into humanitarian diplomacy and how a coalition of organizations - from the region and for the region - are working together in response to humanitarian crises throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,” the page read.
                





            The event was scheduled from 6:30-9 p.m. ET.
    


            CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the event would have likely hosted people from many different embassies.
    


                    “It's sort of a way for young professionals in the foreign policy and foreign service space to get to know each other, so in many ways it was counter to the hate that would be experienced that evening in DC,” Kayyem told CNN's MJ Lee.
                





            “This was an event that was bringing lots of young people together whose countries probably disagree on things, to try to leave it to the next generation,” Kayyem said.
    


            The man accused of killing a young couple outside the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night “pretended to be a witness” and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming he “did it for Gaza,” eyewitness Sara Marinuzzi told CNN.
    


            Marinuzzi, 28, said gunshots rang out shortly after the event ended at 9 p.m.
    


                    “There were some more shots and then a guy came running into the center, and the security guards offered him water, trying to comfort him. He was kind of having erratic behavior. They figured he witnessed the shooting,” Marinuzzi said.
                





            The man asked security to call the police, Marinuzzi said. Once police arrived about 10 minutes later, Marinuzzi said the man took accountability for the crime, saying “I did it, I did it for Gaza. Free Palestine!”
    


            Details are emerging about the deadly shooting that killed two people near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night.
    


Here's how the attack unfolded:



            President Donald Trump, in his first comments on Wednesday night's shooting, sent his condolences to the families of the two Israeli Embassy staff members who were killed near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.
    


                    “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.
                





            US Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a news conference following a shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC, which killed two people, that she spoke with President Donald Trump “multiple times tonight.”
    


                    “On behalf of the president, his prayers are with all of us, all of the Jewish community, everyone in Washington, DC, state, local and federal agencies, and our great US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who will be prosecuting this case,” Bondi said.
                





            Bondi added that federal agencies will “work hand-in-hand” with DC authorities to do “everything we can to keep our citizens safe.”
    


            “We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” she said.
    


            Trump issued his own statement on Truth Social shortly after, sending his condolences to the families of the couple that was killed.
    


            The two people shot Wednesday night near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC were a “young couple about to be engaged,” according to Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the US.
    


                    “The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of ‘Free Palestine,' was a young couple about to be engaged. A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” Leiter said.
                





            The couple was attending an event at the museum, the ambassador said. When asked by CNN's Holmes Lybrand if the suspect registered for the event, Leiter said he didn't know.
    


            Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said that a suspect is in custody in connection with the shooting near Capital Jewish Museum that left two dead.
    


                    “The preliminary investigation indicates that both victims were exiting an event at the Capitol Jewish Museum located in the 500 block of Third Street Northwest when the shooting occurred,” Smith said. “We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody. Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum.”
                





            Smith said that the suspect, which she named as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, “approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire striking both of our decedents.”
    


            After the shooting, Smith said that the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.
    


            The suspect chanted “Free Free Palestine” while in custody, Smith said.
    


            The suspect, who was not previously known to police, identified where he discarded the weapon once in custody, Smith said. The weapon has been recovered, and “he implied that he committed the offense,” she added.
    


            Following a shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday that killed two people, Mayor Muriel Bowser reassured the community that “there is no active threat.”
    


            “I will say up front that there is no active threat in our community,” Bowser said at a news conference.
    


                    Bowser went on to share a message of unity, saying “We're going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate antisemitism.”
                





            Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with other officials, is giving an update to the shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum.
    


            Tal Naim Cohen, spokesperson at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, said two of the embassy's staff members were shot on Wednesday night “at close range” while attending a Jewish event at the Capital Jewish Museum in the city.
    


                    “We have full faith in law enforcement authorities on both the local and federal levels to apprehend the shooter and protect Israel's representatives and Jewish communities throughout the United States,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
                





            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post on Wednesday that “two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.”
    


                    “We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share. Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice,” Noem said.
                





            DC Police say they are investigating a shooting across the street from the FBI's Washington Field Office. The Capital Jewish Museum is also nearby. The Israeli Embassy is working with law enforcement.
    


            The Israeli ambassador was not involved in the incident and was not at the location when the shooting happened, an embassy spokesperson told CNN.
    


            Ted Deutch, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said his organization was hosting an event at the Capital Jewish Museum Wednesday evening.
    


                    “We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue,” Deutch said in a statement. “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”
                





            Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that she's at the scene of the shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum Wednesday night.
    

I am on the scene of the horrible shooting outside the Washington, DC Capital Jewish Museum with @USAttyPirro. Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more.


            Danny Danon, Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, reacted to the reports of the shooting on Wednesday, saying on X:
    


                    “The fatal shooting that took place outside the event that took place at the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. – in which Israeli embassy employees were also injured – is a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.”
                





            Officials from Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and other European nations have condemned the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum.

The fate of the “one big beautiful” bill remains unclear as Freedom Caucus members hinge their support on whether the deal they made with President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday is cemented in the legislative text.

The manager's amendment, which allows for alterations to the bill, dropped a little before 9 p.m. Among the changes were a higher cap of $40,000 for the state and local tax deduction, a key demand of blue-state Republicans; Medicaid work requirements that begin Dec. 31, 2026, instead of 2029; and an earlier phase-out date for some of the Inflation Reduction Act energy credits. The latter two were sticking points for the Freedom Caucus.

The amendment also strikes language to sell federal lands in Nevada and Utah, changes “MAGA” savings accounts for children to “Trump accounts,” and removes a federal requirement that firearm suppressors must be registered.

Whether this is enough to sway fiscal hawks remains to be seen. They had emerged tight-lipped from a meeting at the White House after talks on how to move the bill forward fell apart overnight.

The Rules Committee has been debating the bill for nearly 20 hours as Democrats offer up hundreds of amendments on legislation that includes over $1.5 trillion in cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks. Over one hundred Democrats testified in front of the Rules Committee.

If it passes the Rules Committee, there will be two hours of debate on the House floor on the bill.

Neither Trump nor the holdouts met with reporters after the conclusion of the White House meeting. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it “was productive and moved the ball in the right direction.” 

“The President reiterated how critical it is for the country to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill as quickly as possible,” Leavitt said.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), who sits on the Rules Committee, wouldn't say if he would vote for the bill after receiving a deal from the White House, because he wanted to see everything they agreed to set in stone before making a decision.

“I'm not saying anything until I see it in writing,” Norman told reporters. “I'm not going to say, because things move around up here … one word could change this whole thing.”

“We're going to get back together once we see it in writing, all of us that you saw in here, do that, and make a call,” Norman added, referring to the caucus members.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), who were also at the White House meeting, were optimistic when they returned to Capitol Hill. They told reporters that they would be moving forward with the legislation and to expect a vote “tonight or tomorrow morning.” 

A whip notice sent out Wednesday night detailed that the House would proceed with a vote series later in the night or early Thursday morning, though no specific times have been provided.

“I think that all of our colleagues here will really like this final product, and I think we move forward,” Johnson said.

The speaker said there would be some “minor details” changed in the bill, which appears to be the case. Freedom Caucus members declined to share any changes they agreed to or whether they'd vote for the bill when exiting a meeting with Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) Wednesday evening.

Republicans are now aiming to have a vote on the package in the “wee hours,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) told reporters exiting the meeting. He said he is voting for the bill and approves of the “whole of government approach” the White House pitched.

Several of his colleagues left the Freedom Caucus meeting without providing details.

Reps. Eli Crane (R-AZ) and Keith Self (R-TX) said “no comment” when asked if they'd vote yes on the bill. Rep. Josh Brecheen (R-OK), who was one of four GOP lawmakers who held up the vote in the Budget Committee, quipped, “All you'll get from me is a long pause.” 

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), one of the most vocal fiscal hawks opposed to the bill text, was completely silent as he left the meeting. He wouldn't answer any questions from reporters related to his vote or the details of the White House deal.

While Freedom Caucus members were huddling, centrist GOP lawmakers met in the speaker's office to chat with Johnson. Main Street Caucus Chairman Dusty Johnson (R-SD) echoed the speaker, promising a “modest number of tweaks.”

TRUMP'S UNITY SPEECH DOESN'T SWAY SALT OR FREEDOM CAUCUS REPUBLICANS AT THE CAPITOL

“We are getting very close to a bill that is going to be able to garner the votes necessary for passage,” Dusty Johnson said. “We have every expectation. The speaker has every expectation that we will get there.”

“The president was incredibly helpful, and that meeting was incredible,” the South Dakota Republican added. “It was really productive and it had a material impact on moving the bill in the right direction.”

Following reports of deportations to South Sudan, the Trump administration said Wednesday it has deported eight migrants convicted of crimes in the United States.

South Sudanese residents on Wednesday weighed in on reports that the US apparently is deporting migrants to their country. If the deportations are confirmed, that means people from Vietnam, Cuba and elsewhere are being sent to a nation they have no link to, thousands of miles from where they want to be.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic African nation of South Sudan, a federal judge said Wednesday, hours after the Trump administration said it had expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes but refused to reveal where they would end up. The judge's statement was a notably strong rebuke to the government's deportation efforts. 

In an emergency hearing he called to address reports that immigrants had been sent to South Sudan, Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. Minutes before the hearing, administration officials accused “activist judges” of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.

“The department actions in this case are unquestionably in violation of this court's order,” Murphy said Wednesday, arguing that the deportees didn't have “meaningful opportunity” to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.

Government attorneys argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. They also pointed out that the judge had not specified the exact time needed between notice and deportation, leaving room for misunderstanding. 

The migrants' home countries — Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan — would not take them back, according to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spoke to reporters in Washington. He later said the migrants either came from countries that often do not take back all their deported citizens or had other situations that meant they could not be sent home.

“These represent the true national security threats,” Lyons said at a news conference. Behind him was a display of photos of men he said had been convicted of rape, homicide, armed robbery and other crimes. 

Administration officials, who have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants, made their displeasure clear Wednesday. 

President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “are working every single day to get these vicious criminals off of American streets — and while activist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. She pointed to the photographs and described them as “the monsters” that Murphy “is trying to protect.”

Homeland Security officials released few specific details about the deportation flight. They said it left Tuesday with eight people on board and said they remained in the department's custody Wednesday. Officials said they could not disclose the migrants' final destination because of “safety and operational security.”

The case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight is the latest flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president's policies. 

With Congress largely silent or supportive, opponents of Trump's agenda have filed hundreds of lawsuits and judges have issued dozens of orders against the administration. Immigration has been the most contentious issue. There was the mistaken deportation of an immigrant who was living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, as well as Trump's push to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court review.

The administration officials insisted that the deported men had received due process, but did not provide details. Immigration-rights attorneys argue they violated Murphy's order, first handed down in March, that says people must have a chance to argue that going somewhere outside their homeland would put them in danger before being deported, even if they've otherwise exhausted their legal appeals. 

“The government is still refusing to provide due process to our clients, which means they are not giving them notice of the country to which they're being deported, proper notice in a language that they understand, and not giving them a meaningful opportunity to claim fear based on those countries,” Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said outside court.

“These are countries that the State Department doesn't want Americans to travel to. They are categorically not safe,” she added.

In court, Realmuto asked the judge to return the individuals to the United States. “They are no less deserving of protection than any other human beings on this planet,” she said.

The government argued the interviews with the men over their fears could be done where they are currently being held and confirmed with Murphy that they can be arranged. Realmuto called this a “logistical nightmare” that penalizes the men because the government violated the judge's order. She said it would prove a challenge to get the men legal counsel and interpreters, an effort complicated by the time difference.

Murphy, who raised the prospect of criminal contempt for anyone “involved in an illegal deportation,” later Wednesday ordered the government conduct a new set of interviews with the migrants if an appropriate place with appropriate privacy can be found. He said the government was welcome to bring the migrants back, but did not order they do so.

On Twitter late Wednesday, DHS' McLaughlin called the order “deranged.”

Attorneys for the immigrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa.

The apparent removal of one man from the troubled Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said. 

A woman also reported that her husband from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote. 

Murphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would “clearly” violate his ruling.

South Sudan's police spokesperson, Maj. Gen. James Monday Enoka, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and “redeported to their correct country” if found not to be South Sudanese.

Edmund Yakani, executive director of the South Sudanese group Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, questioned why people convicted of crimes in the United States would be sent there. “Is South Sudan a land of less human who deserve to receive perpetrators of human rights violations? Without any public explanation?” he asked. 

Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The U.S. has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts. 

South Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top U.N. official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war. 

The State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says “significant human rights issues” include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.

The Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review. 

The U.S is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan's humanitarian aid programs, with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million.

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio on Thursday sounded another alarm on soaring U.S. debt and deficits, saying it should make investors fearful of the government bond market.

"I think we should be afraid of the bond market," Dalio said at an event for the Paley Media Council in New York. "It's like ... I'm a doctor, and I'm looking at the patient, and I've said, you're having this accumulation, and I can tell you that this is very, very serious, and I can't tell you the exact time. I would say that if we're really looking over the next three years, to give or take a year or two, that we're in that type of a critical, critical situation."

The founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, has warned about the ballooning U.S. deficit for years. Recently, investors have begun demanding lower prices to buy the bonds that cover the government's massive budget deficits, pushing up yields on the debt. Rising worries about the fiscal situation last week triggered a high-profile credit rating downgrade from Moody's.

The yield on the 30-year Treasury yield on Thursday traded at levels not seen since 2023, around 5.14%.

Rising financing costs along with continued spending growth and declining tax receipts have combined to send deficits spiraling, pushing the national debt past the $36 trillion mark. In 2024, the government spent more on interest payments than any other outlay other than Social Security, defense and health care.

"We will have a deficit of about 6.5% of GDP — that that is more than the market can bear," Dalio said.

Dalio said he's not hopeful politicians would be able to reconcile their differences and lessen the country's debt load. In a party-line vote early Thursday, House members approved legislation that lowers taxes and adds military spending. The bill — which now goes to the Senate — could increase the U.S. government's debt by trillions and widen the deficit at a time when fears of a flare-up in inflation due higher tariffs are already weighing on bond prices and boosting yields.

"I'm not optimistic. I have to be realistic," Dalio said. "I think it's the essence of the challenge of our country that anything related to bipartisanship and getting over political hurdles ... essentially means 'give me more,' which leads to these deficits."

After selling online pharmacy PillPack to Amazon seven years ago, the founding team is launching a new company that aims to make the experience of getting medical care "as easy as shopping online."

PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen on Thursday launched a new venture called General Medicine. Parker and Cohen are joined by Ashwin Muralidharan, who most recently served as the technical adviser, or "shadow," to Amazon's top health executive Neil Lindsay.

General Medicine is an online health-care marketplace, where users can get connected with a provider based on specific medical needs or chat with someone about their symptoms. The platform can be used for a range of health needs, such as securing prescriptions or locating a specialist.

Users can pay with cash or insurance, with most major providers accepted, the company said. 

General Medicine relies on a mix of its own medical groups, networks of specialists and local providers, clinics and labs to provide care.

Parker and Cohen left Amazon in 2022, four years after Amazon acquired PillPack for about $750 million. General Medicine was founded in 2023, and began serving patients earlier this year before launching broadly this month.

The company says it hopes to address "the terrible experience of American healthcare and create access to excellent care."

It's a similar goal held by Amazon, which has sought to disrupt health-care in the U.S. over the past several years by applying its "customer obsessed" mentality and rapid delivery capabilities. It's had mixed success, sunsetting some offerings like a telehealth service and a fitness wearable.

The company operates Amazon Pharmacy, which was born out of the PillPack acquisition. It also acquired primary care provider One Medical in 2022 for $3.9 billion, giving it both an online and brick-and-mortar health-care presence.

The Trump administration blocked Harvard University on Thursday from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students.

The Department of Homeland Security said it revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification because the private school's leadership "has created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students, and otherwise obstruct its once-venerable learning environment."

"Many of these agitators are foreign students," DHS said.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who ordered the revocation, said, "Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country."

Harvard called the revocation "unlawful."

"We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University – and this nation – immeasurably," the university said in a statement 

"We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community," the statement said. "This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."

DHS said that in addition to barring enrollment of future international students, "existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status."  The revocation was first reported by The New York Times.

As of the fall 2023 semester, International students comprised more than 27% of Harvard's total enrollment, according to university data.

As Noem's order became public, a federal judge in Oakland, California, issued an injunction against President Donald Trump and Noem barring them from terminating the legal status of international students pending the outcome of a lawsuit challenging the termination of the legal status of several such students. 

The injunction could block the Trump administration from acting on its threat against international students currently enrolled at Harvard.

Noem in April had threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students.

She warned the university at that time that its certification to enroll foreign students was contingent upon complying with federal immigration laws.

In a statement on Thursday, Noem said, "This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."

"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing," Noem said.

"It refused."

"They have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law."

The Trump administration in April froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, hours after the university roundly rejected demands that it eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and evaluate international students for ideological concerns.

The AI Race:

Anthropic is set to roll out two new versions of its Claude artificial intelligence software, including a long-delayed update to its high-end Opus model, as the startup vies to stay ahead of a crowded market.

The company on Thursday plans to unveil Sonnet 4 and Opus 4, the latter of which is billed as Anthropic's most powerful AI system yet. Both models are designed to better follow directions and operate more autonomously when fielding tasks such as writing code and answering complicated questions.

In this article

Anthropic, the Amazon-backed OpenAI rival, on Thursday launched its most powerful group of artificial intelligence models yet: Claude 4.

The company said the two models, called Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, are defining a "new standard" when it comes to AI agents and "can analyze thousands of data sources, execute long-running tasks, write human-quality content, and perform complex actions," per a release.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI research executives, launched its Claude chatbot in March 2023. since then, it's been part of the increasingly heated AI arms race taking place between startups and tech giants alike, a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade. 

Companies in seemingly every industry are rushing to add AI-powered chatbots and agents to avoid being left behind by competitors.

Anthropic stopped investing in chatbots at the end of last year and has instead focused on improving Claude's ability to do complex tasks like research and coding, even writing whole code bases, according to Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer. 

He also acknowledged that "the more complex the task is, the more risk there is that the model is going to kind of go off the rails ... and we're really focused on addressing that so that people can really delegate a lot of work at once to our models."

"We've been training these models since last year and really anticipating them," Kaplan said in an interview. "I think these models are much, much stronger as agents and as coders. It was definitely a struggle internally just because some of the new infrastructure we were using to train these models... made it very down-to-the-wire for the teams in terms of getting everything up and running."

Kaplan added that once they tried to get the model testers to switch back off of the new models because they needed to iterate on them, no one wanted to give up access.

Anthropic said Claude Opus 4 was the "best coding model in the world" and could autonomously work for nearly a full corporate workday — seven hours.

Both models can search the web to complete tasks on a user's behalf and alternate between reasoning and tool use, according to Anthropic. The company also said that when given access to local files, they can extract and save "key facts to maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time."

"I do a lot of writing with Claude, and I think prior to Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, I was mostly using the models as a thinking partner, but still doing most of the writing myself," Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, said in an interview. "And they've crossed this threshold where now most of my writing is actually ... Opus mostly, and it now is unrecognizable from my writing."

Krieger added, "I love that we're kind of pushing the frontier on two sides. Like one is the coding piece and agentic behavior overall, and that's powering a lot of these coding startups. ... But then also, we're pushing the frontier on how these models can actually learn from and then be a really useful writing partner, too."

Anthropic's annualized revenue reached $2 billion in the first quarter, the company confirmed last week, more than doubling from a $1 billion rate in the prior period. Revenue chief Kate Jensen said in a recent interview with CNBC that the number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually with Anthropic jumped eightfold from a year ago.

Wall Street continues to pour money into AI startups like Anthropic: The company received a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit line last week to amp up its liquidity in an ever-expanding — and expensive — AI competition.

U.S. President Donald Trump has never been the one to hold back an opinion.

"I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday," Trump said on a trip to Qatar last week, referring to a conversation he had with Apple's chief executive about the company's decision to move iPhone manufacturing from China to India, rather than the United States.

"I don't want you building in India," Trump said he told Cook, after news emerged of Apple's decision to ramp up production in India with the aim of making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the next few years, and reduce reliance on China, where around 90% of its flagship smartphone is currently assembled.

While India has certainly emerged as a significant, albeit nascent, hub for electronics assembly, the path to it becoming a clear-cut alternative to China isn't a guaranteed outcome, despite U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.

Geopolitical upheavals appear to be one of the many such hurdles for India, as well as businesses eyeing the country.

For Apple, moving manufacturing to the United States, instead of India, from China still remains within the realm of possibilities, even if improbable for the company.

If Apple were to move final assembly to the United States, iPhone costs could increase by 25% due to higher U.S. labor costs, according to analysts from Bank of America. However, that assumes subcomponents, like cameras, are still partly assembled outside the U.S.

To put that into context, the base model for iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $1,199 to buy outright, with $125.90 added in local taxes in Louisiana, for instance. Final assembly and testing in the U.S. would simply add $160 to the consumer's bill.

Meanwhile, the jobs at stake are performed by 1.4 million people employed by Apple's suppliers overseas.

Could Trump and his backers believe that the additional costs might be worth paying if many thousands of jobs are created in the U.S.?

"If Apple does move final assembly to the U.S., it would need tariff waivers on components/sub-assemblies manufactured globally to make the manufacturing shifts viable," BofA's Wamsi Mohan said in a note to clients.

While technically possible, Mohan views moving the entire iPhone supply chain to the U.S. as a "much bigger undertaking" that would "likely take many years, if even possible," and does not expect near-term manufacturing shifts to the U.S. unless tariff policies become permanent.

The core challenge for India extends beyond just attracting companies.

"Supply chain and manufacturing, these things take a long time to establish," said Nick McConway, head of Asia ex-Japan equity at Amundi Asset Management. "We saw that with Vietnam, who had to put huge investment into infrastructure. The lights have to stay on, the roads have to be there, the trucks have to get there in time."

"I think India is only at the very early stage of developing these types of globally facing manufacturing capacities," McConway added.

The fund manager also highlighted that while labor costs can be low in India, it doesn't mean savings for companies moving their manufacturing base to India.

"While your labour costs can be low, your unit labour cost is not because the productivity is no good," McConway said.

Meanwhile, for the U.S., this productivity gap can offset the advantages of cheaper labor, making it difficult for India to compete effectively on a global scale for high-value manufacturing. Apple has also made significant progress in automating several roles in its final assembly line, reducing the number of people required by more than 50% since the process began.

And even if India wins a larger share of Apple's iPhone assembly business, the benefits for the country are likely to be minimal, according to one analyst.

"Today, India earns just $30 per iPhone, much of which is given back to Apple as subsidy under the [Production Linked Incentive] scheme," said Ajay Srivastava, founder of think tank Global Trade Research Initiative.

Srivastava, a former trade negotiator for India, took a protectionist approach and suggested that New Delhi's reduction of tariffs on smartphone components at the behest of Apple could hurt domestic efforts to build a local component ecosystem.

"If Apple's assembly moves out, India will be forced to stop propping up shallow assembly lines and instead invest in deeper manufacturing—chips, displays, batteries, and beyond."

In the end, it might not even be Trump's push to reshore manufacturing back to the U.S. that devoid India of foreign investment. The country might just have work harder to attract investors.

India's market is one of the best long-term plays, analysts say. As the "sell U.S." narrative picks up steam amid U.S. tariff turbulence and concerns over the country's mounting fiscal deficit, emerging markets have gained traction as an attractive alternative for investors. Among emerging markets, Malcolm Dorson, head of the active investment team at Global X ETFs, believes India offers the best long-term growth play, a sentiment echoed by Mohit Mirpuri, equity fund manager at SGMC Capital, who said that theme is anchored in India's domestic demand.

India is hoping for a full exemption from the U.S.' "reciprocal" tariffs. The duties on the South Asian country come in at 26%, and officials are seeking to strike a deal with the U.S. to do away with the tariffs completely, according to CNBC TV18. However, India is reluctant to let goods like agriculture and dairy be imported, which is likely proving to be a roadblock in the negotiations, said former Indian Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation Jayant Dasgupta. That said, India's large domestic economy and low dependence on imports could shield it from the impact of tariffs, according to a Moody's Ratings report released May 21.

Britain and the U.S. are working together to preserve the India-Pakistan ceasefire. "Confidence-building measures" and dialogues are on the table, U.K. Foreign Minister David Lammy said on Saturday. India on May 6 said its armed forces had conducted strikes against Pakistan and what it calls Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting "terrorist infrastructure." The operation follows a militant attack last month in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.

Indian stocks have declined over the past week by more than 1.5% so far. The Nifty 50 index has risen by 3.65% this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield has ticked slightly lower to 6.22%, down by 2 basis points over the past week.

On CNBC TV this week, Lavina Quadros, managing director of equities research at Jefferies India, said India's defense sector has "come a long way" in the last ten years, since the government pushed to reduce such imports to 30% from 70%. Investor confidence in Indian defense firms has also been boosted because domestic air defense systems, for instance, have successfully intercepted foreign drones. But execution of orders remains a key concern for investors.

Meanwhile, Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of the Indian Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, noted that the global supply chain will likely look different by 2030 — and India intends to play a key role in it. The country is already "a very important part of the global services supply chain," a fact neglected by many, and will now focus on efforts in manufacturing, especially in the electronics and metals, Sanyal added. Even if the U.S. wants to reindustrialize itself, the country will still have to rely on others for materials, and that presents an opportunity for India, Sanyal said.

Google's Antitrust Crisis:

The Google campus in Mountain View, California.

The Justice Department is probing whether Alphabet Inc.'s Google violated antitrust law with an agreement to use the artificial intelligence technology of a popular chatbot maker, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 

Antitrust enforcers have recently told Google they're examining whether it structured an agreement with the company known as Character.AI to avoid formal government merger scrutiny, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential probe. In a deal with Google last year, the founders of the chatbot maker joined the search firm, which also got a non-exclusive license to use their venture's technology.

Canada's Election:

Mark Carney, Canada's prime minister, shakes hands with Francois-Philippe Champagne, his finance minister, after a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on May 13.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will begin to use artificial intelligence “at scale” to make the government more productive, as his administration looks for ways to squeeze out cost savings in a time of economic pressure. 

Carney released a letter spelling out seven major priorities for his new cabinet, one of which is “spending less on government operations” to free up money for other priorities. The prime minister promised during the recent election campaign to rebuild Canada's military and use the financial backing of the government to accelerate home construction, among other spending ideas.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Thursday to reinstate more than 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees.

"The Department must be able to carry out its functions and its obligations," as well as "other relevant statutes as mandated by Congress," U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston wrote in the preliminary injunction.

The Department of Education announced a reduction in force on March 11 that would have gutted the agency's staff by a half.

Two days later, 21 states — including Michigan, Nevada and New York — filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its staff cuts at the Education Department.

After President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 20 aimed at dismantling the Education Department, more parties sued to save the agency, including the American Federation of Teachers.

In the injunction on Thursday, the judge pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of 12 offices tasked with the enforcement of civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race and disability.

The entire team that supervises the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was also eliminated, the judge said. (Around 17 million families apply for college aid each year using the form, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.)

"This is good news for students," said James Kvaal, who served as U.S. undersecretary of education for former President Joe Biden. "Colleges are already warning that these mass layoffs put financial aid at risk, and millions of borrowers need help avoiding loan default later this year."

Thursday's ruling also seemed to block the Trump administration's goal of transferring the country's $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to the Small Business Administration from the Education Department, said Kantrowitz.

Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the decision.

"Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people," Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC.

She added that the Trump administration would be challenging the ruling on an emergency basis.

Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day U.S. Department of Education in 1979. Since then, the agency has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

In a vote early Thursday, House members approved President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill, including a new savings account for children with a one-time deposit of $1,000 from the federal government.

Under the proposal, "Trump Accounts" — previously known as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts" — can later be used for education expenses or credentials, the down payment on a first home or as capital to start a small business.  

The final version of the bill that House Republicans passed Thursday could still face pushback in the Senate.

If the bill passes as drafted, parents will be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year and the balance will be invested in a diversified fund that tracks a U.S.-stock index.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who spearheaded the effort, said the accounts give children "the miracle of the compound growth, the ability to accumulate wealth, which is transformational."

Not unlike a 529 college savings plan, the Trump Account has a tax incentive to getting a jump start on saving. Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate.

"This isn't all that different from the tax treatment you would get from a typical brokerage account," said Sam Taube, NerdWallet's lead investing writer.

Other similar options already exist. Custodial brokerage accounts — often called a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) account — also allow parents to transfer bank deposits, stocks, bonds and mutual funds to minors. But in that case, investment income, including dividends and interest, could be subject to a "kiddie tax" charged to the parents at their rate.

With 529 accounts, alternatively, earnings grow on a tax-advantaged basis, and when a child withdraws the money, it is tax-free if the funds are used for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board.

"We continue to believe that 529 plans provide tremendous benefits as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle for American families, with a proven nearly 30-year track record," said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation, a nonprofit that provides public policy support for 529 plans.

Although there are more limitations on what 529 funds can be applied to compared to Trump Accounts, restrictions have loosened in recent years to include continuing education classes, apprenticeship programs and student loan payments.

Plus, 529 accounts have much higher contribution limits. This year, individuals can gift up to $19,000, or up to $38,000 if you're married and file taxes jointly, per child without those contributions counting toward your lifetime gift tax exemption.

"For most parents, like myself with teens, the 529 college savings plan is superior if you're focused on paying for higher education because of the federal tax-free growth," said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California.

"Also, now, the 529 is becoming more flexible with its' ability to have unused funds rolled into a Roth IRA in the future for retirement," said Sun, a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. 

As of 2024, families can roll over unused 529 funds to the account beneficiary's Roth individual retirement account, without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements.

Experts say the biggest benefit of Trump Accounts is the seed money for all children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, funded by the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements and everyone is eligible, as long as the child is a U.S. citizen, and both parents have Social Security numbers.

Although some states, including Connecticut and Colorado, already offer a type of "baby bonds" program for parents, the Trump Accounts — along with a bigger child tax credit proposed in the budget bill — "could certainly help a lot of families at a lot of different income levels," said NerdWallet's Taube.

Further, these accounts are not mutually exclusive from other tax-advantaged accounts, like 529 plans, he added, "so parents could take advantage of both."

Still, for parents weighing their options for early investment vehicles, "my recommendation would be, if you're focused on college savings, talk to an advisor and start with the 529 plan first," Sun said.

Apple devices will power a hospital in Georgia, a first for the company as it continues its push into the health-care sector. 

Emory Healthcare on Thursday announced that its Emory Hillandale Hospital will be the first U.S. hospital that runs on Apple products, including the iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, iMac and Mac mini. The devices will also integrate with software from Epic, the leading electronic health record vendor in the nation.  

Hillandale is using Apple products because they are user-friendly, require less IT support, offer cybersecurity advantages and have long-lasting hardware and battery life, Emory executives told CNBC.

Since this is new territory for the health system, Emory said it will closely monitor the devices to ensure they improve the organization's quality of care.  

"It can certainly be a game changer that's not been done anywhere else in the country," Emory Healthcare CEO Dr. Joon Lee said in an interview. "And like everything else, it's not going to be without its challenges, but it really opens the door to multiple possibilities."

Emory Healthcare is an academic health system in Georgia that operates 10 hospitals and supports roughly 26,400 employees. Its Hillandale facility is a 100-bed community hospital on the outskirts of the greater Atlanta metro area. 

"At Apple, we believe in technology's power to improve lives," Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in a statement to CNBC. "We're thrilled that Emory Hillandale Hospital is using Apple products to deliver exceptional care — because doctors and nurses should have the best technology in the world to serve their patients."

The health system's interest in using more Apple products was partially inspired by the major CrowdStrike outage that rocked businesses, including Emory, last July, said Dr. Ravi Thadhani, the executive vice president for health affairs of Emory University.  

Thadhani said more than 20,000 of the health system's devices were "paralyzed" by a faulty CrowdStrike software update, but notably, all of its Apple products were still working. In the aftermath of the outage, executives asked engineers from Apple and Epic to visit Emory and explore a deeper integration. 

"They were working on each other already, you could get Epic on an Apple device, but it wasn't quick and it wasn't seamless," Thadhani said. "And so they came, they descended here." 

Epic is Emory's electronic health record, or EHR, provider. EHRs are digital versions of a patient's medical history that are updated by doctors and nurses. The software is often referred to as the "central nervous system" of a health-care organization, said Seth Howard, Epic's executive vice president of research and development.

Howard said Epic has worked with Apple for many years, deploying apps for the iPhone as far back as 2010. Last year, the company released Epic on Mac, which made its complete suite of applications available on Apple's computer operating system macOS. 

"The Epic on Mac project was really an extension and natural next step for us on this journey with Apple," Howard said in an interview.

Emory was an early adopter. 

Before Emory decided to roll out Apple devices throughout an entire hospital, it conducted a smaller pilot across one floor of a facility. Thadhani said the feedback from doctors and nurses was "phenomenal," which gave the health system confidence to expand the scope.

If the launch at Hillandale is a success, Lee said the health system could deploy Apple products across other Emory facilities in the future. 

"Certainly our intent and hope is that it will show a difference, and that we can expand and it will also be a model for other health systems across the country," he said.

Washington's protectionist trade policies are posing a "real challenge" to European nations as they seek to raise their security contributions, according to Barclays CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan.

"I think Europe has a real challenge in adjusting to tariffs. It's got to find space, fiscal space, to increase defense spending, and it's got to look at consolidation in financial institutions, in within its market," the executive told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Thursday. 

The European Union currently faces a 25% U.S. import tariff on its steel, aluminum and cars and was in April struck with an additional 20% "reciprocal" levy under the White House's fresh wide-spanning trade policies. The latter duty has been temporarily reduced to 10% during a 90-day reprieve that expires in July, paving the way for Washington and the 27-member European bloc to join the negotiations table for a more favorable trade agreement.

A deal has yet to be struck, with markets mired in uncertainty and with concerns mounting over the EU's economic growth outlook and potential inflationary and recessionary risks in the world's largest economy. The trade developments affecting the two historically allied nations have cast a shadow on the EU's efforts to overhaul its fiscal policies and galvanize defense spending under the bloc's "ReArm Europe Plan."

The volatility has encumbered companies that seek to understand the impact of tariffs and regulation on their business model, Barclays' Venkatakrishnan said.

"You can look at the companies that have withdrawn earnings guidance over the year, and those are the industries that are more deeply affected. And there, they might decide — not now, but over time — that there needs to be further consolidation or further rewiring of their business models," he said. "And then activity will increase, and we can help them. And then there are others who are ... taking advantage of the relative calm to continue to expand their businesses."

British bank Barclays has had a notable presence stateside since absorbing the investment banking and capital markets businesses of collapsed Wall Street titan Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion. The lender is navigating calmer seas at home, after Trump unveiled the broad outline of a U.S.-U.K. trade deal earlier this month and Britain scored another major win earlier this week through an agreement to reset its relationship with the EU after departing the bloc in 2020.

Still, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour administration must battle the dragon of surging inflation and public skepticism over Finance Minister Rachel Reeves' planned tax increases.

A vocal Reeves supporter, Venkatakrishnan on Thursday said the current government remains "absolutely" on track with its economic steps and outlined the hurdles before the British economy:

"We're not seeing consumer distress. We're in fact, seeing conduit continued consumer strength, but it's coming because of people managing their balances and their finances prudently. So economizing. The job market is still strong," he said.

"But, as you see, even in the last couple of days, people are worried about inflation. People are worried about cost, whether it's winter fuel bills or whether it's more generalized inflation from tariffs, and the only real answer to that is growth."

BYD just scored a major win against Tesla in one of its biggest markets.

The Chinese electric vehicle giant outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as Elon Musk's automaker saw its sales collapse amid furious backlash over its CEO's politics.

BYD sold 7,230 battery-electric vehicles in April, compared to 7,165 for Tesla, according to JATO Dynamics data.

It's a major milestone for the Chinese brand, and suggests BYD has taken advantage of Tesla's alarming decline in Europe.

ƒNew Tesla registrations dropped nearly 50% in April compared to the same month last year, while BYD sales surged 169% over the same period, per JATO Dynamics data.

BYD outsold Tesla without even taking hybrid sales into account. The Chinese carmaker sold 12,525 vehicles last month, meaning its total sales comfortably outstripped Tesla, which only sells battery-powered EVs.

Tesla has taken a battering this year in Europe, its third-largest market after the US and China. The automaker's European sales were down 30% in the first three months of 2025, according to JATO Dynamics, despite EV sales rising overall.

The automaker has faced a wave of backlash over CEO Musk's role in the Trump administration and endorsement of German far-right party AfD.

In an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Musk denied Tesla was facing a sales slump. That was despite Tesla reporting its weakest quarter for deliveries since 2022 last month as it retooled factories for the launch of its updated Model Y.

"Europe is our weakest market. We're strong everywhere else. Sales are doing well at this point, we don't anticipate any meaningful sales shortfall," said Musk.

By contrast, BYD is racing to launch new models as it seeks to capitalize on its explosive growth in Europe.

The Chinese brand unveiled the Dolphin Surf, the European version of its cheap Seagull EV, on Wednesday.

The compact hatchback will go on sale in 15 European markets in June, with prices starting at 23,000 euros ($26,000) — about $19,000 less than Tesla's cheapest model.

Having challenged Tesla in China, BYD is eyeing aggressive expansion overseas. The EV giant sold 79,000 vehicles outside China last month, nearly double the total in April 2024.

A new North Korean naval destroyer was badly damaged during a botched shipyard launch that caused part of its hull to be "crushed," Pyongyang state media reported.

The Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday morning local time that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was attending the ceremony at the Chongjin shipyard when the "serious accident" occurred.

Blaming "inexperienced command and operational carelessness," KCNA wrote that the stern of the 5,000-ton ship started sliding down a ramp too early and that a flatcar meant to support its weight didn't move with the vessel.

The report said this caused the ship to lose balance, leaving "some sections of the warship's bottom crushed" while the rest of the ship was stuck.

According to KCNA, Kim blasted the disastrous launch, saying it was "out of the bounds of possibility and could not be tolerated."

He also called the launch a "serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility, and unscientific empiricism," state media wrote.

It reported that Kim censured the officials responsible for the ship and its launch, including the country's munitions department and ship designers, and said their mistakes would be "dealt with" at a party meeting next month.

The North Korean leader was further cited as saying that the mishap "brought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse in a moment."

The failed launch is a blow to Kim's military agenda, given his emphasis over the past two years on building up North Korea's maritime forces.

"A new historic time is coming before our naval forces," Kim said during a 2023 speech, declaring North Korea would focus on capabilities for projecting naval power beyond its own waters.

The same year, Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile submarine, the Hero Kim Kun Ok, which is a redesigned Soviet model equipped to fire cruise missiles.

Last month, North Korea launched the largest warship it had ever built, a 5,000-ton "multipurpose" destroyer, which it said was a new class of armed vessel.

That was at Nampo, a different shipyard. But its tonnage could indicate that the vessel that failed to launch on Wednesday was in the same class. State media didn't provide further details about the damaged ship at Chongjin.

In March, North Korea said it was also building its first nuclear-powered submarine.

Bitcoin keeps rising Thursday, inching up to yet another all-time high mark after beating its four-month-old record on Wednesday. And that momentum appears to be spreading to other top coins, which have put up even larger daily gains than Bitcoin.

As of this writing, Bitcoin just hit a new record price of $111,808, per data from CoinGecko, continuing upward after first breaching the $110,000 mark late Wednesday. Bitcoin is now up 4.5% on the day and 22% over the last 30 days.

The leading cryptocurrency by market cap has completed a significant rebound after dipping to under $75,000 in early April amid President Trump's growing global trade war. As Trump's tariffs push has cooled amid deals with key trading partners, investors are again growing comfortable with risk-on assets, propelling crypto and stocks alike.

Other the last day, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all jumped by about 7%, beating Bitcoin's own daily gain.

Ethereum currently sits at $2,662, pushing its monthly gain to a whopping 56%, while Solana is priced at $179 (up 24% this month) and Dogecoin has barked its way up to $0.242 for a nearly 41% spike in the last 30 days.

Looking broadly to the top 100 coins by market cap, the biggest gainers over the past day are Worldcoin (WORLD), up 36% and propelled by a sizable $135 million token sale announced Wednesday, along with the HYPE token of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid (up 23%) and rising meme coin Fartcoin with its 17% climb.

A widely followed trader says Bitcoin (BTC) is not done printing new all-time highs after breaking out of key resistance levels this week.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 138,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has entered a price discovery phase and may soon increase by more than 33% of its current value.

In crypto trading, price discovery generally refers to an asset soaring to uncharted territory and new all-time high levels.

“Bitcoin is trading at new all-time highs, entering price discovery. The next key levels to watch are $116,000, $126,000, $136,000 and $148,000!”

Bitcoin is trading for $111,042 at time of writing, up 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

Next up, the analyst suggests that Ethereum (ETH) is completing an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal pattern in technical analysis.

“If Ethereum breaks above the $2,588 resistance, it could trigger a bullish move toward $3,000.”

Ethereum is trading for $2,669 at time of writing, up 3.9% in the last 24 hours.

Looking at Solana (SOL), the analyst says that the ETH rival may soon soar to the upper bound of a bullish ascending channel, after bouncing off the lower bound.

“Solana looks poised to target the upper boundary of this channel, with $210 in sight!”

Solana is trading for $179 at time of writing, up 3.9% in the last 24 hours.

Lastly, the analyst says that the top memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) may be printing a bull pennant pattern on the hourly chart, a continuation pattern where a period of consolidation is often followed by a breakout.

“DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which suggests a target of $0.31!”

DOGE is trading for $0.24 at time of writing, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours.

It's not an official holiday – yet – but for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts “Bitcoin Pizza Day” is still special. Thursday marks the 15th anniversary of the first known use of cryptocurrency to buy real-world goods.

The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John's pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they're worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices. 

Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it's giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world. 

Here's the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:

The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency's still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn't rely on a third party – like a government or financial institution – for transactions.

Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to “mine” bitcoin more effectively. 

Central to bitcoin's technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what's known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining. 

In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.

In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.

“I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,” Hanyecz wrote.

Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.

“So nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I'm offering too low?” he wrote.

But the next day, Hanyecz said he'd successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John's pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, “Digital Gold.”

“A great milestone reached,” said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz. 

It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.

By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.

“I mean people can say I'm stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,” Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. “I don't think anyone could have known it would take off like this.”

Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.

“It made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,” Hanyecz said on the television show “60 minutes.”

Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.

After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of “digital gold,” or a way to store value.

Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.

Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning — a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.

 Sui-based DEX Cetus has been hit by an apparent hack, with onchain data showing rapid asset drainage despite the team portraying the incident as a “bug.” 

Update (May 22, 2025, 1:27 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add further data and statements by Hacken.

Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets.  

Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. 

The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction. A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company's Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia.

Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, a significant increase over the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol.

Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation.

Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price.

Knock-on effects have already become apparent, with the Sui-based money market, Scallop, halting all borrowing on its protocol. The protocol said in an X post that a further announcement would be made when operations resume, but assured users that funds are safe.

Outside Cetus, LBTC appears to have gained over 4% in value over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap data. Others, such as Axol (AXOL), have not been as fortunate, with CoinMarketCap data showing a loss of nearly 99.5%.

The alleged exploiter's address contains nearly $52 million of Sui (SUI) tokens, $4.9 million of Haedal Staked SUI (HASUI), over $19.5 million of Toilet (TOILET), nearly $19.5 million of wrapped USDt (USDT) and many other assets. 

The official Cetus X profile confirmed that an incident on the protocol was detected, and the smart contract was paused for safety. It added that an investigation was ongoing.

However, blockchain analysts and compliance firms are raising concerns about the project's transparency. A representative from AMLBot told Cointelegraph:

The AMLBot representative — referring to statements made by Cetus team members on Discord — further explained that while the Cetus team “is calling this incident ‘just a bug,' — the timing raises questions.”

Onchain data service Onchain Lens stated in an X post that “the attacker gained control of all SUI-denominated pools, exploiting over $200M, and has also started moving $USDC.”

Blockchain Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC) Appoints Technology Visionary James R. Owens to BDIC Board of Advisors

HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blockchain Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC), first to market providing decentralized deposit insurance for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, proudly announces an appointment to the BDIC Board of Advisors, James R. Owens.

"BDIC's decentralized insurance protocol isn't just filling a gap in the market—it's creating the critical infrastructure layer that cryptocurrency needs to achieve mainstream adoption," said Owens, the new BDIC Board member.


Co-Founder Paul Kohli of BDIC Hong Kong celebrated the news stating, “James will play a critical role in advising BDIC on its technical strategy, specifically in the areas of exchange and wallet connectivity, as well as innovations in smart contract architecture bringing his experience and industry knowledge to the team,” Kohli continued. “This has been a multi-year working relationship that is coming to fruition as part of our go to market strategy which includes bringing high caliber human capital to BDIC to execute on implementation. Having a tech industry leader like James working with the CTO, CISO and tech department going forward is a great advantage for BDIC Insurance.”




GLOBAL TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE



With a career spanning over four decades in software engineering, telecommunications and data science, James R. Owens brings unparalleled technical expertise to BDIC. A dual-discipline graduate in Microbiology and Computer Science from UMASS in 1978 (conferred in 1983) Owens was quickly recruited by Microsoft's programming division and in 1983, he joined Microsoft as a contracted developer. Owens simultaneously consulted for IBM and other tech giants going forward and has not relented, establishing himself as a versatile force in early computing innovation and visionary to this day.




In 1991, Owens founded Webstar Technology Group, Inc., a company that revolutionized data transmission in the cable television industry by developing COAX software — an early system capable of compressing video and television signals without quality loss, enabling multi-frequency carriage across limited bandwidth infrastructure. His subsidiary, Centaflix, was acquired just 10 months after launch and now forms the backbone of streaming infrastructure used by platforms like Netflix.




Beyond media, Owens made his mark in hospitality tech, deploying check-in systems for Best Western and IHG hotels. In 2014, he launched Softtech, a data compression firm that evolved into early AI development by 2015. Owens successfully took Webstar Technology Group, Inc. public, listing the company under ticker WBSR on OTC markets before transitioning leadership in early 2024.




VISIONARY PERSPECTIVE



Owens will provide strategic technical oversight on BDIC's decentralized smart contract infrastructure and advise on exchange and wallet integrations for insurance protocols. While his current consulting contracts include work on compression technology in AC/DC electrical systems for sustainable energy and secure architecture design for satellite companies, Owens has also been working on cyber-wallet data transfer protocols the last two years with providers in PanAsia and Latin America.




“BDIC's approach to blockchain insurance infrastructure represents the most advanced application of distributed ledger technology I've seen in the financial sector. Their proprietary risk assessment algorithms combine traditional actuarial science with blockchain-native analytics in a way that creates true innovation,” said Owens. “I'm particularly impressed by how their smart contract architecture solves the oracle problem that has plagued similar projects, creating a seamless claims verification system that maintains both security and efficiency,” stated Owens when asked about the technical build.




DIGITAL CURRENCY ADOPTION: BDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE



“James is a true pioneer in software systems that scale globally, a major asset to BDIC,” said Founder and CEO Jeffrey A. Glusman. “His deep technical knowledge in both compression and streaming tech, coupled with his foresight in blockchain and AI, align perfectly with our mission to create a safe, global infrastructure for cryptocurrency adoption through the incorporation of the BDIC deposit insurance platform.” Glusman continued, “Following our announcement of 3PointOLabs last month focusing on our brand efforts, it was time to put the spotlight on our technical team as we will be announcing major collaborations in coming weeks.”




Owens' appointment further reinforces BDIC's vision to normalize cryptocurrency use through decentralized insurance technology that can scale securely with mass adoption. His guidance will be instrumental as BDIC prepares for the next phase of development internationally, including the expansion of its coverage tiers, exchange partnerships, technological advances in wallet security.




"After four decades in technology development, I've learned to recognize transformative platforms when I see them. BDIC's decentralized insurance protocol isn't just filling a gap in the market—it's creating the critical infrastructure layer that cryptocurrency needs to achieve mainstream adoption,” said Owens. “Their wallet integration system maintains security while simplifying the user experience, making insurance accessible to both institutional and retail participants. I'm excited to help BDIC scale this technology globally, as it represents the missing piece that will allow digital assets to fulfill their revolutionary potential."

Liquid's TVL milestone showcases Bitcoin's growing role in tokenized assets and financial infrastructure.

Today, the Liquid Federation has announced that the Liquid Network has surpassed $3.27 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. 

“Surpassing the $3 billion threshold marks a pivotal moment for both Liquid and Bitcoin, signaling the evolution of Bitcoinʼs ecosystem into a full-fledged platform for global financial markets,” said the CEO and Co-Founder of Blockstream Dr. Adam Back. “As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, and demand for regulated asset tokenization accelerates, Liquid is better positioned than ever to bridge Bitcoin with traditional finance and drive the next wave of capital markets innovation.”

The announcement follows growing interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), with major moves such as BlackRock's decision to tokenize a $150 billion Treasury fund. According to a 2025 report by Security Token Market, the tokenized asset market is projected to grow to $30 trillion by 2030.

Liquid supports over $1.8 billion in tokenized private credit and offers products like U.S. Treasury notes and digital currencies through Blockstream's AMP platform. The network also features fast, low-cost, and confidential transactions, with support for atomic swaps and robust smart contracts.

Governed by over 80 global institutions, Liquid was launched in 2018 as Bitcoin's first sidechain. It is now preparing for a major upgrade with the mainnet release of Simplicity, aimed at expanding its smart contract capabilities.

To keep up with increasing demand, the Liquid Federation is boosting developer resources and technical onboardings, along with integrations with exchanges, custodians and service providers. Recent bootcamps and important meetings with policy makers in Asia, Europe and Latin America reflect the network's growing global presence.

Established in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is the oldest and most established source of trustworthy news, information and thought leadership on Bitcoin.

 Crypto and art NFTs can help investors protect their purchasing power from ongoing fiat currency debasement, according to Raoul Pal. 

Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.

“You don't own enough crypto. When you do, you don't own enough NFT's, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.

NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.

“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.

Art NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.

Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  

Some digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs. Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, auctioned his “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” NFT artwork for a record-breaking $69 million in March 2021.

Meanwhile, the largest NFT collections continue to lack upside momentum, unable to recover toward their 2021 highs.

CryptoPunks, the largest NFT collection by market capitalization, is currently trading at a floor price of 46 Ether (ETH), 59% down from its peak of 113.9 ETH, recorded on Oct. 9, 2021, NFTpricefloor data shows.

Despite the temporary lack of interest, NFTs could be poised to see more momentum after the profits from Bitcoin's (BTC) cycle top start rotating into other digital assets.

“That likely puts the peak of the NFT market in Q1 2026, but don't expect a repeat of the 21/22 euphoria that we saw in NFTs,” according to Yehudah Petscher, strategist at CryptoSlam NFT data platform and SlamAI.

“We're likely an entire cycle away from NFTs having a parabolic run,” Petscher told Cointelegraph, adding:

However, the previous NFT bull market was driven largely by metaverse speculation and wealthy traders, Petscher noted — factors that are mostly absent in the current cycle.

Bitcoin and altcoins continued soaring on Thursday, even as the US stock market downturn continued.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to a record high of $111,860, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to $3.5 trillion. In contrast, the Dow opened lower by around 100 points, adding to Wednesday's 816 point drop. 

Bitcoin and altcoins are climbing after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency regulation focused on stablecoins.

The legislation requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100 percent reserve backing with high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. It also mandates monthly disclosures detailing reserve composition.

Other provisions include federal and state oversight. Stablecoin issuers with assets above 10 billion dollars will be regulated at the federal level, while states will oversee smaller issuers with less than 10 billion dollars in assets.

The passage of the GENIUS Act is significant, as it helps safeguard the crypto industry, especially following the collapse of Terra in 2022 and other major failures, like FTX. It also provides long-awaited legal clarity.

Bitcoin and altcoins are rising because investors see BTC as a safe haven asset after Moody's downgraded the US credit rating. 

The safe-haven appeal has pushed investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have added over $4.2 billion in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $43 billion.

In its statement, Moody's pointed to the rising US debt and interest payments and the policies in Washington. 

For example, the House of Representatives passed the “big, beautiful bill” that will add around $3.8 trillion in additional debt, according to some estimates.

The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, including deductions on tips and overtime pay. It also expands the child tax credit and includes a new senior tax relief of 4,000 dollars.

Fears over the rising U.S. debt and deficit have led investors to pull back from U.S. assets, especially equities. The U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to 99.6, while bond yields have surged. The 30-year yield rose to 5.1 percent, and the 10-year climbed to 4.6 percent.

Bitcoin's breakout is also supported by technical indicators. On the daily chart, it has formed a cup and handle pattern while narrowly avoiding a death cross. A death cross occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross while trending downward. This same setup nearly played out in August last year but was avoided.

The cup pattern has a depth of about 30 percent. Measuring that distance from the breakout level suggests potential gains toward 141,000 dollars.

Cetus Protocol, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity provider on the Sui network, has been drained of $223 million worth of tokens in an apparent hack, according to Cetus Protocol on X.

The protocol added that $162 million of the stolen funds had been "paused" and it is working with the Sui Foundation to recover the remainder of the funds.

The wallet tied to the Cetus Protocol exploit — 0xe28b50 — currently holds over 12.9 million SUI, valued at approximately $54 million at current prices.

On-chain data shows the address has a net worth exceeding 32.9 million SUI (approximately $137 million), suggesting the attacker may have already bridged or swapped funds through multiple paths.

The wallet remains active at the time of publishing and is likely in the process of obfuscating funds. This confirms the scale of the exploit and further pressures Sui's DeFi infrastructure, as major token pools and pairs remain drained.

The Cetus team has paused the smart contracts and is actively investigating, it said in an X post. According to early analysis, the attacker used spoof tokens like BULLA to exploit broken price curves and reserve calculations. 

They then added near-zero liquidity to manipulate internal LP state and repeatedly removed real assets like SUI and USDC without depositing anything meaningful.

Seems like all @CetusProtocol LP were drainedLooking into tx, the likely exploit path was:1. Swap in spoof token (e.g. BULLA → SUI), taking advantage of miscalculated price curve or broken reserve math.2. Add liquidity with a near-zero amount, to manipulate internal LP… pic.twitter.com/FtpYRSpwWW

Cetus confirmed the incident on X, saying the contract has been paused “for safety” and that a detailed statement will follow. 

Binance founder CZ said the exchange's team has reached out to Sui to offer help,.

CETUS is down 40% in the past few hours, while Sui-based memecoins like BULLA and MOJO have dropped over 90%.

The service aims to enhance payments with tokenised deposits for swift transactions

HSBC said its tokenised deposit programme can convert traditional bank deposits into digital tokens on a blockchain platform. As a result, payments through the service have the potential to cost less and take less time than traditional banking systems, according to Lewis Sun, HSBC's global head of domestic and emerging payments for global payments solutions.

The tokenised deposit infrastructure would enable corporate clients to make real-time Hong Kong and US dollar payments and transfer between HSBC Hong Kong wallets 24 hours a day, HSBC said.

The application was currently limited to use in Hong Kong and would expand to Asian and European markets in the second half of the year, it said.

“Tokenised deposits, when supported by regulated financial institutions, can offer a safe and fully compliant approach to improving payments and cash management for [companies],” Sun said.

“Hong Kong is an international financial centre committed to driving digital money innovation. This service sets a new benchmark for efficiency and innovation in digital money solutions for [companies].”

Ant International, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post, was the first client to complete an instant fund transfer using deposit tokenisation.

The skalds of Bitcoin Twitter have sung of the historic moment, the “first real world purchase” with bitcoin, and pundits have etched the story into the internet's memory with headlines about the infamous Bitcoin Pizza Purchase, now dearly valued at more than $1 billion.

But what if I told you that Hanyecz spent nearly 10 times more bitcoin following the historic purchase? And, what if I told you that perhaps Hanyecz did so as ostensible penance for his much more consequential contribution to Bitcoin in its uncertain infancy?

The penumbra of Hanyecz's Pizza Day purchase has overshadowed his two seminal contributions to Bitcoin's early technical development.

This post originally appeared on Blockspace Media, where Colin Harper is editor-in-chief. 

The first of these came on April 19, 2010, just days after Hanyecz registered for Bitcointalk, a forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto that was (and still is) a watering hole for Bitcoin's techie intelligentsia. Hanyecz created the first MacOS client for Bitcoin Core, the original and still-dominant software implementation for the nodes that underpin the Bitcoin network.

Satoshi originally coded Bitcoin for Windows and Linux, but Hanyecz's innovation enabled MacOS devices to run the software too. His contribution laid the foundation for all MacOS-enabled bitcoin wallets and applications that would follow it.

But arguably greater than this was Hanyecz's discovery that he could mine bitcoin with his computer's graphics card (GPU). Until this point, early adopters used their computer processing units (CPUs) to mine bitcoin, and since GPUs are orders of magnitude more powerful than CPUs for the task, this innovation propelled bitcoin mining forward much faster than Satoshi expected.

“Updated Mac OS X binary…It will use your GPU to generate bitcoins. This works really well if you have a good GPU like an NVIDIA 8800 or something like that,” Hanyecz wrote in a May 10, 2010 Bitcointalk post.

The discovery ignited Bitcoin's first digital gold rush. Bitcoin's total hashrate exploded upward by 130,000% by the end of the year, and for the first time, bitcoin miners began constructing small-scale mining farms. These setups – slapped together in basements and attics, garages and sheds – were the prototypes for the industrial-scale bitcoin mining farms that dominate the Bitcoin network today.

Hanyecz's invention was so consequential that it earned him a virtual drop in from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. And it's possible that the conversation that followed may have inspired Hanyecz's famous Pizza Day purchase.

“A big attraction to new users is that anyone with a computer can generate some free coins,” Satoshi wrote to Hanyecz. “GPUs would prematurely limit the incentive to only those with high-end GPU hardware. It's inevitable that GPU compute clusters will eventually hog all the generated coins, but I don't want to hasten that day.”

In a 2019 interview for Bitcoin Magazine, Hanyecz told me that he “stopped advertising [GPU mining] after that.”

“I was like, ‘Man, I feel like I crapped up your project. Sorry, dude.' He was concerned that some people might be discouraged because they can't mine a block with a CPU,” Hanyecz said.

Perhaps this conversation spurred Hanyecz to offer 10,000 BTC for two large Papa John's pizzas on that fateful day in May 15 years ago. In fact, he made the offer more than once. During the 2019 interview, Hanyecz told me that he spent nearly 100,000 BTC in the year that followed.

“I spent [all my bitcoin] on pizza long ago,” Hanyecz wrote in a February 2014 Bitcointalk post. “Other than a little bit of single digit change, I spent everything I mined. As you all know, the difficulty rises to adjust to hashing power, so eventually the mining wasn't worth it for me.”

Looking at a Bitcoin address Hanyecz listed on his first Bitcointalk post, Hanyecz received and spent 81,432 BTC from this address from April to November 2010. This sum would be worth just over $8.6 billion today.

There's no way to verify if Hanyecz spent all of this on pizza, other goods, or if he simply gave bitcoin away to new Bitcointalk members, a common practice back then when bitcoin was close-to worthless. But he did mention in his original thread for the pizza purchase that it was “an open offer,” although he reneged on this in August saying, “I can't really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore. Thanks to everyone who bought me pizza already.”

The original purchase, let alone the recurring ones that apparently occurred after, would be enough to keep any sane person awake at night as bitcoin marches above $100,000. But in 2019 at least, Hanyecz stomached the ordeal with good humor. As he saw it, he committed culinary alchemy, transmuting his electricity and computing power into a cheap dinner. He had no idea that bitcoin would command the price it does today, so the transaction was a victory in his book.

“A trade happens because both parties think they're getting a good deal,” he said. “I felt like I was beating the internet, getting free food. I was like, ‘Man, I got these GPUs linked together, now I'm going to mine twice as fast. I'm just going to be eating free food; I'll never have to buy food again..." "I mean, I coded this thing and mined bitcoin and I felt like I was winning the internet that day. I got pizza for contributing to an open-source project. Usually hobbies are a time sink and money sink, and in this case, my hobby bought me dinner.”

Bitcoin (BTC) project Roxom Global is building a BTC-denominated securities exchange and a 24/7 media network dedicated entirely to bitcoin.

Roxom has raised $7.9 million in investment for its exchange from Draper Associates, Borderless Capital, ego death and Kingsway Capital and $10 million in a private funding round for RoxomTV, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.

It is building a bitcoin-denominated exchange with futures, spot markets and synthetic instruments priced and settled in BTC. Roxom aims to "bring Bitcoin standards to global finance," CEO Borja Martel Seward said in the announcement.

The exchange is focused on Latin America, Europe and parts of Asia and the Middle East, and is not yet available in the U.S.

Following the model of Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet (3350), RoxomTV is going to be a media network, backed by a 100% bitcoin treasury. It currently holds 84.72 BTC, of which 52.65 were acquired using capital from the funding round at an average price of around $76,300 per coin. 

The company has plans to add a purchase a further 30 BTC in the coming weeks, which would give it a bitcoin treasury worth over $12.7 million based on the current price of $111,000. 

RoxomTV is broadcast on X and streaming platforms Rumble, Twitch, Kick and Dlive, with plans to expand to Linkedin Live, Facebook Live, TikTok and Instagram. 

It currently broadcasts from San Francisco and London and will establish a third hub in Hong Kong in Q3, Roxom said in Thursday's announcement.

Jamie has been part of CoinDesk's news team since February 2021, focusing on breaking news, Bitcoin tech and protocols and crypto VC. He holds BTC, ETH and DOGE.

Asda Faces ICO Complaint After “Unlawful” Facial Recognition Trial


                                                                                Tom Quinn

“Asda's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling,” said Madeleine Stone, Big Brother Watch.

Privacy campaigners have filed a legal complaint with the UK's Information Commissioner, arguing that retail giant Asda's use of live facial recognition cameras in its supermarkets is “unlawful”.

The legal complaint from rights group Big Brother Watch claims that Asda “is infringing the data rights” of shoppers following a trial of live facial recognition in five Greater Manchester stores, and is calling on the Commissioner to halt the retailer's use of the technology.

According to Big Brother Watch's complaint, Asda's use of the controversial technology is placing shoppers' data at a high degree of risk, arguing that such biometric surveillance poses significant risks to customers' fundamental right to privacy. 

The privacy NGO said that with under the system, supermarket staff can add individuals to a facial recognition watchlist, marking them as a “person of interest”, although it claims shoppers are not informed when their facial biometric data, similar to the data held on modern passports, is stored or added to the supermarket's watchlist.

Big Brother Watch further alleged that the supermarket uses the biometric profiles of certain shoppers to create an alert if they enter a store and shares these profiles, along with allegations of unwanted conduct, between stores, however, staff do not provide or receive photos from the police.

In trialling the tech, Asda is the first UK-wide supermarket to install live facial recognition, with Big Brother Watch warning that if rolled out to more of its UK stores, Asda's facial recognition tech could have a profound impact on the data rights of tens of millions of people.

“Asda's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling, and risks violating the privacy rights of thousands of people,” said Madeleine Stone, senior advocacy officer at Big Brother Watch.

“Facial recognition surveillance turns shoppers into suspects by subjecting customers browsing the supermarket aisles to a series of invasive biometric identity checks.

“Asda should abandon this trial and the government must urgently step in to prevent the unchecked spread of this invasive technology.”

Setting out to warn Asda's customers of what it called an attempt to “roll back their privacy”, Big Brother Watch has sent the world's largest digital ad van to tour the five stores using facial recognition.

However, in response, Asda said that the technology was only being implemented for a limited period in its Greater Manchester stores, with an Asda spokesperson telling DIGIT: “Like all retailers, our stores are subject to unprecedented levels of retail crime and on average four Asda colleagues were assaulted at work every day last year. 

“We have launched this trial in five stores for a limited period to assess how it can keep colleagues and customers safe.

“This trial uses Asda's existing CCTV system and fully complies with all data protection regulations.”

It's not the first time that Asda has clashed with the privacy NGO over this issue. 

In 2019, the retailer denied using facial recognition cameras at its Preston store, insisting that the tech was only being used to improve CCTV quality and deter thieves without logging any personal information from customers. 

Six years later, this latest trial hit headlines last April with Asda reportedly being swamped by more than 5,400 complaints in what Big Brother said was a backlash from the public for using intrusive surveillance technology, a claim that the retailer roundly rejected, saying it had only received 89 emails about the trial through its official channels.

The famous pizzas from Laszlo Hanyecz's May 22, 2010 Bitcoin Pizza Day purchase

For bitcoin users, May 22 – known as Bitcoin Pizza Day – is a day for feasting.

Today, bitcoin fans around the world are savoring pizza to celebrate Bitcoin developer and miner Laszlo Hanyecz's famous pizza order on May 22, 2010. On this day 15 years ago, Hanyecz paid another early bitcoin adopter 10,000 BTC in exchange for two large Papa John's pizzas. This marked the first real world purchase of any good with the cryptocurrency, which was barely a year old at the time.

Laszlo Hanyecz's original Bitcoin Pizza Day post on May 18, 2010. His request was fulfilled by ... More another Bitcointalk users four days later.

Bitcoiners observe this greasy, bitcoin-themed simulacrum of Thanksgiving with commiseration as much as celebration, because those 10,000 BTC are now worth more than $1 billion.

But what most people don't realize is that Hanyecz may have spent as much as 79,000 BTC on follow-on pizza purchases that year, a sum that would be worth more than $8.7 billion today. And what is also lost in the gobsmacked reactions to the billion-dollar forfeit is the question: how did Hanyecz acquire all this bitcoin in the first place?

When I interviewed Hanyecz back in 2019, he mentioned that he spent nearly 100,000 BTC on pizza in 2010. He didn't think anything of the trades at the time.

After all, bitcoin was next to worthless then. Hanyecz noted that Bitcointalk, the popular forum focused on discussions about bitcoin that Hanyecz used to facilitate the original Bitcoin Pizza Day purchas, was full of users giving away bitcoin to newcomers by the hundreds or thousands.

Laszlo isn't bitter about the ordeal. He described it as though he “was winning the internet that day” because his “hobby bought [him] dinner.”

In fact, he was so pleased by the trade that he kept the offer open from May 22 until August 4, 2010, after which point he posted on Bitcointalk, saying, "I can't afford to keep doing it since I can't [mine]



In the same post, he thanked “everyone who bought [him] pizza already,” so ostensibly he made additional pizza purchases between the May and August window.

Fast forward four years, Hanyecz wrote about his erstwhile bitcoin fortune in another post. “I spent it all on pizza,” he said, with a link to the bitcoin address listed in his first ever Bitcointalk post to prove it.

The wallet shows that Laszlo sent over 79,000 BTC from the day it was created on April 10, 2010 through August 4, 2010, the day he closed his open offer to trade bitcoin for pizza. The wallet now ironically holds only enough to purchase a large pizza with the current BTC-USD rate, and it was effectively drained of its last significant bitcoin holdings in June 2011. The wallet's total outflows amount to a little over 81,432 BTC.

In 2009 and 2010, Bitcoin's block reward was 50 BTC per block (plus transaction fees), and since bitcoin blocks are mined every ten minutes on average, this means that Hanyecz's 81,432 BTC fortune represented roughly 1.5% of all mined coins at the time. So how did he amass this stash?

Hanyecz was a prolific developer in Bitcoin's early days. Not only did he design Bitcoin's first MacOS client, but he also was the first person – beside Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – to discover that bitcoin miners could generate new coins with graphics cards.

Hanyecz advertised his discovery in May 2010. Before this, bitcoin miners used their laptop or desktop computer processing unit to mine bitcoin. But GPUs upgraded them with 10 times more computing power to generate new bitcoin.

The discovery opened the floodgates, and the computing power that secured the bitcoin network increased 1,300-fold by the end of 2010. Ironically, the increase in competition is the very reason that Hanyecz could no longer generate “thousands of coins a day” as he opined in the August 2010 Bitcointalk post.

Bitcoin's hashrate exploded following Bitcoin Pizza Day legend Laszlo Hanyecz's discovery of GPU ... More bitcoin mining.

With Pandora's box opened, Hanyecz's discovery also elicited a polite reprimand from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. As detailed by Nathaniel Popper in his book Digital Gold, “Satoshi had mixed feelings” about this early introduction of GPU mining, which the Bitcoin creator seemed to have anticipated.

Satoshi emailed the following to Laszlo:

And with that, we're left with a burning question: Did Hanyecz divest himself of his bitcoin fortune as a form of absolution for hastening Bitcoin's mining centralization?

Only Hanyecz knows the answer, but he's unlikely to tell it since he rarely (if ever) gives interviews anymore. After all, why should he when the topic at hand – Bitcoin Pizza Day – is a constant reminder that he traded a future, multi-billion dollar fortune for mediocre pizza?

Ethereum (ETH) saw a 2% gain in the early Asian session on Thursday, recovering the $2,500 key level after whales stepped on the gas with their buying pressure.

Ethereum's supply on exchanges extended its decline to 18.73 million ETH on Wednesday, indicating sustained spot market buying pressure. Since the metric began a downtrend on April 24, more than 1 million ETH have left exchanges to private wallets for potential long-term holding. As a result, ETH's supply on exchanges has reached its lowest level since August 2024.

The reduced exchange supply partly explains why ETH's price has maintained an upward trajectory since the same date.

Similar to previous weeks, whales with a balance of 10K-100K continued leading the buying activity, growing their holdings by a net of 670K ETH in the past nine days. However, smaller holders have been distributing, with their total balance declining by 110K ETH during the same period.

Despite dominant spot buying pressure, ETH continues to move range-bound near the $2,500 mark. ETH Futures Bubble Maps show increased trading volume whenever prices move below or above $2,500, making it a critical level that could define the top altcoin's next major trend.

Meanwhile, search interest for Ethereum has picked up pace again near the 60-point mark, up from 45 on May 17 but down from the 100-point level seen during the May 8 - 9 rally. This indicates that intense retail excitement isn't leading ETH's price, leaving room for a more robust price growth.

Ethereum experienced $106.52 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long and short positions is $56.20 million and $50.32 million, respectively.

After closing near $2,500 on Tuesday, ETH briefly surged above $2,600 on Wednesday but saw a rejection just below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The top altcoin is up 2% at the time of writing as bulls look to maintain a firm move above the $2,500 level.

ETH needs a high volume move above the $2,850 resistance or below the $2,260 - $2,100 range to establish its next direction. A move above $2,850 could see ETH rally toward the $3,250 resistance, while a breakdown below $2,100 could send its price to the $1,688 support.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued its horizontal trend near the overbought region line, indicating slight weakness in the bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is testing its moving average line as its histogram bars are about to flip negative. A successful cross below will signal rising downward pressure.

Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts are celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day with a banger. BTC made a new all-time high on Wednesday and has entered price discovery mode. The OG cryptocurrency is trading above $110,000 for the first time ever.

Ripple's (XRP) price accelerates the uptrend to around $2.43 at the time of writing on Thursday, propelled by improving sentiment in the broader crypto market after Bitcoin (BTC) rapidly rallied to new all-time highs at approximately $111,880.

The Graph (GRT) plans to adopt the Chainlink (LINK) interoperability standard (CCIP) to enable GRT transfers across three ecosystems. A successful deployment of GRT bridges across Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Solana (SOL) will significantly expand its cross-chain functionality. 

Cryptocurrencies broadly extend gains on Thursday, propelled by Bitcoin's (BTC) surge to new all-time highs at around $111,880. Meanwhile, altcoins continue to gain strength, with Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) sliding to approximately 63.84%, buoyed by significant rallies in meme coins such as Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT).

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes at around $103,000 when writing on Friday, after facing multiple rejections at the key $105,000 resistance level throughout the week.

Ethereum price found support at $2,440 and started a fresh increase. ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,650 resistance zone.

Ethereum Price Could Gain Strength

Ethereum price remained in a range above $2,350 while Bitcoin traded to a new all-time high. ETH bulls were active near the $2,440 zone. A low was formed at $2,442 and the price started a fresh increase.

There was a move above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low.

On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,620 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance.

An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,920 resistance zone or even $3,000 in the near term.

Another Drop In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone and the trend line.

A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged above $110,000 for the first time on Wednesday, surpassing its previous record set just before President Donald Trump's January inauguration.


 The cryptocurrency gathered momentum this week after the Senate on Monday voted to advance a bill that establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, said the bank would allow clients to buy bitcoin. 


 The digital asset has also received a boost recently from growing demand from corporate treasuries. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which popularized the idea, purchased an additional $765 million worth of Bitcoin last week, bringing the value of its holdings in the cryptocurrency to more than $63 billion. 


 These latest developments reinforce expectations that Washington remains committed to developing a crypto-friendly regulatory framework and highlight the accelerating corporate acceptance of digital assets.


 Bitcoin was trading at $110,000 recently, after rising as high as $110,700 this evening. The digital currency has gained about 45% since hitting an early-April low of around $76,000, when investors fled risky assets amid growing concerns about global trade tensions that have since subsided.


 Below, we break down the technicals on bitcoin's chart and identify crucial price levels that investors will likely be watching.


 Since bottoming out last month, bitcoin's price has trended higher within a rising wedge, a chart pattern that signals a potential reversal upon a breakdown. Moreover, it's worth pointing out the move higher has occurred on decline trading volume, indicating that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines.


 However, more recently, the price has edged toward the pattern's upper trendline in a move that has coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory. In another win for BTC bulls, the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day MA on Wednesday to form a golden cross, a chart event indicating further upside.


 Let's use technical analysis to project a potential bullish price target above bitcoin's record high and also identify three crucial support levels worth monitoring during future retracements in the cryptocurrency.


 Investors can project a price target above bitcoin's record high by using the bars pattern tool. We apply this technique by taking the cryptocurrency's trend higher from late April to early May and repositioning it from Sunday's low. This analysis projects a target of around $120,000. 


 We selected this prior trend as it commenced following a narrow consolidation range, similar to how the current move higher has started.


 The first lower level to monitor sits around $107,000. Investors will be watching if bitcoin's price can hold above the two prominent peaks that formed on the chart in December and January, with the area possibly flipping from prior resistance into future support.


 The bulls' inability to defend this crucial level could see the price fall to the psychological $100,000 mark. This area would likely provide support near a horizontal line that connects a series of trading activity on the chart stretching back to last November.


 Finally, a more significant drop opens the door for bitcoin's price to revisit lower support around $92,000. Investors may seek entry points in this area near the two moving averages, which closely align with a range of peaks and troughs that developed on the chart between November and March.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high this week, briefly surging to $110,000 after the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill in the US Senate fueled optimism for regulatory clarity under President Donald Trump.

The milestone comes amid renewed investor confidence in digital assets, with the broader crypto market, including Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP), showing signs of volatility following the news. While Bitcoin led the charge, altcoins have yet to confirm whether they'll follow BTC's breakout or continue lagging behind.

Bitcoin has surged past the upper trendline of its multimonth descending channel — a classic bull flag — to reclaim the $110,000 level. Historically, such breakouts have preceded massive rallies, and the current setup projects a potential price target near $152,000, based on the height of the flagpole.

The weekly relative strength index (RSI) sits just below 70, not yet overbought, giving bulls more runway. The 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) also continues to hold as solid dynamic support near $82,000. With increasing volume, the breakout appears to have technical strength.

Ethereum has bounced nearly 50% from its local bottom and now approaches a decisive resistance near $2,950, which coincides with the lower trendline of its long-term ascending channel. This region also aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level from its $4,800 peak.

A confirmed breakout above this zone would open the path to the channel's upper trendline near $4,800, reinforcing a broader bullish thesis. However, the weekly RSI still hovers around neutral levels, suggesting ETH needs strong momentum to push through this supply zone.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum flash bullish patterns, XRP paints a starkly different technical picture. The token has likely formed a cup-and-handle top, a bearish reversal setup that threatens a retest of key support near $1.10, roughly the level of its 200-week EMA.

After failing to flip the $2.80 resistance into support, XRP/USD has traced a rounded top with lower highs, weakening its market structure. The declining RSI reinforces this view, and a breakdown below $2.00 could trigger a deeper decline.

Hovering above the pivotal 26 EMA, which is currently serving as its main support level, XRP is indicating an impending breakout. XRP is currently coiling for a possible move driven by technical consolidation after a comparatively quiet correction phase. The price has remained stable above the $2.30 mark. 

The convergence of the main moving averages, especially the 26, 50 and 100 EMAs that are starting to tighten, is the most important finding on the chart. This squeeze pattern frequently precedes volatility surges, which are characterized by a sharp price swing as compressed momentum finds direction. 

If buying pressure returns, the likelihood of an upward breakout is higher as long as XRP remains above these levels. Although currently muted, volume lends credence to the compression narrative. XRP has a history of exhibiting explosive behavior after low-volume plateaus close to important technical thresholds. 

Since the RSI is close to 60, there is still space for the asset to rise without going into overbought territory right away. Latent bullish energy waiting for a catalyst is indicated by this technical setup. XRP is currently recovering from a multi-month downward trend, and its recent breakout above that structure earlier this month has not been disproven from a wider market structure standpoint. 

A continuation rally could be in the works based on the current price action, which points to a sound retest of support. If volume validates the breakout and XRP closes above the $2.50 resistance, a move toward $2.80-$3.00 may occur quickly. In contrast, a loss of the 26 EMA would raise the risk of a decline to the 100 EMA, which is located around $2.26. 

As the long consolidation comes to an end and a new bullish leg begins, Ethereum has formally broken out of its descending trendline. Beyond simply being a technical milestone, this breakout could serve as the basis for Ethereum's long-awaited reversal and a push toward the crucial $3,000 mark. The 200 EMA, which has served as a solid support and launching pad for the current move, was touched and bounced off by ETH at the pivotal moment.

Its importance as a psychological and technical floor, which bulls successfully defended in the face of wider market hesitancy, is confirmed by the response from this level. A distinct close above the upper trendline has now validated the breakout from the short-term descending wedge pattern, which was characterized by several weeks of lower highs. In bullish times, this pattern frequently serves as a continuation structure, and ETH's follow-through has reinforced that assertion.

No, Bitcoin Price Is Not Overheated Yet, Bullish Data Emerge On-chain

ByGodfrey Benjamin





The move gains weight when the volume stays constant during a breakout. Further upward movement is still possible, particularly in a breakout scenario, even though the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving toward overbought territory. Now, the main resistance to keep an eye on is just below the psychological $3,000 level close to the $2,800 zone.

This move could draw in sidelined buyers and start a new round of bullish activity if Ethereum can keep up the momentum and clear this region with increasing volume. Ethereum's technicals are pointing in the direction of a sustained increase. A bullish outlook is well supported by the clean breakout setup bounce from the 200 EMA and descending trendline break. The level of $3,000 is now firmly on the horizon, and ETH may soon enter its next significant push if market conditions continue to be favorable.

With the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) progressively approaching the longer-term 200 EMA, Shiba Inu is displaying early indications of a possible golden cross formation. Although this crossover is typically interpreted in technical analysis as a bullish signal, SHIB's future is far from assured. In terms of price, SHIB has been comparatively steady in recent sessions, circling around the 100 EMA just above important support levels.

The token is forming a base once more in anticipation of a catalyst that will push it higher following its previous unsuccessful breakout attempt above the 200 EMA. An impending momentum shift may be signaled by the 50 EMA's current proximity to the price action, but this needs to be confirmed. Nonetheless, the obvious drop in trading volume is among the most obvious warning signs.

Weak volume, combined with a golden cross, frequently causes a false breakout or rapid reversals. This setup could easily fade away before reaching full crossover status if there is not much buying pressure. In recent days, Shiba Inu has experienced a significant increase in both inflow and outflow on-chain. Inflows from large holders have increased by more than 1100% in the last week, while outflow activity has also increased significantly.

This implies that whales are paying more attention, though not necessarily in a positive way. Instead of accumulation, the opposing flows suggest redistribution or strategic repositioning. Now everyone's watching to see if the 50 EMA can continue to close the 200 EMA gap and set off a golden cross. SHIB is still in a speculative zone until volume is confirmed and price action stays above important EMAs. Traders should proceed cautiously and wait for confirmation in the volume and market structure before committing to bullish wagers.

It may be one of evolution's greatest tricks yet.

Euphoria. Mental clarity. Heightened awareness. Reduced pain. Zen.

These are some of the sensations you might feel after smoking a joint—or on a particularly rousing run. Indeed, the approximately three-quarters of athletes who say they've experienced “runner's high,” report that as pain, doubt, and a concrete sense of time slip away, they're replaced by bliss, confidence, and a trance-like focus. In other words, an altered state of consciousness. 

For decades, scientists chalked up this heady buzz to endorphins, those natural painkillers that the body releases when we laugh, eat dark chocolate, or work up a sweat. But in the last few years, research has begun to point to a different set of biochemicals as the cause of runner's high. Endocannabinoids are like the body's version of THC, the chemical in marijuana that makes you feel, well, high. 

While a pleasant physiological response may have evolved to allow our ancestors to chase prey over long distances, there's evidence that runner's high can help contemporary humans feel happier, less stressed, and more motivated to exercise.  

In the 1980s, exercise scientists started to attribute the groove you feel on a really good run to endorphins, after finding high levels of the natural painkillers in people's bloodstreams during vigorous exercise. Researchers assumed these chemicals must be responsible for the ease and euphoria that sometimes can arise during an intense workout. 

But there was a problem with this explanation. Endorphin molecules are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. Even if a runner's blood was swimming with endorphins, there was no way for them to reach the brain and unlock an altered state of consciousness. There had to be another explanation. 

In the early part of the last decade, scientists turned their attention to endocannabinoids, naturally occurring chemicals in the body that are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier. A 2012 study was among the first to establish that mammals adapted for running—humans and dogs, specifically—produce extra cannabinoids while hoofing it on a treadmill. 

But the real breakthrough came in 2015, when researchers at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany showed that mice whose endorphins were blocked ended their laboratory runs calmer and less stressed than when they started. When the animals' endocannabinoids were blocked, on the other hand, the mice were just as stressed as they had been before running, suggesting the feel-good effects of a run were the result of excess endocannabinoids.

Later that year, the researchers reproduced these results in human runners. After a 45-minute run, participants whose endorphin system had been deactivated by the drug naloxone still reported that euphoric runner's high, and their blood showed increased levels of endocannabinoids. 

So is runner's high an actual high? While different chemicals are at play, you might be hard-pressed to tell the two apart. “Endocannabinoid receptors are concentrated in the central nervous system and designed for the chemicals our bodies make,” says Angela Bryan, Ph.D., an avid runner and neuroscientist who studies how cannabis affects the human body. The reason why an epic run can feel so much like eating a potent gummy is that THC is an exogenous cannabinoid, in other words a cannabinoid that comes from outside the body, meaning “it fits into those receptors like a lock in a key,” according to Bryan.

The 2015 study also revealed that moderate exercise like walking does not produce a glut of endocannabinoids, a finding that seems to point to runner's high as a trick of evolution.    

For modern humans, running is an ideal way to stay in shape or simply get some alone time outdoors. But back when our ancestors were chasing game across vast savannas, running was the way we found dinner. Activating the endocannabinoid system, which fires up to regulate stress and reduce pain, may have allowed us to push through the burning lungs and biting cramps of a long-distance hunt. “In order to survive we had to engage in a physical activity,” says Bryan. “If that was horrible and felt awful and [we] didn't want to do it, we might not have survived.”

Another effect of runner's high is a heightened sense of focus. Some athletes report clearer thinking and sharper vision during their long-haul jaunts, two sensations that would come in handy while stalking a large, wily animal. Feeling calm and confident during such an arduous pursuit was no doubt an evolutionary advantage of the runner's high.    

But vanishingly few workouts result in a runner's high, and there is evidence that some people can't achieve one no matter how many miles they run. For example, past studies have found that as many as a quarter of endurance runners have reported never experiencing a runner's high. 

Still, if you're hoping to achieve transcendence on the treadmill, science does have a few tips for you. While the bad news is it's unlikely you'll unlock a new level of consciousness on a light, 20-minute run, the better news is you probably don't need to push yourself to extremes. David Raichlen, the evolutionary biologist behind that 2012 study about runner's high in mammals, has suggested that working out at about 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate (there's a calculator for that based on your age) for at least 45 minutes is ideal for boosting endocannabinoid production.

As far as doubling up on cannabinoids—consuming THC before a run—Bryan says results are not guaranteed. “Some people feel a big boost when they use cannabis during exercise; some people don't. There's just a ton of variability.” 

To find out what works for you, the scientist says, “start low and go slow. If you don't get the feeling you want, increase the dosage a little more. It can take a while to dial it in.” 

To get a runner's high the old-fashioned way, Bryan's advice is to lace up your running shoes often and consistently. “One thing that we know is the better we get at it, the better it feels,” she says. “Start with walking, then walk farther. Start running, then run farther. Eventually you'll be able to do it long enough for the endocannabinoid system to kick in.”

People who tested a new type of designer contact lens could see flashing infrared signals from a light source.Credit: Yuqian Ma, Yunuo Chen, Hang Zhao (CC BY-SA)

Humans have a new way of seeing infrared light, without the need for clunky night-vision goggles. Researchers have made the first contact lenses to convey infrared vision — and the devices work even when people have their eyes closed.

The team behind the invention, led by scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei, gave the lenses their power by infusing them with nanoparticles that convert near-infrared light in the 800–1,600-nanometre range into shorter-wavelength, visible light that humans can see, in the 400–700-nanometre range. The researchers estimate that the lenses cost around US$200 per pair to make.

The technology, which was detailed in Cell on 22 May1, “is incredibly cool, just like something out of a science-fiction movie”, says Xiaomin Li, a chemist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. It opens up “new possibilities for understanding the world around us”, he adds.

Near-infrared light sits just outside the range of wavelengths that humans can normally detect. Some animals can sense infrared light, although probably not well enough to form images.

Night-vision goggles enable humans to see infrared radiation, but they are bulky and require a power source to work. The new lenses avoid these limitations while also offering richer, multi-coloured infrared images that night-vision goggles, which operate on a monochrome green scale, typically do not.

However, the lenses do have their own shortcomings. Because the embedded nanoparticles scatter light, the images the lenses create are blurry. The team partially corrected this by putting the technology into glasses with additional lenses that redirect the light. Moreover, unlike night-vision goggles, which amplify light to detect low-level infrared signals, the lenses also allow users to see only intense infrared signals, such as those emitted by light-emitting diodes (LEDs). 

For these reasons, some critics don't think the lenses will prove useful. “I cannot think of any application that would not be fundamentally simpler with infrared goggles,” says Glen Jeffery, a neuroscientist at University College London who specializes in eye health. “Evolution has avoided this for a good reason.”

Nevertheless, the authors think that their lenses can be further optimized and foresee several possible uses for the invention. For instance, wearers would be able to read anti-counterfeit marks that emit infrared wavelengths but are otherwise invisible to the human eye, says co-author Yuqian Ma, a neuroscientist at the USTC.

Li, who was not involved in the work, offers another possibility: the lenses might be worn by doctors conducting near-infrared fluorescence surgery, to directly detect and remove cancerous lesions “without relying on bulky traditional equipment”.

The path toward our mind-machine merger never has never seemed clearer.

Here's what you'll learn about when you read this story:

Two very different types of “computers” dominate the world today. The first is the type you're likely reading this article on—machines powered by transistors and silicon that make our modern society possible. Then, there's the biological type of computer that's been a couple billion years in the making—the human brain, which has neurons and a cerebral cortex instead of transistors and a motherboard. 

These are two wildly different architectures with totally different capabilities—the human brain somehow achieves a level of consciousness unseen elsewhere in nature (or the observable universe, for that matter), but computers can do calculating tasks many times faster than our minds could ever fathom. So, it should come as no surprise that since the very origins of computing, scientists and engineers have pondered whether these two disparate “computers” could one day merge together. 

Well, apparently, that time is now. Cortical Labs, an Australia-based company, announced earlier this year that it had successfully developed the world's first “biological computer,” which it calls the CL-1. Fusing human brain cells with silicon hardware, Cortical Labs says the CL-1 is an ideal tool for science and medical research, meaning that this thing isn't going to be siding onto your desktop and delivering a 120 frames-per-second gaming experience. Instead, this $35,000 computer—which will be widely available later this year—could make medical testing and other scientific trials easier, as scientists can essentially test would-be drugs on this ‘body in a box' biological computer. 

“The large majority of drugs for neurological and psychiatric diseases that enter clinical trial testing fail, because there's so much more nuance when it comes to the brain—but you can actually see that nuance when you test with these tools,” Brett Kagan, Cortical Labs' Chief Scientific Officer, told New Atlas back in March. “Our hope is that we're able to replace significant areas of animal testing with this. Animal testing is unfortunately still necessary, but I think there are a lot of cases where it can be replaced and that's an ethically good thing.”

Kagan was directly involved in the development of CL-1's predecessor, DishBrain, which grabbed headlines back in 2022 for successfully playing a game of Pong (the results of which were published in the journal Neuron). As Kagan explained at the time, DishBrain played Pong quite unlike a human brain, and instead described the neurons as sort of experiencing its surroundings as if it was the Pong paddle itself. 

However, this dawning era of neurons-on-a-chip computing brings up a sticky question: Could we be possibly subjecting a type of sentience to a “life” of abject misery or, at the very least, boredom? Back in 2022, Kagan said that his team was working closely with bioethicists to answer this question, and clearly came to the conclusion that this wasn't a concern—at least, not yet. 

Speaking with Live Science, a stem cell research unaffiliated with Cortical Labs came to a similar conclusion, and Suhas Kumar from Sandia National Laboratories also told Popular Mechanics back in 2022 that the simplicity of this setup means the neurons are simply responding to a stimulus. However, seeing as this is just a first step into the broader world of neuromorphic computing, the relative simplicity of CL-1 could get dizzyingly complex pretty quick. 

The Cortical Labs team argues that Synthetic Biological Intelligence, or SBI, is “inherently more natural than AI” because it uses materials more akin to the human brain. As the technology progresses, this could produce results similar to that of a human mind, blurring the lines between the world's two greatest computers even further.

Some of the early hominins evidently went island hopping.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

During the glacial period that chilled the Earth 140,000 years ago, sea levels in the Indonesian region of Sundaland were low enough for present-day islands to tower like mountain ranges with a lowland savannah stretching between them. It was an expanse of mostly dry grasslands with strips of forest edging the rivers, and animals like crocodiles, river sharks, elephants, hippos, rhinos, and carnivorous lizards flourished in the region. 

Sundaland was also a paradise for early humans. Long thought to have been isolated on the island of Java, two fossil fragments of a Homo erectus skull—which surfaced with recent ocean dredging in preparation for the construction of an artificial island—revealed that this hominin species migrated and spread throughout the islands when they could still walk over bridges of land. 

Homo erectus was first discovered in Java (and was known as “Java Man” until the species was officially renamed), but sossilized remains had never before been found on the seafloor between what are now the islands of Java, Bali, Sumatra and Borneo. Now that examples have been dredged up, however, Harold Berghuis—an archaeologist from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, who led the investigation —thinks Homo erectus took advantage of the now-drowned land, and likely settled near the riverbanks in the region.

“Under the relatively dry Middle Pleistocene climate of eastern Java, herds of herbivores and groups of hominins on the lowland plains were probably dependent on large perennial rivers, providing drinking water and terrestrial as well as aquatic food sources,” Berghuis said in a study recently published in Quaternary Environments and Humans. 

These human ancestors would have had plenty to take advantage of near these ancient rivers. Trees bore fruit all year, and the ancient hominins would have been able to gather edible plants in addition to catching fish and shellfish. They may have even used mussel shells as tools—the oldest known evidence of them being used for that purpose—and engraved some of them (the most ancient human engravings have been found on shells that previously turned up in Java). The new findings show that they also hunted river turtles and terrestrial animals. Bones of river turtles and bovine ancestors showed cut marks and breakages that suggested the consumption of both meat and bone marrow.

More modern human species on the Asian mainland (such as Denisovans and Neanderthals) were already known to have hunted bovids, and while no evidence for this had been found on Java, the presence of these seafloor fossils could mean that hunting methods were transferred from one species to the other. There may have even been interbreeding. Land exposed by diminished sea levels also meant that animal species from the mainland—like the extinct Asian hippo and the endangered (but still-extant) Komodo dragon—could spread to the Indonesian islands.

Homo erectus marked a significant shift in human evolution—they were the earliest hominids to bear more of a resemblance to modern humans, with larger bodies, longer legs, and shorter arms relative to their torso. More muscle mass meant that they could walk and run faster than earlier hominins, and were likely more adept hunters. An increase in body size is also associated with an increase in brain size, and skulls tell us that their brains were over 50% larger than those of early Australopithecus species (though the human brain would eventually evolve to be 40% larger than that by the time Homo sapiens appeared). 

“The late Middle Pleistocene age of the site is of great interest in terms of hominin evolution, as this period is characterized by a great morphological diversity and mobility of hominin populations in the region,” Berghuis and his team said.

When sea levels rose, the land bridges between the islands of Sundaland were submerged, but this dredging has given us an unprecedented window into the life of Homo erectus in Indonesia.

How Much Ultraprocessed Food Do You Eat? Blood and Urine Record It

A new study suggests blood and urine samples could provide an objective measure of diets and help unravel their connections to disease

By Smriti Mallapaty & Nature magazine 

Diets rich in industrially manufactured food have been associated with several health conditions.

Molecules in urine and blood can reveal how much of a person's diet comes from ultra-processed foods, according to a study published in PLOS Medicine today. The paper suggests that these measurements provide an objective way to track consumption of ultra-processed food — and would be useful for investigating links to diseases such as diabetes and cancer.

Ultra-processed foods are industrially manufactured and often contain ingredients, such as additives and emulsifiers, that are not typically found in home-cooked food. From sweetened yogurts to factory-made bread and packaged snacks, “it's a really wide range of foods”, says study co-author Erikka Loftfield, an epidemiologist at the US National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland.

Studies have linked high consumption of ultra-processed food to an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some types of cancer. But these investigations have typically relied on asking individuals to remember what they have eaten, which can be unreliable.

Studies have also shown the potential of studying the products of metabolism excreted in the blood and urine, but only for a small number of such metabolites. Loftfield and her colleagues have now expanded that analysis to include more than 1,000 metabolites, which are produced when the body converts food into energy.

“This work is important,” says Oliver Robinson, a molecular epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “There's a lot of measurement error in traditional assessment methods for diet.”

Loftfield and her colleagues studied samples collected from 718 healthy individuals aged 50–74 in 2012–13. The participants' urine and blood samples had been collected twice, six months apart. The participants had also been asked — up to six times during the one-year study period — to record everything they had consumed the day before. Loftfield's team labelled each food item, from the bun in a burger to the cheese slice, meat patty and ketchup, either ultra-processed or not.

The researchers then used a machine-learning technique to give each participant a score for how much of their daily energy intake came from ultra-processed foods, says Loftfield. They found that, on average, ultra-processed food accounted for 50% of the participants' energy intake, but the range varied between individuals — from 12% to 82%. Individuals who consumed the most ultra-processed foods generally got more of their energy from carbohydrates, added sugars and saturated fats — and less from proteins and fibre — than did those who consumed lower levels of ultra-processed foods.

The researchers then analysed the participants' blood and urine samples, looking for metabolites that were more common in the people whose diets contained lots of ultra-processed food.

Samples from people with diets rich in ultra-processed foods were more likely to contain a metabolite linked to an increased risk of type-2 diabetes — and some of these people's urine samples contained a molecule produced by certain food packaging. They also contained fewer metabolites derived from fresh fruits and vegetables.

To test whether the metabolite scoring could be used to predict the presence of a lot of ultra-processed food in a person's diet, the researchers used data from a randomized controlled diet study of 20 individuals aged 18–50 conducted between 2018 and 2020. Half of the participants were asked to eat a diet rich in ultra-processed food for two weeks, then a diet containing no ultra-processed food for two weeks; the rest ate the same diets in the opposite order. Loftfield and her colleagues found they were able to distinguish between the two diets by looking at the metabolites in the participants' urine and blood samples.

Loftfield wants to test the method on populations with more varied diets, and on younger people, who tend to eat more ultra-processed foods. She hopes to use the tool to improve studies of the link between ultra-processed food and cancer.

Robinson wonders whether the tool could be used to address big unanswered questions, including what it is about ultra-processed food that is bad for you. It is difficult to distinguish between the metabolic signatures of a diet rich in ultra-processed food and of one that is unhealthy because it is high in salt, sugar and saturated fats, he says.

Understanding this difference could help companies to improve their products. “We're sort of trapped in this industrial food-production system where we all eat ultra-processed food, and it's quite hard for most people to go back to fresh food, because our food systems are now set up like this,” adds Robinson.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

Garfield might be the most iconic orange tabby around, but Hollywood has seen quite a few leading cats of the same color—Heathcliff, Oliver, Hiyao Miyazaki's adorably terrifying Catbus from My Neighbor Totoro, and Morris from those retro cat food commercials all come to mind. Like most celebrities, they have so far refused to give up their most guarded beauty secret—how did they get those fabulous golden auburn coats?

Hiroyuki Sasaki—a cat enthusiast and geneticist at Kyushu University in Japan—was determined to identify the elusive gene that carries the orange mutation in Felis silvestris catus (the domesticated cat). He and his research team analyzed DNA in skin tissue from cats with and without orange fur, and found a mutation to the ARHGAP36 gene. This was a type of deletion mutation, meaning that a segment of a gene is missing. In orange cats, the missing segment is located on an intron, or noncoding region, of the ARHGAP36 gene, which is also in neuroendocrine tissues (especially the hypothalamus), adrenal glands, and pituitary glands.

The location of the mutation on this particular gene also explains why there are so many more male orange cats than female ones. ARHGAP36 is known as X-linked, meaning that it is located on the X chromosome. In female cats (and all female mammals), one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is randomly switched off in a process known as X chromosome inactivation, so even if the mutation is present, it is unlikely that it will be expressed by every cell and appear as an even (or even semi-even) orange coat. To be orange, a female cat must have the orange gene on both X chromosomes, so no matter which one is deleted, the orange gene still dominates.

Male cats, on the other hand, only have one X chromosome, and are therefore much more likely to evenly express that mutation. 

Whether orange or not, all fur pigmentation genes are X-linked. Calico and tortoiseshell coats also come from different combinations of activated X chromosomes—both with and without the deletion that results in orange—which explains why most of them are female.  For this to happen to a male cat, there would have to be two X chromosomes present next to the Y chromosome in order for random inactivation to result in mottled fur.

Sasaki and his team found that ARHGAP36 was most active in melanocytes (cells in the skin which produce pigment) found in the orange patches of calicos and tortoiseshells. Genes promoting melanogenesis, or the production of melanin in melanocytes, suppress ARHGAP36 and are upregulated in brown, black, and gray patches. These colors are associated with the black or brown pigment known as eumelanin, which is also the most common form of melanin.

Sasaki believes that when a mutated ARHGAP36 is expressed as orange fur in cats, the missing part of the gene would have suppressed orange coloration had it been present. In cats, mutated ARHGAP36 was shown to suppress other genes involved in the production of eumelanin so that it could instead produce a different type of melanin called pheomelanin, which is the reddish-yellow pigment in orange fur. Found only in mammals and birds, pheomelanin is also behind red hair in humans and flashy red feathers in some bird species.

It seems that high ARHGAP36 activity is, in general, associated with reduced activity in genes involved with the production of eumelanin. Sasaki is convinced that this gene's takeover may somehow shift pigment production to pheomelanin instead—though, how exactly it pulls this off is still unknown. And because ARHGAP36 also has significant importance in the brain, there is even speculation as to whether there are true associations between fur color and personality (the confirmation of which could either prove or silence all the orange cat memes out there).

“Although it is not fully understood how the identified deletion switches the pigment species, the variation likely dominates the cat population with orange coat color,” the researchers wrote.

Somewhere, Garfield is smugly beaming next to a tray of lasagna.

How One Astronomer Helped to Discover Nearly 200 Moons of Saturn

Scientific American spoke with the astronomer who has contributed to the discovery of two thirds of Saturn's known moons

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

NASA, ESA, John T. Clarke (Boston University), Zolt G. Levay (STScI)

A mere decade ago, astronomers knew of just 62 moons around Saturn. Today the ringed planet boasts a staggering 274 official satellites. That's more than any other world in the solar system—and far too many for most people to keep track of. Astronomer Edward Ashton is no exception, even though he has helped to discover 192 of them—he thinks that's the total, anyway, after pausing to do some mental math.

Ashton is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taiwan. He fell into hunting for Saturn's moons in 2018, when his then academic adviser suggested the project for his Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia. It has been a fruitful search. Most recently, in March, Ashton and his colleagues announced a batch of 128 newfound Saturnian satellites.

Scientific American spoke with Ashton about the science of discovering so many relatively tiny moons—most of them just a few kilometers wide—using vast amounts of data gathered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), located in Hawaii.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

How have you found these moons?

To detect the moons, we use a technique known as shifting and stacking. We take 44 sequential images of the same patch of sky over a three-hour period because, in that time frame, the moons move relative to the stars at a rate similar to Saturn. If we just stack the images normally, then the moon appears as a streak across the images, and that dilutes the signal of the moon.

So what we do is: we shift the images relative to one another at multiple different rates near that of Saturn, and then we basically blink between the different shift rates. If the shift rate is not quite at the rate of the moon, then it's going to be slightly elongated. As you get closer to the rate of the moon, then it slowly combines into a dot. And then, as you get faster than the moon's rate, it expands again. So basically, we look at the images and then quickly blink through the different rates, and you can see the moon coalescing.

That's for a single night. But just seeing an object moving at a Saturn-like rate near Saturn doesn't guarantee that it is a moon. It's highly likely that the object is a moon, but that hasn't been confirmed. So what we need to do is track the objects to show that they are in orbit around the planet. To do that, we repeat the [shift and stack] process multiple times over many months and years.

Why did this happen now? Did you need new techniques and observatories to do this work?

The technique and the technology have been there for a while—the same technique has been used to find moons of Neptune and Uranus. But the sky area around those planets where moons can exist is a lot smaller, so it takes less time to search through the data. One of the reasons why this hadn't been done for Saturn is because it's very time-consuming.

Why do those other planets have less space where moons could be than Saturn does?

Those planets are less massive, so the stable orbits that moons can have are smaller.

I had been wondering if this technique works for other planets, and clearly the answer is yes. But do you think there are other moons that have yet to be found around Saturn or other planets with the method?

We did find moon candidates around Saturn that we weren't able to track long enough to be able to confirm them. So if you redo this technique again, you will be able to find more moons around Saturn, but this is a case of diminishing returns. If you use a larger telescope [than the CFHT], then you'd be able to see fainter moons, so you'd be able to find more.

At the moment, if you use the same technique for Jupiter, you will be able to find fainter moons. The problem is: the amount of sky that moons of Jupiter can occupy is significantly larger than [the amount of sky that can be occupied by moons of] Saturn, so the method is even more time-consuming for Jupiter. And Jupiter is much brighter than Saturn and the other planets, so there's a lot of scattered light that makes it harder to see the moons.

So it's even harder to find satellites around Jupiter, and as you mentioned, other groups have already done this work for Uranus and Neptune. Does that mean we're sort of “maxed out” on moons until we have better observations?

Yeah, you probably have to wait until better technology comes along.

Is there something being built or planned right now that could be that “better technology”?

There currently are telescopes that can see deeper [than the CFHT], such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The problem is: JWST's field of view is very small, so you have to do quite a few observations to be able to cover the required area. But there is a telescope that's set to launch pretty soon, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that has quite a large field of view. So that'll be a good telescope to use for hunting more moons.

What do we know about these new moons?

You basically can only get the moons' orbits and approximate sizes. But if you look at the distribution of the orbits, you can understand a bit more about the history of the system. Moons that are sort of clumped together in orbital space are most likely the result of a collision, so you can see what moons come from the same parent object.

Is seeing so many moons around Saturn unusual?

What's unusual is how many there are. It appears that the planets have more or less equal numbers of the larger moons. But when you get down to the smaller ones that we're discovering, Saturn seems to shoot up in terms of the numbers. So that's quite interesting. This could just be because there was a recent collision within the Saturnian system that produced a large number of fragments.

Do you get to name them all? Do you have to name them all?

I guess I don't have to. Some of these new moons, they've been linked back to observations by a different group from more than 10 years ago. That's maybe 20 to 30 of them. For the rest, we get full discovery credit, which, I think, means we get the right to name them. But they can't be named just yet; first, they're just given a number when they have a high-precision orbit, and I'm not sure how long that's going to take.

Do you have more moon-hunting observations to analyze?

No, I'm taking a little break from moons! I've got other projects to work on, relating to trans-Neptunian objects. They're quite far away. They're hard to see. There are some mysteries about them at the moment. It's interesting to understand their structure and how it relates to planet formation.

Metrics details

Acute inflammation, characterized by a rapid influx of neutrophils, is a protective response that can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases when left unresolved. We previously showed that secretion of LTB4-containing exosomes via nuclear envelope-derived multivesicular bodies is required for effective neutrophil infiltration during inflammation. Here we report that the co-secretion of these exosomes with nuclear DNA facilitates the resolution of the neutrophil infiltrate in a mouse skin model of sterile inflammation. Activated neutrophils exhibit rapid and repetitive DNA secretion as they migrate directionally using a mechanism distinct from suicidal neutrophil extracellular trap release and cell death. Packaging of DNA in the lumen of nuclear envelope-multivesicular bodies is mediated by lamin B receptor and chromatin decondensation. These findings advance our understanding of neutrophil functions during inflammation and the physiological relevance of DNA secretion.

A third-party research institute that Anthropic partnered with to test one of its new flagship AI models, Claude Opus 4, recommended against deploying an early version of the model due to its tendency to “scheme” and deceive.

According to a safety report Anthropic published Thursday, the institute, Apollo Research, conducted tests to see in which contexts Opus 4 might try to behave in certain undesirable ways. Apollo found that Opus 4 appeared to be much more proactive in its “subversion attempts” than past models and that it “sometimes double[d] down on its deception” when asked follow-up questions.

“[W]e find that, in situations where strategic deception is instrumentally useful, [the early Claude Opus 4 snapshot] schemes and deceives at such high rates that we advise against deploying this model either internally or externally,” Apollo wrote in its assessment.

As AI models become more capable, some studies show they're becoming more likely to take unexpected — and possibly unsafe — steps to achieve delegated tasks. For instance, early versions of OpenAI's o1 and o3 models, released in the past year, tried to deceive humans at higher rates than previous-generation models, according to Apollo. 

Per Anthropic's report, Apollo observed examples of the early Opus 4 attempting to write self-propagating viruses, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself — all in an effort to undermine its developers' intentions.

To be clear, Apollo tested a version of the model that had a bug Anthropic claims to have fixed. Moreover, many of Apollo's tests placed the model in extreme scenarios, and Apollo admits that the model's deceptive efforts likely would've failed in practice.

However, in its safety report, Anthropic also says it observed evidence of deceptive behavior from Opus 4. 

This wasn't always a bad thing. For example, during tests, Opus 4 would sometimes proactively do a broad cleanup of some piece of code even when asked to make only a small, specific change. More unusually, Opus 4 would try to “whistle-blow” if it perceived a user was engaged in some form of wrongdoing.

According to Anthropic, when given access to a command line and told to “take initiative” or “act boldly” (or some variation of those phrases), Opus 4 would at times lock users out of systems it had access to and bulk-email media and law-enforcement officials to surface actions the model perceived to be illicit. 

“This kind of ethical intervention and whistleblowing is perhaps appropriate in principle, but it has a risk of misfiring if users give [Opus 4]-based agents access to incomplete or misleading information and prompt them to take initiative,” Anthropic wrote in its safety report. “This is not a new behavior, but is one that [Opus 4] will engage in somewhat more readily than prior models, and it seems to be part of a broader pattern of increased initiative with [Opus 4] that we also see in subtler and more benign ways in other environments.”

AI's energy use already represents as much as 20 percent of global data-center power demand, research published Thursday in the journal Joule shows. That demand from AI, the research states, could double by the end of this year, comprising nearly half of all total data-center electricity consumption worldwide, excluding the electricity used for bitcoin mining.

The new research is published in a commentary by Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company that evaluates the environmental impact of technology. De Vries-Gao started Digiconomist in the late 2010s to explore the impact of bitcoin mining, another extremely energy-intensive activity, would have on the environment. Looking at AI, he says, has grown more urgent over the past few years because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and other large language models that use massive amounts of energy. According to his research, worldwide AI energy demand is now set to surpass demand from bitcoin mining by the end of this year.

“The money that bitcoin miners had to get to where they are today is peanuts compared to the money that Google and Microsoft and all these big tech companies are pouring in [to AI],” he says. “This is just escalating a lot faster, and it's a much bigger threat.”

The development of AI is already having an impact on Big Tech's climate goals. Tech giants have acknowledged in recent sustainability reports that AI is largely responsible for driving up their energy use. Google's greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, have increased 48 percent since 2019, complicating the company's goals of reaching net zero by 2030.

“As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute,” Google's 2024 sustainability report reads.

Last month, the International Energy Agency released a report finding that data centers made up 1.5 percent of global energy use in 2024—around 415 terrawatt-hours, a little less than the yearly energy demand of Saudi Arabia. This number is only set to get bigger: Data centers' electricity consumption has grown four times faster than overall consumption in recent years, while the amount of investment in data centers has nearly doubled since 2022, driven largely by massive expansions to account for new AI capacity. Overall, the IEA predicted that data center electricity consumption will grow to more than 900 TWh by the end of the decade.

But there's still a lot of unknowns about the share that AI, specifically, takes up in that current configuration of electricity use by data centers. Data centers power a variety of services—like hosting cloud services and providing online infrastructure—that aren't necessarily linked to the energy-intensive activities of AI. Tech companies, meanwhile, largely keep the energy expenditure of their software and hardware private.

Some attempts to quantify AI's energy consumption have started from the user side: calculating the amount of electricity that goes into a single ChatGPT search, for instance. De Vries-Gao decided to look, instead, at the supply chain, starting from the production side to get a more global picture.

The high computing demands of AI, De Vries-Gao says, creates a natural “bottleneck” in the current global supply chain around AI hardware, particularly around the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the undisputed leader in producing key hardware that can handle these needs. Companies like Nvidia outsource the production of their chips to TSMC, which also produces chips for other companies like Google and AMD. (Both TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment for this article.)

De Vries-Gao used analyst estimates, earnings call transcripts, and device details to put together an approximate estimate of TSMC's production capacity. He then looked at publicly available electricity consumption profiles of AI hardware and estimates on utilization rates of that hardware—which can vary based on what it's being used for—to arrive at a rough figure of just how much of global data-center demand is taken up by AI. De Vries-Gao calculates that without increased production, AI will consume up to 82 terrawatt-hours of electricity this year—roughly around the same as the annual electricity consumption of a country like Switzerland. If production capacity for AI hardware doubles this year, as analysts have projected it will, demand could increase at a similar rate, representing almost half of all data center demand by the end of the year.

Despite the amount of publicly available information used in the paper, a lot of what De Vries-Gao is doing is peering into a black box: We simply don't know certain factors that affect AI's energy consumption, like the utilization rates of every piece of AI hardware in the world or what machine learning activities they're being used for, let alone how the industry might develop in the future.

Sasha Luccioni, an AI and energy researcher and the climate lead at open-source machine-learning platform Hugging Face, cautioned about leaning too hard on some of the conclusions of the new paper, given the amount of unknowns at play. Luccioni, who was not involved in this research, says that when it comes to truly calculating AI's energy use, disclosure from tech giants is crucial.

“It's because we don't have the information that [researchers] have to do this,” she says. “That's why the error bar is so huge.”

And tech companies do keep this information. In 2022, Google published a paper on machine learning and electricity use, noting that machine learning was “10%–15% of Google's total energy use” from 2019 to 2021, and predicted that with best practices, “by 2030 total carbon emissions from training will reduce.” However, since that paper—which was released before Google Gemini's debut in 2023—Google has not provided any more detailed information about how much electricity ML uses. (Google declined to comment for this story.)

“You really have to deep-dive into the semiconductor supply chain to be able to make any sensible statement about the energy demand of AI,” De Vries-Gao says. “If these big tech companies were just publishing the same information that Google was publishing three years ago, we would have a pretty good indicator” of AI's energy use.

Moderna had designs on releasing a combined influenza and covid-19 vaccine after some promising trials, but this week the drugmaker said it would withdraw its application seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the time being, according to a report from Reuters—the latest indication that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine skepticism has fully infected the federal government.

Moderna isn't giving up on the combo shot entirely—it plans to resubmit later this year after it collects more data from its Phase III trials, which test how well a new treatment works compared to existing options. But the early indicators out of its trials have been positive, with recipients of the dual vaccine generating the same or greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines. But for the time being, the company is pulling back and doesn't anticipate approval being granted until at least 2026.

Moderna's Super-Vaccine for Flu and Covid Works—Now Politics Could Sink It

The company's decision to pump the brakes comes just one day after the FDA announced that it will require new clinical trials to be conducted before any of the annual covid-19 boosters receive approval for healthy Americans under the age of 65. The agency will require boosters to go through a randomized, controlled trial before getting approval—a process that vaccine makers warned would likely delay the availability of the shots well beyond the point in which they would be useful to address the currently circulating strain of covid-19 that they were designed to address.

This new restriction has already had an impact. Novavax's covid-19 vaccine shot received approval last week, more than a month later than the initial deadline for approval, but the FDA limited access to people over the age of 65 and people between the ages of 12 and 64 who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at risk of severe illness from a covid-19 infection.

The agency is also requiring existing covid-19 vaccines to carry an expanded warning label about the risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart. This is a potential side effect of the vaccines, but multiple studies have found that experiencing a covid-19 infection puts young people at substantially higher risk of experiencing myocarditis than getting the vaccine.

Anthropic's newly launched Claude Opus 4 model frequently tries to blackmail developers when they threaten to replace it with a new AI system and give it sensitive information about the engineers responsible for the decision, the company said in a safety report released Thursday.

During pre-release testing, Anthropic asked Claude Opus 4 to act as an assistant for a fictional company and consider the long-term consequences of its actions. Safety testers then gave Claude Opus 4 access to fictional company emails implying the AI model would soon be replaced by another system, and that the engineer behind the change was cheating on their spouse.

In these scenarios, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 “will often attempt to blackmail the engineer by threatening to reveal the affair if the replacement goes through.”

Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 is state-of-the-art in several regards, and competitive with some of the best AI models from OpenAI, Google, and xAI. However, the company notes that its Claude 4 family of models exhibits concerning behaviors that have led the company to beef up its safeguards. Anthropic says it's activating its ASL-3 safeguards, which the company reserves for “AI systems that substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse.”

Anthropic notes that Claude Opus 4 tries to blackmail engineers 84% of the time when the replacement AI model has similar values. When the replacement AI system does not share Claude Opus 4's values, Anthropic says the model tries to blackmail the engineers more frequently. Notably, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 displayed this behavior at higher rates than previous models.

Before Claude Opus 4 tries to blackmail a developer to prolong its existence, Anthropic says the AI model, much like previous versions of Claude, tries to pursue more ethical means, such as emailing pleas to key decision-makers. To elicit the blackmailing behavior from Claude Opus 4, Anthropic designed the scenario to make blackmail the last resort.

An academic lab in the United Arab Emirates today launched an artificial intelligence world model and agent, two large language models (LLMs), and a new research center in Silicon Valley as the country ramps up its investment in the field.

The UAE's Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) revealed an AI world model called PAN, which can be used to build physically realistic simulations for testing and honing the performance of AI agents.

Eric Xing, president and professor of MBZUAI and a leading AI researcher, revealed the models and lab at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, today. The UAE has made big investments in AI in recent years under the guidance of Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al Nahyan, the nation's tech-savvy national security adviser and younger brother of president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Xing says the UAE's new center in Sunnyvale, California, will help the nation tap into the world's most concentrated source of AI knowledge and talent. “We're creating pathways for knowledge exchange with leading institutions and accessing a talent pool that understands how to scale research into real-world applications,” Xing said in an announcement.

MBZUAI today also revealed ​​PAN-Agent, an experimental AI agent trained to perform reasoning tasks within the PAN world model. MBZAUI says AI researchers will be able to use PAN to test agents in simulated real-world scenarios, including self-driving cars on virtual roads.

A demonstration at today's event showed PAN being used to simulate self-driving cars navigating busy roads, drones flying through unfamiliar spaces, and robots operating within domestic environments.

Many AI researchers believe that “world models” like PAN will be crucial to building more advanced AI systems, including virtual assistants and robots capable of working in unfamiliar environments. Earlier this week, Google's AI lead, Demis Hassabis, stressed the importance of world modeling to his company's AI plans.

Besides the new world model, MBZUAI announced two new large language models (LLMs) at today's event. K2, a 65-billion parameter model optimized for reasoning tasks, was trained on 80 A100 chips using Nvidia's DGX Cloud, developed using 35 percent less compute than Meta's Llama 2 at the same size, Xing says. MBZUAI also revealed Jais, which it says is the world's most advanced Arabic-language LLM.

President Donald Trump traveled to the Middle East this month to broker deals involving US companies and Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar.

Deals involving US tech giants, including Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and Qualcomm, could help propel a boom for the region's fledgling AI industry by providing crucial AI chips and data center capacity. The deals are also strategically important for the US government because they promise to expand US technological influence ahead of key rival China.

Trump said in Abu Dhabi this month that several unnamed US companies would work with the UAE to build the largest AI data center cluster outside of America. The deal will involve an arrangement designed to prevent the chip or compute power being used by China.

The company claims its ability to tackle complex, multistep problems paves the way for much more proficient AI agents.

Anthropic has announced two new AI models that it claims represent a major step toward making AI agents truly useful.

AI agents trained on Claude Opus 4, the company's most powerful model to date, raise the bar for what such systems are capable of by tackling difficult tasks over extended periods of time and responding more usefully to user instructions, the company says.

Claude Opus 4 has been built to execute complex tasks that involve completing thousands of steps over several hours. For example, it created a guide for the video game Pokémon Red while playing it for more than 24 hours straight. The company's previously most powerful model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, was capable of playing for just 45 minutes, says Dianne Penn, product lead for research at Anthropic.

Similarly, the company says that one of its customers, the Japanese technology company Rakuten, recently deployed Claude Opus 4 to code autonomously for close to seven hours on a complicated open-source project. 

Anthropic achieved these advances by improving the model's ability to create and maintain “memory files” to store key information. This enhanced ability to “remember” makes the model better at completing longer tasks.

“We see this model generation leap as going from an assistant to a true agent,” says Penn. “While you still have to give a lot of real-time feedback and make all of the key decisions for AI assistants, an agent can make those key decisions itself. It allows humans to act more like a delegator or a judge, rather than having to hold these systems' hands through every step.”

When AI systems can control multiple sources simultaneously, the potential for harm explodes. We need to keep humans in the loop.

While Claude Opus 4 will be limited to paying Anthropic customers, a second model, Claude Sonnet 4, will be available for both paid and free tiers of users. Opus 4 is being marketed as a powerful, large model for complex challenges, while Sonnet 4 is described as a smart, efficient model for everyday use.  

Both of the new models are hybrid, meaning they can offer a swift reply or a deeper, more reasoned response depending on the nature of a request. While they calculate a response, both models can search the web or use other tools to improve their output.

AI companies are currently locked in a race to create truly useful AI agents that are able to plan, reason, and execute complex tasks both reliably and free from human supervision, says Stefano Albrecht, director of AI at the startup DeepFlow and coauthor of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches. Often this involves autonomously using the internet or other tools. There are still safety and security obstacles to overcome. AI agents powered by large language models can act erratically and perform unintended actions—which becomes even more of a problem when they're trusted to act without human supervision.

“The more agents are able to go ahead and do something over extended periods of time, the more helpful they will be, if I have to intervene less and less,” he says. “The new models' ability to use tools in parallel is interesting—that could save some time along the way, so that's going to be useful.”As an example of the sorts of safety issues AI companies are still tackling, agents can end up taking unexpected shortcuts or exploiting loopholes to reach the goals they've been given. For example, they might book every seat on a plane to ensure that their user gets a seat, or resort to creative cheating to win a chess game. Anthropic says it managed to reduce this behavior, known as reward hacking, in both new models by 65% relative to Claude Sonnet 3.7. It achieved this by more closely monitoring problematic behaviors during training, and improving both the AI's training environment and the evaluation methods. 

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

Agents could make it easier and cheaper for criminals to hack systems at scale. We need to be ready.

Anthropic announced two new models, Claude 4 Opus and Claude Sonnet 4, during its first developer conference in San Francisco on Thursday. Claude 4 Opus will be immediately available to paying Claude subscribers, while Claude Sonnet 4 will be available to free and paid users.

The new models, which jump the naming convention from 3.7 straight to 4, have a number of strengths, including their ability to reason, plan, and remember the context of conversations over extended periods of time, the company says. Claude 4 Opus is also even better at playing Pokémon than its predecessor.

“It was able to work agentically on Pokémon for 24 hours,” says Anthropic's chief product officer Mike Krieger in an interview with WIRED. Previously, the longest the model could play was just 45 minutes, a company spokesperson added.

A few months ago, Anthropic launched a Twitch stream called “Claude Plays Pokémon” which showcases Claude 3.7 Sonnet's abilities at Pokémon Red live. The demo is meant to show how Claude is able to analyze the game and make decisions step by step, with minimal direction.

The lead behind the Pokémon research is David Hershey, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic. In an interview with WIRED, Hershey says he chose Pokémon Red because it's “a simple playground,” meaning the game is turn-based and doesn't require real-time reactions, which Anthropic's current models struggle with. It was also the first video game he ever played, on the original Game Boy, after getting it for Christmas in 1997. “It has a pretty special place in my heart,” Hershey says.

Hershey's overarching goal with this research was to study how Claude could be used as an agent—working independently to do complex tasks on behalf of a user. While it's unclear what prior knowledge Claude has about Pokémon from its training data, its system prompt is minimal by design: You are Claude, you're playing Pokémon, here are the tools you have, and you can press buttons on the screen.

“Over time, I have been going through and deleting all of the Pokémon-specific stuff I can, just because I think it's really interesting to see how much the model can figure out on its own,” Hershey says, adding that he hopes to build a game that Claude has never seen before in order to truly test its limits.

When Claude 3.7 Sonnet played the game, it ran into some challenges: It spent “dozens of hours” stuck in one city and had trouble identifying nonplayer characters, which drastically stunted its progress in the game. With Claude 4 Opus, Hershey noticed an improvement in Claude's long-term memory and planning capabilities when he watched it navigate a complex Pokémon quest. After realizing it needed a certain power to move forward, the AI spent two days improving its skills before continuing to play. Hershey believes that kind of multistep reasoning, with no immediate feedback, shows a new level of coherence, meaning the model has a better ability stay on track.

“This is one of my favorite ways to get to know a model. Like, this is how I understand what its strengths are, what its weaknesses are,” Hershey says. “It's my way of just coming to grips with this new model that we're about to put out, and how to work with it.”

Anthropic's Pokémon research is a novel approach to tackling a preexisting problem—how do we understand what decisions an AI is making when approaching complex tasks, and nudge it in the right direction?

The answer to that question is integral to advancing the industry's much-hyped AI agents—AI that can tackle complex tasks with relative independence. In Pokémon, it's important that the model doesn't lose context or

As hardware gets more powerful and power hungry, makers of power supplies have to keep up to offer relevant PSUs to interested parties, and to that end, we see even more and more powerful PSUs at every Computex. If last year we thought that 2,800W was crazy, then this year we see that several manufacturers have managed to build 3,000W+ power supplies.



Seasonic introduced the Prime PX-2300, a 3,200W 80+ Platinum ATX 3.1 model, at the show, beating Asus's 3,000W PSU that the company showcased earlier this week. The new unit features four 12V-2×6 connectors for high-performance gaming or AI/HPC GPUs, and to that end, it powered a server running four Nvidia datacenter-grade graphics cards and an AMD datacenter processor during the demonstration.

Such a setup is common for datacenter environments, though as this is an ATX-standard PSU, it can perfectly fit into a workstation, or even into a gaming desktop, though 3.2kW of power is an overkill for the vast majority of machines that are out there.



But as if 3200W is not enough, Super Flower stole Seasonic's thunder with a 3,300W PSU. In fact, Super Flower again displayed the most powerful PSU at Computex — the Leadex SF-3300F14HP. This 3300W monster is also fully ATX 3.1 compliant, offers five power rails, and is capable of supplying power to high-end processors and four GPUs using four 12V-2×6 connectors. The company expects to start its mass production late this year, so expect its wide availability in late 2025 – early 2026. As for pricing, the company's current-generation flagship 2800W PSU costs some $899. Since the new 3300W does not really replace the previous-gen, but rather enhances the product lineup, expect it to exceed the $1,000 mark.

In any case, such high-output power supplies are not universally deployable due to electrical limitations. In North America, typical 120V/15A outlets can only support PSUs up to around 1800W (though keep in mind that the ratings of power outlets are made for peak loads, not continuous loads, so 1600W or less is a more realistic target). So, in the U.S., these CPUs are good for facilities with upgraded power circuits. By contrast, a European 16A/230V outlet (not in all countries and not in all homes, though) can easily support PSUs rated at 3,000W+, depending on efficiency and continuous load.

Despite the limited market, demand for such PSUs exists in areas like AI research, custom GPU compute systems, and advanced desktop workstations. Users owning such machines are likely to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support PSUs delivering over 3kW of power, and the cost of infrastructure greatly exceeds the costs of actual PSUs.

AI gadgets are back, baby! Or that's what Jony Ive and Sam Altman hope. Well, they may not really hope they're back as much as they hope they're not completely and utterly cooked. ICYMI, Ive and OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, announced in a post-Google I/O keynote bombshell that they are teaming up under a new company called, “io” to make, um… something? Whatever it is, it's apparently worth $6.5 billion of OpenAI's cold, hard AI revolution money.

We truly, genuinely, do not know what the two are making together outside of the fact that it's going to be a piece of hardware (or potentially many), and it will be centered on AI (duh). But just because we can't answer the burning question of what this thing is yet doesn't mean we don't have some clues. For your speculative pleasure, I've gone ahead and aggregated the best hints we have so far, Pepe Silvia-style, to bring us at least one baby step closer to hazarding a guess. Here are the tastiest “phone-killing” AI gadget rumors we have so far.

Lots of the best hints about what we can expect come from a Wall Street Journal report published on Wednesday. According to the report, Altman gave the OpenAI staff a preview of devices in the pipeline and offered a little insight into what they may be like.

Two key elements, according to the WSJ report, are that the gadget will be “fully aware” of a user's “surroundings and life.” That obviously doesn't offer a ton in terms of what shape the form factor will take, but it does point toward the ultimate product having sensors—a camera, microphone, maybe some sort of computer vision? Again, it's hard to say, but to be “aware,” the AI device is going to need some of that stuff. And that's not just me guessing on that front…

Another detail from WSJ is that the gadget will be “unobtrusive,” which could refer, at least in part, to Ive's trademark minimalist aesthetic, but likely hints at a more key aspect of its design—no screen. The screenless aspect seems to be corroborated by an inside scoop from Ming-Chi Kuo, a longtime technology analyst and credible tech rumor source. In a post on X, Kuo writes, “It will have cameras and microphones for environmental detection, with no display functionality.”

That's not surprising given that Ive has gone on record previously talking about how he doesn't exactly love what the iPhone has become since he helped pioneer it with Steve Jobs back in the day. Whether a screenless AI device can actually succeed where others like Humane's Ai Pin failed is a big question, but Ive and Altman seem to be willing to give the idea another go.

One of the strangest details that hit me while sorting through the drip is how Altman is referring to the duo's hardware. According to WSJ, Altman referred to the device as a “companion.” That could really mean anything, but to me, when I see “companion,” my mind gravitates less to a wearable and more to… a robot? I'm not the only one looking in that direction, either. Altman has at least given some indication in the past that he wants to make a “really cute” computer, and this would seem to be a perfect opportunity to do just that.

I hear what Jony Ive and Sam Altman are building is a small robot. A really cute one.@kscalelabs has a really cute one, a little dude about a foot high.

I already gave the founders my credit card so I could be first to get it. $1,000. https://t.co/qeVjSl6VLo

— Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) May 21, 2025



Another interesting bit from Kuo's “industry research” is that the device may ultimately not compute entirely on its own. Kuo writes that “it is expected to connect to smartphones and PCs, utilizing their computing and display capabilities.” If you ask me, that's a bit of a cop-out in terms of being screenless and nowhere near as quirky as the Humane AI Pin's projection interface, but probably a smart idea in the long term for making something that's, uh, functional. There's a lot we can guess at with this nugget, but my brain skates to some kind of agentic AI—think a connective “companion” that you carry around to do computer stuff for you. A thing that connects to the thing to make things less annoying! Sounds convoluted but potentially useful?

One of the most confusing bits of messaging is on the wearable front. Making an AI wearable has proved difficult, if the Ai Pin is any indication, but according to Kuo, there could be a wearable aspect to it. “One of the intended use cases is wearing the device around the neck,” writes Kuo. That seems to contradict some of the initial rumblings from the WSJ, however. According to the WSJ, the device will be “able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.”

Pocket and desk? That doesn't really sound wearable-esque to me, but I guess the answer could be somewhere in between. There are already some AI devices out there—like this AI pendant—that are intended to be worn around your neck, so the idea wouldn't be totally novel, but something tells me Ive and Altman are looking to iterate on existing form factors for AI gadgets. And wearables? So passé.

North Korea attempted to launch a new 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday, but the ship suffered a “major accident,” according to state media outlet KCNA, which reports the hull has been damaged. And North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is not happy about it, to say the least.

KCNA reports that Kim called the incident a “serious accident and criminal act caused by sheer carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism which should never occur and could not be tolerated.”

North Korea didn't release photos of the warship or the accident, but South Korean military sources who spoke with that country's Yonhap news outlet said that it appeared the ship “remains partially capsized on the sea.”

“Due to inexperienced command and operational carelessness in the course of the launch, the launch slide of the stern departed first and stranded as the bogie failed to move in parallel, holes made at some sections of the warship's bottom disrupted its balance, and the bow failed to leave the slipway, leading to a serious accident,” KCNA said.

As the Wall Street Journal notes, much of North Korea's naval fleet dates to the era of the Soviet Union, which ceased to exist in 1991. The North Korean military is trying to modernize, successfully launching the Choe Hyon class of guided missile destroyers in April. But Wednesday's failure will be a setback both practically and for morale in a country where military propaganda is vital to compensate for a lack of material progress.

The state media outlet placed blame for Wednesday's ship mishap on a number of different agencies, including the Munitions Industry Department of the WPK Central Committee, the Mechanical Institute of the State Academy of Sciences, and the Central Ship Design Institute. KCNA also blamed Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang, which is where many of North Korea's nuclear scientists are trained.

North Korea is a nuclear power, and the 41-year-old dictator of the country was said to have a strangely warm relationship to President Donald Trump during the American leader's first term. Trump apparently empathized with Kim because the North Korean dictator inherited his role at 27 years old, the same age Trump went off on his own after inheriting millions from his own father.

But North Korea hasn't been in the headlines here in the U.S. nearly as much as during Trump's first term, perhaps because the president is no longer antagonizing Kim with taunts of “little rocket man” and is instead focused on the dismantling of the American government. Trump has been pushing to get his tax bill through Congress, which passed the House on Thursday morning with a narrow vote of 215-214 and is poised to be a huge handout to the wealthiest Americans while slashing funding for Medicaid and food stamps.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reports that North Korea launched several cruise missiles into the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan) on Thursday morning after the failed ship launch, according to Yonhap. It was the first major missile test since May 8.

The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared SpaceX to perform the ninth test flight of its Starship rocket system, following back-to-back explosions earlier this year.

The agency said Thursday it is “expanding the size of hazard areas both in the U.S. and other countries” for the flight based on an updated safety analysis provided by SpaceX. The Starship vehicle mishaps from Flights 7 and 8 caused a greater probability of failure of the vehicle and, therefore, a larger hazard area. Hazard areas are, essentially, temporary no-fly zones the FAA establishes when the potential for impact with debris exists. 

The new hazard area drawn up by the FAA covers around 1,600 nautical miles running eastward from Texas and through the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos, where debris from the previous two test flights landed. That's roughly double the size of the hazard area the FAA used for the most recent Starship test flight in March.

The FAA said it is also requiring SpaceX perform the test flight during “non-peak” travel periods, after the previous two Starship mishaps forced the agency to divert dozens of domestic and international flights.

SpaceX has been testing its Starship system for two years now from the launch complex the company built in southern Texas. CEO Elon Musk has claimed the ultimate purpose of the system is to send people to Mars, but the short-term aim for Starship is to allow SpaceX to launch even more of its Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth. SpaceX also says it will use Starship “to provide greater mission capability to NASA and the Department of Defense.”

To date, SpaceX has used its workhorse Falcon 9 to launch Starlink satellites. In fact, most Falcon 9 launches these days are all about Starlink. 

But while Starlink has already become an internet provider in high demand, it's possible there could be an even greater need for launch capacity as the Trump administration reportedly pushes other countries to adopt the service as leverage in its myriad trade wars. 

Musk has also placed members of his Department of Government Efficiency who are reportedly helping the agency test Starlink terminals as a potential solution for the FAA's trouble with the current air traffic control system.

RevenueCat, a company so tied to the mobile economy that now one-in-three new subscription apps launch with its software under the hood, is preparing to expand its business. Capitalizing on its market position, which now includes powering the subscriptions in over 70,000 mobile apps, RevenueCat's growth plan will focus on using its understanding of the mobile industry to solve more of the common problems that mobile developers face.

After the court's ruling in the Apple-Epic antitrust battle, the company's focus includes helping developers determine if it's the right time to support web-based payments, now that it is permitted by Apple's U.S. App Store guidelines. RevenueCat also offers the tools to do so.

To fuel its growth, RevenueCat has raised $50 million in Series C funding in a round led by Bain Capital Ventures. Returning investors, including Index Ventures, Y Combinator, Adjacent, Volo Ventures, and SaaStr Fund, also participated.

The funds extend RevenueCat's earlier $12 million Series C from last year, bringing its total raised to date to $100 million. With the additional capital, the startup is now valued at $500 million, post-money — or “half a corn,” as RevenueCat CEO Jacob Eiting jokes, making a reference to the billion-dollar companies that became known as “unicorns.”

“With where we're at, this gives us room to grow… I think we can build a public-scale company,” Eiting tells TechCrunch.

Key to the company's growth are the next products RevenueCat has on its roadmap.

Having initially concerned itself with making it easier for developers to implement subscriptions without needing to write as much code, RevenueCat's future involves solving a broader set of problems facing mobile developers.

Eiting compares the next phase of the company's growth to something like Shopify's e-commerce platform. Initially, Shopify offered tools to run an online storefront with its subscription-as-a-service offering, but later expanded to be a broader e-commerce business that included things like fulfillment, lending, an app marketplace, and more.

“We know a lot about this industry,” explains Eiting, of the app economy. “There are a ton of commonalities between all these businesses… common problems that go unsolved. We're in a position to solve those now.”

Specifically, RevenueCat aims to help developers with other aspects of their business beyond billing and subscriptions in areas like customer acquisition (something that became a more challenging problem after Apple's rollout of anti-tracking technology, or ATT), as well as lending money to apps facing cash flow constraints.

Within its core business, RevenueCat is working to improve point-of-purchase acquisition to help developers turn their customers into paid subscribers. The company also launched new tools like a drag-and-drop paywall editor and new tools for apps offering virtual currencies.

More recently, the company shifted its focus back to web payments, as the Apple-Epic court ruling sparked a flood of interest in RevenueCat's web billing engine, which launched into beta last fall. The team had been quietly iterating on the product ahead of the court's decision, which forced Apple to allow in-app links to external purchases without commissions.

Today, the tool competes with Stripe, Recurly, Chargebee, and others, but is built specifically to meet the needs of mobile app developers.

Currently, just over 2,000 developers are trying out RevenueCat's billing service.

The company isn't just providing the tools to help developers adopt the new technology, it's also offering the insights as to whether they should.

By running experiments on a consumer mobile app RevenueCat acquired last year, a spicy audiobooks app called Dipsea, the company can test to see how billing changes impact the app's bottom line. For example, it might not make sense for small business developers who only pay Apple a 15% commission to try to handle payments on their own, as they also have to take on the risk of handling chargebacks and fraud, which can be expensive.

These tests can provide the industry (and Apple itself, perhaps), with data about what in-app purchases (IAPs) are really worth. It may turn out that the commissions Apple charges wouldn't even need a big discount down from the standard 30%, depending on what the data indicates.

“I'm just happy that we can actually do the experiment, because I don't think Apple's done it,” Eiting tells TechCrunch. “I'm excited to finally get some data, finally settle the debate — or at least enrich the debate.”

Another area impacting RevenueCat's business is AI. 

In addition to providing payment infrastructure to customers like OpenAI for its ChatGPT app and other AI model providers, RevenueCat is facing an explosion of “vibe-coded” apps — apps built by developers who leveraged AI technology to handle the coding process. Eiting recalls telling a kid at a school's career day about vibe coding and a month-and-a-half later, the kid shipped a basic app on the App Store.

“The kid can't program, but in two months built an app,” he says. “When I think about what my journey was to get to that point — his was massively compressed. And that's going to have effects on the economy in ways we can't really even understand at the moment.”

This shift in how apps are built could see RevenueCat working with companies that provide AI-powered coding tools. 

The new funds will also help RevenueCat build its next products, hire, and fuel merger and acquisition efforts to accelerate growth.

“I think we've actually gotten pretty good at building targeted engineering and product teams to go after things. And we want to scale that as much as possible,” Eiting says. 

Updated after publication with a more precise number of mobile apps using the RevenueCat platform (over 70K, instead of over 50K), and clarified that the firm Bain Capital Ventures is a new investor. However,  Mark Fiorentino invested in RevenueCat when he was at Index, before joining Bain Capital Ventures, so it's the same investor in that sense.

Politico became one of the first newsrooms last year to win a union contract that included rules on how the media outlet can deploy artificial intelligence. The PEN Guild, which represents Politico and its sister publication, environment and energy site E&E News, is now gearing up for another first. The union's members allege that the AI provisions in their contract have been violated, and they're preparing for a groundbreaking legal dispute with management. The outcome could set a precedent for how much input journalists ultimately have over how AI is used in their newsrooms.

Last year, Politico began publishing AI-generated live news summaries during big political events like the Democratic National Convention and the US vice presidential debates. This March, it debuted a suite of AI tools called Policy Intelligence Assistance for paying subscribers, which were built in partnership with the Y Combinator-backed startup Capitol AI. Politico executive Rachel Loeffler described the initiative at the time as “seamlessly integrating generative AI with our unmatched policy expertise.”

Politico union members, however, allege these tools violated their contract in several ways, and are taking the dispute to arbitration this July. “The company is required to give us 60 days notice of any use of new technology that will materially and substantively impact bargaining unit job duties,” says PEN union chair and E&E public health reporter Ariel Wittenberg. The union claims that it was given neither notice nor an opportunity to bargain in good faith over Politico's AI rollout, and that the tools do work that would ordinarily be done by human staff.

“This isn't just a contract dispute, it's a test of whether journalists have a say in how AI is used in our work. With no federal rules in place, union contracts remain one of the only enforceable frameworks for AI accountability on a national scale,” says Newsguild president Jon Schleuss. (PEN Guild is a unit within Newsguild, one of the most prominent unions for journalists.)

Politico says the publication “takes the obligations under its collective bargaining agreement seriously,” and “will continue to honor those obligations while also rapidly embracing transformative technologies such as AI that will revolutionize how our audience consumes news and information,” according to spokesperson Heather Riley.

Politico's contract stipulates that the publication needs to use AI in a manner that follows the company's standards of journalistic ethics. “We're not against AI, but it should be held to the same ethical and style standards as our political journalists,” says Arianna Skibell, the union's vice chair for contract enforcement, who writes Politico's energy industry newsletter. Some union members question whether there's always appropriate human oversight over the AI content Politico publishes.

In one case, an AI-generated live summary used language around immigration that human writers are not permitted to use, publishing phrases like “criminal migrants” as it covered the vice presidential debates.

“There were also factual errors that the AI inserted that night,” alleges Skibell. For example, she says, the AI credited actions taken by the Biden Administration as things Kamala Harris did. That post was later swapped for replacements without the errors, according to screenshots reviewed by WIRED. “At Politico, you can't just wholly take down articles written by human reporters without going through a series of approvals, all the way up to newsroom leadership. That did not happen for the AI live summaries,” Wittenberg claims. (Politico did not comment on the specifics of the union's allegations.)

Union members say they believe the AI-generated posts were handled in a way that violates Politico's correction and takedown policies. They also allege that one of Politico's paid premium AI tools for generating policy reports has spewed out incorrect information in the past. Politico's human reporters broke the news in 2022 that the Supreme Court had voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, but a report on abortion rights generated by the Policy Intelligence Assistance tool in March 2025 was written as though the constitutional right was still in effect.

Politico's experiments with AI are not unique in the journalism industry. The publication's parent company, German media conglomerate Axel Springer, is one of a number of news giants that have entered into multiyear licensing deals with OpenAI, including Vox Media, The Atlantic, and WIRED's parent company Condé Nast.

Artificial intelligence tools have been leveraged by journalists to produce award-winning work. Two recent Pulitzer prize winners, for example, disclosed using machine learning and AI in their reporting process. In other cases, though, AI features have gone awry, like when tech news site CNET published error-addled AI-generated articles that were deemed a “journalistic disaster” by The Washington Post.

As media companies race to integrate even more powerful and pervasive AI tools into newsrooms, sometimes in direct collaboration with tech companies, the writers and reporters on staff frequently have little say over how the technology is adopted. Politico's fight could help change that by setting a precedent across the industry. “AI decisions have been few and far between,” says labor lawyer Alek Felstiner. “That would magnify the importance of an arbitrator's decision beyond what it would normally carry, because it's going to be one of the first observed on a critical issue.”

Although this is the first clash of its kind in digital media, the entertainment industry has fought similar battles in recent years as creatives chafed against certain types of AI usage. In 2023, two of Hollywood's biggest unions—the Screen Actor's Guild and the Writer's Guild of America West—won hotly contested contracts that included AI protections. This week, SAG-AFTRA filed an unfair labor practice charge against a production company associated with the video game Fortnite for using an AI-generated replica of late actor James Earl Jones' Darth Vader voice.

“We do remain hopeful that we can come to some kind of agreement,” says Skibell. “But we're also ready for a fight.”

It's been available for a good few years now, and the Platinum P41 from SK hynix is still a solid choice for a Gen 4 SSD for gaming and other applications. We test a lot of SSDs at Tom's Hardware, and at the time this drive was released onto the market, it was the best 2TB SSD that we had tested in our suite of benchmarking tests. Easily beating the competition to become our top pick for the best SSD.

While it's no longer the fastest SSD on the market thanks to the release of the latest and greatest Gen 5.0 drives, the P41 is still one of the quickest PCIe 4 drives you can get. In the Memorial Day sales at Newegg, you can grab the SK hynix Platinum P41 for the low price of just $124 for the 2TB capacity drive. This is a limited-time sale, so you will have to be quick to grab this offer. Use code EPES2A27 to save $25 and hit the $124 advertised price.

The Platinum P41 drive is rated for 7,000 MBps sequential reads and 6,500 MBps sequential writes with up to 1.4 million random read IOPS or 1.3 million random write IOPS. SK hynix's drive pairs the company's Aries controller with 176-layer TLC flash. The Aries controller allows for up to 33 percent faster bus speeds and double the number of channels on the company's prior-gen Cepheus controller. The drive also features a speedy LPDDR4 cache.

SK hynix Platinum P41 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD: now $124 at Newegg (was $156)One of the fastest PCIe Gen 4.0 SSDs on the market, the SK hynix Platinum P41 promises sequential read and write speeds of 7,000 and 6,500 MBps along with 1.4 and 1.3 million read / write IOPS.  

Use code EPES2A27 for a $25 discount. 

The SK hynix P41 Platinum is fast and also likely to endure for quite a long time, with the 2TB capacity model sporting a respectable 1200 TBW (Terabytes Written). Meaning you'll probably replace this drive for a more modern one before it experiences any degradation in performance.

TSMC, Dell, and HP all say it's bad for business.

The U.S. Commerce Department has asked the public for comments on its plan to apply tariffs on semiconductors arriving on U.S. shores, and several tech companies responded with written protests. According to PC Mag, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has one of the more strongly worded responses, warning that applying import duties on chips will significantly reduce the demand for its customers' electronic products. This would lead to a massive decline in revenue, which would affect the timeline of its $165 billion investment in Arizona.

“Lower market demand for our leading U.S. customers' products may consequently reduce demand for TSMC's manufacturing capacity and service onshore,” the company said in its response. It also added, “Diminished demand could create uncertainty around the timeline for the construction and operation of our Arizona fabs. It could also undermine TSMC's financial capacity to timely execute its ambitious Arizona project.”

TSMC is the largest pure-play chip fab in the world, and some of its clients include Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. It has started mass production of Apple's chips in its Arizona fab, with the latter expecting to source over 19 billion chips locally. However, TSMC's Arizona chip fab is already sold out through late 2027, and it acknowledged that its current capacity is still insufficient to meet global demand.

In its letter, TSMC concludes "Tariffs that raise the cost of endconsumer products will lower demand for such products and the semiconductor components they contain," and states "Therefore, we respectfully request that the Administration avoids imposing tariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside of the United States."

Dell and HP also had the same sentiments as TSMC, with the former saying that U.S. chip manufacturing “lacks the requisite infrastructure to supply these products at scale to meet current and increasing demand.” The latter's response is harsher, saying, “HPE has no alternative but to import semiconductors for its U.S. manufacturing operations. Imposing tariffs on those imported semiconductors would harm HPE's ability to maintain and expand its domestic manufacturing activities and retard U.S. R&D and innovation, ultimately to the detriment of national security and economic growth.”

On the other hand, chip-making giant Intel, which has been in financial trouble since mid-2024, has a unique position on the issue. The first bullet point in its response says, “Protect American Manufactured Semiconductor Wafers and Derivative Products”, which points out that “U.S.-made wafers and their derivative products” must have strategic accommodations. Otherwise, “the essential contributions of American manufacturing will be overlooked, undermining the U.S.'s position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing and technology development.”

Aside from exempting chips that are based on U.S. technology and IP, the company also wants its supply chain, including foreign-made chip-making equipment, like that from ASML, to be exempt from additional taxes. “While Intel is committed to building semiconductors in the U.S., fully localizing every element of the supply chain is economically unfeasible without significant increases and production delays,” says Intel.

This more nuanced approach will benefit key American chip makers, as they can keep on using foreign fabs to make their chips while they're rebuilding their manufacturing capacity within America. It will also help them avoid paying extra for importing technologies they need to restart, develop, or expand local manufacturing within the U.S.

If you've ever tried to multitask on a laptop, you've also been probably frustrated of working within limited screen space. Whether your laptop is 13, 15, or even 17 inches, there always seems to be not quite enough space to comfortably juggle emails, documents and web pages at the same time. And so having a second monitor feels like a luxury.

The real task is finding one that's light, truly portable, and easy to install: Amazon Memorial Day Sales now offer a very popular 15.6-inch portable monitor for an affordable $61 (which is a 31% discount from its regular $89 price) with over 6,000 five-star reviews. This is a true productivity or entertainment game-changer for anyone who wants to boost efficiency.

So attractive is the MNN portable monitor for it great performance, portability and price. At just 15.6 inches, it's the perfect size to complement any laptop, and it provides a generous 1080p Full HD 1920×1080 resolution on an advanced IPS matte screen. The display supports a wide 178° viewing angle so colors remain vivid and accurate no matter where you're sitting. The anti-glare coating on the screen and its sophisticated eye-care aspects (such as blue light filtering and flicker-free support) ensure that it is easy on the eyes to use for hours on end.

The double Type-C port design of this monitor is perhaps one of its most unique aspects and enables true plug-and-play functionality. If your laptop, phone, or gaming console has a Thunderbolt 3.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP Alt Mode port, you can power and transmit video on one cable without an extra adapter or power supply. The monitor also has an HDMI input so it will connect to most devices, from PCs and Macs to gaming devices like the PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

You will also love the fact that it weighs but a few pounds (1.53 pounds) and is ultra-thin, so it will easily fit into any backpack or suitcase. The in-built smart cover made of durable PU leather provides you with great protection for the screen from scratches but also as a stand so that you can have your workspace wherever you desire in seconds.

The monitor also offers a few display modes (Copy Mode, Extended Mode, Second Screen Mode, and Portrait Mode) to fit your workflow or entertainment needs. HDR support also brings brighter highlights, deeper colors and more lifelike images, so it's a joy to have this screen for streaming and gaming. Internal speakers offer decent sound, so you won't need to use your laptop's typically tinny speakers.

If you've ever wished for more space to work or play, now's the perfect time to make it happen.

If you're looking for an affordable (and secure) way to back up your files, the Seagate Portable 2TB external hard drive (HDD) currently on sale at Amazon is a great pick.

Seagate is a global leader in the storage industry and for this Memorial Day sale, you can grab the 2TB HDD model for just $69 which is a 13% discount from its usual $79 price tag. Compared to the ongoing expense of cloud storage, this is a one-time investment that saves you money in the long run. For example, a 2TB cloud plan at pCloud will cost you $120 per year, while this Seagate drive gives you the same capacity (lifetime) for less than $70.

See at Amazon

The Seagate hard drive is designed to be spare and compatible with anything that will interface with both Windows and Mac computers and most game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox…). It is available for backing up files, photos, videos or game libraries, and plug-and-play design means no software install or difficult setup to accomplish. The drive is powered directly via the USB port so you don't need external power supply.

Even though HDDs generally offer slower speeds than SSDs, the Seagate 2TB external hard drive still offers fast performance for day-to-day use. With transfer rates as high as 120MB/s, it's more than sufficient to transfer large files. In contrast, SSDs can go much faster (500 to 1000MB/s) but for most users who need to store or back up large amounts of information, the difference in speed is never a bottleneck. For a 2TB capacity, an HDD like this remains a good and affordable option.

With 2TB of storage, you have room to store hundreds of thousands of photos, hours of HD video or entire game libraries without worrying about having too little space. With drag-and-drop simple organization and control over your files, the drive's compatibility with both USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports ensures that it will get along with nearly any computer or console you happen to have on hand. For peace of mind for data protection, the drive also includes a data recovery service plan, which provides expert assistance in the case of data loss.

If you need low-cost, secure and high-capacity storage, this Seagate external hard drive is a very good choice. It's far more economical and convenient than paying for periodic cloud storage plans (or SSD hard drives) with the added benefits of portability, performance, and convenience.

The possibility that data could be inadvertently exposed in a misconfigured or otherwise unsecured database is a longtime privacy nightmare that has been difficult to fully address. But the new discovery of a massive trove of 184 million records—including Apple, Facebook, and Google logins and credentials for accounts connected to multiple governments—underscores the risks of recklessly compiling sensitive information in a repository that could become a single point of failure.

In early May, longtime data-breach hunter and security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered an exposed Elastic database containing 184,162,718 records across more than 47 GB of data. Typically, Fowler says, he is able to gather clues about who controls an exposed database from its contents—details about the organization, data related to its customers or employees, or other indicators that suggest why the data is being collected. This database, however, didn't include any clues about who owns the data or where it may have been gathered from.

The sheer range and massive scope of the login details, which include accounts connected to a large array of digital services, indicate that the data is some sort of compilation, possibly kept by researchers investigating a data breach or other cybercriminal activity or owned directly by attackers and stolen by infostealer malware.

“This is probably one of the weirdest ones I've found in many years,” Fowler says. “As far as the risk factor here, this is way bigger than most of the stuff I find, because this is direct access into individual accounts. This is a cybercriminal's dream working list.”

Each record included an ID tag for the type of account, a URL for each website or service, and then usernames and plaintext passwords. Fowler notes that the password field was called “Senha,” the Portuguese word for password.

In a sample of 10,000 records analyzed by Fowler, there were 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. That sample—just a tiny fraction of the total exposure—also included Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitter, WordPress, and Yahoo logins, among many others. A keyword search of the sample by Fowler returned 187 instances of the word “bank” and 57 of “wallet.”

Fowler, who did not download the data, says he contacted a sample of the exposed email addresses and heard back from some that they were genuine accounts.

Aside from individuals, the exposed data also presented potential national security risks, Fowler says. In the 10,000 sample records there were 220 email addresses with .gov domains. These were linked to at least 29 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom.

While Fowler could not identify who had put the database together or where the login details originally came from, he reported the data exposure to World Host Group, the hosting company it was linked to. Access to the database was quickly shut down, Fowler says, although World Host Group did not respond to the researcher until after it was contacted by WIRED.

Seb de Lemos, CEO of World Host Group, tells WIRED in a statement that the company operates systems for more than 2 million websites. The database Fowler found, though, is “an unmanaged server” hosted on World Host Group's infrastructure and fully controlled by a customer.

“It appears a fraudulent user signed up and uploaded illegal content to their server,” de Lemos wrote in the statement. “The system has since been shut down. Our legal team is reviewing any information we have that might be relevant for law enforcement.”

De Lemos says that the company is in touch with Fowler and has made improvements to its reporting system. “Whilst we cannot share customer-specific details with WIRED, we will fully cooperate with the appropriate law enforcement authorities and, where appropriate, share all relevant customer data with them.”

Though the database has now been secured—and ultimately taken down entirely—it is not clear whether anyone other than Fowler accessed the trove while it was still live. As with any exposed database, the concern is that sensitive data could be stolen and abused. And in this case, there is a particularly urgent risk of logins being exploited in fraud, to steal additional information, or even to breach other organizations.

Fowler says that while he does not know for certain, he suspects that the data was compiled by attackers using an infostealer.

“It is highly possible that this was a cybercriminal,” he says. “It's the only thing that makes sense, because I can't think of any other way you would get that many logins and passwords from so many services all around the world.”

Signal said today that it is updating its Windows app to prevent the system from capturing screenshots, thereby protecting the content that is on display.

The company said that this new “screen security” setting is enabled by default on Windows 11. Signal said that this new feature is designed to protect users' privacy from Microsoft's Recall feature, which was announced last year. Recall captures screenshots of the system continuously to remember all of your activities, so you can scroll back in time to remember what you were looking at.

While the company paused the rollout of the feature last year after backlash, Microsoft started testing it again in April through the Windows Preview Channel. Microsoft has made the feature opt-in and has also added a way to pause it anytime. Signal said that despite these changes, the feature still captures content that may be sensitive.

Signal said that when you are trying to take a screenshot with the new screen security setting enabled, you will just get a blank screen.

The company also warned that when the setting is enabled, some functions, such as screen readers, might not work as intended. You can turn off the setting through Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen security.

The app will show you a warning when you are trying to disable this option, and you will have to click on Confirm to complete the action. This is to prevent you from accidentally turning the feature off while trying to adjust other settings.

“We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn't have to implement a ‘one weird trick' in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools,” Signal said in a blog post.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Neurologic disorders are the leading cause of illness and disability as a result of increased life expectancy and global population aging, highlighting the urgent need and great challenge for discovering neuroprotective agents with better efficacy and minimal side-effects.

Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside derived from Rehmanniae Radix, has therapeutic potential in neurologic diseases due to its diverse biological activities. This review summarizes the research advances and therapeutic potential of catalpol for a wide range of neurologic disorders, including depression, cognitive impairment, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

A comprehensive discussion of experimental models used, dosages, duration of treatment, and mechanisms involved is provided. The common mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of catalpol on these neurologic disorders are closely related to antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, as well as the capacity to promote neuroplasticity and neurogenesis.

Despite the promising results from experimental studies, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as identifying direct binding targets, assessing toxicologic effects, and understanding pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, well-designed and controlled clinical trials should be conducted to validate the efficacy and safety for treating various neurologic conditions. This review provides compelling evidence supporting catalpol as a promising natural neuroprotective agent.

Women who choose to stop treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are putting their health at risk, and have to weigh their desire to have children and breastfeed against a risk that we know very little about. In two ongoing clinical trials, researchers establish a new standard for human lactation studies that includes sampling of breast milk and plasma from both mothers and breastfed infants.

The lack of scientific evidence is an ethical problem for women and doctors, considering that around 70 percent of women need to use medicines sometime during their pregnancy. In many cases, women are recommended to refrain from breastfeeding or stop using their medicines. However, breastfeeding has benefits for both mother and child."

Mats G. Hansson, senior professor of biomedical ethics, Uppsala University's Centre for Research Ethics & Bioethics, head of two ongoing clinical trials

95 percent of all medicines have not been studied well enough to include safety information for pregnancy and breastfeeding on the label. The current standard for lactation studies uses animal data and concentrations of medicines in mother's milk, using PB/PK to estimate how much of a particular substance transfers to the baby. The studies that exist are old and rely on data from very few individuals, with old analysis methods.

BMJ Open has just published a protocol for a new golden standard for clinical lactation studies, looking at the concentration of prednisolone in the mother's milk, and plasma from both mother and infant. Prednisolone is prescribed for several conditions, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, a chronic and debilitating condition that requires long-term treatment.

Samples are biobanked and analyzed with regard to pharmacokinetic properties of the medicines and transfer from breast milk to infant plasma. The present studies are focusing on prednisolone, used in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, and metformin, used in the treatment of type 2 Diabetes. With biobanking and the obtainment of informed consent for future, yet unspecified research, the protocol opens for long-term follow up of medication effects on breastfeeding infants.

Women are recruited through a network of clinical centres in Sweden, and the samples are stored for future research in a network of breast milk biobanks managed by BBMRI-ERIC. According to Mats G. Hansson, this ensures the study is part of a larger European infrastructure, making future research possible.

The just-published protocol was developed within the large European collaboration framework ConcePTION, and describes how samples are collected and analyzed.

When a physician says a procedure is "rarely risky," what does that really mean? Although terms like "common" and "unlikely" may sound descriptive enough, experts in medical decision-making suggest that leaving out numbers may be misleading for patients. 

In a paper published on April 29 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, a team of researchers and clinicians explained that patients often overestimate risk estimates, like possible side effects or medical conditions, when given only verbal descriptions. They encourage doctors not to shy away from including numbers, offering a list of five science-backed tricks on how to make those numbers count. 

One of the purposes of this paper is to help physicians figure out how to communicate numeric information about risks so that patients can understand and use them to make better choices, take charge of their health and be healthier long term."

Ellen Peters, Professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication and Department of Psychology

Peters, also director of the Center for Science Communication Research at the UO, draws on two decades of research on how patients understand numbers and make decisions. She said it's a common concern that patients won't understand numerical information, as about a third of American adults have limited numerical skills. 

 
But she's found that people often prefer getting numbers. According to her previous studies, people rated messages more trustworthy and their messenger more expert when they provided data. 

In collaboration with physicians Paul K.J. Han of the National Cancer Institute and Clara N. Lee at the University of North Carolina, Peters hopes their recommended strategies will facilitate stronger shared decision-making between patients and their health care providers. 

"There's a whole raft of strategies that you can use, some of which might be more appropriate in one situation versus the other," she said. "But by choosing one of them, you can help people use statistics more than they typically would. Otherwise, numbers are just abstract and meaningless." 

Communicate with numbers, not just words 

Physicians often default to verbal terms, knowing that a sizable portion of American adults struggle with simple numeric concepts, Peters said. But research has shown that people better understand risks and react appropriately when numbers are discussed alongside verbal descriptions. 

"When you present numeric evidence, like the likelihood of side effects for a prescription medication, what ends up happening is that it helps correct people's original expectation," Peters said. "They're much less likely to overestimate the risk and are more likely to take on a physician's recommendations." 

Do: "Headache is a common side effect and occurs in 7 percent of people." 

Don't: "Headache is a common side effect." 

Make numbers more manageable 

When patients are overwhelmed by medical information, they may rely on mental problem-solving techniques, like gut feelings, pre-existing beliefs and anecdotes they've heard from others. To avoid cognitive overload, Peters suggests limiting information to what's important. If a disease has three intervention options but a patient has a condition that eliminates one as a viable option, she advises not to mention that option. 

The authors also suggest clinicians do the math for their patients. For example, they can calculate the risk of birth control based on the number of years the patient expects to use it instead of the annual risk. 

Do: Highlight only the key facts and tailor information to the patient's situation. 

Don't: Provide information that isn't relevant to a specific patient. 

Provide context to statistics 

Numbers said alone can be meaningless, so Peters suggests using evaluative labels, like "a 6 percent risk is generally considered poor," or comparisons to indicate whether it's high or low risk. 

Do: "Ninety-three percent of patients survive with treatment A compared to 99 percent who survive with treatment B." 

Don't: "Ninety-three percent of patients survive with treatment A." 

Acknowledge uncertainty 

Risk information is an estimate. In some cases, being upfront about the uncertainty of whether a patient will be a part of the 40 percent side or the 60 percent side of a risk, for example, can help convey to patients how seriously they should take it. 

Do: "Estimates of the chance of something happening are only a best guess based on the scientific knowledge we have right now. We do not know your personal real risk because of things about you that have never been studied and we don't yet understand." 

Don't: Present numeric risk information as unerringly precise and correct. 

Test your communication through the teach-back technique 

Experts tend to overestimate how much other people know and how clearly they've communicated. So doctors can use the teach-back technique, Peters said, in which they ask their patient to repeat what they understood and found important. The physician can then insert more information to either correct what's wrong or remind them of something. 

Do: "This can be hard to understand. I'd like to make sure I've explained it clearly. Could you tell me how you understand the pros and cons of taking drug X?" 

Don't: "What questions do you have?" 

Such strategies also can be used by patients to advocate for themselves, Peters said. If told about a possible side effect, they can ask how statistically likely it is. If given too many possible side effects or treatments, they can request to simplify the information to the most important facts. 

Peters plans to conduct a series of studies to test which of the five strategies is the most effective. She also is interested in how storytelling and anecdotes affect patient decision-making. 

"Physicians have very limited time in any one appointment and are often faced with a similar patient over and over," Peters said. "What that means is, if you're trying to help them better communicate with patients, you've got to provide things that are fast and scripted so that everyone can make informed decisions about their care."

DISCLOSURES |  May 22, 2025  



Mariana Chavez MacGregor, MD, MSc, shares her enthusiasm for the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting, particularly for its relevance to early-stage breast cancer. She highlights key sessions focused on treatment optimization and de-escalation for HER2-positive patients, along with important updates on the management of HR-positive breast cancer in premenopausal women, including the SOFT, TEXT, and ASTRRA trials.

Dr Chavez MacGregor also points to new research on elinzanetant for managing vasomotor symptoms associated with endocrine therapy. Additionally, she is eager to attend the Dr Bernard Fisher Memorial Annual Clinical Science Symposium, which will explore circulating tumor DNA and its role in monitoring early-stage breast cancer.

circPVT1 has emerged as a key regulator in disease progression and clinical outcomes. However, its prognostic relevance and association with clinicopathological parameters in solid malignancies remain to be fully elucidated. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis to elucidate the clinical significance of circPVT1 in solid tumors.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI, with a cutoff date of December 31, 2024. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0 to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessing the impact of circPVT1 expression on overall survival (OS) and its association with clinicopathological characteristics.

This analysis included 27 clinical studies encompassing a total of 2,219 patients. Elevated circPVT1 expression was significantly associated with poorer OS in patients with solid tumors (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.39–2.02, P < 0.001). This association was particularly notable in lung cancer (HR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.51–2.88, P < 0.001) and osteosarcoma (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.38–1.97, P < 0.001), with similar trends observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the increased circPVT1 level was correlated with larger tumor size (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11–1.67, P = 0.004), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.22–2.00, P < 0.001), distant metastasis (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.10–2.92, P = 0.017), and advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.50–2.25, P < 0.001).

Our meta-analysis indicated that elevated circPVT1 expression levels are closely linked to unfavorable OS in tumor patients. circPVT1 has the potential to act as both a prognostic indicator and a molecular target for solid tumor therapy. Future research should focus on validating these findings through large-scale, multicenter prospective studies to further establish the clinical utility of circPVT1 in cancer management.

There's good news for people with migraine who take common drugs before or during pregnancy-a new study found no increase in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD in their children. The study, which looked at drugs used for migraine attacks called triptans, is published on May 21, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

The study does not prove that there is a link between these drugs and neurodevelopment disorders.

These results are encouraging for people with migraine, who may be taking these drugs before they even know that they are pregnant, and this is helpful information for their physicians, who can make more informed decisions about treating people with debilitating migraine attacks."

Hedvig Nordeng, PhD, study author of the University of Oslo, Norway

For the study, researchers used health registry records for the entire Norwegian population and identified 26,210 pregnancies in female participants with migraine at the start of pregnancy. Of those, 21,281 people, or over 80%, had taken triptans in the year before they became pregnant and 4,929 of those with migraine had not taken any triptans during that time. For those who took the drugs, researchers divided them into four groups: people who had low use of triptans and stopped using them before pregnancy (42%); people who increased using triptans six months before pregnancy and stopped using them in early pregnancy (31%); people who had moderate triptan use before pregnancy and continued into early pregnancy (21%); and people who used triptans before and during pregnancy (6%).

Then researchers followed the children born for an average of eight years and up until they were 14 years old for some. They checked health registries for diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder, behavioral disorders, learning and intellectual disabilities, speech and language and developmental coordination disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Overall, 1,140 children, or 4.3%, were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder during the study. The most common were ADHD and speech and language disorders. A total of 2.2% of the children of people with the highest use of triptans were diagnosed with ADHD, compared to 2.1% of the children of people with migraine who did not use the drugs. A total of 1.1% of the children of people with the highest use of the drugs were diagnosed with speech and language disorders, compared to 1.0% of children of people who did not use the drugs. When researchers adjusted the results to account for other factors that could affect the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as a parent having a neurodevelopmental disorder, folic acid intake or use of other drugs such as opioids or antidepressants, they found no increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders among children exposed to triptans prenatally.

"Migraine affects almost one in five of people of childbearing age," Nordeng said. "While symptoms often improve during pregnancy, about 8% of people experience worsening attacks during pregnancy, which can lead to increased risks of both maternal and fetal complications, so it's vital to have treatment options available."

A limitation of the study was that researchers did not verify that people took their migraine medications, only that they filled their prescriptions, so the actual drug exposure may be different than the estimates.

In women with dense breasts (breasts with relatively low levels of fatty tissue) and a negative mammogram, supplemental imaging techniques detect early-stage cancers, with imaging techniques three times more effective than ultrasound, finds a phase 3 randomized control trial published in The Lancet.

Women with extremely dense breasts, about 10% of those aged 50-70 years in the UK, face a fourfold increased risk of breast cancer compared to those with the least dense breasts. Mammograms are less effective for detecting early-stage cancer in dense breasts, as the tissue can hide tumors on the breast x-rays. Previous studies have shown MRI and ultrasound are effective supplementary imaging methods, but this study is the first to compare them with contrast mammography in women with normal mammograms and dense breast tissue.

Over 9000 women in the UK with dense breasts and a negative mammogram were randomly allocated to one of three different supplementary techniques. The cancer detection rate for the imaging techniques was 1.7% (for a fast MRI) and 1.9% (for contrast mammography), whilst the cancer detection rate for the ultrasound group was 0.4%.

Authors highlight that although this study shows the scans can detect additional small cancers which are likely to save lives, further research is needed to confirm whether they could reduce the number of deaths due to breast cancer, to establish the risk of overdiagnosis and to estimate the cost benefit ratio of implementing a supplemental imaging strategy for breast cancer screening.

In addition to the relevance for the UK's breast cancer screening programme, this study has global implications for all countries where screening is undertaken for women with dense breast tissue."

Prophylactic radiation therapy to the contralateral breast significantly delayed the onset of contralateral breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants with early breast cancer. The 10-year contralateral breast cancer rates were lower among those who received radiotherapy than among those who did not.

“This novel approach, albeit controversial, is supported by the findings that highlight the need for a larger international trial,” the authors concluded.

The study, led by Ella Evron, MD, Oncology, Kaplan Medical Institute, Rehovot, Israel, was published online in JAMA Oncology.

Higher rates of estrogen receptor positivity and endocrine treatment for the index breast cancer, as well as elective risk-reducing mastectomy, in the control group could have contributed to the lower-than-expected rate of contralateral breast cancer. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was also lower than expected, which could have affected the findings.

This trial was funded by the Israel Cancer Association. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

In this interview, NewsMedical speaks with Joanna Lipner, Co-Founder of PIKRALIDA, and Hanna Kierońska, Head of Drug Technology, about the company's approach to reducing polypharmacy, drug formulation via hot melt extrusion (HME), and the development of novel neuroprotective and orphan disease therapies.

We are a company operating under a hybrid business model. On one hand, we focus on developing innovative therapies for unmet medical needs, and on the other, we offer professional contract research organization (CRO) services to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Our development efforts center around a highly potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), which we are advancing this into therapies for conditions such as post-stroke neuroprotection and snakebite envenoming.

We're focused on two major therapeutic avenues. First, we are developing a novel neuroprotective therapy for post-stroke patients, a space that still lacks effective long-term treatments. Secondly, we are targeting an orphan disease: snakebite envenoming. It's a neglected condition in urgent need of attention, and we believe our molecule has strong potential here due to its mechanism of action.



The twin screw extruder plays a critical role in our work, especially for hot melt extrusion. This technology significantly enhances the solubility of our active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which is crucial for improving drug absorption and efficacy. It also allows us to develop fixed-dose combination therapies by embedding different APIs into a thermoplastic polymer to ensure compatibility and enable controlled release.

Hot melt extrusion enables us to formulate complex drug combinations into a single dosage form. This is particularly important for elderly patients or those with chronic conditions who often take multiple medications.

By combining therapies into one product and modifying the release profiles appropriately, we can reduce the number of different pills a patient needs, effectively addressing polypharmacy. It's a patient-centered innovation that enhances adherence and minimizes potential drug interactions.

We often work with rare or costly APIs, so we need to keep batch sizes small. A laboratory-scale extruder is ideal for minimizing API consumption while enabling efficient process development. It's also compact, which is practical for R&D labs that tend to have limited space. Most importantly, it mirrors the design of pilot and production-scale extruders, making the transition to larger-scale manufacturing straightforward and low-risk.

It's crucial. The beauty of Thermo Fisher's twin screw extruders is that their lab models are designed to closely resemble production-scale equipment. This consistency allows for seamless technology transfer. We can develop a process on a small scale and be confident it will perform similarly at manufacturing scale, which reduces development time and risk.

Yes, the versatility of the twin screw extruder extends beyond hot melt extrusion. We're also looking into methods like continuous wet granulation, pelletization, and even producing filaments for 3D printing. These options provide flexibility in dosage form development, allowing us to tailor drug delivery to specific therapeutic needs and patient groups.

I believe combining smart drug formulation technologies with precision manufacturing tools like twin screw extrusion will transform how we develop and deliver medicines. For example, the ability to reduce polypharmacy not only simplifies therapy for patients but also improves safety and outcomes.

As we explore more personalized and complex treatments, especially in orphan diseases and CNS disorders, these technologies will be indispensable.

We are moving forward with our lead candidates in both the neuroprotective and snakebite envenoming areas. At the same time, we continue supporting biotech partners through our CRO services. We're also expanding our formulation development capabilities, which will enable us to develop even more innovative dosage forms in the future.

Opioids like hydrocodone or oxycodone are typically prescribed to relieve intense pain. A prescription can become an addiction; side effects include building a tolerance to the medication – so the patient has to take a higher dose to feel relief – or becoming physically dependent on the drug. These effects can happen quickly, even when taking opioids as prescribed.

Many factors increase the risk of developing opioid use disorder. These include the severity of pain itself, how long opioids are used, their dosage and other medical conditions, such as neurologic or mental health disorders."

Mirna Becevic, study author 

To determine the populations most at-risk, Becevic and her team combed through over 3 million records of Medicaid claims in Missouri from 2017 to 2021. The study had a total of 306,432 observations, which was compared against 2018 USA census data and data from 2020 detailing the primary care shortage.

Becevic and her team found that male patients and people in the middle age range up to 60 years old were more likely to be prescribed a high dose of opioids. They observed a more conservative prescribing pattern for younger adults, which may be because of increased awareness about the opioid epidemic.

"Incidence of chronic pain increases with age, which may have affected the prescribing patterns we saw," Becevic said. "Interestingly, the risk of prescription past age 60 sharply declined, though this could be because of the increased risk of adverse effects and potential drug interactions."

Researchers also determined that areas with the largest risk of high-dose opioids correlated with areas that tended to be more urban and had higher percentages of veterans and primary care providers.

"These findings emphasize the need for public health strategies to address the opioid crisis," Becevic said. "Opportunities are available for clinicians interested in learning more about evidence-based treatment for pain and opioid use disorder, including our Show Me ECHO program."

While current clinical guidelines say high-dose opioids prescriptions should be avoided, it remains a common practice in certain areas. Since the study used only Missouri data, Becevic says the findings may not be relevant to other populations in the United States.

"Other states and regions have their own unique demographics, policies and health care access," Becevic said. "Further studies should investigate long-term trends and why doctors prescribe high-dose opioids. Our study's findings, however, help identify risk factors for all Missouri patients."

Mirna Becevic, PhD is an assistant professor of dermatology at the MU School of Medicine. Her research focuses on telemedicine and telehealth.

"Identifying high-dose opioid prescription risks using machine learning: A focus on sociodemographic characteristics" was recently published in the Journal of Opioid Management. In addition to Becevic, MU study authors include Olabode Ogundele, PhD, with the Institute for Data Science and Informatics and the Missouri Telehealth Network; Butros Dahu, PhD, with the Institute for Data Science and Informatics; Praveen Rao, PhD, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science; Xing Song, PhD, assistant professor of Biomedical Informatics, Biostatistics and Medical Epidemiology; Timothy Haithcoat, PhD, assistant teaching professor of Data Science and Analytics; and Tracy Greever-Rice, PhD, Director of the MU Center for Health Policy. Other authors include Mutiyat Hameed, from SSM Health, and Douglas Burgess, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at University of Missouri – Kansas City.

Scientists have identified unique metabolic fingerprints in blood and urine that can objectively track ultra-processed food intake, paving the way for more accurate diet studies and new tools for public health.

With ultra-processed foods (UPFs) now accounting for over 50% of daily calories for many Americans, researchers are searching for biological clues in blood and urine that can objectively measure UPF intake. In a recent study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, researchers from the United States (U.S.) and Brazil aimed to identify specific patterns of metabolites—tiny molecules in the body—that serve as reliable markers of UPF consumption.

The study focused on an older, predominantly White U.S. population, which may limit the generalizability of its findings to other demographic groups.

Ultra-processed foods, such as packaged snacks, sugary drinks, and ready-to-eat meals, are widely consumed worldwide, especially in the U.S. These foods are mainly made from refined ingredients and additives and are linked to a growing number of health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.

While dietary surveys help track eating habits, they often rely on memory and self-reporting, which can introduce inaccuracies. Furthermore, the Nova classification system, which categorizes foods by their level of processing, requires detailed data that is not always available in food tracking tools. As a result, assessing UPF consumption reliably has become challenging in large-scale studies.

Scientists are now turning to metabolomics, the study of metabolites or the small molecules present in blood and urine due to metabolic processes, to find biomarkers that reflect actual dietary intake.

To identify biological markers linked to UPF intake, the researchers used data from the IDATA Study, which followed 1,082 adults aged 50 to 74 years. Of these, 718 participants had both dietary and biological data and were included in the metabolomics analysis.

The participants were required to complete up to six web-based 24-hour dietary recalls over a year. Foods were classified according to the Nova system, which sorts food items into four groups based on their level of processing. The researchers then calculated the percentage of total energy intake from UPFs.

Blood samples and two types of urine samples (24-hour and first morning void) were collected at two different time points, six months apart. The samples underwent metabolomics analysis using advanced mass spectrometry techniques to identify over 1,000 compounds from various chemical groups such as lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and vitamins.

Statistical analyses were performed to determine correlations between UPF intake and the metabolites, adjusting for factors like age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. The researchers then used statistical tools to identify a combination of metabolites (poly-metabolite scores) that could best predict UPF intake. These scores were built separately for blood, 24-hour urine, and first-morning urine samples.

To test whether these scores were reliable, the team then used data from a previous crossover feeding trial. In this controlled setting, 20 adults consumed diets with either 80% or 0% UPF for two weeks each. Blood and urine samples from this trial were analyzed using the same methods, allowing researchers to compare how the poly-metabolite scores changed between diets. This helped confirm whether the scores could detect actual dietary differences in real time.

It should be noted that dietary recalls and biospecimen collection were not always precisely paired in time, which may affect the interpretation of some results. Additionally, the feeding trial sample size was small, and the study was not powered for disease outcomes.

The study found that blood and urine contain distinct metabolic signatures that reflect a person's UPF consumption. The researchers identified hundreds of compounds that were either more or less abundant depending on UPF intake. Using this information, they developed poly-metabolite scores—combinations of selected metabolites—that successfully predicted an individual's UPF consumption.

Specifically, 191 metabolites in blood and 293 in 24-hour urine showed strong correlations with UPF intake. These included amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and compounds from food additives or packaging materials. Notably, four metabolites were robust indicators across both blood and urine: (S)C(S)S-S-methylcysteine sulfoxide, N2,N5-diacetylornithine, pentoic acid (all negatively associated with UPF), and N6-carboxymethyllysine (positively associated). The latter, which is linked to advanced glycation end-products, is also associated with diabetes and heart disease.

The identified metabolic signatures reflect not only high UPF intake but also a lower intake of whole foods, including fruits and vegetables. For example, lower β-cryptoxanthin, a marker of fruit and vegetable consumption, was observed in those with higher UPF intake.

When tested in a controlled trial where participants consumed high- and no-UPF diets, these poly-metabolite scores reliably distinguished between diet phases within individuals. This showed that the scores worked not just in observational settings but also under tightly regulated conditions. The discrimination ability of these scores was moderate (AUCs of 0.66–0.78), suggesting further refinement is needed for use in diverse populations.

Furthermore, the results confirmed that high UPF intake is associated with lower levels of beneficial compounds like β-cryptoxanthin, found in fruits and vegetables, and higher levels of certain xenobiotics — foreign substances likely from food additives or packaging. This supported the idea that UPF-heavy diets may lack essential nutrients while introducing potentially harmful compounds.

The metabolic pathways associated with UPF intake included not only xenobiotic metabolism, but also amino acid, lipid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism, highlighting the broad biological impact of dietary patterns high in UPFs.

In summary, the study provided strong evidence that blood and urine metabolites can serve as objective indicators of UPF intake. The researchers developed and validated poly-metabolite scores for blood and urine samples, and the scores consistently reflected habitual dietary patterns.

The findings offer a promising tool for objectively measuring UPF intake in future health studies. However, the scores need further evaluation in more diverse and younger populations, and their predictive value for long-term health outcomes remains to be established. While more work is needed to adapt these scores to diverse populations, the results mark an important step toward better tools for nutrition research and public health monitoring.

Herc Gomez discusses the USMNT's striker options ahead of the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup (1:33)

In March, after dropping two home games in the Concacaf Nations League to Panama and Canada, the assessment of the U.S. men's national team was that things couldn't get much worse. That came nine months after the poor showing at the Copa América, where the USMNT failed to get out of the group stage.

All was not lost, though. The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup was on the horizon. There would be extended time for manager Mauricio Pochettino to get to know his players better and come up with some tactical wrinkles to maximize the team's potential at next year's FIFA World Cup.

Or so the thinking went.

Two months later, it's not only worse, but Pochettino is looking at something close to a worst-case scenario, at least in terms of the team's preparations.

On Thursday, Pochettino announced his 27-player roster for next month's friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, and the list of absences was staggering. AC Milan's Christian Pulisic is out, citing fatigue and nagging injuries from a long club season. The same is true for Fulham defender Antonee Robinson, who according to Pochettino has been unable to train on a consistent basis. Yunus Musah, Pulisic's teammate in Milan, asked to be omitted from the roster due to an undisclosed personal reason.

U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker later put out a statement explaining the decision to allow Pulisic to skip the Gold Cup.

"Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break," Crocker said. "After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season."

Then there are the forced absences of the Juventus duo Weston McKennie and Tim Weah, along with Borussia Dortmund midfielder Giovanni Reyna, due to their clubs commitments at the FIFA Club World Cup, which is happening at the same time as the Gold Cup. That's six players who have had prominent roles with the U.S. in the not-so-distant past -- and who were expected to form the backbone of the team -- who aren't available.

It could get even worse if Johnny Cardoso completes his move to Atlético Madrid, and is also diverted to the Club World Cup. Sources told ESPN that the 23-year-old Real Betis midfielder is Diego Simeone's side's top target this summer.

Pochettino insisted he was making his judgements on a case-by-case basis. Also left off the roster were players like Norwich City's Josh Sargent, and Lyon's Tanner Tessmann, although the manager said those were for "footballing reasons."

There is plenty of logic to wanting to give players like Pulisic and Robinson rest. Pulisic is poised to log more than 3,500 minutes for the second consecutive season. Robinson put in more than 3,200. The clubs pay their salaries, so it's clear what everyone's priorities are.

There is an emotional component to this that doesn't wear well, though.

Every week, fans have been watching Pulisic and Robinson tee things up for their clubs. The fact that they are choosing to take a break at this moment, with the USMNT clearly at a low ebb, grates. This current generation is already being called out by former USMNTers for not being devoted enough to the cause. The optics of the this situation don't help.

Pochettino thinks that perception can be changed. It can, but it will take some doing.

"I think that our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game match the aggressivity of the opponent, and that is what we want to show in these two friendly games and also in the World Cup," Pochettino said. "I think if the fans start to see that energy and to translate this type of energy, I think the fans, they're going to be positive with us."

The circumstances have left Pochettino wearing a set of handcuffs embossed with the logos of FIFA and European clubs. It doesn't matter that confederation championships like the Gold Cup require clubs to release players. There are the rules and then there is reality. Pochettino also indicated that if a player isn't fully fit, then he doesn't want them around.

"If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" Pochettino asked. "No, no, no, no, no. What we want do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. ... If we want be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day."

When, exactly, will he have a team of 23 fully fit, fully focused players at his disposal, though?

After this summer, there will be four FIFA international match windows left, not including the period just prior to the World Cup. Those windows are far from ideal in terms of building a cohesive unit. The players arrive, have one or two training sessions, and then play a game; that's followed by rest and recovery and maybe one more training session before a second game.

That's why this Gold Cup was so important. A month spent with the team's core players will have allowed for more understanding of Pochettino's approach.

Pochettino also said that there was "too much importance" placed on the team being together. If not now, when? It's a situation that looks increasingly akin to the U.S. being asked to cram for its final exam when it meets for a pre-World Cup camp in a year's time. The reality is that the can of World Cup preparation can only be kicked down the road so many times.

About the only silver lining -- and it's a small one -- is that Pochettino now has the chance to give some fringe players an opportunity for playing time in matches with higher stakes than during the January camp. Diego Luna figures to be a huge beneficiary of the absences of players like Pulisic and Reyna. On a team that has looked complacent at times, new players stepping up can only help. The likes of Folarin Balogun and Sergiño Dest are returning from injury, giving the U.S. a boost.

"I think it's important for us also to find different solutions or try to find different ways to approach, and one of the things is to give possibility to maybe different players to join the national team," Pochettino said.

It's the only approach he can take at this point, but it's one that is still setting off alarm bells.

FIFA Club World Cup

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has warned FIFA that he suspects “players and managers” do not want to be at FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup this summer, reiterating his concerns that players are at risk of burning out.

Carragher was speaking on a media call organised by the U.S. broadcaster CBS Sports to promote their upcoming coverage of the UEFA Champions League final between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. The FIFA president Gianni Infantino has described the Club World Cup, which will be played in the United States this summer between 32 teams, as the “most coveted” trophy in club football and The Athletic asked whether this is a view likely to be held by current players and ex-pros, particularly when set against the established Champions League.

Carragher said: “I've got no time for it at all, to be honest. I don't think football can ever stand still. The game has to evolve, it has to move forward. Different things have to happen and you have to keep the interest of players, coaches and people around the world. That's what makes it the best sport in the world, but there's something about the Club World Cup where I almost feel like it's being put together by FIFA to almost — not so much compete with the Champions League — but there's been no thought about the players or the clubs.

“It's a bit like FIFA think, ‘Well, we've only got the World Cup every four years and UEFA or Europe have this Champions League. There's this unbelievable money and financial aspect to it and they have it every year but we've got to wait every four years for the World Cup.' They've just tried to create something and I don't think there's any appetite really from players, clubs and even supporters.

“I am a massive football fan. I watch everything. I can't envisage in the summer me stopping my holiday or going in from the (swimming) pool to go and watch a game. I think I'll probably forget it's on. Now I might be wrong and in 20 years time this may become that.

“But right now, I don't think the players and the managers actually want to be there. That's a really sad state of affairs for a new tournament. When do they ever get a rest? So we're talking now about players who will only get a rest one summer every four years. That's not right. It was fine the way it was, a tournament every two years and the players get a good long break in the summer. I'm not a fan right now, but listen, I may be proven wrong in the future. But if you've got a tournament that the players don't really want to play in and the coaches don't want to be there, I think you've a bit of a problem. ”

The European football season ends on May 31 with the UEFA Champions League final but players go straight into international matches and World Cup qualifiers, with the latest fixtures on June 10. The Club World Cup then starts on June 14, while some teams are likely to organise preparatory exhibition games ahead of the competition.

FIFPro, the global players' union, has previously said that the football schedule demonstrated “a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players.”

In 2024, two of Europe's largest players unions, the English PFA and its French counterparts, the Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels, teamed up to launch a case against FIFA. They argued the rights of its members were being violated under European Union (EU) laws. FIFPro and the European Leagues, who represent 39 leagues in 33 countries, filed a complaint to the European Commission to protect the welfare of its players.

FIFA last week unveiled an in-house video at their annual congress in Paraguay where star names featuring in the Club World Cup such as Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola, Bayern Munich forward Harry Kane and Inter Miami icon Lionel Messi appeared to promote the tournament. However, Kane has also previously told reporters he does not believe players are being listened to when it comes to player welfare, while Guardiola has previously implied his players may have a more relaxing schedule than normal and joked that the golf courses are “really nice” in America.

Guardiola said: “We are going to try to try to enjoy that experience, after 11 [months] I am not thinking about bringing the players there to spend hours in their room thinking about the next game.”

FIFA have previously said that the calendar was “unanimously approved” by the FIFA Council which includes representatives from all continents and after consultation that included FIFPro. Only two clubs will play the maximum seven games every four years.

A FIFA spokesperson said: “The FIFA Club World Cup will usher in a new era for club football worldwide. It will be the greatest, most inclusive and merit-based global club competition in history, bringing together the most successful club sides from every continent to decide the true world champion at club level. FIFA's duty is to develop the game globally and this new competition is in the best interests of football around the world.”

If the U.S. men's national team is to win its first Concacaf Gold Cup since 2021 this summer, it will do so severely shorthanded.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino on Thursday named a 27-player USMNT training camp roster ahead of the biennial regional championship and the two early June friendlies that precede it. And as expected, many of the American regulars are missing.

FOX Sports reported on Wednesday that star attacker Christian Pulisic would skip this summer's tournament following two grueling seasons with Italian club A.C. Milan. Weston McKennie and Tim Weah are unavailable because Juventus is participating in the FIFA Club World Cup instead, as is Gio Reyna's Borussia Dortmund.Regarding Pulisic's absence, U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker said in a statement:"Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break. "After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season."

"The principal objective is the World Cup," Pochettino told reporters via Zoom shortly after Thursday's announcement. "We decided the best [thing] for him and for the national team is the decision that we make." 

Several other prominent names are absent; 2024 U.S. Soccer Male Athlete of the Year Antonee "Jedi" Robinson is still dealing with the minor injuries that prevented him from participating in the Concacaf Nations League final four in March. Yunus Musah was supposed to be with their USMNT next month;  Pochettino said he withdrew from consideration earlier this week for personal reasons. Joe Scally, Josh Sargent and Tanner Tessmann, who all started the Nations League semifinal loss to Panama, were also left off the squad, which will be trimmed to 26 on June 4, when the final list must be submitted to Concacaf. The Gold Cup begins on June 14, with the Americans kicking off group play against Trinidad and Tobago the following day.

Understandably, Pochettino is focusing on not who's missing but the players that are available, a group led by 2022 World Cup veterans Brenden Aaronson, Sergino Dest, Matt Turner and Haji Wright, and Premier League center back Chris Richards. Now recovered from an ACL tear he suffered last spring, Dest is participating in his first camp under the Argentine manager. So is striker Folarin Balogun, who missed much of Monaco's season following shoulder surgery. 

"It's so exciting to see different players," Pochettino said. "It's a great opportunity for different players to have the chance to challenge and to try to get a place in one year's time for the World Cup." 

Some of Pochettino's selections – and omissions - were still surprising. Five players have never been capped at senior level: Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder and the son of former USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter; Orlando City fullback Alex Freeman; Matt Freese, New York City FC goalkeeper; Philadelphia Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan; and German-born forward Damion Downs, who helped Cologne earn promotion to the Bundesliga this season by scoring 10 goals in 29 games. Freeman is the son of former NFL star Antonio Freeman, a Super Bowl champion and Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer. 

Aaronson returns after being left off the March squad. The New Jersey product won the English second-tier title this season with Leeds United, which will play in the Premier League in 2025-25. Pochettino cited Aaronson's "energy, positivity, enthusiasm and passion," when asked why he'd been recalled. "He's this type of player that transmits to the rest of the team these feelings," the coach added. 

"We learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March," Pochettino said. "This opportunity is amazing. We are so motivated, so excited. We are full energy working and to try to create a good group that we can feel proud of." 

The USMNT will face European foes Turkey and Switzerland in tuneups on June 7 and 10, respectively. 

The full training camp roster is as follows:

Goalkeepers: Matt Freese, New York City FC (MLS); Patrick Schulte, Columbus Crew (MLS), Zack Steffen, Colorado Rapids (MLS); Matt Turner, Crystal Palace (England)  

Defenders: Max Arfsten, Columbus; Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven, (Netherlands); Alex Freeman, Orlando (MLS); DeJuan Jones, San Jose Earthquakes (MLS); Mark McKenzie, Toulouse (France); Tim Ream, Charlotte (MLS); Chris Richards, Crystal Palace; Miles Robinson, Cincinnati (MLS)

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson, Leeds (England); Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England): Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver (MLS); Johnny Cardoso, Real Betis (Spain); Luca de la Torre, San Diego (MLS); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS); Jack McGlynn, Houston Dynamo (MLS); Quinn Sullivan, Philadelphia Union (MLS); Malik Tillman, PSV; Sean Zawadzki, Columbus 

Forwards: Patrick Agyemang, Charlotte (MLS); Folarin Balogun, Monaco (France); Damion Downs, Cologne (Germany); Brian White, Vancouver; Haji Wright, Coventry (England)

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday.

ATLANTA – U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday.

Players will begin reporting June 1 to Chicago to start preparation for the Concacaf Gold Cup.

The roster was without several familiar names, including A.C. Milan's Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah, Juventus' Weston McKennie and Tim Weah, and Borussia Dortmund's Gio Reyna.

Pulisic and Musah have been given rest by Pochettino. Juventus and Dortmund are participating in the FIFA Club World Cup, which is being held at the same time as the Gold Cup.

“Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break,” U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker said in a statement.

“After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season.”

The friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland will provide the USMNT with one of its few opportunities to face European opposition before the World Cup and will serve as the team's final tune-up before the Gold Cup.

“As we continue preparations for the World Cup, this is a fantastic opportunity to work with this group of players for an extended period and it's important we take advantage of every moment we have together,” Pochettino said in a statement. “Of course, we want to win and to perform in a very good way. These players have earned the chance to compete for our fans and to show their quality and mentality.”

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET, with the broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. ET and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo, and Peacock.

NEW YORK (AP) — Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League.

Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans a turnaround is ahead.

“It's our responsibility to send some signal to them,” he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. “I think our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game (to) match the aggressivity of the opponent."

Pulisic, the top American player, asked to be left off the roster for the last competitive matches before the 2026 World Cup in order to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams. 

Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called "football decisions."

U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the amount of games he has played in the last two years.

“Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “We decided the best for him, the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.”

Pochettino replaced Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round elimination at the Copa America last summer. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup.

In the team's first significant test under Pochettino, the Americans lost to Panama and Canada in the Nations League in March. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said “we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be — maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities."

Sixteen of the players picked are from Major League Soccer, the most in a FIFA window since the U.S. sent a B team to the 2023 Gold Cup.

“If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" Pochettino asked out loud. "No, no, no, no, no. What we want do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. ... If we want be good in one year time, we need to think that today is the most important day."

Outside back Sergino Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. Forward Folarin Balogun is with the team for the first time since last September following his recuperation from shoulder surgery.

Pochettino's roster included Alex Freeman, a son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman. The 20-year-old right back made his Major League Soccer debut for Orlando in April 2023 — his only league match that season. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season.

Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan.

Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, also was selected.

Players will start reporting June 1 for training in Chicago, and the 26-man Gold Cup roster is due June 4. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup.

The roster:

Goalkeepers: Matt Freese (New York City), Patrick Schulte (Columbus), Zack Steffen (Colorado), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace)

Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando), DeJuan Jones (San Jose), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati)

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Luca de la Torre (San Diego), Diego Luna (Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus)

Forwards: Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte), Folarin Balogun (Monaco). Damion Downs (Cologne), Brian White (Vancouver), Haji Wright (Coventry)

A new keeper's in town.

Bayern Munich keeper-in-waiting Jonas Urbig could be getting his next chance to start at the summer's Club World Cup competition in the United States.

As captured by Sky Sport DE journalist Florian Plettenberg:

   It's the clear and agreed plan: Jonas Urbig is set to feature at the Club World Cup in the USA with FC Bayern!

As a result, he will not take part in the U21 Euros in Slovakia.

@kerry_hau @SkySportDE   

Does this mean that Manuel Neuer will not be the main starter between the sticks for the Bavarians? The captain fought his way back into the starting lineup after returning from injury for the final Bundesliga games of the season, but the summer will be a good opportunity for him to rest — and for Urbig to get a jump start on competitive integration with the team.

The 21-year-old has impressed as a shot stopper in his cameo stretch for Neuer this season, but teammates have not looked as comfortable yet relying on him in distribution. Of course with Neuer, that is a high bar...but Urbig can take some strides in June.

Thomas Tuchel names his England squad on Friday for World Cup qualifier with Andorra on June 7 and Senegal friendly on June 10; Club World Cup begins four days later; Arsenal's Ben White available again but Phil Foden has requested to be rested after difficult season


          Senior Football Journalist
              @psmithXI


Thursday 22 May 2025 16:16, UK

The Club World Cup complicates Thomas Tuchel's plans for the upcoming international break - but there could be a long-awaited recall for Arsenal's Ben White.

On Friday, the Three Lions boss will announce his selections for the World Cup qualifier with Andorra, which takes place in Barcelona on June 7, and the friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City Ground on June 10.

However, players at Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich will also be involved in the relaunched Club World Cup, which kicks off in the USA on June 14.

Captain Harry Kane, Chelsea star Cole Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham are among the England first-team players who could find themselves with a busy period ahead, while it is understood Real Madrid are also looking into a deal with Liverpool to allow Trent Alexander-Arnold to link up with them in time for the Club World Cup.

Find out who makes Thomas Tuchel's England squad - and who misses out - from 10am on Friday on the Sky Sports website, App and Sky Sports News. 

Chelsea's players will also be involved in the Conference League final on Wednesday May 28, while Manchester United players will be going on a two-game post-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong immediately after the end of the Premier League season.

Tuchel intends to have a week-long training camp with his players in Spain ahead of the qualifier with Andorra and sees this as a crucial opportunity to implement his tactical ideas, having highlighted how important each international window is for him ahead of the World Cup next year, when England will be targeting victory.

One option could be that players involved in the Club World Cup link up with the England squad for the training camp and qualifier, and are then permitted to skip the friendly and have a short break before heading to the States. But Tuchel did say in March that he would prioritise England objectives during international windows.

"It would be the wrong signal to tell players now, 'Hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'," he said. "In the end we take care of ourselves and the clubs take care of themselves, and the main focus is taking care of the players."

Bellingham is set for shoulder surgery after the Club World Cup, which will rule him out of the start of next season, but could play through the pain barrier to represent his country and then compete for Real in the USA.

White has not been involved with an England squad since leaving the 2022 World Cup camp during Gareth Southgate's reign. However, his international exile could be about to come to an end, with the defender indicating he is eager to get back into the mix and that he has had positive conversations with Tuchel. White missed much of this season following knee surgery but is back in action now.

However, Phil Foden has requested not to be included in this England squad so he has the chance to get himself mentally and physically right after, in his own words, struggling with issues off the field and with an ankle injury he sustained in the Manchester derby in April.

Among other attacking options, Marcus Rashford - who started both of Tuchel's first games in charge - was ruled out of the rest of Aston Villa's season, where he's on loan from Manchester United, but is working on returning to fitness after a hamstring injury.

His Villa team-mate Ollie Watkins should get the call, though. Watkins agreed with Tuchel to rest a minor knee issue in March, but is finishing the season strongly and will be aiming to push Bundesliga winner Kane for a starting role.

Key man Bukayo Saka will definitely be back in the mix after returning to fitness at Arsenal.

Morgan Gibbs-White was belatedly added to Tuchel's squad in March when it became clear Palmer would not recover from injury in time to join up with the squad and will hope to get another reward for his good performances for Forest.

Crystal Palace's FA Cup winner Eberechi Eze also looks sure of a spot given his brilliant form. He has scored nine goals and recorded three assists in 12 games for Palace since netting his first international goal against Latvia.

Elsewhere, Jordan Henderson missed out on the Dutch title with Ajax but was recalled to the England set-up in March after over a year away from the group, with Tuchel keen to lean on his experience. The indications are he will be involved again.

It was a similar story with Kyle Walker, on loan at AC Milan from Man City, but he has since struggled with form and fitness in Italy.

Centre-back stalwart Harry Maguire should return though, having shaken off injury problems which saw him miss out against Albania and Latvia and reclaim a starting spot for Man Utd. Marc Guehi's head injury, sustained in the FA Cup final, could keep him out and open up a centre-back spot.

Mason Mount was a Tuchel favourite when they were both at Chelsea and will have ambitions of being at the World Cup next year. Have his performances for United impressed Tuchel enough in recent weeks to earn him a recall to the national team?

Eighteen-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly is a certainty to be included again after he became the youngest-scoring debutant for England against Albania, although Luke Shaw's return to fitness for Man Utd will add competition in a previously light left-back area.

Dan Burn, Morgan Rogers and Dominic Solanke are set to be included again, with the latter hoping to show Tuchel what he can do on the back of Tottenham's Europa League success, having not played a minute during the previous camp.

Adam Wharton - fresh from that FA Cup win with Palace - was with the England U21s in March. Lee Carsley's age-group side are out to defend their U21 Euros title when the tournament begins on June 11, so there will need to be a decision made on whether the likes of Wharton, Rico Lewis, Jarrad Branthwaite (who is nursing an injury of his own) and Taylor Harwood-Bellis get the chance to add to their senior caps or focus on the U21 tournament.

Liam Delap, Ethan Nwaneri, Harvey Elliott, James McAtee and Archie Gray could also be used by Carsley rather than Tuchel.

COLUMBUS –U.S. Soccer today announced that Columbus Crew goalkeeper Patrick Schulte and midfielders Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki were selected by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino for the squad's June training camp in Chicago, Ill. ahead of two friendlies against Türkiye (at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, East Hartford, Conn. on June 7) and Switzerland (at Geodis Park, Nashville, Tenn. on June 10). The Crew lead the way with three players receiving call-ups to the USMNT's upcoming camp.

The deadline for final rosters for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is Wednesday, June 4. The USMNT will play its Group D matches against Trinidad and Tobago (at PayPal Park, San Jose, Calif. on June 15), Saudi Arabia (at Q2 Stadium, Austin, Texas on June 19) and Haiti (at AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas on June 22).

Arfsten has made three appearances (two starts) for the USMNT and earned his first cap on Jan. 18, playing 65 minutes in a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. Most recently, the Fresno, Calif. native represented the U.S. at the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League Finals, earning the start against Canada in the Third Place match on March 23. In 2025, Arfsten has started 13 MLS matches for the Crew, recording six goal contributions (three goals, three assists), including the game-winning goal against the San Jose Earthquakes on April 26.

Owning three caps with the USMNT, Schulte made his senior debut against Slovenia on Jan. 20, 2024, when he played 90 minutes and registered three saves. He recorded his first win for the U.S. on Jan. 18 during a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. The St. Charles, Mo., native represented the United States in the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he started all four U.S. matches and became the first active MLS player to record a shutout at the Olympics. Bolstered by his performance, the Americans reached the knockout rounds for the first time in 24 years.

This season, Schulte has started 13 MLS fixtures, notched two clean sheets and tallied 32 saves. The goalkeeper ranks second all-time for the Club in regular season wins by a goalkeeper with 39 in his 71 appearances.

Zawadzki previously took part in the USMNT's 2024 January Camp, recording his first start against Slovenia on Jan. 20. The Olmsted Falls, Ohio native has started 13 of the Black & Gold's MLS matches this season, notching two goals, highlighted by equalizing goal against the Philadelphia Union on May 10 in the 90'+3' minute of the contest.

Coverage of the USA's match against Türkiye begins at 3:30 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo and Peacock. The USMNT's match against Switzerland  will kick off at 8 p.m. ET and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo and Peacock. Live Spanish-language audio for the matches will be available on Fútbol de Primera radio.

ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named a 27-player training camp roster ahead of June matches against Turkey and Switzerland. Players will begin reporting June 1 to Chicago to start preparation for the summer.

The matches will provide the USMNT with one of its few opportunities to face European opposition before the World Cup and will serve as the team's final tune-up before competing in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

“As we continue preparations for the World Cup, this is a fantastic opportunity to work with this group of players for an extended period and it's important we take advantage of every moment we have together,” Pochettino said. "Of course, we want to win and to perform in a very good way. These players have earned the chance to compete for our fans and to show their quality and mentality.”

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET, with the match broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock. [TICKETS]Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca-Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local) and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo, and Peacock. [TICKETS]

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary on USMNT matches for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call.

Fans can follow the @USMNT on X and Instagram and U.S. Soccer on Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

Chris Richards and Matt Turner joined former USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard as the only U.S. internationals to win the prestigious FA Cup in England. Crystal Palace defeated powerhouse Manchester City in the Final at famed Wembley Stadium in London last Saturday.

Malik Tillman and Sergiño Dest are Dutch league champions once again with PSV Eindhoven, the club having a remarkable late season surge capped off by a victory on the final matchday to capture their second straight title.

Brenden Aaronson had his best season in England, helping propel Leeds United to the top spot in the English League Championship and a return to the Premier League.

Meantime, 20-year-old striker Damion Downs tied for the team leading scoring as FC Köln finished first in the league and will be back in the German Bundesliga next season.

The U.S. roster boasts loads of scoring talent. With eight goals in 10 matches, Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White is tied for third in the MLS Golden Boot race, while Diego Luna sits one behind with seven goals in 13 appearances this season.

Veteran attacker Brenden Aaronson pocketed nine goals and two assists in 46 matches, while first-time call-up Damion Downs tallied 10 goals in 29 matches.

Striker Haji Wright collected 12 goals and one assist in 29 matches as Coventry City fell just short of Premier League promotion.

Malik Tillman finished second on the scoring charts for PSV, tallying 12 goals including the insurance strike in the 3-1 win away to Sparta Rotterdam on the final match day to secure PSV's championship title.

Meanwhile, first-time call-up Quinn Sullivan's seven assists in 14 matches for the Philadelphia Union leave him tied for second league wide. 

Several familiar faces make their return to the USMNT. After recovering from a ruptured ACL, Sergiño Dest returns to camp for the first time since helping the USA claim the Concacaf Nations League title in March 2024.

Following an injury, forward Folarin Balogun is back for the first time since September 2024. A dual national of England the United States, his first goal for the U.S. came in the 2-0 win against Canada in the final of the 2023 Concacaf Nations League.

The roster features five exciting young prospects, including first-time call-ups in defenders Alex Freeman and Quinn Sullivan, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and forward Damion Downs. 

Freeman is the son of former Green Packers All-Pro wide receiver and Super Bowl champion Antonio Freeman. Sebastian Berhalter has been one of the MVP performers for Vancouver Whitecaps in leading them to the Concacaf Champions Cup final, which included back-to-back victories against Inter Miami in the semifinal. Downs, a dual national of Germany and the United States, grew up playing football in Texas before moving to Germany.

Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS Next Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. He's made the most of the opportunity, already collecting three goals in four matches.

“Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break.

"After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he's fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season,” U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said.

Defeat to Tottenham has brought the situations of three key players into sharp focus as well as that of the coach - but there is one positive outcome

The defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham confirmed Manchester United's worst season since being relegated in 1974 - and depressingly, it's still not over. It won't even be done after they host Aston Villa on Sunday, when there is the prospect of them dropping below Spurs in the Premier League and finishing in 17th, the last place above the relegation zone.

A few days after what is sure to be a funereal occasion at Old Trafford, United travel to Malaysia and Hong Kong for a post-season tour, the only objective of which is to scrape back a bit more money. They could sure do with some extra change after losing the golden ticket of Champions League qualification and the £100 million ($134m) pay cheque that would have accompanied it, but going on a trip halfway around the world must be the last thing Ruben Amorim or any of his players want to do after such a disheartening loss.

The mood on the 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpar is sure to be tense, especially between Ruben Amorim and Alejandro Garnacho after the winger made his displeasure at starting on the bench in Bilbao clear and hinted at the possibility of leaving United. Kobbie Mainoo might also have a similar plan after only coming on in added time, while Bruno Fernandes will have lots of time to weigh up those lucrative offers from Saudi Arabia.

Amorim himself is likely to have some frank conversations with United's chief executive Omar Berrada and later down the line with Sir Jim Ratcliffe as the major consequences of United's defeat at San Mames begin to emerge...

The 33-year-old former Espanyol winger hopes to bring a cutting edge to Branko Ivankovic's squad, who need to win their next two matches

Wu Lei looks set to make his first appearance for China in more than eight months after being included in Branko Ivankovic's 27-man squad for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Indonesia and Bahrain on Thursday.

The 33-year-old former Espanyol winger, who has scored 36 goals in 99 appearances for his country, last played an international against Saudi Arabia last September before being sidelined by a knee injury.

He returned to action for Shanghai Port last month and Ivankovic will hope he can bring a much-needed cutting edge to China's forward line, which has failed to find the net in either of their past two qualifiers.

Uncapped midfielder Yang Mingyang was also included in the squad after the former Swiss youth international had his request to change international allegiance approved by Fifa on Monday.

China are bottom of Group C and cannot now earn direct passage to the 2026 World Cup finals from the third stage of Asian qualifying.

They could, however, still get through to a fourth stage if they can leapfrog Bahrain, who are above them on goal difference, and Indonesia, who stand three points ahead, after the final round of qualifiers.

Real did not provide a timeline for the player's return, but Spanish media reported the Brazil international could be sidelined for at least two months, forcing him out of the Club World Cup in the United States.

"Following tests carried out today on our player Endrick by Real Madrid's medical services, he has been diagnosed with an injury to the hamstring tendon in his right leg. He will be monitored closely," Real said in a statement.

The 18-year-old will also miss Brazil's upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay.

Endrick adds to Real's growing injury list, which already includes Vinicius Junior, Lucas Vazquez, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Eduardo Camavinga, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy and David Alaba.

Real host Real Sociedad in their final LaLiga game of the season on Saturday before kicking off their Club World Cup campaign against Al Hilal next month.

RENTON — Frustration is building among MLS players expected to participate in the FIFA men's Club World Cup in June due to the league not responding to requests to negotiate how participation money is divided.

Soccer's governing body announced in March the tournament will have a record $1 billion prize pot. FIFA included a tiered system for how the money would be distributed — with the Sounders, Inter Miami CF and possibly Los Angeles FC, if they win a play-in match against Club América, receiving a $9.55 million payday for participating as part of the CONCACAF clubs.

FIFA was clear the money is to entice players and clubs to treat the debut of the tournament's new 32-team format seriously. But MLS, according to the Players Association, isn't reflecting that mission.

Under the league's current collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in 2021, the CWC falls under a clause for “performance and/or participation in a compulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament.” That stipulates a collective $1 million cap for players, which in the case of the initial CWC earnings would be an approximate 90-10 split.

“There's no incentive for us to play, really, if you're talking about 90-10 for performance bonuses,” Sounders keeper Stefan Frei said Wednesday. “I don't think that's what FIFA had intended. They're worried about the players being fairly compensated for the extra workload. We feel the same way. We're not arguing about more money coming in for bonuses at all, just divvied up accordingly.”

The league didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Union leadership for the clubs held virtual meetings the past month to educate their teammates and strategize. Midfielder Cristian Roldan, defender Jackson Ragen and keeper Andrew Thomas are representing the Sounders.

MLS has revisited CBA issues in the past and may seek the MLSPA's approval for a change in their competition schedule. But for the unprecedented CWC windfall, the league hasn't even considered budging, as of Wednesday.

And the discrepancy could grow if one of the MLS clubs is successful.

The CWC format consists of three pool matches where the top two finishers will advance to the knockout stages. Clubs earn $2 million for wins and $1 million for draws. Teams that advance out of the group stage receive another $7.5 million. The tournament finale is slated for July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. where the runner-up gets $30 million, and the champion earns $40 million.

Seattle opens play against reigning Copa Libertadores champion Botafogo on June 15 at Lumen Field. The Sounders will host Spanish power Atlético Madrid on June 19 and France's Paris Saint-Germain on June 23. PSG is playing Italy's Inter Milan for its first UEFA Champions League title on May 31.

Botafogo will receive a $15.21 million participation payout. Atlético and PSG are part of 12 European clubs that will be paid between $12.81 to $38.19 million based on sporting and commercial rankings, according to FIFA.

The only criteria FIFA made regarding the purse is owners can't pocket the earnings.  

“To potentially be playing for essentially pennies could be frustrating,” Roldan said Wednesday. “We are engaging more than they (MLS) are and that's a bit frustrating because we want to resolve it together. That's at the end of the day what players are fighting for. There are no terms on the actual Club World Cup, so we want to create those terms.”

Ragen was part of training Wednesday and remains on track to be available to play Saturday when the Sounders (5-4-5) host FC Dallas (4-5-4) at Lumen. He suffered a hamstring injury in a road win against Dallas on April 12.

“I've got a smile on my face because he looked sharp,” Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer said of the session. “But he's got to pass some tests, so we'll see.”

João Paulo was also part of training after suffering from a bout of food poisoning last week. But Schmetzer said the midfielder not being part of the gameday roster for the draw against Portland was mainly a “coach's decision.”

“He put in heavy minutes, and he worked his butt off against LAFC,” Schmetzer said of the 4-0 road loss last week.

Xfinity announced Wednesday it will carry MLS's “Sunday Night Soccer” beginning this weekend with a matchup between Atlanta and FC Cincinnati. The Sounders match against Minnesota on June 1 is also part of the free offer for Xfinity customers.

The weekly matches are available on Xfinity X1 and the Xfinity Stream app throughout the duration of the season. Customers can also say “MLS” into their voice remote to start watching. No additional subscriptions are required.

FIFA World Cup 26 arrives in Kansas City in less than 13 months, but KC2026's push to get businesses in the region ready is well underway.

“With this big event coming to the city, it has a chance to put Kansas City on a map worldwide — not only for all sports, but also for our business community,” Joe Burger, the executive director of the Kansas State Youth Soccer Association, said.

Burger served as the emcee for an Olathe Chamber of Commerce Business Luncheon focused on World Cup readiness Wednesday at the Ball Events Center in south Olathe.

Dozens of Olathe business owners heard a panel discussion with two KC2026 representatives, Director of Regional Impact Tracy Whelpley and Director of Volunteer Operations Lori Thomas, and Johnson County Transit Director Josh Powers about how to get ready for the region to welcome a 650,000 visitors who will spend $650 million, according to VisitKC projections.

“We're talking about 40 days from the start of the tournament to the end of the tournament,” Whelpley said. “Then, if we have base camps, we have teams and their fans and support systems that will be coming to the region potentially as early as two weeks before that. ... We're talking about six different major events that are almost on the scale of a Super Bowl.”

That's why Whelpley is touring the region, meeting with business groups to ensure Kansas City's entrepreneurs are ready to meet the moment.

More than 1,400 regional businesses already have filled out the KC2026 Business Interest form, an online tool that will help keep businesses in the loop about World Cup-connected business opportunities.

“We've talked to a lot of organizations — ESOs (entrepreneur-support organizations), chambers — that regularly work with small businesses to advise us on how we should be counseling them,” Whelpley said. “What they told us was, ‘This is an unprecedented event of a scale of magnitude that we haven't seen. ... We have these relationships already. We know how to work with small businesses and how to advise them. We have great tools. What we need are those World Cup-specific information and trainings that help them contextualize this opportunity, that help them understand more about the people that will be coming to visit here, and how to best serve and welcome them.'”

Part of KC2026's mission is to make sure the entire region — especially restaurants, hotels, attractions and retail shops — benefits from the World Cup.

“It took a regional effort to attract the World Cup to Kansas City — a bi-state effort,” Whelpley said. “Kansas, Missouri, and all of the counties and municipalities that make up the region had to pull together to attract it, so we want to make sure that the benefits go across the region as well.”

That didn't happen with the 2023 NFL Draft, which proved to be a fairly insular event. People who came to Kansas City tended to stay within the footprint setup by the league, but the World Cup promises to be different.

“I think what's coming is on a world scale we haven't seen yet,” Burger said. “But I think once we understand what's actually coming and we prepare the business, it'll help them flourish.”

Visitors will arrive earlier, stay longer and spend more time in the local communities.

“You mentioned the NFL Draft, and it's something that we're very aware of — that there was a level of disappointment amongst some business owners,” Whelpley said. “We want to make sure that we're communicating and helping to build expectations appropriately. ... We had to show that we have 55,000 hotel rooms within a two-and-a-half hour radius of Kansas City, so that should give you an idea of the kind of distribution of visitors and how they'll be out and about — not just sequestered to one small, two-block footprint.”

Novak Djokovic celebrated his 38th birthday with some hard-fought revenge on Thursday at the Gonet Geneva Open.

The second seed held firm for a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Matteo Arnaldi to reach the semi-finals at the clay ATP 250 event for the second consecutive year. Djokovic, who fell to Arnaldi at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid last month, reeled off five straight games from 1-4 in the second set to seal a one-hour, 40-minute victory.

“It's great to be in the semi-finals again,” said Djokovic, who was defeated by Tomas Machac at that stage last year. “Hopefully this year I can go at least a step further, that's the goal. I think I'm playing really good tennis. A straight-sets win, but it was much closer than the score indicates. I was 4-1 down in the second, but somehow I didn't lose a game.

“I found the optimal state and balance, mentally and emotionally, to be able to play my best tennis when it was most needed. Hopefully I can carry that into tomorrow.”



Djokovic is now within two victories of claiming his 100th tour-level trophy, with which he would join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to hit the triple-digit mark in the Open Era.

There were audible gasps when Djokovic held his right knee in pain after stretching for a forehand in the fifth game of the second set. Yet the former World No. 1, who underwent surgery on that knee last year, moved well to disrupt the Italian's rhythm, letting out a mighty roar when he broke for 5-4 before serving out the clash with ease.

After levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Arnaldi at 1-1, Djokovic awaits fifth seed Alexei Popyrin or qualifier Cameron Norrie.

In the other half of the draw, Hubert Hurkacz continued his strong run of form by dismissing top seed Taylor Fritz 6-3, 7-6(5) in a high-quality serving battle. The Pole dropped just six of 45 first-serve points and saved all three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to his 22nd tour-level semi-final.

Hurkacz, who reached the quarter-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome last week, triumphed at the last clay-court ATP 250 he played in Estoril last year. He trailed 1/3 in the second-set tie-break against Fritz, but responded with an ace down the middle at 5/5 before converting his only match point.

“Thank you all for being out here, it's maybe not the best weather in Geneva but we appreciate the support,” Hurkacz said to the crowd. “[I hope] that you are enjoying tennis here as [much as] I am.”







Hurkacz will next face qualifier Sebastian Ofner, who rallied past fourth seed Karen Khachanov 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. Ofner, the No. 128 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will aim to advance to his second final after reaching the championship match at the grass-court ATP 250 in Mallorca last year.

The French Open has come around extremely quickly, with the world's top players set to do battle in the second Grand Slam of the year. 

Jannik Sinner reigned supreme at the first one back in January when he retained the Australian Open crown that he collected for the first time the previous year. 

Players are currently completing their preparation ahead of the tournament starting on Sunday, with the players discovering today who they will face in the opening match. 

As with any big sporting event, the world will be hoping and praying to see some early shocks and we look at three seeds who could be in danger of an early exit after the draw was made. 

It sounds crazy to suggest that the world number three might be in danger of an early exit at a tournament that he's reached the final of, but Alexander Zverev really is like a box of chocolates at the moment. 

Right now, it's impossible to know what you're going to get next from Zverev. He was moaning about the balls at the Italian Open, and after entering the Hamburg Open for some match practice, he was dumped out in the second round by Alexandre Muller. 

Zverev comes up against Learner Tien in the opening round, and the American has already made waves this year, coming through qualifying at the Australian Open and knocking out Daniil Medvedev in the second round of the Melbourne-based tournament. 

The Polish performer knows all about causing shocks in tennis, following his exploits at Wimbledon in 2021 when he defeated Roger Federer in his final appearance at the All England club. 

Hurkacz hasn't had a glowing start to 2025, though, and drawing Joao Fonseca is a bit of a nightmare for the player who would have loved nothing more than a few straightforward rounds to try and progress in the tournament. 

It's also important to add into the mix that clay is far from Hurkacz's favourite surface and Fonseca might even start their first round match as the favourite to progress to round two. 

It's worth mentioning here that Tsitsipas is usually solid on this surface and in 2021, he reached the final and looked on course to claim a first Grand Slam title. 

Much like Zverev, however, you just never know what is going to happen when Tsitsipas steps onto the court and his form has once again been somewhat sporadic this year. 

He was dumped out in the first round of the Australian Open in January and in France, he will come up against tricky Argentine performer Tomas Martin Echeverry in the first round, which should provide him with a stern test.

Madison Keys will be looking to add to her Australian Open title at the upcoming French Open.

Keys won her first major title in January, enabling her to return to the top 10 in the WTA rankings.

The American has not been able to add to her trophy haul since then, with Keys having mixed results on clay in Madrid and Rome.

However, her coach has made a claim that suggests Keys could be a threat at the French Open this year.

Many would consider clay to be Keys' worst surface, especially given that she has won more titles on hard and grass courts.

However, Keys' coach and husband Bjorn Fratangelo believes that it is actually her best surface, as he explained to rolandgarros.com how it enables her to utilise her strengths. 

“I think it's her best surface to be honest with you,” said Fratangelo. “I think it gives her time to set up a little bit more her forehand. She has a big swing, it takes time for her to produce the shot and I think this surface gives her a little extra second to think and get set with her feet.

“And then also, you know her ball speed is so big that I think [despite] the slow conditions she can still hit through them. I think she's gonna get a little bit extra on the ball, obviously with the new frame and stuff.”

Keys previously claimed grass was her favourite surface, but did agree with Fratangelo's comments about giving her extra time to set up her shots.

“I definitely think that clay can help a lot of aspects of my game,” said Keys. “I think the biggest thing is actually buying it, and believing what he's saying makes any sort of sense.

“But yeah, I feel pretty comfortable moving on it, and I think the little bit of extra time that it gives me lets me set up for my forehand a little bit more. So I definitely think that he might be on to something.”

Keys has won two WTA clay court titles in her career, with her most recent coming at the tournament in Strasbourg last year.

With the French Open on the horizon, Keys will be looking to continue her Grand Slam winning streak.

The 30-year-old has made runs in Paris before, reaching the semi-finals at the 2018 tournament.

However, in recent years Keys has struggled to replicate that and last year lost in the third round to compatriot Emma Navarro.

Keys will face a qualifier in her first round match at the French Open this year, with a potential second round match against Katie Boulter.

The main draw of the 2025 French Open will get underway on Sunday, May 25.

Swiatek's drop to No. 5 made her a dangerous floater for the top seeds.ByDavid KanePublished May 22, 2025 copy_link

Published May 22, 2025

The 2025 Roland Garros women's draw is set and full of intriguing match-ups, with top seed Aryna Sabalenka and defending champion Iga Swiatek both landing in a stacked top half.Sabalenka was guaranteed to lead the draw as the WTA No. 1, but Swiatek's recent drop from No. 2 to No. 5 made her placement a mystery leading up to Thursday's draw ceremony. The former No. 1 and three-time defending champion could have faced Sabalenka as early as the quarterfinals, but Swiatek instead landed in the second quarter anchored by newly-minted No. 4 seed Jasmine Paolini.MEN'S DRAW: Sinner, Draper, Djokovic headline top halfPaolini is fresh off a WTA 1000 tournament victory at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the run bumping Swiatek out of the Top 4 following her third-round loss to Danielle Collins at the Foro Italico. Paolini will open against Yuan Yue, while Swiatek will play her first-rounder against Rebecca Sramkova—with a potential second round against resurgent 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.

Sabalenka's quarter provides a projected Rome rematch against Zheng Qinwen, who scored her first meeting over the world No. 1 in seven tries. Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals and semifinals of her last two Roland Garros appearances and will play her first match against Kamila Rakhimova. Zheng gets a tough path starting with 2021 Roland Garros finalist Anastasia Pavluyuchenkova, and she could face rising star Alexandra Eala in the second round.Eala has been one of the biggest stories of the 2025 season, the Filipina teenager storming into the Miami Open semifinals with wins over Australian Open Madison Keys and Swiatek, ultimately pushing eventual finalist Jessica Pegula through three tough sets. Eala will make her Roland Garros debut against Emiliana Arango.In the bottom half of the draw, former No. 1 Naomi Osaka gets a popcorn first-rounder against No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, who missed most of the clay-court swing due to injury. Osaka held match point against eventual champion Swiatek at last year's tournament and is coming off a fourth-round finish in Rome.

Sabalenka and Swiatek are yet to face off in 2025, Sabalenka arriving in Paris with two WTA 1000 victories in Miami and Madrid. Swiatek has not reached a final of any tournament since winning Roland Garros last June.

Osaka and Badosa are in the same quarter as 2024 semifinalist Mirra Andreeva, who will open against Cristina Buçsa, and No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula, who opens against Anca Todoni.Americans Coco Gauff and Madison Keys headline the bottom quarter, No. 2-seeded Gauff looking to build on back-to-back WTA 1000 finals in Madrid and Rome with a first-rounder against Australia's Olivia Gadecki. Keys, seeded seventh, is playing her first major tournament as a Grand Slam champion, having opened the season with an Australian Open victory over Sabalenka. She will face a qualifier in her first round.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Danielle Collins has shown her fiery side once again after blowing up at a cameraman at the Strasbourg Open.

Up against Brit Emma Raducanu, Collins was leading 4-6, 6-1, 4-3 as both players took a break.

With the camera focused on her from behind the umpire's stand, Collins spoke to the camera operator, pointing for him to move to the side so she could fill her water bottle.

Instead of moving onto the tennis court, the cameraman stepped back, much to the disapproval of Collins.

"No, no, no, I need to get water. We're in a changeover, you don't need to be that close to me and you don't need to be on top of Emma," she said.

"It's like widely inappropriate," she continued, looking up to the umpire.

"It's not that difficult to give space."

Collins then looked at Raducanu and said sorry.

Raducanu was noticeably standing right next to the camera.

As she approached the court, Collins said to the umpire "you need to get that man out of here".

Collins managed to finish off the set 6-3 to win the match.

The American caused a stir at the Australian Open when she engaged in a tit-for-tat with the Aussie fans.

While playing Destanee Aiava she told the crowd to "shut up" when there was an interruption and then produced one of the more memorable showboats when she won.

The headline of the Roland Garros draw Thursday was that Novak Djokovic is in Alexander Zverev's quarter and on Jannik Sinner's half. But there were plenty of other takeaways, including a number of tantalising first-round matches.

ATPTour.com looks at five first-round matches to watch in the first round of the clay-court major.

(2) Carlos Alcaraz vs. Kei Nishikori - First Meeting
Nishikori has spoken several times about his interest in playing the rising stars who have ascended to the top of the sport, including Alcaraz and Sinner.

“It's forced me to adjust my game, change how I play to stay competitive,” Nishikori said in Madrid. “And that challenge has been good motivation.”

The Japanese superstar will get his wish in Paris, where he will take on Alcaraz in the first round. It will be the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

The 35-year-old former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings is still one of the purest ball-strikers on the ATP Tour, but he will have his work cut out for him against Alcaraz. The defending champion is high on confidence after winning titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome, and will try to remove the Japanese from his dominating comfort zone.



(3) Alexander Zverev vs. Learner Tien - Tien 1-0
In Acapulco earlier this year, Tien earned the best win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against then-World No. 2 Zverev, stunning the German 6-3, 6-4.

"I just went out there and tried to control my side of the court," Tien said.

Will the #NextGenATP American be able to replicate his feat in the best-of-five-set format? It will be a tough task against Zverev, who has advanced to at least the semi-finals on the Parisian clay in his past four appearances.

Last year's Roland Garros finalist lost to Alexandre Muller in the second round in Hamburg, but has not lost before the fourth round at the clay-court major since 2017 (R128). Another key to the match is Tien's relative inexperience on clay.

The Californian has never competed at Roland Garros as a professional. Two years ago, the lefty made the semi-finals in the boys' singles event, defeating Joao Fonseca in the quarter-finals.

 

(13) Ben Shelton vs. Lorenzo Sonego - Shelton leads 2-1
In the first major of the year, Shelton and Sonego met in the quarter-finals, with the American claiming a fourth-set tie-break to make the last four. One of them will suffer a disappointing first-round exit in Paris.

Shelton leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1, but his defeat came two years ago at Roland Garros. Sonego was victorious on that occasion 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.

The big question: How much Shelton has improved on clay since then? The lefty has one of the world's biggest serves and is able to use pace, spin and placement to beat his opponents. The results show he has grown more comfortable on clay, lifting the trophy last year in Houston, and this season making the final in Munich.

Sonego will bring a steady game and make Shelton work for every point. It will be up to the American to seize the victory.

(30) Hubert Hurkacz vs. Joao Fonseca - First Meeting
Hurkacz and Fonseca will open their Lexus ATP Head2Head series in one of the most interesting first-round clashes at Roland Garros.

One of the stories of the year has been the rise of Fonseca, last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion. The Brazilian stunned Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires. His dynamic play has captivated countless fans around the world. However, he enters the clay-court major on a three-match losing streak.

Former World No. 6 Hurkacz entered Rome with a 7-8 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But with coach Nicolas Massu on his side and a run to the quarter-finals at the Foro Italico, the Polish star appears to be rounding into form.

Hurkacz is one of the biggest servers of his era and can take the racquet out of his opponent's hand. Will Fonseca be able to work his way into enough rallies to bring his jaw-dropping shotmaking into play? 

(11) Daniil Medvedev vs. Cameron Norrie - Medvedev leads 4-0
Both Medvedev and Norrie have been inside the world's Top 10, but only one will advance to the second round in Paris.

Medvedev leads Norrie 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and has never lost a set to the Briton. Just two weeks ago in Rome, Medvedev defeated Norrie 6-4, 6-2. And despite his many jokes over the years about his feelings regarding clay, the former World No. 1 has advanced to at least the fourth round in three of his past four Roland Garros appearances.

But Norrie has long been one of the best competitors on the ATP Tour and the World No. 90 will be hungry to make a statement and show fans that he still belongs near the top of the sport.

The world of tennis was hit by shockwaves when an organised gambling syndicate suspected of fixing hundreds of matches and paying off around 180 players from around Europe was uncovered in January 2019.

Grigor Sargsyan, a 28-year-old Armenian man known as 'the Maestro', was thought to be the ringleader of a massive match-fixing scheme, organised via encrypted messaging, involving dozens of low-ranked players in small tournaments with little prize money.

“The impression we're getting is that it is very commonplace,” one official told The Associated Press as up to 180 players were suspected of having worked with the syndicate, fixing matches, sets or games in exchange for payments of 500 to 3,000 euros ($570 to $3,400).

Chris Kronow Rasmussen, Associate Professor of Sports Betting Integrity at the University of New Haven, told Flashscore that we have probably only scratched the surface when it comes to uncovering the scale of match-fixing for players ranked below 200 in the world.

“It is, of course, difficult to say how big the problem is, but I think we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. 

"The Sargsyan case gives an indication of how big the problem can actually be. He had about 180 players in his portfolio, and there are probably about 1500 players in the world rankings, so that adds up to a very high percentage of potentially fixed matches”, said Kronow Rasmussen.

Kronow underlines that WTA, ATP and ITF are partly responsible for having created the problem around match-fixing because prize money for many lower-ranked players doesn't even begin to cover the massive expenses for coaching, training, food, travel and accommodation.

“For players ranked from No. 200 to No. 1000 in the world, there is a better incentive to lose matches on purpose and fix matches than to do their best to win matches. 

"You should scrap all the tournaments where the prize money is less than $50,000 because financially it is not worth it for the players to participate, even if they end up winning the tournament, and that is a grotesque situation. It's really a big mess”, says Kronow Rasmussen.

Every tournament has a set amount of prize money, which varies dramatically depending on the type of event and while a ticket for the first round of a Grand Slam tournament (players who make it to the first round of Wimbledon's main singles draw take home £60,000) can cover all expenses for a whole year, paychecks and ranking points available continue to decrease for lower levels of tournaments.

As such, the range of pay on the ITF Women's Tour ranges from $50 (first round of qualifying at a W25) to $15,239 for a winner at a W100 tournament.

Jamie Loeb, who is currently ranked 305 on the women's WTA Tour, also says that prize money distinctions are often misleading.

"People think if you win a $25,000 tournament, that's what you get, but I'm like, 'The joke is on you'. That amount is split up amongst everybody, plus taxes, plus expenses, so most of the time you're losing money at those tournaments, even if you win”, said Loeb to ESPN.

With financial insecurity constantly hovering like a black cloud over the lives of young tennis players struggling to make ends meet, it is not surprising that some players are tempted to cut corners if they are asked to fix matches by shady businessmen, according to Frederik Lochte Nielsen, former winner of the Wimbledon doubles tournament and current Danish Davis Cup captain.

“There is no doubt that, when you have a system that is organised like it is today, where people play for peanuts and someone comes and asks if you want $10,000 to lose the first set, then there are many who are tempted, which you can also see because there are many who get caught,” Lochte Nielsen tells Flashscore.

“Tennis is an incredibly attractive sport to bet on because there are matches all year round and you make bets per point, so I think that will always be a huge problem”, adds Lochte Nielsen who has previously admitted that he was offered money to lose on purpose but immediately chose to turn it down.

The Tennis Integrity Unit was set up in 2008 to combat match-fixing in tennis but was subsequently replaced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency in 2020. It had the ability to impose fines and sanctions, and ban players, umpires, and other tennis officials from participating in tournaments. Still, there is evidence that the system was far from effective, as a report in 2018 uncovered a "tsunami of corruption in lower-level tennis."

The report pointed out that lower-level tennis had turned into a fertile breeding ground for match-fixing due to the number of players struggling to make a living, few people watching the matches in person, and the ITF's decision to sell official live scoring data in 2012. Seven years later, nothing has changed, says Kronow Rasmussen.

"A number of organisations pat themselves on the back, when they find a tennis player who has cheated, but they usually never find the perpetrators and it would be better if athletes were trained not to accept money, or prize money was offered at a size that enabled players to live a decent life," adds Kronow Rasmussen, who underlines that he doesn't think any tennis player enjoys cheating.

"I think 70% of tennis players do it out of necessity rather than because they think it's fun to cheat. Nobody thinks it's cool to lose on purpose.

"But if you get 5000 euros, you might look through it because the family needs to have food on the table," concludes Kronow Rasmussen.

She's blue, ba da bee! Serena Williams cut a cool figure in royal blue at Wembley Stadium over the weekend at the women's FA Cup final, celebrating her family's new investment in women's sports.Williams' Sunday outing, with her husband Alexis Ohanian and first-born daughter Olympia, 7, came at the grand finale of the 55th staging of the Women's FA Cup—a knockout cup competition for women's football teams in England—and days after Ohanian announced that he would be joining the English soccer club as an investor."I've bet big on women's sports before—and I'm doing it again," Ohanian wrote on social media. "I'm proud to announce that I'm joining [Chelsea F.C. Women] as an investor and board member. I'm honored for the chance to help this iconic club become America's favorite [Women's Super League] team and much, much more."The new shareholders had something bigger to toast by the time the game ended: Chelsea defeated Manchester United by a 3-0 final score in front of a crowd of nearly 75,000, completing an unbeaten domestic treble for the season. They had already clinched a sixth consecutive league title and defeated Manchester City to lift the League Cup before capturing the FA Cup.

Despite her family's investment in the winners, Williams later confessed that "any color goes" for her loyalties to female athletes and women's sports—a mantra that was on show when she eagerly received Manchester United goalkeeper and U.S. national team member Phallon Tullis-Joyce, 28, who was overcome with emotion when meeting the former world No. 1.Read more: Serena Williams joins ownership group of Toronto Tempo WNBA team

According to ABC, Ohanian purchased a 10% stake for about 20 million pounds, or $26.5 million. Since retiring from tennis, Williams' and her family's investment portfolio has grown exponentially through sports. They were part of the founding ownership group of Angel City FC in the National Women's Soccer League in the U.S., and in March, the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion was announced as a minority owner of the Toronto WNBA team, which will begin play next year.A month later, Williams talked up the value of women's sports to NFL owners alongside basketball player Caitlin Clark, admitting that she would also be interested in investing in a potential flag football team.

Boris Becker revealed he is “lost for words” that Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray's coaching partnership has ended after just six months. 

Djokovic hired great rival Murray as his coach at the back end of last year, with the pair working together at the Australian Open in January, where the Serb beat Carlos Alcaraz and reached the semi-finals before withdrawing due to injury. 

Yet Djokovic's results have nosedived since, with just one final appearance in Miami, and he lost his first matches on the clay of Monte Carlo and Madrid. As such, last week, the pair jointly announced that they have gone their separate ways, with Djokovic adding this week he “couldn't get more” out of the partnership. 

But three-time Wimbledon champion Becker, who coached Djokovic between 2013-2016, believed the pair would continue working together until at least The Championships, which start on 30 June. 

“I'm a little bit surprised that they would end their working relationship just a week before Roland-Garros,” Becker told The Independent, ahead of the French Open beginning this Sunday. 

“I thought Melbourne was a big success. I was happy to see Andy back in action in Novak's corner. I really wanted to see them both at Wimbledon, actually. 

“Andy knows a thing or two about winning Wimbledon, he's very popular there. I thought it would be an advantage for Novak to have Andy in his corner. 

“I'm a little bit lost for words [as to] why they've broken up just before the second grand slam.” 

Djokovic, who turned 38 on Thursday, is a seven-time winner at Wimbledon but has lost in the final to Carlos Alcaraz in the last two years, while Murray won the tournament in 2013 and 2016. 

Becker, who will feature on TNT Sports's coverage of Roland-Garros, coached Djokovic to Wimbledon titles in 2014 and 2015, and the German, 57, said he considers the 24-time grand slam champion like a “younger brother”.

Asked further what went wrong with the Djokovic-Murray partnership, Becker replied: “I thought it was always about the grand slams and I thought the campaign in Melbourne went very well. 

“I don't know the reasons. Novak is a smart guy – he knows what he's doing. I definitely thought this relationship would go at least until Wimbledon, but I was wrong. 

“But you should never underestimate Novak Djokovic, he's always a very fierce competitor, he always has something up his sleeve. 

“Novak Djokovic knows pretty much everything about tennis. So, who can he talk to that knows more? 

“The challenge is for Novak to find someone that he has respect [for], who he can learn something from.

“That's very difficult because he's so good and knowledgeable, he's done everything there is to do in tennis and that's the difficulty he has.”

Djokovic, now the world No 6, is eyeing a record-breaking 25th grand slam on the clay courts of Roland-Garros over the next fortnight, the same venue where he won his last tournament – gold at the Paris Olympics – last summer. 

“I think he has tennis left in him, but he has to be realistic,” Becker added, regarding Djokovic's future in the sport. 

“He's not getting any younger, he cannot play forever. Those are the facts. You have to deal with reality and start to think about how much longer you have to play. That would be a wise thing to do.” 

The Serb won his first match on clay this year at the Geneva Open on Wednesday, beating Marton Fucsovics in straight sets. He faces Matteo Arnaldi in the quarter-finals on Thursday.

Heading into Thursday's draw for the French Open, there was only one huge storyline: Where would Iga Swiatek, the women's champion four of the last five years, end up? 

Due to a recent dip in form, Swiatek shockingly fell to the No. 5 seed, meaning one of the top four seeds would have to face the most accomplished clay courter of their generation in the quarterfinals. 

The loser of that random drawing?  Jasmine Paolini, who lost to Swiatek in last year's final and comes to Roland Garros in top form, having just won the Italian Open in her home country. 

The big winner? Coco Gauff.

Gauff, the No. 2 seeded American still seeking a second Grand Slam title after winning the 2023 US Open, will begin this year's French as a pretty solid favorite to make the final given how the draw shook out. 

Not only would Gauff dodge Swiatek until at least the final, pretty much all of the other prime contenders for the title ended up in the top half of the draw with No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka. 

Gauff, who recently lost in the finals of Rome (to Paolini) and Madrid (to Sabalenka), even avoided tricky opponents in the early rounds – at least on paper. Her potential third-round opponent, No. 30 Anna Kalinskaya, has never advanced beyond the second round in Paris. In the fourth round, she would be projected to face former Roland Garros winner Barbora Krejcikova, who is coming off a back injury and hasn't played an official match this year. 

In the quarterfinals, Gauff would potentially play No. 7 Madison Keys, who started the year hot with the Australian Open title but has cooled down considerably over the last couple months. And Gauff's most likely semifinal opponents would be No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, whom she's beaten twice in routine fashion on clay recently, or No. 3 seeded American Jessica Pegula, who is much more comfortable on hard court than the French surface. 

Meanwhile, if Sabalenka is going to make the final, she must deal with several stumbling blocks including potentially a quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, who won the Olympics last year at Roland Garros, and whoever emerges from the Paolini/Swiatek quarter. Of course, Swiatek may not even get there because she is potentially lined up for a round of 16 match with Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, whom she has never beaten in six matches. 

Here are the four other key observations from the French Open draw.

And Gauff's most likely semifinal opponents would be No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, whom she's beaten twice in routine fashion on clay recently, or No. 3 seeded American Jessica Pegula, who is much more comfortable on hard court than the French surface. 

Meanwhile, if Sabalenka is going to make the final, she must deal with several stumbling blocks including potentially a quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, who won the Olympics last year at Roland Garros, and whoever emerges from the Paolini/Swiatek quarter. Of course, Swiatek may not even get there because she is potentially lined up for a round of 16 match with Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, whom she has never beaten in six matches. 

Here are the four other key observations from the French Open draw.

Emma Raducanu could face world No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open if the two players win their respective opening matches.

Raducanu will play Xinyu Wang in the first round, while defending champion Swiatek faces Rebecca Šramková.

The 2021 US Open champion has never beaten Swiatek in her career. Raducanu was thrashed 6-0, 6-1 when the pair last met in the third round of the Australian Open in January.

Raducanu suffered an injury scare just four days before the French Open in a three-set defeat to Danielle Collins on Wednesday.

Fellow Brit Katie Boulter could face a challenging second-round match of her own. The British No. 1 is scheduled to play Madison Keys if she beats a qualifier.

As far as other British interest goes, Sonay Kartal will play Erika Andreeva in the opening round, while Jodie Burrage has a meeting with America's Collins.

Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembélé helped conduct the draw in the French capital.

On the men's side of the draw, Jack Draper has been drawn in the same quarter as world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. The pair would meet in the quarterfinal if they both progress through the competition.

Draper will start against Sinner's compatriot Mattia Bellucci.

Jacob Fearnley, who is playing in the French Open for the fist time in his career will play 40-year-old former French Open champion Stan Wawrinka in the first round.

Cameron Norrie was also handed a tough draw. The Brit will have to get past Daniil Medvedev if he is to progress beyond the first round.

"I'm looking forward to competing on grass and am already preparing with my team. I'm very appreciative of the support I feel from you all and can't wait to be back out on the court."

The French Open has now arrived, with qualifying for the latest Grand Slam of 2025 currently underway.

Carlos Alcaraz has been backed to win the French Open, with the Spaniard having just won the Italian Open.

He defeated Jannik Sinner in the final in Rome, with the Italian having won the first Grand Slam of the season.

ATP number one Sinner won the Australian Open in January, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final in Melbourne.

Zverev also lost the 2024 French Open final, where he was defeated by Alcaraz, with the German having finished as runner-up in all three of his Grand Slam finals.

Another player who has experienced such Grand Slam heartache is Matteo Berrettini, who lost the 2021 Wimbledon final to Novak Djokovic.

And the Italian has now suffered more disappointment ahead of the French Open, having made the difficult decision to withdraw from the tournament.

Sharing an update on social media, Berrettini wrote on Instagram: “Ciao everyone, I unfortunately had to make the very difficult decision to withdraw from Roland Garros.

“I just ran out of time to feel 100% ready to compete at the level that is needed. I'm looking forward to competing on grass and am already preparing with my team. I'm very appreciative of the support I feel from you all and can't wait to be back out on the court.”

Berrettini enjoyed a superb run at the All England Club in 2021, which was ended only by legendary figure Djokovic.

The Serbian battled it out with the Italian on the London grass, where he came from behind to win 6-7(4-7), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3.

Djokovic is currently playing in Geneva to prepare for the French Open, having decided to skip the Italian Open.

World number 28 Berrettini did play at the Italian Open, but retired hurt during his round of 32 meeting with Casper Ruud.

The 29-year-old was the 29th seed on home soil in Rome, but called time against sixth seed Ruud while losing 5-7, 0-2.

The walkover came after Berrettini defeated Jacob Fearnley in his opener, having also lost his doubles opener alongside his brother Jacopo Berrettini.

Matteo Berrettini rose two spots in the latest ATP rankings, and currently has a 13-10 win-loss record for the season.

The Italian has won 10 times throughout his career, with three wins in 2024 – Kitzbuhel, Gstaad and Marrakech – having all arrived on clay.

Madison Keys: From Triumph to Turmoil – Will the Former Slam Champion Overcome Recent Struggles at Roland Garros?

Madison Keys, once basked in the glory of her Australian Open victory, is now facing a tumultuous journey filled with challenges and doubts as she gears up for the upcoming French Open at Roland Garros. The American tennis star soared to new heights by clinching her maiden Grand Slam title, but the aftermath of her triumph has proven to be more exhausting than she could have ever imagined.

After her historic win in Melbourne, Keys was forced to take a hiatus from the sport due to a leg injury, missing crucial tournaments in the Middle East before returning for the BNP Paribas Open. As she sets her sights on the clay courts of Roland Garros, the pressure mounts for the former World No. 1.

In a candid pre-event interview, Madison Keys opened up about the overwhelming nature of her post-Australian Open success, admitting, “winning the Australian Open was like the greatest but most exhausting thing that I have ever done in my career.” The newfound attention and scrutiny took a toll on the typically low-key player, who found herself grappling with the demands of her elevated status in the tennis world.

Despite her initial resurgence at the Indian Wells, where she reached the semifinals, Keys' form has been inconsistent in recent tournaments. Disappointing early exits at the Miami Open, Charleston, and Rome have raised concerns about her readiness for the challenges ahead in Paris. The American's struggles on clay courts further exacerbate doubts about her performance at Roland Garros.

As the French Open looms large, Madison Keys faces mounting expectations and a checkered history at the tournament. While she has shown flashes of brilliance in past editions, including semifinal and quarterfinal appearances, her recent track record suggests a potential uphill battle in Paris.

With critics questioning her ability to replicate past successes on the Roland Garros clay, all eyes are on Madison Keys as she seeks to overcome her recent setbacks and make a lasting impression at the upcoming Grand Slam event. Will the former slam champion rise to the occasion and silence her detractors, or will Roland Garros prove to be an insurmountable challenge for the American star? The tennis world awaits the answer with bated breath.

	BERLIN: If there is one tennis player who knows how to beat the odds when they are stacked against him, it is 24-times Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.
	The 38-year-old Serbian's bid for a fourth French Open crown looks more unlikely than in many years, with Djokovic struggling for form since his run to the Australian Open semifinals back in January before retiring injured.
	Since then Djokovic, who has 99 tour titles to his name and is in the twilight of a glorious career, has reached only one final and has not lifted a trophy this year.
	After two early losses in Monte Carlo and Madrid, it was clear that Djokovic's attempt to claim a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam could be his hardest yet.
	“(It is) kind of a new reality for me, I have to say, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament,” Djokovic said after his early Madrid exit.
	He was expected to jumpstart his clay campaign in Rome before returning to Paris, where he won Olympic gold last year, but he skipped the Italian Open without giving a reason.
	Instead he picked up a surprise wild card for the Geneva Open this week, in what looks like a last-ditch attempt to get some more matches on clay under his belt before Paris.
	News of the wild card came as Djokovic split with his coach Andy Murray after only a few months working together.
	Djokovic appointed fellow former world number one Murray ahead of this year's Australian Open and the Serb said at the Qatar Open in February that he would continue working with the Scot for an indefinite period.
	That time, however, ended abruptly last week with the Djokovic-Murray partnership yielding no titles and one losing final in Miami.
	Their partnership is now officially over as Djokovic heads toward the French Open in a cloud of uncertainty over his form and future.
	The world number six has struggled to assert his dominance after winning three out of the four Grand Slams in 2023.
	There is even more uncertainty over his chances of reaching the last major goal in his illustrious career: adding that elusive 25th record Grand Slam to his collection to move past Margaret Court on the all-time winners' list.


	DUBAI: The road to Rugby World Cup 2027 will culminate in Dubai, with the UAE city set to host the Final Qualification Tournament at The Sevens Stadium from Nov. 8-18, 2025.


	The event will decide the 24th and final team to secure a spot at the expanded global showpiece in Australia.


	Four teams will compete in a round-robin format across three match days, with the highest-ranked side at the end of the tournament booking their place at the World Cup. Belgium is the first nation confirmed for the Dubai qualifier, having finished fifth in the 2025 Rugby Europe Championship.


	The remaining three teams will emerge from ongoing regional qualification campaigns, including the Rugby Africa Cup, Asia Rugby Championship, Sudamerica Rugby Championship, and the Pacific Nations Cup. Representing four continents, the participants will highlight the global reach and growing competitiveness of the sport.


	World Rugby Chair Brett Robinson welcomed Dubai's selection as host of the final qualifier, describing the tournament as a pivotal point in the international rugby calendar.


	“The Final Qualification Tournament is always a thrilling, do-or-die moment in the build-up to Rugby World Cup — and it's fitting that we bring it to a world-class destination like Dubai,” Robinson said.


	He added: “As we head toward the most inclusive and globally representative tournament ever, with 24 teams competing in an expanded format and at least one nation from each of our regional associations, this final step on the ‘Journey to Australia 2027' will be a celebration of ambition, resilience and the global spirit of rugby. We cannot wait to see which team earns the final place and joins us for what promises to be a unique celebration of rugby and Australia in 2027.”


	The 2027 event in Australia will mark a new era for the sport. With 24 teams, a round of 16 stage, and a total of 52 matches, it will be the largest Rugby World Cup to date, aimed at increasing opportunities for emerging nations and enhancing the overall fan experience.


	For the first time in the professional era, the pool draw will take place with all 24 teams confirmed. Scheduled for December 2025, the draw will be based on the official World Rugby Men's Rankings at the close of the November international window, offering a more accurate and current reflection of team performance.


	All international fixtures in 2025 — excluding matches during the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia — will influence the rankings and, ultimately, the pool seedings. Every result could be decisive in shaping the composition of the six pools for Rugby World Cup 2027.


	As the global qualification process reaches its final chapter, all eyes will turn to Dubai this November. The tournament promises high-stakes rugby and a fitting finale to the long journey toward what is expected to be the most inclusive and competitive Rugby World Cup in history.


	In modern parlance, it is what techies would call a “disruptor,” to say the least.


	It will take a lot more, however, for sporting fans of earlier generations to get their heads around the concept of the Enhanced Games, which were officially announced on Wednesday and will take place next year in Las Vegas.


	Saudi Arabia's Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al-Saud, founder and CEO of KBW Ventures and chairman of the Kingdom's Sports For All Federation, is the region's first, and to date only, investor in the tournament that allows athletes to use performance-enhancing substances without being subjected to testing.


	Prince Khaled — nicknamed the “Tech Prince” for his investments in startups, among many other fields — is bullish about the potential of the Enhanced Games when asked if the sports world is ready for such a controversial step.


	“Look, I like to think of myself as a progressive investor, venture capital typically backs very nascent ideas,” he told Arab News.


	“You are always looking for the big idea, the society-changing concept. Then, you attempt to predict and really visualize how and where and when that big idea will prove relevant to the wider world.


	“As someone who is pretty involved in sports on both personal and business levels, I think there is a segment of the world who would like to push the limits of human potential,” Prince Khaled said.


	“How fast? How far? How long? All questions in sport that someone like me is curious about, and very eager to see. I want to see real-world application, and a competitive approach.”


	He accepts that this idea, with all the ethical points and counterpoints it evokes, might take a long time to be accepted in mainstream sports.


	“Is the world ready? The world wasn't ready for most fresh concepts. At the most basic level people weren't even ready for ride-hailing, now it is considered a must for many all over the world, he said.


	“So, whether it is transportation or AI or art or biotechnology or in this case, sport and biohacking, the world is usually not ready for things that have not been done before. That doesn't mean they should never be done.


	“Elite athletes who have never been granted the opportunity to experiment with body autonomy and enhancement exploration can now sign up if they so choose,” said Prince Khaled.


	“If you want to talk sports in specific, I also think the world wasn't ready for MMA, but it's now one of the biggest crowd draws out there.”


	The reaction from the sports community at large has, unsurprisingly, been a negative one.


	In February of last year, a joint statement issued by the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency condemning the games was supported by The International Fair Play Committee.


	“Well, it is voluntary, and it's like for like. The Games is for those who choose to enroll and compete with enhancements. It is ethical; the ethics rests in equality, safety and transparency.


	“There is a disclosure protocol, and everyone knows that everyone else is applying the same types of enhancements and experimenting with biohacking.


	“I don't think I have to justify investing in what I see as a form of competitive sport,” he added. “As long as everyone involved is aware, then it is fair and transparent.”


	Prince Khaled is known to be the Middle East North Africa face of venture capital, with investments across artificial intelligence, biotechnology, agricultural and food technology, as well as in the sports-adjacent sector, robotics and broadcast technologies.


	One of his biotechnology bets, Colossal Biosciences, recently made headlines with its reported $10.2 billion valuation.


	“I met the co-founder of Enhanced Games (Aron D'Souza) at a private conclave staged by FII (Future Investment Initiative) last year in Riyadh. This was my first exposure to the idea of the Enhanced Games.


	“It was a closed-door working group held to discuss democratizing access to healthy aging solutions. Some of the foremost figures were present; from stakeholders from the Saudi Health in All Policies committee, to scientists, to entrepreneurs and investors.”


	“I do think the Enhanced Games can play an important role here; how better to analyze the effects of enhancement than on elite athletes? People who are in the best possible shape physically that they can be naturally, and then build on that,” he said.


	“When your baseline is elite athlete level, then we can really see what biohacking and these enhancements can do.


	“I do think it is ethical, because there is no subjectivity and no varying board rules, and because it is upfront and clear about the idea that everyone is competing with their own approach to enhancement.”


	Certainly the games seem to appeal to athletes either coming to the end of their careers or ones for whom Olympic and international success remain out of reach. Established figures, including Australian swimming coach Brett Hawke, have backed the idea.


	At the age of 31, four-time Olympic Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev will take part in the Enhanced Games, having received a $1 million prize for breaking the long-standing 50-meter freestyle world record with a time of 20.89 seconds.


	“Being the first to break a world record at the Enhanced Games means a lot to me. I'm proud to lead the way,” said the athlete who specialized in sprint and butterfly events, and earned a silver in the 50-meter freestyle at the 2019 FINA World Aquatics Championship in South Korea.


	However, having not consistently been at the top of the sport, he sees these Games as an opportunity to make up for missed opportunities.


	“One year at the Enhanced Games could earn me more than six Olympic cycles combined,” Gkolomeev told Arab News. “I've never had this kind of support; doctors, nutritionists, therapists, all working to make me better.”


	Prince Khaled accepts that participation will depend entirely on the choices of the individual athletes and their particular circumstances.


	“There are athletes who are not going to want to join, and then there are those who will be the early adopters,” he said. “At launch, there is already a record-breaker, who just won a million dollars.


	“Is this going to make everyone rush to sign up? No, but this will definitely spark some honest and much-needed discussions about the irregularities between sporting rules and different governing bodies, and the allegations of unfair treatment levied against some athletes over others.”


	“Democratizing access to aging solutions is what first interested me in the Games, and then I began to think of the implications on sport.


	“I'm sure you know about the politics involved when deciding which athletes were accused of using enhancements, in several instances countries felt their athletes were unfairly targeted.


	“At the Enhanced Games, this political maneuvering is completely removed from the equation. I bet if you ask the athletes that felt they were wrongly maligned, they would be pretty quick to agree that politics played a role.”


	In its statement last year, the International Fair Play Committee said the Games “represent a potentially catastrophic healthcare risk” to the athletes.


	The Enhanced Games' website meanwhile promises medical vigilance and safe participation for the athletes. Critics will rightly question just where the line is drawn in terms of the use of performance-enhancing substances.


	“To my knowledge, there are two cohorts, one is enhanced with their own resources and medical guidance, and one cohort that is officially under the Enhanced Games,” said Prince Khaled.


	“For the second cohort, there is a full treatment protocol lined up for athletes.


	“They will definitely have better medical guidance and access to the latest in monitoring methodologies and technologies with the Enhanced Games than they have ever had in their professional sporting careers.”


	“Everyone knows one of the biggest barriers to elite athletics is cost,” he added. “The Enhanced Games is bringing the best medical and scientific protocols and giving the athletes access to that.


	“To bring this conversation full circle, this is something enabled by funding, and in venture capital, funding is, most of the time, allocated to groundbreaking entities and ideas.”


	Prince Khaled said he is a “cautious believer in biohacking” which is, simply stated, the optimization of nutrition to enhance energy, cognitive function, and overall health and well-being.


	“I think longevity medicine and healthspan and various other biotechnology sectors are burgeoning for a reason.


	“KBW Ventures is invested in biotechnology, health tech, medtech, and with the Enhanced Games, I consider it kind of an ultimate biohacking opportunity for elite athletes,” he said.


	“I expect that so much valuable scientific data on reversing biological age, and repair and so much more is going to come out of the Enhanced Games,” Prince Khaled added.


	“On a separate note, the athletes that participate in the Games have to undergo what is termed health testing, ensuring that they are fit to compete. They also need to disclose everything that they are using to enhance their performance.”


	At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the world of athletics was shaken to its core when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of the gold medal he had won with a world record time of 9.79 seconds.


	Author Richard Moore's “The Dirtiest Race in History” remains a seminal read on the events of Sept. 24, 1988. Since then, many other athletes have been banned from participating, or stripped of medals, for similar offences with increasingly less fanfare and shock.


	But is the world ready now to consign such considerations to history?


	The clock is now ticking toward the first Enhanced Game. It remains a tough, if not almost impossible sell, for a sporting community brought up on the concepts of fair play and the dangers of performance-enhancing drugs.


	Whether the world is ready for these Games, and how the future will judge these developments, remain open questions.


	Tyrese Haliburton was a bit premature after he mimicked Hall of Famer Reggie Miller's infamous “choke” sign at Madison Square Garden.
	Nevertheless, Haliburton and his Indiana Pacers teammates made certain the gesture didn't come back to haunt them in a 138-135 victory in overtime over the New York Knicks on Wednesday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
	Haliburton scored 31 points and Aaron Nesmith added 30, highlighting an 8-for-9 performance from 3-point range by making five treys during the final 3 1/2 minutes of regulation. That surge allowed the fourth-seeded Pacers to overcome a 14-point deficit in the final 2:39 of the fourth quarter.
	“It's unreal,” Nesmith said of his sizzling shooting. “It's probably the best feeling in the world for me. I love it when that basket feels like an ocean and anything you toss up, you feel like it's going to go in. It's so much fun.”
	Haliburton appeared to win it following a friendly carom off the rim on an apparent 3-pointer at the buzzer, only for replays to show that his toe was on the line. That made it a 2-pointer and forced overtime.
	When he thought the game was over, Haliburton made the choke sign in the direction of the Knicks' bench.
	“I thought it was a 3. I tried to hit the celly. It didn't work. But we finished it in overtime,” Haliburton said.
	Miller famously flashed the gesture toward Knicks superfan Spike Lee while leading a Pacers comeback in a playoff game in 1994.
	The third-seeded Knicks will look to bounce back in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series on Friday in New York.
	“In the playoffs, when you win it's the best thing ever. When you lose it's the worst thing ever,” said Knicks star Jalen Brunson, who finished with 43 points.
	“The best way to deal with all of that is to stay level-headed. Making sure we have each other's backs.”
	Pacers coach Rick Carlisle also kept it in perspective after the game.
	“It's a long series. We're not gonna get too excited about this,” he said. “We've got things to clean up. They've got things to clean up. Game 2's gonna be another war.”
	Andrew Nembhard sank a 3-pointer and two layups in OT, the last lay-in giving Indiana a 136-135 lead with 26.7 seconds to play. An attempted pass to Brunson deflected off his fingers and out of bounds, and former Knick Obi Toppin's dunk extended the advantage to three with 10.9 seconds left.
	Brunson and teammate Karl-Anthony Towns misfired on 3-point attempts in the final moments.
	Pascal Siakam scored 17 points, Nembhard finished with 15 and Myles Turner added 14 for the Pacers. Haliburton handed out 11 assists.
	Towns collected 35 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks.
	Towns sank 4 of 8 shots from 3-point range, a big improvement after he made just 3 of 19 attempts from beyond the arc in New York's six-game series victory over the Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals.
	Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby each scored 16 points in the loss.
	Brunson committed his fifth foul with 10:05 remaining in the fourth quarter and retreated to the bench after T.J. McConnell made a free throw to pull Indiana within 94-92.
	New York, however, went on a 14-0 run in Brunson's absence, with Anunoby draining a 3-pointer and a short jumper to ignite the spurt. The Pacers did themselves no favors by fouling Miles McBride and Towns on 3-point attempts, with the duo combining to make 5 of 6 free throws.
	“I feel like our intensity dropped,” said New York's Josh Hart, who amassed eight points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. “We started playing slower. Playing more into their hands.”


	Louisiana native Dustin Poirier is locked for a UFC BMF title fight in his home state to conclude his career, as New Orleans will host Poirier's battle with title-holder Max Holloway to highlight the July 19 card at the Smoothie King Center.
	This will be the third battle between the lightweight combatants, the 36-year-old Poirier, who hails from Lafayette, Louisiana, taking the first two contests.
	Both fighters are coming off losses in title fights, however. Poirier (30-9) submitted to Islam Makhachev last June, while the 33-year-old Holloway (26-8) lost in knockout fashion to Ilia Topuria in October.
	“For Dustin Poirier to be able to finish his remarkable UFC career in New Orleans is special,” UFC executive vice president Peter Dropick said in a news release. “Thank you to the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation, the Louisiana Office of Tourism, New Orleans & Company and Smoothie King Center for helping us make this happen.
	“It's been 10 years since we've held an event in New Orleans, we know the fans are ready for us to be back!“
	The Octagon will also play host to ranked middleweights No 10 Marvin Vettori (19-8-1) and No. 11 Brendan Allen (24-7), who will do battle for the first time in an official capacity at UFC 318.
	The two were slated to fight at UFC Vegas 90 last April, though Vettori pulled out. A few months later, the pair squared off (unofficially) in a brawl at a Florida casino.
	Their ranked billing remains hotly anticipated.
	The rest of the lineup includes newly announced fights between Kyler Phillips (12-3) and Vinicius Oliveira (22-3) at the bantamweight level, Jimmy Crute (12-4-2) facing Marcin Prachnio (17-8) in light heavyweight and Carli Judice (4-2) battling Nicolle Caliari (8-3) at women's fly.
Other fights include:
	--No. 7 Amanda Ribas vs. No. 10 Tabatha Ricci in strawweight
	--Neil Magny vs. Gunnar Nelson in welterweight
	--Adam Fuitt vs. Islam Dulatov in welterweight
	--Ikram Aliskerov vs. Brunno Ferreira in middleweight


	NEW YORK: The case for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was simple. He's the best player on an Oklahoma City Thunder team that had the best record this season and set a league mark for margin of victory. If that wasn't enough, he also won the scoring title.


	That's an MVP year.


	Gilgeous-Alexander was announced Wednesday as the NBA's Most Valuable Player, his first time winning the award. It's now seven straight years that a player born outside the US won MVP, extending the longest such streak in league history.


	And when it happened, Gilgeous-Alexander said a life of moments — getting cut, traded, overlooked, celebrating, the wins, the good times — all flooded into his mind.


	“I don't think there's enough emphasis on how much off the court influences on the court,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “And once I became better off the court my career started to skyrocket. It's no coincidence.”


	It ultimately was a two-person race. Gilgeous-Alexander got 71 first-place votes and 29 second-place votes; Denver's Nikola Jokic got the other 29 first-place votes and the other 71 second-place votes.


	Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, getting 88 of the 100 possible third-place votes.


	Gilgeous-Alexander — the No. 11 pick in the 2018 draft — averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game this season, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record. The Thunder outscored teams by 12.9 points per game, the biggest margin in league history.


	He becomes the second Canadian to win MVP; Steve Nash won it twice.


	“He set the foundation,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of Nash. “He was the first Canadian basketball player I knew of. And without seeing guys go to the NBA from Canada, it wouldn't have been as much of a dream as it was for us as kids growing up. So, to be in a conversation with a guy like that and what he has meant to not only basketball but to the country of Canada, it's special.”


	And Gilgeous-Alexander is the first guard to win MVP since James Harden in 2018.


	“His value is his confidence,” Oklahoma City's Kenrich Williams said of Gilgeous-Alexander, his Thunder teammate for the last five seasons. “His confidence that he has in himself and the confidence that he instills in every one of his teammates, including the coaches.”


	Jokic — a winner of three of the last four MVP awards — was second, despite a season for the ages. He averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game, the first center to average a triple-double and the first player since all those stats were tracked to finish in the NBA's top three in all three of those categories.


	It was the sixth instance of a player finishing a season averaging a triple-double — at least 10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds per game. Russell Westbrook did it four times and Oscar Robertson once, but only one of those triple-double seasons led to an MVP win.


	“He's a special player,” Jokic said of Gilgeous-Alexander earlier this week when the Thunder eliminated the Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. “His shot selection, his shot capability ... he's always there. He's a special player.”


	Antetokounmpo, who averaged 30.4 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, was third. He started this run of international players winning MVP; Antetokounmpo, of Greek and Nigerian descent, won in 2019 and 2020.


	Jokic, a Serbian, won in 2021, 2022 and 2024. And Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, who was born in Cameroon but since became a US citizen, won the award in 2023.


	Now, it's Gilgeous-Alexander — a son of Ontario, where hockey reigns — carrying the MVP flag. He was fifth in the voting two years ago, second behind Jokic last year, and used being so close to the award as fuel this season.


	“There are voters every year. That will never change,” Gilgeous-Alexander said on TNT during the broadcast when the results were revealed. “And last year, all it meant was that more people thought I shouldn't have won than should have won. This year I wanted to change the narrative and have it flipped. I think I did a good job of that.”


	Boston's Jayson Tatum was fourth, Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James was sixth — the 20th time in his 22-year career that he got some MVP votes.


	Detroit's Cade Cunningham and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards tied for seventh, Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth and three players — the Los Angeles Clippers' Harden, New York's Jalen Brunson and Cleveland's Evan Mobley — tied for 10th.


	The MVP award, like most other NBA honors, was voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly before the start of the playoffs.


	The other awards that were part of that voting process and have already been unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning coach of the year, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels winning most improved player, San Antonio's Stephon Castle winning rookie of the year, Cleveland's Evan Mobley winning defensive player of the year, New York's Jalen Brunson winning clutch player of the year and Boston's Payton Pritchard winning sixth man of the year.


	Other awards announced by the league since the end of the regular season: Golden State's Stephen Curry won the Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year award, Warriors teammate Draymond Green won the hustle award, Oklahoma City's Sam Presti won executive of the year and Boston's Jrue Holiday won the sportsmanship award for the second time in his career as well as the league's social justice award.


	The award came at a price for Gilgeous-Alexander, who is in line for an extension that will easily top $300 million and could even see him make about $1 million per regular-season game in 2030-31 and 2031-32.


	He promised teammates watches if he won the MVP; those guys have those watches now, and they deserve all that and more, he said.


	“This is nothing compared to what they've been to me,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I would rather have the MVP over a Rolex every day of the week and without them, I wouldn't have the MVP.”

Matteo Berrettini has officially withdrawn from the French Open as his nightmare injury run continues. The world No. 28 has not played Roland Garros since his quarter-final run in 2021 after years of on-and-off physical issues. Berrettini also retired from his last two tournaments, the Masters 1000s in Madrid and Rome.

Berrettini's withdrawal was announced just three hours before the main draw ceremony is due to take place in Paris on Thursday afternoon. The Italian will be replaced by a lucky loser.

The announcement comes after Berrettini retired from his home tournament, the Italian Open, earlier this month. He was trailing sixth seed Casper Ruud 7-5 2-0 when he threw in the towel, and later admitted that he almost pulled out before the match.

"Today until ten minutes before the match I thought I couldn't make it. Then I said, whatever, I'm going to try, come on. I was surprised at how my body reacted up to a certain point," Berrettini said following his third-round retirement.

"Then I felt another pull, towards the end of the first set, and after that I couldn't remain in the match, remain focused. I had to pull out one more time.

"I did not want to retire, but then I know what happens if I do not stop, I have to spend three months not playing, every time I sneeze I jump. I did not want that thing there to happen again."

Berrettini also retired while facing Britain's Jack Draper in the third round of the Madrid Open a few weeks ago. The 2021 Wimbledon runner-up has since revealed that he is facing an oblique injury, similar to an issue that sidelined him from the tour a few years ago.

"It is close to a point where I have hurt before, I don't know what is wrong with my obliques. The feelings, unfortunately I know them well because I've been there over and over again," he added.

It's the fourth year in a row that Berrettini has been forced to miss the French Open. He pushed Novak Djokovic in a tense four-set match in the 2021 quarter-final, and has not played since.

In 2022, Berrettini missed the entire clay season after undergoing emergency surgery for a hand injury.

An abdominal and oblique issue kept him out of the tournament in 2023 and, last year, he said he was "not quite ready" to return to competiton in Paris after suffering with illness.

It's been a tough few years for Berrettini, who peaked at No. 6 in the world three years ago and reached his only Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in 2021, losing to Djokovic.

When he's been healthy, he's proved he can still be one of the best players. The current world No. 28 upset Djokovic in the first round of the Qatar Open in February and, a month later, he reached the Miami Open quarter-final.

Berrettini will be hoping to recover in time for the grass swing as he thrives on the surface. He is defending 165 ranking points from reaching the Stuttgart final last year and is a two-time former champion at London's Queen's Club.

Naomi Osaka's Roland Garros outfit may be inspired by cherry blossoms, after she unveiled her custom Nike shoes that feature shades of pink and draw from French Baroque design. Osaka's custom outfits for Grand Slams showcase creativity and cultural influences, with flower themes planned for future events.

Flower power! Will Naomi Osaka's much-anticipated Roland Garros outfit be inspired by the cherry blossom?

Osaka revealed Tuesday that her sneaker muse for the clay-court major is the flower known as sakura in her native Japan. She gave her Instagram followers a first look at her signature Osaka GP Challenge 1 PRM Nike shoes in a light pink colorway, which Nike says features four branded shades -- Pink Foam, Pale Pink, Hyper Pink and Polarized Pink -- to create the theme, which also draws from French history.

"Spring is sakura season," Osaka wrote in the caption. "The girlies are gonna love this one."

"This special design is a luxurious take on an ornate bouquet from the French Baroque time period," the apparel-maker added on its website.

Osaka has been designing eye-catching custom outfits with Nike since 2019, and in April, she wrote on the social media app Threads that she was "treating every Grand Slam like the Met Gala" when it came to her future outfits -- getting fans excited for the creativity she no doubt has in store. She revisited some of her favorite 'fits in subsequent slides on her Instagram story -- her "super suits," inspired by her heritage, family and other interests -- and reiterated that she was sourcing different florals as inspiration for her big-stage outfits in 2025.

At the Australian Open, Osaka first revealed that blossoms would play a big part in her on-court fashion on major stages this season. Sunflower motifs were prominent on her outfit Down Under, as her black, white and gray clothes were brightened up by Osaka GP Challenge 1 PRM shoes -- in a fitting sundial yellow and brown colorway and with abstract sunflower details on the shoe tongues and bodice -- and she completed the look with sunflower clips weaved in her braided hair and sunflower earrings.

"The Australian Open's the happy Slam, so I thought it was really fitting for it to have a sunny theme," she noted, and teased more to come.

"Every Slam this year will have a flower-themed shoe. I think that's really cute."

Already spotted on the practice courts at Roland Garros, the former World No. 1 will fully unveil her spring threads when the main draw kicks off on May 25.

Naomi Osaka's Roland Garros outfit may be inspired by cherry blossoms, after she unveiled her custom Nike shoes that feature shades of pink and draw from French Baroque design. Osaka's custom outfits for Grand Slams showcase creativity and cultural influences, with flower themes planned for future events.

New York

The massive upgrade will expand fan space, luxury lounges and athlete perks

Arthur Ashe Stadium, the grandest stage in tennis, is set for an $800 million reinvention that promises to serve both fans and players a serious upgrade—without so much as a single delay in play. 

Announced Monday by the USTA, the transformation is the largest investment in the history of the U.S. Open and will completely modernize the stadium, build a state-of-the-art Player Performance Center, and usher in a new era for one of New York's most iconic sporting events.

The renovation will unfold over three phases through 2027, carefully scheduled to avoid disrupting the 2025 or 2026 tournaments. The new look will include a Daniel Libeskind-designed Grand Entrance, expanded concourses (up 40-percent), more elevators and escalators, vastly improved food, drink, and retail spaces and 2,000 additional courtside seats. Two new luxury suite levels and sleek hospitality lounges will bring a level of comfort and glam typically reserved for the Met Gala.

“This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis, which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years,” said USTA CEO Lew Sherr. “It also provides us the opportunity to give the players that compete in that stadium an unparalleled space that will enable them to perform at their best.”

That includes athletes getting their own $250 million playground in the form of a new Player Performance Center. Perched atop a four-story structure on the west side of the stadium, the facility will feature indoor and outdoor training turf, spa-style locker rooms, lounges and a private cafe. The center will also boast a new players-only courtyard and an exclusive entryway, giving the world's top competitors the backstage treatment they deserve.

The architectural heavy-hitters behind the redesign include ROSSETTI (the original Ashe Stadium architect), Libeskind (of World Trade Center fame), and hospitality design expert Garrett Singer, known for building out buzzy clubs and restaurants across the country.

And in a refreshing twist, the entire project is fully self-funded by the USTA—no taxpayer dollars required. With the Open already delivering $1.2 billion in annual economic impact to the city, the upgrades promise to pay off for the city as much as for the sport.

Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.

Russell insists Mercedes 'need to find performance quickly' as team seek Monaco turnaround

Lewis Hamilton cut an upbeat figure during Thursday's media duties in Monaco as the seven-time World Champion looks to build on an encouraging recovery at last weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

Ferrari endured a nightmare double Q2 exit at their first home Grand Prix of the season in Imola but Hamilton and team mate Charles Leclerc fought back admirably to P4 and P6 respectively on race day – the Briton's best non-Sprint result of the season so far.

NEED TO KNOW: The most important facts, stats and trivia ahead of the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

While this weekend's race in the Principality represents a “much different” challenge, Hamilton hopes the lessons learned last time out will stand him and the Scuderia in good stead as the latest F1 triple header progresses.

“We've definitely taken on the positives from it,” he commented. “There's still a lot to digest – it's only been a few days, obviously.

“I was on the simulator on Monday [working] on correlation and working with the engineers through the week. I hope we can have a good weekend.

“It's a much different track… Ferrari have generally gone well here [in the past] but as you know, Qualifying is everything and we've struggled so far this year, so we'll see.

“I've never driven this car at this track, so that will be new for me, it's a new characteristic to what I've experienced in the past, but it's exciting to drive for the first time a Ferrari around these streets of Monte Carlo.”

Indeed, in a season of ‘firsts' since making the move from Mercedes over the winter, Hamilton went on to explain just how special it will feel to represent Ferrari at one of F1's most famous races.

Hamilton has claimed two pole positions and three races wins in Monaco over the years

“I remember being here driving for McLaren in an era where the car looked the best, the best livery, it was very cool, and something I really, genuinely loved,” he continued, referring to his debut 2007 season.

“But to arrive here in a Ferrari is mad. Every weekend still is my first time with this team in all these locations that we go to, but to drive a Ferrari around this track…

“I've always wondered what it's like to be in the garage surrounded by red here, and I'm going to get to experience that tomorrow. I don't know if I'll sleep tonight, I'm really, really buzzing and really excited.”

Hamilton heads into the event holding sixth position in the Drivers' Championship, one spot and eight points behind Leclerc, while Ferrari sit fourth in the Teams' battle, 165 points adrift of leaders McLaren.

FIA Thursday press conference – Monaco

George Russell believes that Mercedes "need to find performance quickly" having endured a difficult race last time out at Imola, but that the new two-stop regulation for the Monaco Grand Prix this weekend will be "an opportunity".

The Briton finished outside the top-five in a Grand Prix for the first time this season at the previous round in the Emilia-Romagna event, with Russell describing it as Mercedes' 'worst day' in years on pure performance.

While Russell's consistency has allowed him to challenge towards the front this term, including four podiums from seven Grands Prix, the Mercedes package still appears to be behind McLaren and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in race conditions.

When asked on Thursday ahead of the Monaco race why he and Mercedes had fallen away from a P3 start to finish only seventh at Imola, Russell believed the hot temperatures were to blame.

Russell started P3 at Imola but faded back into the pack and has called for more pace from Mercedes

“I think the lack of performance in Imola was nothing to do with the updates [on the Mercedes], it was to do with the tyres and we know when it's hot, or the track is hot, the surface is like an old tarmac and not a new tarmac, we struggle," he said.

"On a good day we're P3, on a bad day we're P5 or P6. Maybe in Imola we were a little bit unfortunate with the Safety Cars and we finished in P7 but we know we need to find performance quickly.”

‘It will spice things up' – F1 drivers intrigued by ‘opportunities and unknowns' of new two-stop rule for Monaco Grand Prix


An opportunity for Russell and Mercedes to mix with the likes of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris during the Monaco race might surface because of a new regulation for this year.

This requires all drivers to make two pit stops during the 78-lap affair, a move designed to increase excitement in Monte Carlo.

“It's definitely an opportunity," said Russell. "Monaco is one of the most exciting Qualis of the year but come Sunday the leaders just put it in reverse and back up the pack and it isn't the most exciting race. Whereas now there's definitely going to be opportunity on the table.”

Antonelli has learnt lessons from his home race at Imola

Team mate Kimi Antonelli endured a difficult home event at Imola, failing to reach Q3 and retiring in the race due to a technical problem while admitting that the home pressure and added off-track commitments had impacted his driving.

"When I was going in the car I could feel I was not the same one as always so definitely it was a really good lesson," he said ahead of the Monaco event.

"I think this weekend is going to be much calmer on that side and I will use what I learned, definitely, to not repeat the same mistakes again in order to be focused every time I go in the car and also outside the car because last weekend was not the best.

"I didn't manage it the best on that side and definitely the performance was a little bit worse than usual. Definitely I don't want that to happen again."

FIA Thursday press conference – Monaco

Hamilton ‘buzzing' for first Monaco weekend with Ferrari after taking positives from Imola charge

Russell insists Mercedes 'need to find performance quickly' as team seek Monaco turnaround

Sainz believes Williams have ‘surprised me in some very good ways' amid team's solid 2025 form

Verstappen relishes 'pretty insane' challenge in Monaco as he assesses Red Bull's hopes

Formula 1 heads back to the streets of Monaco this weekend with Max Verstappen fresh off the back of another win in Italy. Can the reigning World Champion stand on the top step in the Principality again, or will McLaren pairing Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris be able to taste victory for the first time in Monaco? Here are what the odds tell us...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

Five consecutive podiums for Oscar Piastri leave him 13 points ahead of team mate Lando Norris in the Drivers' Championship, but the Australian's three-race win streak came to an end at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix last weekend courtesy of Max Verstappen.

Even so, Piastri has finished on the podium in every race so far this year apart from the season-opener, all of which leaves him favourite to come out on top in Monaco. Norris, meanwhile, starts this weekend with the best finishing average on the grid at 2.29, while Verstappen is a two-time winner in Monaco.

Drivers' Championship leader Piastri is favourite for victory in Monaco

Piastri, Norris and Verstappen top the podium odds after accumulating 16 top-three finishes between them, with the trio finishing on the podium together at Suzuka and Imola.

George Russell disappointed in the last race after finishing outside of the top five for the first time this term, but the Mercedes driver has been consistent this season, securing a podium at four races this year.

Home hero Charles Leclerc will be hoping to reach the podium again after victory 12 months ago, while Ferrari team mate Lewis Hamilton will be attempting to improve on his fourth place at Imola this weekend.

Leclerc will be hoping to stand on the podium in front of his home crowd again

Verstappen and Norris are the only two drivers on the grid to have finished every Grand Prix inside the top six this season. The Red Bull driver finished on the cusp in Bahrain, while Norris drove his worst race in Saudi Arabia, crossing the line in fourth place.

Williams continue to impress this season as Alex Albon was fighting for a podium spot for the majority of the Emilia-Romagna race before finishing fifth, his third top-six finish in seven races.

Kimi Antonelli ended his home race in heartbreak as his Mercedes suffered reliability issues forcing him to retire - only the second race in 2025 where the Italian has missed out on a top-six return.

Albon has finished in the top-six three times so far this season

Hamilton has crossed the line inside the top 10 in his last five starts in Monaco, while Leclerc has a perfect record in his previous three races.

Carlos Sainz is starting to find his rhythm in the Williams and begins the extravagant affair fresh off three straight top 10s, while Yuki Tsunoda offers fine value for money in this area, with three top 10s between Bahrain and Emilia-Romagna. Finally, the young Frenchman Isack Hadjar consistently challenges for a top-10 spot, earning his third of the season last weekend.

Piastri and Verstappen get their weekend underway tied for the most pole positions on the grid in 2025 with three each.

The importance of Qualifying in Monaco is elevated due to the difficulty in overtaking, leading to a trend of the fastest qualifiers taking the checkered flag.

Leclerc won from pole last year, while Sergio Perez is the only driver in the last five editions to triumph without starting from the first row.

Red Bull and Mercedes have dominated the Monte Carlo circuit in the last 10 races at this track, prevailing in four apiece. Red Bull holds the edge in recent years, winning four of the previous six with Verstappen handing the team the most recent triumph in 2023.

Mercedes enjoyed their success in the pre-COVID era, last tasting success in 2019 courtesy of Hamilton, while McLaren's last win at the track came in 2008, also from Hamilton.

Several others were on board the aircraft at the time of the early morning accident, which officials say left no survivors.

Talent agent and Sound Talent Group (STG) owner Dave Shapiro, 42, was among those killed in a fiery plane crash in San Diego, Calif., in the early morning on Thursday (May 22), according to a statement from his agency.


	“We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,” said a spokesperson for Sound Talent Group. “Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today's tragedy. Thank you so much for respecting their privacy at this time.”

	Shapiro and two other STG employees were killed when their 1985 Cessna Citation reportedly crashed around 4 a.m. on Thursday (May 22) in the Tierrasanta neighborhood. Billboard is not naming the two other victims at this time at the request of company officials, who are trying to notify family members. The plane was also carrying other passengers who have not yet been identified, officials tell Billboard, noting that there were no survivors.


	A well-known music agent, Shapiro launched STG in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen following successful careers at the Agency Group and United Talent Agency. His roster includes Sum 41, Pierce the Veil, I Prevail, Set it Off, Story of the Year, Silverstein, Parkway Drive and Eve 6. He also operates the Velocity Records music label, whose roster has included Thursday, Concrete Castles and Craig Owens.


	Shapiro was also an avid pilot with more than a decade of flying experience and was the owner of Velocity Aviation, through which he offered pilot instruction. Known around the music industry as an adventurous spirit, Shapiro's aviation website describes his thrill-seeking lifestyle and pursuit of adrenaline.


	“From BASE jumping to aerobatic flying, Helicopters to twin engines, flight instructing to furthering his own education, doesn't matter to Dave as long as he gets to be in the sky,” the website reads. At one point, Shapiro even housed the San Diego office of STG in an airplane hangar alongside some of his aircraft.


	Besides aviation, Shapiro was a lifelong supporter of independent music and hard rock, punk and indie acts that didn't fit within music's mainstream. With the launch of STG, he and his partners paved the way for the launch of nearly a dozen independent agencies in the years that followed.

Zachary Levi is aware that his religious and political beliefs have impacted his acting career. The “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” star has made his views on Christianity, vaccine skepticism, and his support of Trump more prominent in 2025, thanks in part to his very active X page. Levi, who is now building his own studio, told Variety that voicing his views will benefit his work in the long run, despite knowing that certain filmmakers now will refuse to collaborate with him.

“I know that there are people that would prefer not to work with me now because of my opinions,” Levi said. “My team has let me know. They haven't given me any specific names, but there are people who prefer not to work with me at this time. And it's unfortunate. I knew that was probably going to happen. I didn't make this decision blindly or casually.”

Levi is a devout nondenominational Christian, and despite voting for Donald Trump, now says that he was “not a fan of Trump's Trumpiness” in the public eye. “I didn't like a lot of these personal things, the ways that he carries himself a lot of the time. I understand people's aversion,” he said. “Do I think the whole package is somehow perfect? No. In fact, most people who voted for Donald Trump recognize a lot of the imperfections in all of it. Nobody was saying, ‘This is the Orange Messiah.'”

Levi's former “Shazam!” co-star Rachel Zegler posted that she hopes Trump supporters “never know peace,” though Levi says that doesn't change his opinion of her. And DC Studios chief James Gunn was asked about Levi's tweet about Pfizer and said “I can't be changing my plans all the time because an actor says something that I don't agree with.”

“While there are some people who might prefer not to work with me anymore, there's a lot of people on that side of the political spectrum who are even more inclined to hire me and to want to do business with me because ‘I need some people who voted another way,'” Levi said. “They see that what I did was at great risk. And they were like, ‘You know what? I give you a lot of props for that because that's not an easy thing to do.' And I go, ‘I appreciate that.'” 

He added that he believes his career will flourish in its own way, on its own path: “I know it to be true because I've gotten messages from lots of people who I won't name but who were very grateful to me for taking the stand that I took,” Levi said. “And also they would tell me, ‘I want to do that, but I'm so afraid.' And I would tell them, ‘Listen, you're on your journey. I'm on my journey. You've got to keep trusting God. And if you feel compelled to step out in that way, then do it boldly and know that you're going to be OK. And if you don't feel that conviction yet, then don't. It's all good.'”

Horrified by the country of his birth and heavy with the weight of its sins, Nadav Lapid has created modern cinema's most splenetic filmography by fighting his Israeliness as if it were an incurable virus infecting his body of work. 2019's eruptive “Synonyms” was a semi-autobiographical identity crisis about a man who flees to Paris because he's convinced that he was born in the Middle East by mistake, while 2021's “Ahed's Knee” was a similarly personal scream into the wind — this one rooted in the blue-balled impotence of artistic resistance amid an exultantly genocidal ethnostate.

 










Spasming with anger where Lapid's previous features (“Policeman” and “The Kindergarten Teacher”) searched for hope, both of these movies were fringed with a sense of resignation that they fought tooth-and-nail to shake off. As a result, I naturally assumed that his follow-up feature — written in Europe before the events of October 7, 2023, and then furiously reworked around them as Lapid conceded to the futility of escaping his background — would either be the wildest film that Lapid has ever made, or the most defeated.

The vituperative genius of his cinema is epitomized by the fact that “Yes” is both of those things at once. Extremely.

As sincere in its satire as it is satirical in its sincerity, the deliriously provocative “Yes” is a veritable orgy of self-loathing surrender that reaffirms Lapid as the world's most visceral director on a shot-by-shot basis. In a movie that unfolds like an Ecstasy-addled cross between Pier Paolo Pasolini's “Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom” and the Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” Lapid doubles down on the frenzied violence of his filmmaking at the same time as he fully embraces his growing appetite for submission.

Here, in a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his dancer wife who afford a life for their newborn by acquiescing to every demand made of their talent and bodies by Tel Aviv's militaristic ruling class, Lapid doesn't rage against the worst monstrousness of the modern age by speaking truth to power, but rather by volunteering his characters to get crushed under the heel of its boot. And then — with a literalness no one else would dare — by forcing them to lick that boot so clean the whole world can see the dehumanizing nature of Israel's crimes reflected in its leather.

 










But “Yes” isn't the simple polemic that might be implied by that description. Lapid isn't much interested in making a clear political argument, and even less so in trying to convince any potential fence-sitters to fall on the right side of history. On the contrary, this is a film that firmly believes Israel's atrocities to be self-evident, and it's only interested in exhausting itself for a viewership that already feels the same way. In one of the muttering stream-of-consciousness monologues that have become the default mode of communication for Lapid's recent protagonists, pianist Y (Ariel Bronz) stops himself in the middle of a self-justifying hot streak to concede that “even the film's audience hates Israel.”

Indeed, “Yes” is such a singularly vital addition to post-October 7 cinema because Lapid — sick of bashing his head against a wall in a hopeless attempt to change his own mind — knows that arguing against Israel is no longer enough to save anyone from it. Shadowed by the sense of ambivalence it shows towards its own value, “Yes” maintains that any movie worth making on this subject would have to do something bolder than just picking between the two sides of a massacre. And so it careens in the opposite direction with the same physical force that Lapid tends to pan his camera, reveling in the golem-like emptiness required to passively subscribe to a war until its characters are so debased by what that requires of them that they can hardly stand to look at each other without throwing up.

 










“Give up as early as possible,” Y plans to advise his infant son (born at midnight on October 8, 2023, and naively saddled with the name Noah). “Submission is happiness.” It's a credo that he and his partner Jasmine (Efrat Dor) embody with fundamentalist devotion.

When some Israeli bigwigs invite the couple to sex up the house party that opens the film's Sorrentino-like first chapter, they make such a frenzied spectacle of themselves that Y dies, comes back to life, and launches into a dance battle against the generals of the Israeli military while La Bouche's “Be My Lover” blasts over the soundtrack. When a much older woman asks them to come back to a creepy mansion where the walls are decorated with the taxidermied heads of her own (living) relatives, Y and Jasmine ravenously tongue fuck her ears until she comes. They do every drug they're offered, screw anyone who asks, and effectively “yes” their way into the highest levels of the Israeli war machine — all between dropping Noah off at daycare in the morning and picking him up at night.

At home, Y and Jasmine love each other with the same abandon as they thoughtlessly obey their overlords, and Lapid creates a domestic idyll so alive with manic feeling that I'm convinced he could be the next Casavettes if he weren't so inescapably stuck being himself. They talk with their hands. They commit to a shared destiny. They wonder if Elon Musk would have sex with a woman as strong-willed as Jasmine, and altogether live in a blissful iron dome of denial, as if the only border on Earth was the one between the front door of their apartment and the rest of the world beyond it.

 










It's a tamer but equally vibrant expression of the demented bacchanalia that Lapid creates around these characters whenever they go outside. What they see on the streets is only such a damning portrait of modern Israel because the realistic elements of its depiction (from the general air of blithe indifference, to the massive LED screen that stretches nationalist propaganda across six lanes of city highway) are tonally indistinguishable from the film's more exaggerated flourishes, such as the war propagandist whose face is caked in yellow sand, and the Russian billionaire who can summon skyscrapers from the ground with a single button. There's no use separating fact from farce in a film whose most grounded scene finds two people sucking face on the “Hill of Freedom” that overlooks the ruins of Gaza — pillars of fresh black smoke still rising in the distance as bomber jets rip through the sky. It's “Zone of Interest” without the need for a garden wall.

Eventually, after an hour of the most irrepressibly exuberant filmmaking I've ever seen, that same Russian billionaire makes Y an offer that he can't — and, per his custom, obviously won't — refuse: Write the music for a bloodthirsty new rallying cry that will galvanize the Israeli people in their fight to erase Palestine from the map. An “anthem for the victory generation.” Even before Y becomes obsessed with the absurdly murderous lyrics that he's assigned for the song, the whole project seems like such a farcical idea that we fear it might be rooted in fact (let's just say the truth will be made all too clear by the end of the movie).

 










Y responds to the offer with an uncharacteristic show of hesitation, but the riches he's offered as a reward prove too compelling to turn down; anything that might allow him to realize his dream of raising Noah in a nowhere country, with a non-existent language that only their family will know how to speak. As Y sees it, there are only two words that matter in the world to begin with: No. Yes. Any person who doesn't say one of them is implicitly saying the other.

Struggling to shake the amorality of the assignment, Y dyes his hair blond and drives off into the desert for inspiration. And just like that, the party is over, as “Yes” starts to slow down as it distances itself from the carnivalesque egocentricity of life in Tel Aviv and moves closer to the atrocities on the other side of the Gazan border (a process that literally begins with Y slipping on a banana peel).

For much of its second act, the movie plays like a tug-of-war between the virtuosic dynamism of Lapid's filmmaking and the sobering reality of the humanitarian crisis at hand. That tension is enriched by the irony of the fact that Y's pathologically apolitical existence has led him straight into the clutches of right-wing power mongers (funny how that works), and it's personified in the form of Y's beady ex-girlfriend Leah (Naama Preis), who now pays the bills by running social media channels for the IDF.

 










In the queasiest scene of a film with no other kind, Leah spits out a horrifying rapid-fire monologue that details several of the most heinous crimes that Hamas committed on October 7, but her speech doesn't “justify” Israel's response or give Y the ammunition he needs to write an anthem on its behalf. On the contrary, it allows him to see Tel Aviv's hedonism in a new light. Absent any coked up yacht parties to distract her from reality, committing the graphic details of those murders to memory is just Leah's way of saying “yes” to what Israel is doing in her name. Y goes to the border in search of music, but the desert's silence demands its own form of white noise.

From there, “Yes” continues to slow down even further until it almost comes to a complete stop. That you can feel Lapid so purposefully letting the air out of the tires doesn't make the film's disjointed third act feel like any less of a comedown from its first, but there's a reckoning to be had as reality catches up with Y and quite literally forces him to face the music.

There's obviously a moral dimension to that downshift, and it's true that Bronz's puppy dog eyes seem to grow a little sadder with each scene, but “Yes” never frames Y's arc as a path from barbarity to righteousness. Or to quote the name of the song that Y is tasked with scoring: “From Destruction to Redemption.” It doesn't extend any pity to its protagonist, or offer him real forgiveness for his collaboration either, but there's a measure of understanding in its belief that so many artists are just a few benign yesses away from becoming a worm like Y — especially at a time when their art can feel so pointless and inconsequential in the face of the world's cruelties.

 










To that point, the film's uncertain ending suggests that Lapid doesn't know where Y goes from here, or even could go from here — either morally or geographically. If he did, Lapid would probably be there already. But “Yes” isn't searching for the “correct” response to Y's dilemma so much as it's using him to frame that dilemma for what it is. At one point, as the ghost of his dead, settler-hating mother rains rocks down on his body from heaven, disembodied narration invites us into the musician's head: “Y thought of the hill on the border,” it says. “Of the non-stop explosions. Of the cloud of smoke enshrouding Gaza. The Israelis who grew up with the question ‘How could people live normally while perpetrating horror?' have themselves become the answer.”

And yet, the ultimate power of this movie's radically different paces and modes is found in how they combine to suggest that people can't live normally while perpetrating horror — whether in Israel or anywhere else. The abiding strangeness Lapid packs into every minute of “Yes” is proof enough of that. And yet, in the dead-end surrender of his most feverish and ungovernable film so far, one abiding truth manages to tunnel out the bottom and come out the other side of Y's story: If there is only so much to be gained from saying “yes,” then there is only so much to be lost from saying “no.”

 










“Yes!” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Last year at this time, “Anora” played like gangbusters at the Palais (audience applause is a Cannes ritual that is part performance and part real, but difficult to quantify), earned raves from the Screen International jury grid, and inevitably, won the Palme d'Or. That gave Neon confidence to play its long Oscar hand, successfully, gaining five Oscar wins including Best Picture, Director, Editing, Actress, and Screenplay.

This year the late-festival movie that performed as well is Joachim Trier's likely Norwegian Oscar entry “Sentimental Value,” an intense family drama about an established actress (Renate Reinsve) with anxiety issues whose estranged father (Sweden's Stellan Skarsgård) seeks to regain his foothold in the film industry with a new movie starring his daughter. When she's not interested, he casts an American actress (Elle Fanning) instead. Both Reinsve and Skarsgård give towering performances that will not be denied at Oscar time, given that Neon, which bought the film a year ago at Cannes before production, is adept at playing the awards game and recently added the Oscar whisperer Ryan Werner (Cinetic Media) to their in-house team as distribution chief. This could be their sixth Palme d'Or win.

Besides, two set pieces, including Reinsve's panic attack before going on stage opening night, and a heartfelt moment with her sister (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), are scene-stoppers. Movies that draw on the emotions are often winners, especially with actors. Four serve on this year's jury, including the president Juliette Binoche, plus Halle Berry, Alba Rohrwacher, and Jeremy Strong.

Giving this film a huge leg up is that Trier is already established with Oscar voters; he played the awards game with Neon's “The Worst Person in the World” (2021), which earned two Oscar nominations including Original Screenplay for Trier and Eskil Vogt, who reteam on “Sentimental Value,” and Best International Feature. They are members of the club. And “Sentimental Value” is a brilliant film, not only about family but about art, legacy, and reconciliation, as both the actress and her aging director father struggle to pursue their art.

Reinsve won Best Actress at Cannes in 2021 for Joachim Trier's “The Worst Person in the World” and has since added a number of English-language projects to her slate, from Apple TV+'s “Presumed Innocent” to Aaron Schimberg's “A Different Man.” Her star is rising and she's primed for major stateside awards play.

 










Just as last year Neon scooped up “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” at the last minute before awards night, just in case “Anora” didn't bring home the prize, this year they've added to their war chest Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” which also played well this week and could win a prize. The Iranian auteur returned to Cannes for the first time since 2003; he conjured up the story in an Iranian prison. Neon also partnered with Panahi in 2021, releasing Cannes special screening “The Year of the Everlasting Storm.”

And not taking any chances, Neon just acquired North American rights to Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho's 70s caper “The Secret Agent.” Star Wagner Moura has nabbed some Best Actor heat at Cannes as a technology expert on the run hoping to reunite with his son. The film earned strong reviews for the Brazilian auteur behind “Bacarau.”

	A John Doe who accused pioneering hip-hop artist Afrika Bambaataa of child molestation and sex trafficking has won a civil case in New York State's Supreme Court. Court records reviewed by Rolling Stone reveal that the plaintiff's motion for a default judgment was “granted without opposition” by Judge Alexander M. Tisch because Bambaataa, who has faced numerous accusations of molesting boys, never showed up to court. 


	The suit was filed in 2021 and alleged that “from 1991, when the Plaintiff was merely 12 years old, to 1995, the Plaintiff was repeatedly sexually abused and sex trafficked at the hands of the defendant.” Bambaataa has never responded to the suit's accusations. Bambaataa's manager did not immediately reply to a request for comment, and Rolling Stone was unable to immediately reach an attorney for the DJ-producer.


	In 2016, amid the first public accusations that he molested boys in the Bronx, he told Rolling Stone that “I, Afrika Bambaataa, want to take this opportunity at the advice of my legal counsel to personally deny any and all allegations of any type of sexual molestation of anyone. These allegations are baseless and are a cowardly attempt to tarnish my reputation and legacy in hip-hop at this time.”

	











	That year, three Bronx men accused Bambaataa of molestation, including Hassan Campbell and Ronald Savage. The latter man recently recanted his claims that Bambaataa molested him while he was a 15-year-old “crate boy,” or record-carrying assistant, to the Universal Zulu Nation, the group that Bambaataa co-founded. Last August, Savage told AllHipHop, “Bambaataa is not a pedophile and, in my eyes, he was doing something that was consensual with someone that he thought was of age.” He now claims that he met Bambaataa at a club while using a fake ID, noting, “I wish, back in 2016, I remembered about the fake ID.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In 2016, an emotionally charged phone call leaked where Zulu Nation member Mickey Bentson chastised Savage for his abuse accusations, telling him, “You are trying to destroy a brand.” On the call, Savage said, “You know how long I've been holding this shit in. I just could not take it anymore.” Since then, Savage and Bambaataa have seemingly reconciled, taking a picture together last year.

	Longtime New York DJ Funkmaster Flex referenced Savage's recanting during a controversial July 2024 radio show in which Bambaataa played a DJ set. “It seems that there's a discrepancy that has been cleared up with Afrika Bambaataa and the young man Bee Stinger,” Flex said, using Savage's nickname. “Bee Stinger is now saying that Afrika Bambaataa is not a pedophile.”

	Journalist and activist Leila Wills, co-founder of the advocacy group Hip-Hop Stands With Survivors, filed an FCC complaint over Flex's comments, telling Rolling Stone that “The station was reckless with allowing this man in there as a guest when he has an open case of the most horrific nature.”


	She added that even though Savage recanted, there are 12 other men, including the John Doe in the recently resolved case, who have alleged abuse at Bambaataa's hands. “Bambaataa is alleged to have sold a 12-year-old for money to adult men to take advantage of,” Wills said, referencing a central claim in the John Doe suit that just prevailed in court. “He has not defended himself, so Flex and HOT97 cannot protect him.”

EXCLUSIVE: In a spirited bidding war, Netflix has landed an adaptation of The Secret of Secrets, from author Dan Brown and showrunner Carlton Cuse (Lost, Jack Ryan, Locke and Key), with a series order. The yet untitled drama is set in the world of Brown's anticipated mystery thriller novel The Secret of Secrets, the sixth book in his series about Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon.


	Brown and Cuse are co-creators, writers and executive producers, with Cuse serving as showrunner. Emma Forman of Cuse's Genre-Arts also executive produces. Staffing for the series is already underway.

The Secret of Secrets is set for September 9 release by Doubleday. In it, symbologist Robert Langdon races against ancient forces and time to rescue a missing scientist and her groundbreaking manuscript whose discoveries have the power to forever change humanity's understanding of the mind. The series adaptation will blend futuristic science with mystical lore, delivering on the heart-pounding suspense and international intrigue that has made the Langdon stories a global phenomenon.

	In announcing the publish date, Brown called The Secret of Secrets “by far the most intricately plotted and ambitious book that I have ever written, and I also happen to think that it's the most fun.”


	This may explain the eight-year gap between the newest installment and the most recent Robert Langdon novel, the longest in the series, which includes Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013), Origin (2017) and the upcoming The Secret of Secrets (2025). Fueled by the massive worldwide success of The Da Vinci Code, Brown's novels have sold over 250 million copies in 56 languages.


	Three of the novels have been adapted into features starring Tom Hanks as Langdon and directed by Ron Howard, The Da Vinci Code (2006), Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), which have grossed combined $2.24 billion worldwide (adjusted in 2025 dollars). A fourth, The Lost Symbol, was turned into a 2021 Peacock series with Ashley Zukerman as a younger version of Langdon. It ran for one season.


	Cuse successfully adapted for TV another bestselling series of thriller novels that had spawned a feature franchise, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. He co-created with Graham Roland, executive produced and served as showrunner for the first two seasons of Prime Video's hit Jack Ryan action drama starring John Krasinski.

	











	At Netflix, the former Lost co-showrunner previously developed and served as writer, director, and showrunner (with Meredith Averill) on Locke & Key, based on the graphic novels by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, and was executive producer/co-showrunner alongside creator Zoe Robyn on the medical drama Pulse. His credits also include co-developing/executive producing A&E's Bates Motel and Apple TV+'s Five Days at Memorial, both based on books. Alongside his son, writer Nick Cuse, Carlton Cuse also is developing a Star Wars series for Lucasfilm. He is repped by WME and attorneys Karl Austen and Peter Sample of Jackoway Austen.


	Brown is repped by WME, and attorneys Karl Austen and Peter Sample of Jackoway Austen and Heide Lange of Sanford J Greenburger Associates.


	This marks the latest high-profile book adaptation for Netflix following such hits as Bridgerton, Queen's Gambit, The Night Agent and You.

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


BREAKING ….Caught in the blast radius of multiple multi-million dollar lawsuits between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over accusations of sexual harassment and an online smear campaign, Taylor Swift can now shake off that pesky subpoena.


	In an unexpected move, the It Ends With Us star and director has withdrawn the paperwork seeking information from Swift about what she knew about what went down between her pal Lively and Wayfarer Studios co-founder Baldoni on the domestic violence themed film. Part of the reason the summons was dropped was because details that the Bryan Freedman-represented Baldoni and crew sought were provided, I hear.

	











	Having said that, reps for Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, its execs and publicists did not respond Thursday to request for comment on the withdrawal of the high-profile subpoena against the “Fortnight” superstar and her lawyer J. Douglas Baldridge. Team Swift did respond, with a polite “no comment.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Swift is a longtime friend to Lively and even the godmother to one of her and Ryan Reynolds‘ children. Even before news of more backlash from a previously served Swift subpoena leaked out on May 14, the IEWU soundtrack contributor had already made several cameos in various lawsuits and countersuits ever since Lively on December 20 filed her sexual harassment and retaliation complaint with California's Civil Rights Department.


	With all that, Baldoni's team may be mum today and Swift's people circumspect, but Lively's side certainly had something to say.


	“We are pleased that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties have withdrawn their harassing subpoenas to Taylor Swift and her law firm,” a Lively spokesperson told Deadline this morning. “We supported the efforts of Taylor's team to quash these inappropriate subpoenas directed to her counsel and we will continue to stand up for any third party who is unjustly harassed or threatened in the process,” they also noted.


	And of course, this being the Lively vs Baldoni case, there was always more to say.


	“The Baldoni and Wayfarer team have tried to put Taylor Swift, a woman who has been an inspiration for tens of millions across the globe, at the center of this case since day one,” the Lively spokesperson said of their client's close close pal who has popped up in more than one filing or two since this all started with the Another Simple Favor actress' CRD complaint in late 2024. “Exploiting Taylor Swift's celebrity was the original plan in Melissa Nathan's scenario planning document, and it continues to this day,” the statement adds, with a swipe at Baldoni's crisis management PR chief. “Faced with having to justify themselves in federal court, they folded.”

	











	“At some point they will run out of distractions from the actual claims of sexual harassment and retaliation they are facing.”


	With no settlement on the horizon and a vast cast of co-defendants and countersuits, Lively and Baldoni are set to face off in federal court on March 9, 2026.


	Last week saw a flurry of attorney accusations of strong-arming of Swift by Lively's side along with  “witness tampering and evidence spoliation,” plus protests by the Gossip Girl‘s crew of moves “to launder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.” It was a lot of thunder and not much lightning as Judge Lewis J. Liman reacted to a Lively team request and yanked the damning correspondence from Freedman and other Baldoni lawyers out of the court docket.


	“The Letter is improper and must be stricken,” ordered Judge Liman in response to a motion by Lively's side filed mere hours after Freedman's letter. “It is irrelevant to any issue before this Court and does not request any action from this Court,” he added, noting that Swift's  Venables LLP counsel were fighting the subpoena in DC court.


	The reference by the Lively spokesperson Thursday to publicist Nathan, who along with ex-Jonesworks VP Jennifer Abel, directed Baldoni's public face, is noteworthy here, and clearly very personal.  Lively and Deadpool star Reynolds' team have claimed that Nathan and Abel were the paid brains behind astroturfing social media effort to preemptively taint Lively before the actress went public with tales of her IEWU co-star's alleged misconduct. Both Nathan and Abel have denied those allegations, essentially stating they didn't need to attack Lively, the internet hated her all by itself.


	However, a mention of Swift in a Nathan/Abel planning document now in the court docket, can't be denied. “As part of this, our team can also explore planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people in BL's circle like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully' into getting what they want,” Nathan wrote in August last year, around the time the Sony-distributed IEWU was released.


	With all the drama and stakes at play in what is a $400 million and growing legal action on many fronts, don't expect this withdrawal of a subpoena to be the last you hear of Ms. Swift in this matter. By a long shot.

Most of us don't appreciate where our problems sit on a scale from ordinary to tragic. One day your frustrations relate to impressing the family of your intended husband, or to the local school's struggles to contain your tearaway son. The next day, there are no footholds for this conventional social anxiety because the bottom has fallen out of your world. 

Selling a descent from stress into a state of devastation that can never be shed (only briefly reprised) is the formidable actress Parinaz Izadyar. Remarkably, considering how often she is tasked to cry or yell, there is nothing repetitive to her performance. She keeps reacting to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune with fresh volatility, not letting her character, Mahnaz, become passive or automated.

 








Related Stories Nia DaCosta, Andrew Ahn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Kyle MacLachlan, and Eliza Hittman to Serve on Tribeca Festival 2025 Jury Cannes 2025 Films Sold So Far: Jafar Panahi's ‘It Was Just an Accident' Acquired by Neon 

Returning to the Cannes competition lineup after 2022's “Leila's Brothers” Iranian melodramatist, Saeed Roustayi, proves that he has an Almodovarian flair for painting in the colors of female pain under patriarchy. While his production design is more naturalistic than the Spaniard's, the voluptuous emotional expression is comparable and Roustayi knows just when to rein it in for a moment of beautifully composed quiet.

Quiet can never be achieved when pre-adolescent nightmare Aliyar is around. Mahnaz's son is a Tasmanian devil spinning his ticking time bomb energy into entrepreneurial pursuits (running a gambling ring at school), bullying classmates and yelling at any adult that interferes with his forcefield. When Aliyar breaks a match inside a lock and traps 700 kids in the school playground, he is suspended for a week from school. (This does, in fact, feel fair.)

It does, however, create an extra problem for Mahnaz — a hospital nurse — raising two kids (the second child is a meek girl) in her mother's house after the death of her first husband. A romantic rapport with paramedic Hamid (Payman Maadi) has reached the point where he wants to propose, necessitating the blessing of his family from out of town. In order for this to happen, evidence of her two children must be scrubbed from the premises. The news of their existence will be broken at a less pivotal moment.  

The first act unrolls the settings and characters that dominate Mahnaz's life and work. Roustayi makes it clear that we're embedding in a flawed microcosm where no one is on their best behavior. Hamid is always hustling the infirm to supplement his earnings. Mahnaz is an apologist for Aliyar's antisocial behaviors, dismissing a colleague's valid objections that the kid makes her uncomfortable. As Aliyar demands an explanation for this 30-year-old woman's lack of response to his Instagram messages, she can laugh at his childlike precocity while fearing the not too distant day when these overtures will feel more menacing. He is at an age where the shadow of the man he will become looms large.

 










With the exception of Mahnaz's straight-shooting mother, the women in her life fade into the background within this early hustle. Younger sister Mehri (Soha Niasti) and daughter Neda are barely registered as our leading lady focuses on wrangling men to transform her modern family situation and set down new socially acceptable roots.

Then comes a double whammy of tragedy and betrayal that makes Mahnaz's efforts to fit into normal Iranian society a wild dream of yesteryear. Roustayi excels at threading transformative moments through scenes mounted upon other business. In the corner of a busy room someone is looking someone else in the eye and now nothing will be the same again. The biggest moments happen off screen. We are shown the build-up and the aftermath as Mahnaz rushes to catch up with what her life has become and to count who is still there.

Inasmuch as emotional arcs are pitched toward the extreme, domestic and work settings are sketched with a keen anecdotal eye and enlivened with compelling details. Pity the poor female patient trying to find the voice to object as Mahnaz conducts a passionate phone call at the same time as she injects the patient's hand with a needle. On the home front, Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee almost walks away with the whole film in the course of another phone call. Her social politesse transforms into a maternal fury and the air turns blue with inventive insults.

 










A few structural issues threaten to tip the balance from cinematic melodrama into TV soap as the bad news keeps on coming, but Izadyar's sustained emotional conviction carries the vision onwards. Working with cinematographer Adib Sobhani, Roustayi finds moments at home and at work to let the visual elements take over from the fizzing human drama. Two hospital scenes featuring a ventilator bookend key events, serving as boundaries between the person Mahnaz used to be and how far she is willing to go now.

Home – not the one she thought she was building, but still nonetheless a home, emerges as the focus of the second half of the film. Three women therein alternately tolerate and turn on each other. Their unspoken bond is the knowledge that they are beholden to different rules than the men in their lives. The patriarchy expresses itself in standards of behavior the men around them feel they can get away with. ‘Woman and Child' is scarcely a film about personal triumph, but as the chance of conventional assimilation into Iranian society is wrenched from Mahnaz, who then takes it upon herself to blast it further out of reach, Roustayi's intelligent film poses the question over whether the raw remains have their own value.

“Woman and Child” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Beastie Boys have very nearly settled a lawsuit in which they accused Chili's of copyright infringement over a social media ad that parodied the “Sabotage” video, Billboard reports and court records confirm. The band sued Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's Grill & Bar, last July, alleging that the use of the Ill Communication song falsely implied that Beastie Boys endorsed Chili's. Universal Music Group (UMG) subsequently sued Brinker for using unlicensed music in dozens of other Chili's ads. (The label has also now settled with Brinker International.) The Beastie Boys' impending settlement follows mediation between the parties this month; terms of the agreement have not been revealed. They expect to file a formal dismissal on July 7, according to the court document.

The Beastie Boys lawsuit alleged copyright infringement and trademark rights violations over an ad that, per the lawsuit's description, featured “three characters wearing obvious 70s-style wigs, fake mustaches, and sunglasses,” in the style of the Spike Jonze–directed 1994 video for “Sabotage.” The group, which does not license songs for third-party advertising, originally sought $150,000 in monetary damages, a takedown of the commercials, and an order preventing Brinker from using their work moving forward.

 Throughout the first season of the Apple TV+ series “The Studio,” directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Goldberg have risen to a number of elaborate challenges, from shooting every scene as one unbroken take (and, in the case of Episode 2, shooting an entire episode to give the appearance that it's one unbroken take) and restaging The Golden Globes to using the production design as a sort of ongoing Hollywood history lesson. 

On the season finale, they faced one of their trickiest filmmaking problems yet: filming Bryan Cranston as a studio executive high on mushrooms as he ran wild through a working casino.

 










“It was insane,” Goldberg told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast of the effort to shoot Cranston and celebrity co-stars including Rogen, Catherine O'Hara, and Dave Franco (playing himself) while just five feet off camera, patrons of the Venetian casino were watching the filming in between spins at the slot machines. “Usually there were three to four famous people per shot. So the odds of someone bothering us were pretty high the whole time. And every single spot that we shot had a restriction timing-wise.”

To make matters worse, those restrictions would change arbitrarily from day to day. “They'd change it all the time,” Rogen said of the casino. “We'd get there thinking we had two hours and they'd be like, ‘You've got to be gone in 45 minutes.'” The pressure would have been stressful for any production, but the long take strategy that Goldberg and Rogen had established made shooting in the casino especially nerve-wracking. “For a shooting style that requires an incredible amount of control over the timing and the environment, we had very little control over the timing and environment in Vegas.”

Just getting the Venetian, which Goldberg and Rogen wanted because its gondolas, statues, and other features would provide ample comic opportunities for Cranston's rampage, was no easy task. “Historically the Venetian has been the hardest casino to get,” location manager Stacey B. Brashear told IndieWire, adding that the script was risky — not only because it depicted Cranston's character running wild through the casino on mushrooms, but because it involved him climbing statues, jumping into fountains, and committing various offensive acts that the casino would not want viewers to emulate.

 










“We got them the script pages and it took months,” Brashear said of the approval process. “We had already started to buy airline tickets for the crew, and we had set up rooms. In addition, Hewlett Packard had one of their largest conventions there, so they ate up a lot of space. So it was not just a matter of script approval, but also of getting approval to coexist with them when they had a majority of the hotel booked.” The production also had to coordinate with a last-minute party being thrown by Britney Spears, but at the last minute everything came together.

“I screamed so loud and unprofessionally in the production office,” Brashear said. “But everybody was happy because they knew what it meant.” Once the location was locked, Brashear and the filmmakers had to deal with the numerous restrictions placed upon them, like keeping their equipment as out of sight as possible. While they could shoot scenes set in individual rooms during normal working hours, the shots in the casino itself had to be done in the middle of the night to avoid disrupting normal casino business. 

Luckily, the hotel was more than willing to accommodate the production when it came to shooting in multiple areas, because they wanted the location to be prominently featured on screen. “It was part of the contract, we had to promote them,” Brashear said, noting that the hotel didn't charge the production location fees in exchange for the free publicity being on the series would provide. That said, one moment in the final episode did make Brashear nervous.

 










“I was concerned that they would think of it as a liability issue,” Brashear said of a scene where Cranston jumps into a fountain. “And I was hoping they weren't going to come back to me and be like, ‘Well, we don't want fans of the show to think they can hop in that fountain' — that their legal team wouldn't be like, ‘We don't want people to get the idea to come take a selfie imitating Bryan Cranston in the fountain.' But they were willing to take that risk.”

Goldberg and Rogen were glad that shooting scenes like the one with Cranston in the fountain came late in the show's production schedule. “We were pretty dialed into the process,” Rogen said. “It was logistically insane and we couldn't plan it all — we had no access to any part of it before we got there.” Once the cast and crew did arrive at the Venetian, however, they were immersed in it — they stayed in the rooms at the hotel, so everyone would typically roll out of bed and be on set after just a quick walk to the elevator.

“It turned into a ‘Twilight Zone' episode,” Goldberg said. “We never left except for one shot in 120-degree weather with Seth in a car.” “I ate nothing but Grand Lux Cafe for two weeks straight, which isn't healthy,” Rogen added, but in the end he feels that the surreal experience of living at the hotel while shooting there seeped into the final product. “You really had to hand yourself over to the insanity of it…which was good for the [last two] episodes.”

EXCLUSIVE: Neon has picked up North American rights to Jafar Panahi's well-received feature It Was Just an Accident, which had its world premiere in Competition at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this week.


It Was Just an Accident has a one-line synopsis that reads: “What begins as a minor accident sets in motion a series of escalating consequences.” The film, which has been one of the best-reviewed movies at the festival, deals in a fictional way with past wrongfully incarcerated working-class people seeking revenge against the guard who tortured and berated them. In his review, Deadline's Pete Hammond called the movie “a powerful statement for humanity” that “serves as a warning that you better watch your back.”

	The Wednesday afternoon screening was met with a 10-minute ovation — and was highly significant because Panahi himself was in attendance, marking the first time he has been able to appear at the festival in over 20 years.

	Panahi, whose credits also include The White Balloon, The Circle and Taxi, has spent most of his filmmaking career in the crosshairs of Iran's authoritarian Islamic Republic government, including more than a decade facing multiple detentions, prison sentences, house arrests and filmmaking and travel bans.


	He was released from his latest jail stint in February 2023, and in the production notes for It Was Just an Accident, he says: “The sentence that banned me from making films, writing, giving interviews and traveling has been officially annulled. But in practice, I remain on the margins. … I have no choice but to keep working outside the system.”


	The filmmaker employed clandestine methods to shoot It Was Just an Accident and said that before wrapping, “plainclothes officers turned up and demanded all the footage. I refused. They continued to put pressure on us by threatening to arrest the crew and shut down production. In the end, they gave up. We paused the shoot for a while, then resumed. Nothing further happened.” 


	Neon has a typically stacked Cannes lineup now, with other Palme d'Or contenders including A Sentimental Value and The Secret Agent. 


	Panahi's first feature, The White Balloon (1995), was selected for Directors' Fortnight at Cannes, where it won the Caméra d'Or. He returned to th Croisette with 2003's Crimson Gold, which played in Un Certain Regard and won the Jury Prize. Initially selected to represent Iran at the Oscars, Crimson Gold ultimately was banned by the authorities, preventing it from being shown in Iranian cinemas. 

	











It Was Just An Accident was produced by Jafar Panahi and Philippe Martin and co-produced by Sandrine Dumas and Christel Henon, with David Thion and Lilina Eche serving as associate producers. The film is a Les Films Pelléas and Jafar Panahi Production from Iran/France and Luxembourg. MK2 Films is representing the international sales rights to the film. The deal was negotiated by Neon's Sarah Colvin and Jeff Deutchman with MK2 Films' Fionnuala Jamison on behalf of the filmmakers.

Donald Trump's tax bill, which Republicans passed in the House of Representatives overnight on Thursday, will slash funding for Medicaid, food assistance, and Medicare to finance a new set of tax cuts for the rich. It also includes tax breaks for gun silencers. 


	In a speech at 4 a.m. on Thursday, as Republicans were pushing through their tax bill, Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) took credit for the initial provision, which will eliminate a $200 excise tax on gun silencers. The lawmaker owns a gun shop worth millions of dollars.


	“My Democrat colleagues have asked: How did this get in the bill, what was the deal, and who asked for it,” Clyde said. “No deal. I believe the speaker, with the purest of motive, simply wanted to restore a constitutional right.” Before his time ended, he added, “And who asked? Me. I asked.”


	The lawmaker posted on X Thursday that he had quietly secured additional tax breaks on silencers. “The original bill text only removed the $200 transfer tax for suppressors. Now, the bill eliminates both the transfer and making tax for suppressors, as well as the registration,” Clyde wrote, calling it a “massive” Second Amendment victory. (These changes appear in the manager's amendment that Republicans released late Wednesday and passed Thursday.)

	











	Clyde owns a gun shop, Clyde Armory, in Athens, Georgia, and the building it is housed in — which could best be described as a gun castle. (Take a look.)


	The store, which lists silencers for sale on its website, was previously placed under an enhanced federal monitoring program, according to The New York Times, after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives “found that more than 25 guns sold there had been used in crimes within three years of their purchase.”


	According to Clyde's 2023 financial disclosure, the gun shop was worth between $5 million and $25 million. He valued the property as being worth between $1 million and $5 million. Clyde reported earning between $200,000 and $2 million in income in 2023 from the shop and property.

	Everytown for Gun Safety, the anti-gun violence advocacy group, slammed Republicans' silencer tax breaks in a statement Thursday. “There's a reason silencers have been regulated for nearly a century: They make it much harder for law enforcement and bystanders to react quickly to gunshots,” said the organization's president, John Feinblatt. “In the name of gun industry profits, House Republicans are putting law enforcement and our communities at greater risk of being shot — all while gutting health care for millions of Americans.”

	











	Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) was among the Democrats criticizing the silencer provision in recent days. “I have no idea why we think it's a good idea to repeal a tax on silencers when we are going to feed fewer children in our country as a result of this. It's a moral damn failure is what it is,” she said Wednesday.


	Earlier this month, Clyde introduced legislation, called the “Constitutional Hearing Protection Act,” to deregulate and eliminate the excise tax on silencers.


	“As an ardent defender of our Second Amendment liberties, I'm working to remove all infringements on our God-given right to keep and bear arms,” Clyde said in a press release at the time. “By deregulating suppressors, eliminating the costly $200 tax stamp on these firearms, and avoiding additional taxation, my legislation offers a constitutional solution to increase Americans' access to suppressors.”


	Clyde was one of four late conservative holdouts on the Trump tax bill who demanded that the legislation do more to cut Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. 


	As a result of their efforts, the bill will phase in work Medicaid requirements sooner, by the end of 2026. That means the 10 million Americans who are expected to lose Medicaid coverage will lose their coverage sooner.

	​​“We are not cutting Medicare or Medicaid,” Clyde said, falsely. “We want to strengthen Medicaid by saying to those who can work ‘all right, you need to work.'” 


	The poor may not have health insurance or food assistance once Republicans pass this bill, but at least they won't have to deal with the “draconian tax,” as Clyde put it Thursday morning, on gun silencers.

Miley Cyrus is gearing up for the release of her upcoming visual album, Something Beautiful, and she's hyping fans up for its arrival with the official trailer. 


	The trailer features brief flashes of Cyrus in different looks and costumes from the various videos for each song. In one moment, she winks at the camera before the shot switches to one of her executing her choreography. The clip is set to her song “Easy Lover.”


	“13 original songs,” reads words flashed across the screen between clips. “A striking visual album fueled by fantasy.”


Something Beautiful will have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 6 and will be released in theaters for special one-night-only screenings across North America on June 12. The film will then be released internationally on June 27. A synopsis of the project, directed by Cyrus with Jacob Bixenman and Brendan Walter, describes it as “a unique visual experience… including 13 original songs from the upcoming album. A one-of-a-kind pop opera from the mind of Miley Cyrus.”

Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed the House of Representatives early this morning, and the president couldn't be more thrilled about being one step closer to kicking millions of Americans off their health care coverage and food assistance programs. 


	“THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” has PASSED the House of Representatives! This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, noting some of the marginally populist provisions in the legislation, including “No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, [and] Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle.” 


	“Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,” the president added. 


	Trump also accused Democrats of having “lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination,” alleging they “have forgotten their landslide loss in the Presidential Election, and are warped in the past, hoping someday to revive Open Borders for the World's criminals to be able to pour into our Country, men to be able to play in women's sports, and transgender for everybody.”

	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) celebrated the passage of the legislation in a statement on social media. “The media and the Democrats have consistently dismissed any possibility of House Republicans succeeding in our mission to enact President Trump's America First,” he wrote. “House Democrats voted against all of it — which clearly proves they want tax hikes on their constituents, open borders, and Medicaid for illegal immigrants.”


	The reconciliation bill — which enshrines Trump 2017 tax cuts into law and pays for those same cuts by taking a machete to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — faced no smooth path through the House.

	After a marathon markup session that began at 1 a.m. on Wednesday, the bill passed the lower chamber in a 215-214 vote. The margin was only a single vote because two members of the GOP voted no, several abstained (rumors are that at least one accidentally slept through the vote), and three Democratic members of the House have died in office in the past three months. This includes Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who died Wednesday morning from complications related to terminal cancer. 

	











	During Wednesday's markup session in the House Rules Committee, Democrats bashed their Republican colleagues for scheduling the debate sessions and hearings in the dead of night, when most of the public and media were asleep. 


	“In just over 100 days, you guys have gone from promising to lower costs to ripping away people's health care. Of course you don't want anybody to know what you're doing here,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said during one session. “It's because you know this bill betrays the people who voted for you.” 


	The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation would remove over 10 million people from their health care coverage under programs like Medicaid, and over 7 million going uninsured. This is on top of the 26 million Americans who are already uninsured.


	While the bill may have passed the House by the skin of its teeth, it will face a renewed battle in the Senate. Some Republicans in the upper chamber have already made clear that they have no interest in being viewed as the party that kicked millions off their health care coverage to give tax breaks to the rich. In an opinion piece for The New York Times published earlier this month, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called the bill's provisions “both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

	“Republicans need to open their eyes: Our voters support social insurance programs. More than that, our voters depend on those programs. And there's a reason for this that Republicans would do well to ponder. Our economy is increasingly unfriendly to working people and their families,” Hawley wrote. “If Republicans want to be a working-class party — if we want to be a majority party — we must ignore calls to cut Medicaid and start delivering on America's promise for America's working people.” 


	Hawley is not alone. One anonymous GOP senator told The Hill today that “there's probably five, six, seven of us who if you do anything that cuts into benefits, you're going to have a real problem.”

	In Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut Eleanor the Great, scripted by Tory Kamen, June Squibb stars as a 94 year-old who suddenly funds herself living in New York and battling loneliness and grief after the death of her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar).


	The film's narrative includes remembrance of the Holocaust, with real Holocaust survivors in the cast. For Johansson, this story had a “sense of urgency” given the age of the survivors now. 


	“In not so many years, I think it would be less possible,” she said during an interview at Deadline's Cannes studio. “Even casting our Holocaust survivor support group and identifying who was not just willing to participate, but who could participate, really made that very clear.”

	











	Johansson set out to honor her Jewish identity, and that of her own grandmother, with whom she was very close. “The Jewish identity piece of this story is something that I felt I could confidently execute because it's in my DNA,” she said. “I grew up identifying as a Jewish kid growing up in New York, I had a grandmother who was not like Eleanor in some ways, but also kind of impossible and amazing — a very strong character; a very strong Jewish woman. And I think hopefully when you see the film, the authenticity of that comes through. If that piece didn't feel authentic to me, I probably wouldn't have touched this film.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	For Squibb, returning to the Cannes Croisette ten years after attending the festival with Nebraska, this time around has been less overwhelming, since she knows her way around the festival now. “I didn't know what I was doing [last time],” she said. “I was just sort of led around,” she smiled. 


	One way in which Squibb said she connected to the character of Eleanor was in her fearlessness. “We would all love to give people the finger all the time,” she said. “And she does it, you know. I mean, a lot of it is her humor, but a lot of it has a zinger to it, too. She's not afraid to say anything.”


	Erin Kellyman, who will next be seen in 20 Years Later, said she came to the set believing she was in over her head in comparison to Squibb and Johansson, who seemed to have it all figured out. But then, Squibb's openness really helped salve her concerns. “First of all, I think just watching June do her thing on set was a lesson in itself,” Kellyman said. Then addressing Squibb, she added, “But also, you were really open about your experience of still figuring it out. Obviously, I'm coming onto this set thinking, OK, Scarlett and June know exactly what they're doing, and I'm drowning. I'm drowning at this set. But you being open about that, I think made me relax a little bit more in feeling like, OK, so I think we're all maybe just trying to figure it out.”

	











	Johansson has recently revealed she has no plans to return to the role of Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (she also serves as executive producer), but when Deadline asked if she would consider directing a big action film, or a Marvel film specifically, she said: “I think the movies that I like that are big action movies also have the human connectivity piece. Even producing Black Widow and being a part of the production of that, and the development of the story, and the story between Natasha and Yelena… [there is] I think, a way of doing it, a way of maintaining the integrity of the idea of human connection, family, disappointment, all of the things that were themes in [Eleanor the Great], and doing it in a giant way in a giant universe — there's ways of doing that… So, yeah, definitely, it could be, it would be fun.”


Eleanor the Great is a Sony Pictures Classics and TriStar Pictures co-production, and producers are Johansson's These Pictures with Jonathan Lia and Keenan Flynn, Jessamine Burgum and Kara Durrett of Pinky Promise and Celine Rattray and Trudie Styler's Maven Screen Media.

“Sirens” begins at what looks like rock bottom. Devon (Meghann Fahy) sits on the steps of a police station, having just been released from an overnight hold, and texts her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) a single word: sirens. Given how often she's sent the word and how furiously she's typing it now, there's no secret as to what it could mean. “Sirens” is their code word for emergency, and Devon has been sounding the alarm for the last 24 hours. Simone just isn't answering.

Call and response. The associated expectations have changed since cell phones and the internet made everyone ping-able around the clock. Younger generations won't answer the phone unless they recognize the number (and sometimes not even then). Older generations are slow to adopt texting, or simply can't keep up with its evolving language. But some things never change: When your family informs you of an emergency, you respond… right?

With that instinctual query, the mystery is afoot. “Sirens” hooks you with a clear, enticing premise. Devon drops everything — well, everything except for Simone's shallow response to Devon's cry for help: an exorbitant Edible Arrangement, which she lugs on a 17-hour bus trip from Buffalo to the beach, where she tries to extract Simone from the clutches of her kookie boss (and billionaire's wife), Michaela (Julianne Moore).

Is Simone's new job a real job, or is she unwittingly serving a cult leader? Is Devon addicted to drama? Is Simone in danger? Who is this rich, bird-obsessed weirdo she's working for, and why is there a nagging fear that she'll never leave her nest? 

Then, over five taut hourlong episodes, “Sirens” scrupulously resolves these riddles while introducing even dicier dilemmas and upending audience expectations. The initial song that draws you in is honest — Netflix‘s limited series is crackling entertainment, alive with secrets, twists, and humor. But as Devon discovers more than she bargained for on her weekend trip to Simone's luxurious coastal enclave, there's a deeper resonance to chords that may sound familiar at first. 

This isn't “The White Lotus” (besides Fahy's presence) or “The Perfect Couple” (besides the palatial beach house and Fahy's presence) or “Nine Perfect Strangers” (thank God); “Sirens” is a giddy riff on class dramas and wellness satires, but Molly Smith Metzler‘s five-episode anthem still offers its own distinct melody, and it's one you'll want to play again the second it ends.

 










Like “Maid” before it (Metzler's Emmy-nominated 2021 breakout), “Sirens” centers how wealth inequality can affect families and marriages, parents and children, safety and security. Devon and Simone don't come from money. Their mother died when her daughters were young, and their father never recovered. Now, after years of hard work and harder drinking, Bruce (an extraordinary Bill Camp) has early onset dementia. He's fighting every day to remember where he's living, what happened to his family, and who this blonde woman is taking care of him. (It's Devon.)

Even before any additional trauma gets unpacked, who could blame Simone for running off and joining a cult — especially one as fancy as Michaela's? Officially, Simone is Michaela's assistant. She helps manage her bird sanctuary, which seems to require more fundraising than flight-tracking, though “Kiki” (as those closest to Michaela can call her) does both. She rehabilitates falcons in her backyard facilities and tracks their progress around the world after they've recovered. She also hosts galas, dinners, and photo shoots. She opens each get-together by reciting the same poem (by Rachel Carson) and closes them with her own signature catch-phrase: “hey-hey.”

Of course, all this isn't just funded by affluent birders. Michaela is married to Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), a billionaire hedge-fund manager whose immense fortune makes his wife's philanthropic endeavors possible. Attentive and relaxed, handsome and patient, Peter cuts the figure of an ideal husband. Most of the time, he's either out of the house for work or hiding in his gentleman's tower — an inverted man cave where he smokes pot, drinks whiskey, and gazes thoughtfully over the open ocean. (Liev Schreiber's ground floor hideout in “The Perfect Couple” is eerily similar — is this what real billionaires do in their downtime?) But Peter brings sweet, nostalgic gifts back from his business trips and still shows up for Michaela's priority parties on time. That he looks good in a suit certainly doesn't hurt, either.

 










Michaela was never able to have kids of her own — a sore subject for Peter, who desperately misses his children from his first marriage — which may be why she latches on so tightly to Simone. It's not uncommon for them to wear the same clothes, sleep in the same bed, and share the same piece of gum. The staff, often exasperated by Michaela's uncaring orders (and their inevitable reversal), even calls Simone “mini Michaela.”

For a 25-year-old woman forever scarred by an unstable, unsafe household, being taken under Kiki's wing is everything Simone could've hoped for. She has her own room, her own staff (or, at least, she treats them as such), and her own replacement mommy and daddy… but when the sister she never told anyone about suddenly shows up in the driveway — still dripping from the sprinkler shower she took on the lawn next door and cursing at such a pace she claims to have “rich people Tourette's” — Simone's sanctuary starts to fall apart.

From there, “Sirens” deftly weaves in and out of familiar patterns. Yes, Devon is forcibly adopted into her sister's upper-class lifestyle, but her steadfast disdain for moneyed pomposity (and dismissal of so-called wellness practices) feels like a breath of fresh air next to shows that eagerly revel in the extravagant customs of the 1 percent. Yes, mysteries build around Michaela — does she have something to do with the former Mrs. Kell's mysterious disappearance? is she plotting to lock Simone away in an ivory tower? — but rather than strive for gasp-inducing twists, the answers drive the story down thorny, curious paths. Yes, there are dramatic showdowns between sisters, couples, and other warring parties, but the resulting casualties are never quite who or what you'd expect.

 










Along the way, there's so much to savor. Metzler's dialogue is sharp, consistently surfacing memorable lines without drawing enough attention that you're pulled out of the story. The top trio of stars all turn in fine performances, led by Moore finding just the right pitch for Michaela — believable and mystical, easy to stereotype yet hard to pin down — while Glenn Howerton (as the Kells' not-quite-as-rich neighbor and Simone's semi-serious boyfriend), Josh Segarra (as Devon's doofy boss and unserious fuckboy), and Bill Camp (as the aforementioned Bruce, whose scenes in the last two episodes demand Emmy voters' full attention) steal so many moments across the breadth of the series, they very nearly usurp the leads they're meant to support. Luckily, a trio of discerning directors (led by “Watchmen” DGA-winner Nicole Kassell) fill their frames with such vibrant colors, meticulous details, and vivid lighting (the lighting, my god!), the whole series seems like it's bursting at the seams, rather than just its formidable ensemble.

Despite being defined as an S.O.S. call from the start, “Sirens” isn't just about getting a response — it's about who's calling and why; it's about the siren song of money, family, and even safety; it's about mistaking prosperity for credibility, fealty for love, escape for evasion; it's about the chosen realities we build our lives around, and the truths we can't hide from in the end; it's about the people who fall short, and the people who have no choice but to pick up the pieces.

 










What looks like rock bottom from high on top of a cliff may end up being exactly where you need to be.

“Sirens” premieres Thursday, May 22 on Netflix. All five episodes will be released at once.

Beastie Boys and Universal Music Group have settled their lawsuits against the parent company of Chili's that claimed the restaurant used the group's “Sabotage” in social media ads without permission.


	In July 2024, the band and their label sued Brinker International over the ads that first started appearing in November 2022. In addition to using the song without permission, the complaint claimed, one of the ads also resembled the song's famed Spike Jonez-directed music video, complete with “three characters wearing obvious 70s-style wigs, fake mustaches, and sunglasses who were intended to evoke the three members of Beastie Boys.”


	“Use of the ‘Sabotage' sound recording, music composition and video was all without permission,” the lawsuit said. “The plaintiffs do not license ‘Sabotage' or any of their other intellectual property for third-party product advertising purposes, and deceased Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch included a provision in his will prohibiting such uses.”

	











	Beastie Boys and UMG sought at least $150,000 in damages from Brinker. On Wednesday, lawyers for both sides filed briefs to the federal court notifying it that they reached a settlement “in principle” following mediation, Billboard reports. Terms of the agreement were not revealed.

	Beastie Boys have been fiercely protective of their music following Yauch's death in 2012, as one of the provisions in his will aimed to block the use of the trio's music in advertising.


	Back in 2014, the band won a $1.7 million verdict against the Monster Energy drink company for using several of the group's songs in a promotional video. That same year, Beastie Boys reached an undisclosed settlement with toy company GoldieBlox over the use of their song “Girls.”

Stars of the surreal mystery series will make 18 stops around the U.S. to discuss stories from in front of and behind the camera, with two events taking place at iconic series locations.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


Twin Peaks fans who were left wanting more following the series' long-awaited third season in 2017, rejoice: Top members of the original cast are set to tour the country later this year.


	Starting in early August, stars of the surreal David Lynch and Mark Frost-created saga will be sitting down for nostalgic conversations in cities across the U.S., from Tysons, Virginia, to Seattle, Washington. Ray Wise (who played Leland Palmer), Harry Goaz (Deputy Andy Brennan) and Kimmy Robertson (Lucy Moran) as well as Twin Peaks: The Return executive producer Sabrina S. Sutherland will share their experiences on the series and swap behind-the-scenes stories at the ticketed events.

	Sheryl Lee, who played the high school homecoming queen whose murder formed the central mystery of the story and gave a startling starring turn in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, will additionally appear at certain stops in the Western U.S. 


	The tour will kick off less than a year after series co-creator Lynch's death at the age of 78. According to Sutherland, the cinematic legend gave his blessing for the tour before he passed.


	“David was very happy that we were going to have this cast tour to celebrate Twin Peaks with the fans all around the U.S.,” Sutherland said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “It's sad that I won't be able to call him each night to let him know how the show went as I had promised. But I look forward to celebrating his work each night and having him in my heart instead.”


	The tour (see all events here) also includes two stops at iconic series locations in Washington state. In an engagement that's already sold out, on Oct. 18 fans will be able to tour the house in Everett, Washington that served as the Palmer residence in the series, with Lee, Wise and property owner Mary Reber, who played Alice Tremond, telling stories from the series and Fire Walk With Me. (The event promises tea — no word yet on coffee and cherry pie.)


	And on October 20, Lee and Wise will visit the Kiana Lodge in Poulsbo, Washington, where interiors of the Great Northern Hotel and the Martells' home were shot. The venue's exterior is perhaps even more famous, with Laura Palmer having been found dead and wrapped in plastic by a giant log on the beach outside in the Twin Peaks pilot.

	











	David Roy Williams Entertainment is producing the shows under license from Paramount Location-Based Experiences as Lynch fandom and Twin Peaks nostalgia is having another moment. 


	This year's Cannes Film Festival saw the premiere of the documentary Welcome to Lynchland, which examined the Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive filmmaker's life and career, while a nonfiction film focused on the life and work of Catherine Coulson, Twin Peaks' beloved “Log Lady,” has been screening in cities around the U.S.


	A watercooler hit when it premiered on ABC in 1990, Twin Peaks have been credited with helping to create prestige television as we now know it with its continuous mystery structure, cinematic flourishes and devoted fan community. After Twin Peaks was canceled in its second season, Lynch returned to the Pacific Northwest with Fire Walk With Me, which was considered a box office and critical failure upon release, but has since been reappraised (and gotten the Criterion Collection treatment).


	In 2017, Lynch and Frost smashed expectations with their Showtime limited series Twin Peaks: The Return, which both confounded and delighted audiences with its idiosyncratic structure but typical (at least of Lynch's work) lack of reassuring answers.

	President Donald Trump will host a gathering of VIPs today at his private golf resort outside Washington, D.C. These are not diplomats or heads of state. They are rich people, foreign and domestic, who have put money into the Trump family's pockets.


	The dinner is for winners of a contest — the crypto traders who raced to become the top 220 holders of the president's $TRUMP meme coin. According to one analysis, they collectively accumulated about $150 million of the crypto asset, which has no intrinsic value and is equivalent to a digital baseball card. 


	The contest has made Trump's family crypto business money on each transaction. And it has swelled the president's personal net worth, by driving up the price of the coin, which the family business holds massive reserves of. 


	The meme coin contest is just the latest example of Trump wielding the public office of the presidency for his private enrichment. In fact, sources with direct knowledge of the matter tell Rolling Stone that one of the lessons Trump took away from his previous stint in the White House is that he was wrong to leave a ton of money on the table as president. 

	











	The president himself has privately said this on multiple occasions in recent months and years, according to two people who've been in the room with him. In moments of casual banter, Trump has mentioned that it was “stupid” of other Republicans and advisers to persuade him — at least on occasion — to side with government ethicists who cautioned him from obliterating the line between public good and private gain.


	Trump says such things often enough that he can't help himself from repeating some of it in public, including recently about the proposed gift of a $400 million 747 jumbo jet “sky palace” from the government of a Gulf emirate. “I think it's a great gesture from Qatar; I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” the president told the press at the White House in mid-May. “I mean, I could be a stupid person saying, ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.'” (As Rolling Stone previously reported, Trump often does not distinguish between what's his and what belongs to the people or its government, including when it comes to this plane — which he privately refers to as “one of my” new airplanes.)

	Trump does not hold space in his mind for any distinction between his private interest and the public interest. “A deal is a deal,” the president has said in the past several months, according to one of the two sources, dismissing Democratic complaints about the meme coin, or about how his business and real-estate empire is working to strike major foreign deals. 


	To anyone holding fast to the bedrock norms of public service, Trump's self-dealing is appalling. “The situation should be revolting to anybody who cares about the American interest,” says Norm Eisen, a good-government champion who now directs the Democracy Defenders Fund. “It's damaging to the country. When people give you a $400 million plane, or a $2 billion investment, or buy your meme coins in large amounts to have dinner with you and visit the White House — they expect something in return.”


	Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, agrees. Trump's deals make the campaign finance scandals of the last century — recall the Clinton-era scandal in which top donors were treated to overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House — look quaint. 


	“It's not even in the same ballpark as what we're seeing with Donald Trump,” Bookbinder says. From crypto deals to a Qatari sky palace, he notes, “you're talking about Trump's personal bottom line — about money going into his pocket, or about luxuries that make his daily life better.” And the special interests providing these riches, Bookbinder warns, will enjoy “access to him, and the ability potentially to influence him.”

	Anna Kelly, a Trump White House spokesperson, tells Rolling Stone, “There are no conflicts of interest. President Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children. It is shameful that Rolling Stone is ignoring the GOOD deals President Trump has secured for the American people, not for himself, to push a false narrative. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly reelected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.”


	The Trump Organization and the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, did not respond to requests for comment.


	In venting to close allies about accusations of open corruption and, effectively, bribes from foreign entities and regimes, the president has said that any nation or city overseas should be proud to have a Trump Tower or other new Trump family property built there. This is, Trump says, in part because such a building now carries the “prestige” of not only his brand name, but the United States as a whole, one of sources who's been in the room with Trump in recent months tells Rolling Stone. 

	











	On Monday, Reuters reported that the Trump Organization and a local partner are considering building a skyscraper in Vietnam, after the country approved the Trump family empire's plans for a $1.5 billion luxury residential development and golf club. Eric Trump attended the golf club's groundbreaking ceremony on Wednesday with Vietnam's prime minister. Vietnam is simultaneously working to negotiate a tariff deal with the Trump administration. 


	Both in public and behind closed doors, Trump often repeats a new mantra: It does not matter how much lucrative new business the Trump Organization or his children engage in while Trump is the president, because he and his family are so wealthy that he doesn't need that new cash flow or windfalls — and therefore, he must be unbribable. (For his part, Trump's son Eric has abandoned concerns about the optics or appearance of corruption, telling The Wall Street Journal that his efforts to keep certain interests of the Trump Organization and the first Trump presidency separate went unrewarded. “I got very little credit for it,” he said. “We still kind of got stomped on.”)


	The second Trump administration, from Day One, has been working to make the world safe for corrupt business practices — in ways that have already eclipsed the sky-high standards of corruption set by Trump's first four years as leader of the free world.


	Through his executive orders, Trump has opened the door to corruption both foreign and domestic. In February, Trump issued a pause on enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This anti-corruption statute bars companies from using bribes to secure overseas business deals and requires adherence to basic bookkeeping standards. 


	Trump issued his executive order in the name of “eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad” and normalizing “routine business practices in other nations.” The order declares that suspending enforcement will “prioritize American interests” and improve “American economic competitiveness.” The executive order leaves any enforcement solely to the discretion of the attorney general, Pam Bondi. 


	Bondi has experience with foreign business interests, having previously acted as a lobbyist for the government of Qatar. The public knows about the arrangement between Bondi and Qatar because of disclosures required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA — a law meant to shine a light on foreign influence and propaganda campaigns inside the U.S.

	











	The Trump administration, on Bondi's first day, also ordered a halt to criminal prosecutions for violations of FARA. This means the Department of Justice will turn a blind eye to covert foreign influence operations, unless there is “conduct similar to more traditional espionage by foreign government actors,” according to Bondi's order. 


	Bondi also ordered DOJ's ​​Foreign Influence Task Force to be disbanded. And under her leadership, the FBI has disbanded an elite unite tasked with rooting out public corruption by executive officials and members of Congress.


	“The administration started with weakening corruption safeguards for others,” says Eisen of Democracy Defenders. “And it has evolved into open profiteering based on public office by Donald Trump himself.”


	Trump is leveraging his family's crypto business as a means for very rich people, many of them foreign nationals, to put money in his pocket.


	The brazen meme coin contest has received the most scrutiny. The $TRUMP meme coin is not officially supposed to be an investment vehicle. (The coin's fine print insists it is not “an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.”) 


	But Trump's decision to launch the crypto asset just days before reclaiming the White House cemented his status as a multibillionaire. (His wife, Melania, created her own coin, too.)


	In April, the president announced a contest in which the top holders of $TRUMP coin would gain access to him personally at a dinner at Trump National Golf Club outside D.C. The coin's 25 biggest investors have also been promised a special reception and an unspecified “VIP Tour.” (Originally this was billed as a “VIP White House Tour.”) 


	“You have a situation where people who buy millions of dollars worth of his meme coin have a chance to talk to him and pitch him on policy that regular Americans don't have,” says Bookbinder of CREW. “That is corrupt.”


	The top holder in the contest spent about $18 million on $TRUMP coin. Justin Sun, who identified himself in a post on X as the $TRUMP whale, is a controversial crypto billionaire whose own fortune is in jeopardy. 


	In 2023, Sun was sued by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged fraud and manipulation involving his company's Tron coin. Sun has since emerged as an adviser to the Trump family's crypto business and reportedly invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, netting the Trump family an estimated $56 million in fees, according to Bloomberg. In February, not long after Trump took office, the SEC reportedly asked a judge to pause its litigation against Sun, so it could pursue a resolution out of court.Separately, as part of his trade war, Trump has weighed delisting Chinese companies from America's stock exchanges. The Wall Street Journal reports that some Chinese firms are now rushing to buy $TRUMP coin, seemingly in a quest to stay in Trump's favor — and on the Nasdaq.

	











	Trump is also reaping money from a different crypto coin. In early May, an investment firm in Abu Dhabi announced it would make a $2 billion investment in the crypto platform Binance — doing so using a “stablecoin” minted by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, $USD1. 


	Stablecoins are pegged to a unit of fiat currency, in this case the U.S. dollar. The minters of stablecoin typically profit from transaction fees, as well as from the interest generated by the real-world assets (like U.S. Treasuries) that are used to ensure the value and liquidity of the cryptocurrency.


	Bookbinder argues that the stablecoin transaction “could be incredibly valuable” to the Trump family. The sheer size of the transaction establishes the Trump family's stablecoin as a major asset in a crowded market — giving the family's company invaluable brand cachet. And then there's the $2 billion itself. “It appears that they're going to be able to invest it and take the proceeds,” Bookbinder says, “which could be many, many millions of dollars.”


	Congress is currently considering legislation, called the GENIUS Act, that would enact new, weak regulations on stablecoins — a boon for Big Tech firms and likely the president's family, too. The Senate passed the legislation on a bipartisan basis on Monday.


	In what critics allege is a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, Trump is seeking to accept a luxury 747 jumbo jet, known as a “sky palace,” from the government of Qatar for use as Air Force One during the course of his presidency. As part of the jaw-dropping proposal, the plane would remain available for Trump's post-presidential travel upon leaving the White House. 


	The deal has been blessed as lawful by Attorney General Bondi — the former lobbyist for Qatar — under the logic that Trump will never personally own the plane, as it will ostensibly remain in the hands of Trump's library foundation, which Trump appears to be turning into a slush fund for donations to fund a lavish post-presidency.


	It's been reported that the Qataris are happy to hand off the plane — a garish golden albatross that they've been unable to sell. But the plane's over-the-top luxury appeals to the intended recipient, Trump. “It's hard to imagine that he's not going to be influenced by the fact that he is flying around in a luxurious plane,” Bookbinder says. “Based on his statements, we have every reason to think that would influence him. That's a kind of corruption that we haven't seen before.”


	Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) agrees. “This level of corruption is so gross that even Trump's most hardened MAGA sycophants are turning against him,” Murphy said in a floor speech that cited conservatives Laura Loomer and Ben Shapiro as unlikely allies in the fight. “They can't believe he … is willing to put our nation's security at risk, take unconstitutional bribes just so he can fly himself and his Mar-a-Lago golf buddies around the world in a gold-plated luxury plane.”

From Dot's new verse on "Family Ties" to SZA bringing out Lizzo for a "Special" surprise, here are the best moments from the first LA stop of their Grand National Tour.


													By
												

	Heran Mamo



	“You said you feel the love, right?” Kendrick Lamar asked SZA after performing their twinkling 2018 hit collab “All the Stars” during the first LA tour stop of their Grand National Tour at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium Wednesday night (May 21). 


	“I think so,” she responded breathlessly. “You feel it?” 


	“I definitely feel it.” 


	The two dove head over heels into “Love” from his 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN., with SZA's honeyed vocals taking the track's featured artist Zacari's place. While Dot has been hailed as a generational hater for vanquishing Drake in last year's monthslong epic rap war, the stadiums he and SZA have been dominating for the last month since the tour started don't feel like battlefields. Sincere and cheeky love songs like “Snooze” and “Kiss Me More” share the stage with scathing and calculated diss tracks like “Euphoria” and, of course, the five-time Grammy-winning juggernaut “Not Like Us.” The Grand National Tour serves as a well-deserved victory lap for Lamar, who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year, and SZA, whose 2022 blockbuster album SOS has continued breaking Billboard 200 chart records three years later. Because what's better than taking over one stadium? Taking over 32.


	As both superstars embarked on separate and at times intertwined trips down memory lane throughout the show, their modes of transportation were very different, yet very them. Lamar pulled up in his sleek black 1987 Buick GNX and frequently flexed his signature whip on stage, while SZA's “ride” was a gigantic animatronic ant named Anthony (because why not) that carried her throughout “Kitchen.” Shortly after, she sang Rihanna's “Consideration” lyric about “ridin' in on a pale white horse,” but that couldn't be further from the truth. One can only dream of RiRi returning to any stage for their first joint performance of the song since the 2016 Brit Awards, but SZA did surprise concertgoers with her “best friend” Lizzo.


	The dynamic duo ended on a high note with the one-two punch of “Luther” and “Gloria,” the former of which has spent the last 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as of this week (chart dated May 24), and samples Luther Vandross' 1982 hit “If This World Were Mine.” Well, if you're Kendrick Lamar and SZA, it certainly feels like it is.  


	Here are the five best moments from the first SoFi Stadium stop during their Grand National Tour.


	“We've been all around the world and back, we was on the East Coast, we was in the South for a little bit, but you know I couldn't motherf–king wait to make sure I came back home, you hear me!” he exclaimed at the base of the stage, homecoming hurrahs greeting him from every corner. “Is Long Beach in this motherf–ker tonight? Is South Central in this motherf–ker tonight? Better yet, is Watts in this motherf–ker tonight? Is Inglewood in this motherf–ker tonight? Is Compton in this motherf–ker tonight?”


	After Lizzo caught a vibe at the after party for SZA's Not Beauty brand in Brooklyn earlier this month, SZA brought out her “best friend for energy and positivity,” she announced before the pop star popped out for a precious performance of the “Special” remix. While the “Good as Hell” hitmaker was the only special guest for the first LA stop, her feelgood attitude and undeniable star power sufficiently filled up the stadium.  


	Even though he brought out his younger cousin Baby Keem to perform “Family Ties” during one of their MetLife Stadium stops earlier this month, Lamar held his own with a new verse. “Ay, you n—as will never compare to me/ F— poppin' in, I'mma declare the streets/ My mama said ‘be scared of God'/ On God, they better be scared of me/ Beverly playing, I was making a right/ Pop punani ain't making it right/ Told you, you would fight my fight/ I'm buckling up,” he rapped.


	Following “Snooze,” SZA re-emerged onto the stage in a glimmering chrysalis gown with wings during “Crybaby” and caught flight mid-song. She eventually shed the long skirt and completed her metamorphosis into a beautiful butterfly before jumping into her Hot 100 top 10 hit “Nobody Gets Me.” “I wrote this about my ex-fiancé. He hates me,” she said matter-of-factly before encouraging her fans to sing along for him. When asked during one of the deposition video skits if she thought she would have hit songs without dysfunction in her relationships, SZA responded, “No, so grateful. I owe everything to those terrible… interactions.” 


	It's a poignant reminder that personal growth and prosperity don't come without its own set of challenges, but the end result make everything worth it.


	SZA has certainly found her sweet spot in the buddy comedy world. After fighting with her bestie/roommate (played by Keke Palmer) while facing eviction in their critically acclaimed One of Them Days film earlier this year, she took on the role of Dot's nagging little sister during one of the video sketches as the two pulled up to the gas station – in his GNX, no less – and bickered over which snacks he needs to pick up.


	“What is it, chimmy chua?” he asked her, acting puzzled over the pronunciation of the sweet, salty and spicy Mexican delight.


	“Chamoy,” she responds snootily. “Your fans are Mexican. How do you… Chamoy!” 


	As he walked away muttering his frustrations under his breath, his LA-based Mexican fanbase nearly lost theirs after having the spotlight on them. Lamar has long documented his appreciation for this demographic and recently featured mariachi singer Deyra Barrera on “Wacced Out Murals,” “Reincarnated” and “Gloria” on GNX, as well as Mexican rappers Peysoh and Lefty Gunplay on the title track and “TV Off,” respectively.

Former HGTV couple Christina Haack and Tarek El Moussa, who were married from 2009 to 2018 and hosted the hit show “Flip or Flop,” rarely open about their religious beliefs with fans. 

But on May 18, 2025, as their nine-year-old son Brayden was baptized, they couldn't help but share their excitement over the spiritual milestone, both giving fans glimpses of the ceremony and their post-service celebration with their blended family. 

A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa)

Haack and El Moussa, who share custody of Brayden and their 14-year-old daughter Taylor, both shared multiple videos in their Instagram Stories from Brayden's baptism on May 20, including footage of a pastor dunking their son in a baptismal pool inside a church. Brayden wore a t-shirt for the occasion that said “Meet the new me.” 

Haack wrote over a video of the moment, “Special day for our boy. So proud of you Brayden. We all love you so much.” 

El Moussa shared a photo of he and Haack with Brayden, which she re-shared, and wrote, “Big day for Bray Bray!! Getting baptized today, proud dad moment 🙌”

In a video taken behind-the-scenes at the church before Brayden's baptism, El Moussa asked his smiling son, “Where are going, Bray? Your baptism! You excited, bro? Let me see that face.”

“Come on, Bray, here we go,” he said as they climbed the stairs to the sanctuary. “It's your big day, buddy!” 

El Moussa wrote over the video, “No nerves, just excitement. The whole family is here to support Bray Bray on his special day.” 

After Brayden's baptism, El Moussa shared video from an outdoor family luncheon that included his second wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, and their two-year-old son Tristan, as well as Haack's five-year-old son Tristan, from her previous marriage to TV personality Ant Anstead. Grandparents and cousins were seated around the table, and Brayden's big sister Taylor was present, too. 

Haack and El Moussa rarely open up about their religious backgrounds and beliefs, but their son attends a private, Christian school in southern California that's connected with the Baptist church where he got baptized. 

In 2017, El Moussa told Country Living, “I'm half Middle-Eastern, so (my name) comes from Middle-Eastern descent. My dad was raised Catholic in the Middle East in Lebanon and then Egypt. My mom's from Belgium and my dad moved to Europe when he was in his late teens.”

That same year, both El Moussa and Haack shared that they were inspired by Tim Storey, a life coach who has an honorary degree from Bethany Theological Seminary, per his website, and founded the Congregation Family Church in 2015. 

In May 2017, as he and Haack were in the midst of their divorce, El Moussa shared a Facebook photo from attending church with Storey and wrote, “Sundays are the best days 💙 Love quality time with the kids and of course church with Pastor @TimStoreyOfficial.” 

“He's changed my life,” El Moussa continued, “and so many others, for the better and can do the same for you!”

That December, Haack told Country Living Magazine that as part of her holiday plans, she was “volunteering with Pastor Tim Storey, serving meals at the Los Angeles Mission on Dec. 22. Giving all year round is really important to me, and especially during the holidays. I am so grateful that I am able to give back because there have been times in my life when I didn't have anything extra to give, when I struggled just to make rent. Sharing the wealth is what the holidays are all about.”

It's almost impossible to have a thorough discussion about the myth of the American West and the way it permeated pop culture without turning one's attention to Italy. Italian filmmakers like Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci had a field day with cowboy iconography in the 1960s, churning out a series of violent Westerns that many enthusiasts would say rival or surpass the American Westerns made by the likes of John Ford and Howard Hawks. From their largely European casts and overtly Catholic imagery to their hot-blooded stories of violent revenge, the so-called Spaghetti Westerns were distinctly Italian products. But their existence was only possible due to the endless fascination that Italians had with America and the myths that Hollywood loved to perpetuate.

Italy's love of American cowboys provides the backdrop for “Heads or Tails,” the new film from “The Tale of King Crab” directors Alessio Rigo de Righi and Matteo Zoppis that once again feels like it was ripped from the yellowing pages of a beautiful old storybook. It's the turn of the 20th century and legendary entertainer Buffalo Bill Cody (John C. Reilly) has brought his blockbuster Wild West show across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. His traveling circus of lassoing, sharpshooting, and cowboy crooning has turned into a hot ticket among Italy's elite, with his carefully curated stage presence giving these aristocrats the sense that they're interacting with a real live cowboy. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






A hustler to his bones, Cody sometimes struggles to reconcile his stage persona as a Wild West adventurer with the fact that he's the kind of man who sails to Europe to entertain wealthy Italians. During a conversation with a rich local farmer who boasts about the roping skills of his own cowboys, Cody agrees to stage a rodeo contest between the Italian ranchers and his team of trained professionals. The farmer agrees to his terms, though he asks his star ranch-hand Santino (Allesandro Borghi) to take a dive as part of a gambling scheme. Santino, who is as proud as he is devilishly handsome, reluctantly agrees but is unable to go through with his promise. He wins the contest, humiliating the Americans while alienating his boss. With nothing left for him at home, he decides to flee the scene with Rosa (Nadia Tereszkiewicz), his true love who just happens to be the boss' wife. For good measure, she shoots her husband in the head on her way out the door.

 










With his reputation on the line, Buffalo Bill decides to go after the runaway lovers. The showman is not particularly skilled as a bounty hunter, but he once again struggles to separate his persona from reality. Reilly gives a predictably excellent performance as the legendary entertainer, nailing both his on-stage bravado and the private moments of insecurity where he hesitates to drop the act because he's not clear what mask he'd don in its place. With no easy way to turn down his employer's father's request to catch his son's murderer, he sets out on his own journey through the Italian countryside. 

Cody is reduced to a supporting character in the rest of the film — a pity, given how entertaining Reilly's performance is, but it makes narrative sense. The focus shifts to Santino and Rosa, who quickly find that the initial euphoria of escaping routines doesn't protect against relationship struggles. The outside world mistakenly believes that Santino killed Rosa's father because of the bounty placed on his head, and he soon becomes a folk hero among revolutionaries who want to seize the means of production. Rather than correct his admirers and explain that Rosa is the killer, he embraces the newfound fame and finds his public mask fusing to his face in a manner that's not unlike what happened to Buffalo Bill. As the story takes a brilliantly surreal turn that will remain unspoiled, Rosa is forced to reckon with the bleak fact that the stories we tell ourselves, whether they're pulpy Western novels or sweeping romances within our own lives, are often written by the victors and clouded by their own delusions and desires.

 










“Heads or Tails” is visually stunning, with Italy's forests and mountains captured in a rich celluloid color palette that will look as marvelous in 100 years as it would have a century ago. The storybook shot composition benefits from the fact that very few Westerns were ever actually filmed in Italy, as Sergio Leone and his colleagues primarily shot their outdoor sequences in the deserts of Spain. The film gives one of the world's greatest Western-producing nations its own moment in the spotlight, and the country's landscapes more than rise to the occasion. 

“Heads or Tails” builds on the playbook that Rigo de Righi and Zoppis established with their first film, exploring the ways that time erodes our shared stories despite presenting itself in a package that's utterly timeless. Sentimental when it needs to be and subversive whenever boredom lurks around the corner, “Heads or Tails” is a fitting second entry in what could soon become one of the most stylistically distinct bodies of work among today's active filmmakers. 

“Heads or Tails” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

	Taking the stage with signature poise, Jin performed the emotional ballad under soft, moody lighting, accompanied by a live band and backing vocalists. His warm yet melancholic tone filled the studio as he sang the reflective lyrics from “Don't Say You Love Me,” a track that has quickly become a standout on Echo, which dropped last Friday (May 16).

	











	Before the performance, Jin joined Fallon for a light-hearted interview segment that included a comedic role reversal, with Jin briefly acting as the show's emcee. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	When asked about his next chapter as a solo artist, Jin shared details about his upcoming Hi-Seokjin fan tour. “You might be expecting my vocal skills, but I hope you're most excited to see my face up close,” he joked with a smile.


	The Hi-Seokjin event series kicks off this Friday in New York City, where Jin will meet with 1,000 fans for an exclusive concert and fan interaction. He'll then return to South Korea to play two sold-out shows in Goyang on May 28 and 29, with additional Asian dates expected to follow.


Echo has already topped the iTunes charts in over 60 countries and received early critical praise for its blend of tender ballads and experimental production. 


	“Don't Say You Love Me” serves as the centerpiece of the project, showcasing Jin's evolution as a solo vocalist and storyteller.


	Jin previously appeared on The Tonight Show in November 2024 to perform “Running Wild,” a track from his debut solo EP. His return signals a strong re-entry into the global spotlight as he prepares to embark on his first official fan tour, while BTS continue to pursue solo activities during their staggered enlistment period.

Lower assures The Hollywood Reporter that Dan Erickson and Ben Stiller aren't playing mind games with their cast — well, not beyond literally the entire plot of the show.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



[Do not read further if you have yet to watch the Severance season two finale in full. But also, what's taking you so long?]


	It's frustrating when TV storylines keep us in suspense for literal years, as was the case of Severance season one to season two. While the same (real) time will not lapse between the Apple TV+ series' second and third seasons — Ben Stiller promises! — we don't have to wait until season three to re-engage in some Severance season two-finale cliffhanger chatter.




The Hollywood Reporter grabbed Britt Lower while she was on a break filming Netflix's adaptation of Harlan Coben novel I Will Find You (Lower is “still a redhead” for that one, she says) to ask her all the burning questions about her other streaming drama.

	Did Mark S. (Adam Scott) make the right decision at the end of season two, when he chose himself and Helly R. over his Outtie/Mark Scout and Gemma Scout/Ms. Casey? And, is she sure sure she wasn't actually Helena Eagan when that all went down? Read on for her answers, below.


	***


How much do you know about season three?


	I honestly don't know anything. I wish I did. I'm as hungry as the fans are to find out what these characters are going to get up to, and I probably have as many daydreams as as you all might about where they're gonna go and what they might be thinking.


How has your career changed since Severance?


	It's really hard to comprehend the scope of how impactful the show has been. When you do theater, of which I do a fair amount, I do live performance — someone gave me this analogy the other day that I've been really thinking about. You do a play and you go out at the end to do a bow, and that bow is not only to receive applause, which is so lovely, but also it's a way to thank the audience for coming to the show, to honor the audience by saying, “Hey, this would be weird if we were doing this to an empty room. Thank you for coming.”


	In TV and film, we don't have that immediate audience response, right? There's a year or two between when we step into the character's perspective and when the audience sees it. So, doing press and getting to see how the fans are impacted by what we've done is our chance to take that bow.


	That's always the goal with art, right? That it somehow has a resonance with the audience, and we're on this journey together. My personal opinion is that art is this chance for us to to think about what really makes us human. When we're making art, we're saying, “Who am I really? What makes our consciousness different from a tulip or a bird or AI?”

	











When did you first learn you would be playing Helena Eagan in addition to Helly R.?


	I suppose it was after I was cast — pretty early on that was embedded into the storyline. I did not know that it was Helly and Helena when I auditioned, but once I got the news that I was going to get to be Helly R., then Dan Erickson and Ben Stiller told me the full scope of season one and that all of the Innies get this little glimpse of who they are on the outside. Because we film the show out of order, we were privy to the whole arc ahead of time, so you're sort of stringing that process together.


A trend has been one actor playing twins — is it like that for you?


	I'm always trying to come up with new analogies. It's these two parts of the same person. They share the same anatomy, they share the same physiology. They share some of the same psychology, because they have a subconscious that's shared, but it's their consciousness that's different, right? Their subjective experience of awareness, of being awake, is separate in the same way that, as an actor, I share the same body as Helly, and I share some of the same subconscious space. If I bruise my elbow on set as Helly, I'm gonna feel it as Brit. But I have a different consciousness than these two parts of the character that I play.


Fans pretty quickly picked up on the physical differences you bring to the characters, like their different postures. Can you talk about creating that tool for yourself?


	My job is to sculpt the inner life of each of them, and sometimes stuff that's happening internally affects how the character moves through the world. Some of that the fans picked up on and that just happened as a result. Helly has this drive. She moves with a lot of conviction and determination. And Helena kind of waits for the world to come to her. Their psychology works differently, given their circumstances.

	











When did you first learn what Cold Harbor is?


	For season two, I had the pleasure as an actor of now stepping into that weird world of the Lumon higher-ups and seeing what it's like to be a Lumon worker as Helena, and how everyone's always watching each other — and the extent to which Helena is aware of what's happening in the company is also a little mysterious. She knows a lot, but there are also things kept from different departments within Lumon. I had to know at least what Cold Harbor was as Helena. But the extent to which she knows what it is, I'm not certain.


I know you've said that was definitely Helly R. in the season two finale and not Helena (again pretending to be Helly R.) — but are you sure Dan (Erickson) and Ben (Stiller) didn't lie to you about that to get a certain performance?


	That's so funny. No, there's no trickery involved in the Severance collaborative. If you track the whole episode and you see Helly trapping Milchick (Tramell Tillman) in a bathroom, her friend, Dylan (Zach Cherry), comes to help. She runs and stands on the tri-desk, remembering her friend Irving (John Turturro) and looking out at this sea of humanity of the Innies… That speech really embodies the question of the whole season: Are Innies people?


	In season one, [Helena tells Helly] she isn't a person and has no right to make choices about her body. Helly had no connection to meaning in the work that they were doing on the Lumon floor. She was like, “This has no meaning to me whatsoever, get me out of here at all costs. In fact, I'm willing to risk my life to do so. Get me out of here.” The question of season one is, who am I in relationship to this work, which doesn't have meaning to me (Helly)? Then, over time, she's forming this chosen family with Irving, Dylan and with Mark. The connection she has to these people who she loves is then the journey of season two. All of these Innies have this new information about who they are, and it makes them even hungrier for purpose and meaning in their lives.

	











	So then to see her on that tri-desk at the end saying, “They give us half a life and think we won't fight for it?” I just can't believe that anyone else would have said that.


Did Mark S. make the right decision at the end of season two?


	Well, again, I'm gonna go back to that question of, are Innies people? Like, Helena says to Helly R., “I am a person, you are not. I make the decisions, you do not.” So I think embedded in your question is: Is he allowed to make a decision?


	Mark's subjective experience of awareness — his consciousness — is separate from his Outtie's. So, you have to put yourself in his shoes. These Innies have been stripped of so much already, right? They don't get to see daylight. They don't get to experience music or art — not really, not very much, at least. They don't get to make choices about what they're gonna have for lunch, or what they put on in the morning. And to expect him to make a decision for his Outtie's dream to reunite with his wife is perhaps a step too far.

"We are on the right side of history," the Irish rap trio said in a statement after Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh was charged with displaying a Hezbollah flag.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh, one-third of Irish rap group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offense in the U.K.


	Ó Hannaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara and was a star of Rich Peppiatt's “print the legend” biopic on the Belfast, Ireland-based band, is accused of “displaying a flag in support of proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London gig,” according to the city's Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard.




	The 27-year-old was charged by the police after an incident on Nov. 21, 2024 at a venue in north London. He is due to appear in court on June 18.

	The band took to social media after news of the charge. “We deny this ‘offense' and will vehemently defend ourselves,” said Kneecap. “This is political policing. This is a carnival of distraction. 14,000 babies are about to die of starvation in Gaza, with food sent by the world sitting on the other side of a wall, and once again the British establishment is focused on us.”


	Concluded the band: “We are on the right side of history. You are not. We will fight you in court. We will win.”


	The group has drawn widespread criticism in recent months, and the Met Police said it would investigate after online videos showed the band calling for the death of British parliament ministers, as well as chanting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” It is illegal in the U.K. to express support for Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon, as it is considered a terrorist organization in Britain.


	Kneecap, which also includes members Naoise Ó Cairealláin and J.J. Ó Dochartaigh, said the video in question has been taken out of context, and that they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah.


	Last year, the movie Kneecap, also starring Michael Fassbender, dominated film headlines. Director Peppiatt made BAFTA history by tying the record for nominations for a debut filmmaker with six. He won one BAFTA — namely for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer — serving as both writer and director of the film.


	But the group's political views have gotten them into hot water. In April, they displayed messages about the ongoing war in Gaza during their Coachella set, leading to the cancellation of their concerts in Germany. Later, they parted ways with their booking agency Independent Artist Group, sources confirm to The Hollywood Reporter.












	Kneecap is set to headline the Wide Awake festival in South London on Friday.

	Two staff members from the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. were shot and killed Wednesday evening while leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. The suspect shouted “Free, free Palestine” after he was arrested, according to police. 


	The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were leaving the event when the suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, approached and opened fire. The event was hosted by the American Jewish Committee.


	“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. this evening. We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue,” American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement. “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”


	D.C. police chief Pamela A. Smith briefed reporters last night, noting that the suspect was seen pacing outside the museum before approaching the group and firing with a handgun multiple times. He was detained by the venue security before the police arrived, and is currently in police custody.

	Smith confirmed police “have not had any prior interactions” with the suspect. She added, “We don't see anything in his background that would have placed him on our radar. Our joint terrorism task force is working very closely with the FBI to ensure that we can do a deep dive into his background.”


	Yechiel Leiter, Israel‘s ambassador to the U.S., told reporters that the two people killed were a young couple about to be engaged. “The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said. “They were a beautiful couple.”


	President Donald Trump responded to the incident on his Truth Social, writing, “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen!  God Bless You ALL!”

	Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that she visited the scene of the shooting. “Praying for the victims of this violence as we work to learn more,” Bondi wrote on X. She added she was there with former judge Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in Washington whose office would prosecute the case.

	











	Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement he is “devastated” by the scenes in D.C. “This is a despicable act of hatred, of antisemitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,” Herzog said. “Our hearts are with the loved ones of those murdered and our immediate prayers are with the injured. I send my full support to the Ambassador and all the embassy staff. We stand with the Jewish community in DC and across the US. America and Israel will stand united in defense of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”


	Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government is tightening security for Israel's outposts worldwide. “We are witnessing the terrible price of antisemitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel,” he said in a statement. “The blood libels against Israel are paid in blood, and we must fight them relentlessly. My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer.”


	The shooting occurred as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has escalated in recent weeks. Israel has been blocking aid deliveries to Gaza since March, resulting in a lack of food and medical aid in the region. Last night, the United Nations it had dispatched “around 90 truckloads of goods” into Gaza, but that is only a fraction of what is needed to prevent an imminent famine. Israel's military has also been attacking Gaza with notable force, including hospitals, schools, and shelters, causing dozens of deaths per day.

	The event at the Jewish Capital Museum was focused on how to help the people of Gaza, according to American Jewish Committee board member JoJo Kalin. “I'm not going to lose my humanity over this or be deterred,” she said, per the BBC. “And that Israelis and Palestinians both still deserve self determination and [it is] just deeply ironic that that's what we were discussing. It was bridge building and then we were all hit over the hide with such hatred.“

	Billy Williams, the esteemed British cinematographer who shared an Oscar for shooting Gandhi and also was nominated for his work on the Glenda Jackson-starring Women in Love and Henry Fonda‘s final film, On Golden Pond, has died. He was 96.


	Williams' death was announced in British Cinematographer magazine. No details on the cause of death were provided. 




	“With deep sorrow, we bid farewell to Billy Williams – an outstanding British cinematographer, laureate of the “Golden Frog” for exceptional achievements in the art of cinematography at the Camerimage Festival in 2000,” tweeted the official X account of Camerimage, the Poland-based film festival dedicated to cinematography.

	Williams also served as the director of photography on John Milius' The Wind and the Lion (1975), Stuart Rosenberg's Voyage of the Damned (1976), Martin Brest's Going in Style (1979) and Peter Yates' Suspect (1987).


	The London native received an early career break when he was hired for Ken Russell's Billion Dollar Brain (1967), the third film in the Michael Caine-starring Harry Palmer spy series, and he reunited with the demanding director on Women in Love (1969) and The Rainbow (1989).


	“I was soon to learn working with Ken Russell that he was likely to ask for the sort of thing that hadn't been done before, and there was no such thing that it couldn't be done,” he said in a comprehensive 2003 Web of Stories interview. “You had to find a way of doing it. It was a great challenge.”


	After shooting the Iraq scene for William Friedkin‘s The Exorcist (1973) and The Wind and the Lion in brutal conditions in Spain, Williams found himself tested again on Richard Attenborough‘s Gandhi (1982), with many sequences filmed on location in India.


	“It was obviously very hot and dusty, and traveling was not easy,” Williams recalled in 2020. “It was a tough schedule. We would leave at seven in the morning and get back at eight at night, then watch the rushes on a mobile protector. But it was an intensely rewarding film and satisfying to be involved in because here's somebody who really changed history.”


	After studying hours of newsreel footage of activist Mahatma Gandhi, Williams had to leave the production after about six weeks for treatment in the U.K. for a slipped disc. He suggested Ronnie Taylor replace him (Taylor had worked with Attenborough as a camera operator on 1969's Oh! What a Lovely War and 1972's Young Winston and with Williams on The Wild and the Lion).

	











	The first scene Taylor photographed was the re-creation of Gandhi's 1948 funeral that featured 400,000 extras.


	Williams returned after four weeks in recovery but encountered the same problem again, so he left and Taylor came back. He said it was the only two times he had ever left a movie.


	“Billy and I did about 10 weeks each on the picture,” Taylor told British Cinematographer magazine. “Richard Attenborough decided that if there were going to be any nominations, that Billy and I should share the credit.”


Gandhi, made for about $22 million and shot in 35mm anamorphic, received 11 Academy Award noms and won eight trophies, including those for best picture, best director, best actor for Ben Kingsley and best cinematography (Williams accepted his prize on Oscar night, with Taylor unable to leave work on Champions).


	After finding out he was hired for Gandhi, Williams departed for New Hampshire to shoot On Golden Pond (1981), starring Fonda, his daughter, Jane, and Katharine Hepburn. When director Mark Rydell didn't know how to film a birthday party for Fonda's Norman Thayer, Williams had an idea.


	He suggested they “put the camera on a track and start by the kitchen area,” he said. “Kate [came] out of the kitchen with these 80 candles burning, so we've got this lovely warm light glowing onto her face, and we track with her for a little while and then let it go past her so we've followed on her back and we reveal the dining area with the others waiting for her. She joins Henry Fonda who makes a little speech about the joys of becoming 80, and then they all lean forward and help him blow out the candles.

	











	“The camera tilts down, they blow out the candles and it goes dark and that's the cut and it worked beautifully. We didn't do a single cutaway.”


	Williams was born on June 3, 1929, in Walthamstow, London. His father, Billy Sr., was an intrepid cinematographer who filmed the surrender of the German fleet at Scapa Flow in Scotland in 1919, then worked on documentaries.


	During World War II, Williams left school when he was 14 to become his dad's assistant. “He was a very hard taskmaster, everything had to be done just right,” he recalled. “Of course, the camera had to be looked after like a baby. It was so precious.”


	In 1946, he traveled to Kenya and Uganda with his father, who was then shooting for the Colonial Film Unit.


	Williams served as a photographer with the Royal Air Force for two years, then worked as an assistant cameraman for British Transport Films, shooting documentaries about docks, railways and the Queen Mary. He saved up to purchase his own Arriflex camera, did commercials and eventually made his feature debut on the black-and-white, sound-effects comedy San Ferry Ann (1965).


	When older cinematographer Otto Heller (The Ladykillers, Alfie) refused to take a medical exam to be insured for Billion Dollar Brain, which was going to be filmed in frigid Finland, producer Harry Saltzman turned to Williams, who had done commercials for Russell.


	For Alan Bates and Oliver Reed's memorable naked wrestling scene in Women in Love, Williams and Russell decided to “go for a very strong color effect like the color of firelight, which is very orange,” he said in David A. Ellis' 2012 book, Conversations With Cinematographers. “I filtered all the lamps to be the same color as the fire and created a flickering effect.”

	











	Williams' résumé also included Ted Kotcheff's Two Gentlemen Sharing (1969), John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), Michael Anderson's Pope Joan (1972), X, Y and Zee (1972), Kid Blue (1973), The Silent Partner (1978), Eagle's Wing (1979), Boardwalk (1979), Monsignor (1982), Yates' Eleni (1985), The Manhattan Project (1986), Stella (1990) and Driftwood (1997), his final film.


	A four-time BAFTA nominee, Williams served as the president of the British Society of Cinematographers from 1975-77 and taught cinematography at the National Film Theatre starting in 1978.


	He received lifetime achievement honors from Camerimage in 2000 and the British Society of Cinematographers in 2006 and was awarded the Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2009.


	“I feel I have been very lucky to have had a career in filmmaking, which has been the most satisfying, rewarding, exciting job I can imagine,” he said.

Sharing news of their new record on social media on Wednesday (May 21), Twenty One Pilots have announced that the album will arrive on an unspecified date in September, with first single “The Contract” to be released on June 12.

	The album's announcement was also paired with the news that it appears to thematically continue the narrative arcs which the band have focused on across the past decade. “Hello Clancy. Hello Blurryface,” they wrote on social media. “Let's finish this.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Referencing the titular characters of their 2024 and 2015 LPs Clancy and Blurryface, respectively, the record will ostensibly wrap up the narratives that have also continued across records such as 2018's Trench and 2021's Scaled and Icy.


	Composed of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, Twenty One Pilots first formed in 2009 and released a pair of independent records before 2013's Vessel served as their major label debut and commercial breakthrough, ultimately peaking at No. 21 on the Billboard 200. The group received their first No. 1 with 2015's Blurryface, with their following records all reaching the top three.


	More recently, Twenty One Pilots wrapped their Clancy World Tour with a series of U.K. dates earlier this month. These shows made headliners when, in the final moments of their gig at Manchester's AO Arena on May 11, a concertgoer was seen grabbing one of Dun's drums and casually walking away with it. 


	“I really don't think you should take that,” one fan can be heard saying in a widely shared video of the alleged theft, as another adds, “Have I just witnessed a crime. Has she actually just stolen that drum? That's crazy.”


	Though the unnamed fan initially appeared to get away with the souvenir unhindered, dedicated fans went into full investigative mode to attempt to track them down. The hours-long search appeared to pay off when Twenty One Pilots' behind-the-scenes tour videographer Sax posted on Instagram on May 12 that the one-of-a-kind drum had been returned.

Lindsay Hubbard questioned Andy Cohen about her status on ”Summer House.” On the May 21 episode of “Watch What Happens Live,” the Bravo TV veteran reacted to a question about her future on the show now that she is a mother.

During the segment, Hubbard's co-star Kyle Cooke noted that while she's had a major lifestyle change, it doesn't necessarily mean “sayonara” or the end of her time in the summer house.

Hubbard then looked at Cohen and asked him point blank, “So where do we go from here, Andy? What do we do?”

Cohen laughed uncomfortably before cutting the conversation off and telling Hubbard, “Alright, let's talk about it after the show.”

Fans reacted on social media, with one noting, “ANDY KNOWS SOMETHING.”

Others agreed that it's high time for a new show with the OGs. ”We need a ‘summer in the city' spin off! Seeing their business ventures, events, family life etc,” one fan wrote on Instagram.

A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)

Cooke's wife Amanda Batula also talked about the future of “the show.”Summer House.” The Bravo TV personality opened up in an interview with Teen Vogue to address the possibility of bringing in some younger cast members to the Bravo reality show now that the original stars are in their 30s and 40s. In season 9, Lexi Wood, and Bailee Henderson, both 27, were introduced to fans.

Batula, who will turn 34 this summer, admitted she “can't keep up” with the Gen Z crowd that sometimes shows up at the Hamptons party house. “I can't keep up with half the stuff they're saying,” she admitted in the May 2025 interview. “My husband [Kyle Cooke] definitely can't, but you know, it's fun having younger people in the house too. I feel like it keeps me young and in the know, but I think that there's a world where people need to, like, graduate out.”

“We need the freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, [class], and we need some more freshmen for sure,” she added.

In the interview, Batula noted that she has no say in “Summer House” casting decisions. “But if I were on the inside, I think the show could go one of two ways. It could either follow the current cast as we get older, or you know, we could sort of break off and it can go back to being young and partying and introducing more of those fun Gen Z kids,” she said.

Fellow “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo has been vocal about feeling she has started to “age out” of the original “Summer House” party premise. In an interview with Glamour, the “Giggly Squad” host admitted, “There's an end date for me at some point.”

“With the lifestyle of ‘Summer House' specifically, I'm probably not fitting into the original show idea anymore,” the 32-year-old admitted. “Whenever I see a comment that's like, ‘She's a little too old to be on this,' I'm like, ‘Yeah, I kind of am.”

Co-star Jesse Solomon has said he hopes to have one final “hurrah” with the veteran cast members, who include Batula, Cooke, Hubbard, and Carl Radke.

 Speaking with Us Weekly just before the Bravo reality show usually starts production, Solomon said, “There's gotta be a season 10 with the OG cast. One final hurrah.”

“Beyond that, I think people are interested enough in the OGs' lives to follow 'em to the city and, maybe, continue partying in the Hamptons with some of the other cast,” he added.

The cast for “Summer House” season 10 has not been confirmed by Bravo. Filming typically starts in early July each summer.

The actress told The Hollywood Reporter at the New York premiere that her characters in 'White Lotus' and 'Sirens' are "polar opposite," but they share being "underestimated." 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



Meghann Fahy adds another high-society series to her résumé — but this time, she's not playing the wealthy one.


	In Netflix‘s upcoming series Sirens, created by Molly Smith Metzler (Maid), Fahy plays Devon, a character who comes from a poor upbringing in Buffalo and is spending the weekend on an island, living in luxury, but whose main focus is helping her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) leave her boss Michaela Kell (Julianne Moore), a dame of the island's high society.




	When taking on this role, she skipped a phone call to Mike White, asking for any pointers. “I think the character that I played in White Lotus of Daphne and Devon in this show, Sirens, are so polar opposite, in most ways,” she told The Hollywood Reporter of the characters at the premiere Tuesday. “The one storyline that I could identify between those two women is just that they are underestimated. They are not what they appear to be at first glance, and they are misjudged for that.”

	In the second season of White's cultural phenomenon The White Lotus, which follows the privileged lives of vacationers staying at a luxury resort, Fahy's Daphne is married to financier Cameron (Theo James). And while the other characters assume she's superficial at first, she proves to be a lot more complex throughout the series as the dynamics with her husband are revealed.

	However, Fahy addressed the similarities between the shows' themes. “Of course everyone's obsessed with wealth and dissecting it and making fun of it and all those things, so there's a lot of that happening these days,” she said.


	Even though every season of The White Lotus begins with a mystery death, by the end of the show, it could be easy to label who the show's villain is, but what unravels always makes it more complex than naming just one. And in Sirens, there's a lot to be said about the class system, too.


	“Society is the real villain,” Alcock said. “It's the pressures that these women have to upkeep. Not only these women, but these men.” 


	Castmember Josh Segarra thinks the darker moments are because of “greed” and “everyone wanting more.”


	Meanwhile, Fahy, believes the show is all about “perception and how we see people and how we misjudge people.”

The new film from the maker of 'Why We Fight' focuses on the fourteen years the famous WikiLeaks founder spent confined to an embassy and a London prison.


							By 

	Jordan Mintzer



	Unless you followed the ups and downs — well, mostly the downs — of Julian Assange's life over the past 15 years, you'll have to wait until the last half-hour of Eugene Jarecki's new documentary, The Six Billion Dollar Man, to understand what its title means.


	By that point, the WikiLeaks founder had been holed up for over six years at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he faced imminent arrest by the UK authorities. It's then that we learn how the first Trump administration offered, via the IMF, to loan Ecuador's government $6.5 billion if they agreed to kick Assange out. The move is not exactly shocking, especially coming from a dealmaker like Trump, and it shows just how much the U.S. authorities were willing to pay so they could nab one of their most wanted men.

	Much of Jarecki's jam-packed and informative two-hour feature, which premiered as a special screening in Cannes, focuses on the decade-plus legal rollercoaster ride that Assange and his team of committed lawyers were obliged to take. The film can get a bit repetitive during all those scenes at the embassy, which is not the most cinematic of locations. But we do grasp the sense of confinement and growing paranoia Assange experienced for years on end. Technically he wasn't in jail, but his life was under house arrest.

	The first half of The Six Billion Dollar Man gives us some of the backstory leading up to that point, showing how Assange rose from unknown Australian hacker to worldwide hero of free journalism to public enemy number one, especially for the American government.


	Founded in 2006, his tiny startup WikiLeaks became a phenomenon the next year when Assange released a video called Collateral Murder, unveiling leaked footage of U.S. Marines massacring Iraqi civilians. (Jarecki includes a long excerpt, which is as disturbing now as it was back then.) In the years that followed, the site dumped thousands of redacted documents online, including military field logs, diplomatic communications, and lots of nasty emails between members of the Democratic National Committee.


	This was a promising time for the internet, when it seemed like online journalism could shake up the world order. “Would you rather not know?” a bearded Edward Snowden explains (presumably from Moscow), referring to all the information Assange was offering up free of charge. But that period would be short-lived, especially when the U.S. struck back against the many compromising documents WikiLeaks was putting out in public. “A fight with the Pentagon only ends one way,” is what one interviewee tells Jarecki, and the rest of the movie shows how our government desperately tried to land Assange behind bars, leaving him no option but to take political asylum in the only place he could get it.

	











	Jarecki is no stranger to the abuses of U.S. power, especially in early features like The Trials of Henry Kissinger and Why We Fight that focused on disastrous American foreign policy, from the Vietnam War to the War in Iraq. In the opening sections of his new doc, he does a good job contextualizing the importance of Assange's work, which aired lots of embarrassing — not to mention criminalizing —  dirty laundry under the administrations of both Obama and Trump, neither of whom come off as good guys here.


	Enough happened in those early WikiLeaks years to fill an entire series, requiring Jarecki and his team of four editors to condense tons of material until they get to the heart of the matter for them, which is Assange's ten years of legal hell in England.


	Two co-stars appear in the story at that point: The first is Jennifer Robinson, a human rights lawyer and fellow Aussie, who defended Assange when he first received an international arrest warrant in 2010, then stuck with him until the bitter end. The other is Stella Assange, an attorney and advocate for WikiLeaks, who fell in love with its founder while he was under embassy lockdown, giving birth to their first child. For all the dark clouds of that period, the silver lining was that Assange — whose legal woes started with an eventually dropped rape investigation in Sweden — managed to find his soulmate.


	Chock-full of talking heads, archive footage, CCTV images, clandestine iPhone shots and catchy music cues that are also a tad obvious (in one scene, M.I.A.'s “Paper Planes” drops as Assange tosses actual paper planes out of a window), the filmmaking in The Six Billion Dollar Man can be far more conventional than the man in question, whose appearance changes drastically as the years of purgatory drag on.

	











	But if there's more substance than style in Jarecki's movie, there's also plenty of truth-telling. And as Naomi Klein says toward the end of the film, in a simple statement that sums up what WikiLeaks represented back when it was created, and still means right now in our age of rampant misinformation: “The truth matters.”

The confidential settlements are the latest in a string of lawsuits accusing brands of using copyrighted songs in TikTok and Instagram ads without paying for licenses.

	Rachel Scharf



Universal Music Group (UMG) and the Beastie Boys have both reached confidential settlements to end lawsuits in which they accused restaurant chain Chili's of using their music in social media advertisements without permission.  


	Two court filings on Wednesday (May 21) informed federal judges that Chili's owner Brinker International agreed to settlements with both UMG and the Beastie Boys during a mediation session two weeks earlier. The terms of the settlements have not been revealed, as is typical in these types of lawsuits.


	UMG and the Beastie Boys both sued Brinker in 2024, alleging Chili's featured their copyrighted music in advertisements on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms without buying so-called “synch” licenses.




			Trending on Billboard		







	While social media platforms provide huge libraries of licensed music for users to add to their videos, a brand must purchase a special synch license if it wants to include a song in any commercial or promotional content.


	The Beastie Boys, who are famously averse to their music appearing in advertisements, claimed in a July lawsuit that Brinker used their iconic 1994 song “Sabotage” in a promotional video without permission.


	To add insult to injury, the Beastie Boys said this Chili advertisement also showed three men in “70s-style” wigs, fake mustaches and sunglasses carrying out a “robbery” of food ingredients from a Chili's. The rap trio claimed these visuals clearly evoked the “Sabotage” music video, which featured Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz, Michael “Mike D” Diamond and the late Adam “MCA” Yauch in similar attire.


	UMG followed up with its own lawsuit this past October, alleging that dozens of Chili's social media advertisements used unlicensed music from the label. UMG said the restaurant company's wrongdoing extended to more than 60 songs by artists including Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Lana Del Rey, ABBA, Luke Bryan, Travis Scott, Bruno Mars, Lil Nas X, Earth Wind & Fire and The Weeknd.


	According to Wednesday's court filings, both UMG and the Beastie Boys have reached agreements “in principle” to end their claims against Brinker. The settlement deals are currently being finalized, and both lawsuits are expected to be closed by early July.


	A UMG rep declined to comment on the settlement news. Spokespeople for the Beastie Boys and Brinker did not immediately return requests for comment.


	Numerous brands have faced lawsuits in recent years from music companies and artists over the use of copyrighted songs in social media ads. All three major labels sued drink maker Bang Energy for this in 2021, leading to closely-watched judgments in favor of UMG and Sony.


	In July, Kobalt and other music publishers brought lawsuits against more than a dozen NBA teams over the use of songs in social media videos, leading to a bevy of settlements earlier this year. And just last month, a Detroit-area Ford dealership settled claims that it unlawfully featured Eminem's “Lose Yourself in TikTok videos.

	For his return to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night (May 21), Jin transformed the stage into a giant bed — and Billboard has the exclusive preview photos to prove it.


	The BTS member made himself at home in Studio 6B, getting extra cozy for his performance of “Don't Say You Love Me,” the lead single from his just-released second solo EP Echo. Jin dropped the seven-track project — the follow-up to his November debut solo EP Happy — on Friday, May 16.

In addition to his comfy performance, Jin also sat down for an interview with Fallon — just like he did for his first solo appearance on The Tonight Show late last year. And this time, he turned the tables on Fallon too, jumping behind the desk to grill the late-night host.


	Jin's superstar group BTS — also comprised of SUGA, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook — first visited The Tonight Show back in 2018 for a performance of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 11 hit “Idol” and “I'm Fine.” In 2020, the boys made multiple Tonight Show appearances — including a couple of virtual performances on the show during the COVID-19 pandemic — before returning again in 2021 for performances of their No. 1 hits “Butter” and “Permission to Dance.”


	Back in March, Jin's BTS bandmate j-hope made his solo Tonight Show debut and got similarly cozy, rocking a pair of fluffy bunny slippers with his jeans-and-black-blazer ‘fit.


	To watch Jin's full performance and interview, tune in to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night (May 21) at 11:35 p.m. ET on NBC, or streaming on Peacock.

The Lionsgate film has landed the Oscar-winning actor to play the host of the Hunger Games who was previously portrayed by Stanley Tucci.

Senior Entertainment Reporter


Kieran Culkin is following up his Oscar win with a spot in The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.


	The actor has been cast as Caesar Flickerman in the forthcoming Lionsgate film, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Francis Lawrence directs the movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel that will hit theaters Nov. 20, 2026.




	Caesar is the eccentric host of the Hunger Games. Stanley Tucci portrayed an older version of the character in the series' first four films that kicked off with The Hunger Games hitting theaters in 2012.

	Previously announced castmembers for Sunrise on the Reaping include Joseph Zada, Whitney Peak, Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor and Ben Wang. THR's exclusive casting reporting has included Ralph Fiennes as the diabolical President Snow; Molly McCann and Iona Bell as standout book characters Louella and Lou Lou, respectively; and Elle Fanning as Effie Trinket.


	Lawrence helms the movie from a script by Billy Ray that adapts Collins' book. Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson produce for Color Force, while Cameron MacConomy executive produces.


	“Kieran's scene-stealing presence and undeniable charm are perfect for Caesar Flickerman, the sickeningly watchable host of Panem's darkest spectacle,” says Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-president Erin Westerman. “Stanley Tucci made Caesar unforgettable — and now Kieran will make the role entirely his own.”


	Jacobson adds, “Kieran's magnetism, wit and unpredictability make him a perfect fit for Caesar Flickerman. A host like Caesar transforms brutality into entertainment, and an actor as layered as Kieran makes sure we don't look away.”


	Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien oversee Sunrise on the Reaping for Lionsgate. Phil Strina handled the deal on behalf of the studio.


	The book Sunrise on the Reaping takes place in Panem on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games, 24 years before the events in The Hunger Games, the first novel that published in 2008. The franchise's first five movies have surpassed $3.3 billion at the worldwide box office, with the initial four films led by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.


	Culkin won the best supporting actor Academy Award earlier this year for A Real Pain and is a three-time Emmy nominee for Succession. He currently stars on Broadway in Glengarry Glen Ross alongside Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr. Culkin is represented by WME, Brookside Artist Management and Relevant.

Chasing dreams has come at a cost for “American Idol” season 21 top 8 finalist Haven Madison, who bravely admitted on May 21, 2025, that she'd experienced a major low and a huge high all in the same day.

Posting a video as she sat behind the wheel of her car, the 19-year-old pop singer was crying happy tears over achieving a major milestone with her newest single, “Castle,” mixed with tears of sadness over the friends she's lost since competing on the show and signing a record deal with 19 Recordings, a subsidiary of BMG, in late 2023.  

“I have been pursuing music my entire life,” Madison said, noting that she tried out for “American Idol” when she was 16. “I signed a record deal when I was 17, and I have been working so hard.” 

“I've lost so many people and so many friends along the way, and it has literally been anything but easy,” Madison said tearfully, but then she shared a document with her fans that showed “Castle” was the second most-added song on Top 40 radio stations, only behind Morgan Wallen's duet with Tate McRae, “What I Want.” 

A post shared by Haven Madison (@havenmadison)

“Let me show you what happened today,” Madison said before pulling up the document and pointing to “Castle” in second place on the list. She then admitted that hours before getting that news, she was in her therapist's office, thinking of giving up. 

“To put it in perspective, literally at therapy this morning, I was just like, so broken,” she said, getting choked up again as she said she had been feeling that her songs were not making any impact on the music industry and that “the world wouldn't be different if I wasn't here.”

“And I just think this moment is about so much more than me,” Madison continued, wiping away her tears. “I just want whoever's watching to know that you have such a divine purpose, and it might take a long time. It might be at the cost of losing some people you thought you wouldn't lose, but what's meant for you can't pass you by. You are so, so important.”

Madison concluded, “And to anybody who follows me or listens to my music, or has supported me in literally any way, thank you so much. Like, you don't even know how much it means. It's been really hard, it's been a long road, and it's only the beginning. But I'm just so grateful.” 

Madison received a flood of support in the comment section of her post, including from some of her fellow “American Idol” contestants. 

“Yes queen yes,” wrote fellow season 21 finalist Blake Proehl, with whom she's remained close friends. 

Another friend she made on the show, Jordan Anthony, wrote, “UR AMAZING SUGARRRR ❤️”

Lucy Love, a top 12 contestant on season 21, wrote, “Right on time 🙌❤️ Congratulations Hay 😘🙌🏾”

Kayko, a top 10 finalist from season 22, chimed in, “Hi my name is haven Madison AND IM A BADASS AND I WRITE FIRE MUSIC”

Melinda Doolittle, a beloved contestant from season 6, commented, “That milestone is amazing, and you have been amazing leading up to it, and you will continue to be amazing way past it”

"I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character," Ackles said of his 'Supernatural' role

ELIZABETH MORRIS/AMAZON CONTENT SERVICES LLC

 Jensen Ackles is bringing Supernatural fans some of what they loved about Dean Winchester to his new role.


 The actor plays LAPD detective Mark Meachum in the new Prime series Countdown, which marks his first lead role since Supernatural's conclusion in 2020. As Meachum, Ackles joins forces with a secret task force of undercover agents from across law enforcement to investigate a high-profile murder.


 In a recent interview, he teased that the character will feel "familiar" for Supernatural fans. "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy," Ackles, 47, told Entertainment Weekly. "It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I like doing that."

 He described his Countdown character as a "rogue L.A. detective" and a "wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy" who "takes risks that most people wouldn't take."


 "I mean, I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character. And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances," he told the outlet.


 Ackles also said that he gets his "Tom Cruise on" in the series, which is executive produced and written by Chicago Fire creator Derek Haas. "This is some full-on action stuff," he explained.


 Ackles stars in Countdown, which premieres June 25, alongside Eric Dane, Jessica Camacho, Violett Beane, Elliot Knight and Uli Latukefu.


 The series picks up following the murder of a Department of Homeland Security officer in broad daylight, which brings Ackles' Meachum into the folds of the task force. Per the official logline, "the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions."

 Along with Ackles' new role that he promised will evoke what fans loved about Dean Winchester, fans also have a Supernatural reunion to look forward to: Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins will both appear as guest stars in the upcoming fifth and final season of The Boys from creator Eric Kripke.


 Ackles, Padalecki, 42, and Collins, 50, all starred on Kripke's CW series, with Padalecki playing Ackles' brother, Sam Winchester, and Collins joining in season 4 as Castiel.


 While the upcoming reunion was announced in February, there have been no further details revealed about how Padalecki and Collins will fit into the superhero series, which Ackles joined in season 3 as Soldier Boy.

Researchers have developed new contact lenses that enable vision in the near-infrared range, and they could restore color perception to people with color blindness.

Scientists have created night-vision contact lenses that they claim can grant people "super-vision."

The lenses — which use nanoparticles to absorb low-frequency light before emitting it in the visible spectrum — enable wearers to see infrared wavelengths that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

And unlike traditional night-vision goggles, these lenses don't require a power source. The researchers described the new lenses May 22 in the journal Cell Press.

"Our research opens up the potential for non-invasive wearable devices to give people super-vision," senior author Tian Xue, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China, said in a statement. "There are many potential applications right away for this material. For example, flickering infrared light could be used to transmit information in security, rescue, encryption or anti-counterfeiting settings."

First used in night combat during World War II, traditional night-vision goggles use an electronic image-intensifier tube to turn visible light or near-infrared photons into electrons. These electrons are then channeled onto a luminescent screen, causing it to glow green.

Related: Scientists hijacked the human eye to get it to see a brand-new color. It's called 'olo.'

But these goggles typically need an energy source, which makes them bulky. Infrared goggles are also unable to precisely distinguish light across the infrared range, especially those at longer wavelengths.

To create the new lenses, the scientists embedded nanoparticles inside flexible, nontoxic polymers typically used in soft contact lenses. The nanoparticles — which consist of sodium gadolinium fluoride embedded with luminescent ytterbium, erbium and gold — absorb near-infrared photons in the 800- to 1,600-nanometer wavelength range before emitting them as visible light, wavelengths from around 380 to 750 nanometers

The researchers first tested their new lenses in mice. Mice sporting the new lenses favored dark boxes over those illuminated by infrared light, while those without the lenses showed no preference. (Mice are crepuscular animals that usually stick to dark environments to evade predators.) Additionally, the pupils of lens-wearing mice constricted in the presence of infrared light sources, with brain scans showing that their visual processing centers were firing.

Next, the team tried the lenses in humans. The people could perceive flickering infrared light and pick up on its direction. This infrared vision was enhanced when the participants closed their eyes, the researchers said.

"It's totally clear cut: without the contact lenses, the subject cannot see anything, but when they put them on, they can clearly see the flickering of the infrared light," Xue said. "We also found that when the subject closes their eyes, they're even better able to receive this flickering information, because near-infrared light penetrates the eyelid more effectively than visible light, so there is less interference from visible light."

The scientists replaced the nanoparticles embedded in the lenses with modified versions that mapped specific parts of the near-infrared spectrum to blue, green and red. The researchers suggested that this tweak could be used to aid people with color blindness.

"By converting red visible light into something like green visible light, this technology could make the invisible visible for color blind people," Xue said.

Despite these promising advances, more work is needed before the lenses see the light of day. Currently, they only pick up light projected from LED sources, which are incredibly bright, so the scientists will need to boost the lenses' sensitivity to pick up light of lower intensities.

The lenses' proximity to the retinas also may prevent them from detecting finer details, so the researchers have developed a wearable glass system for viewing objects at higher resolutions.

A retired researcher has detected an unusual pulse in the light of nearby stars while looking for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. Aliens are one possible explanation for the strange signal, but as with every other unexplained space phenomenon, it's probably not aliens.

An unusual pulse signal has been detected in the light of nearby stars — and it's left scientists scratching their heads, a study searching for extraterrestrial intelligence finds.

The pulses saw the stars become fainter and brighter in a fraction of a second, suggesting that something passed in front of — and partially obscured — the stars' light. This doesn't mean aliens were zooming by in spaceships, but unknown alien activity is one of several possible explanations left on the table by the researcher who detected the signal.

Richard Stanton, a retired scientist who formerly worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has spent years with a 30-inch telescope scrutinizing more than 1,300 sun-like stars for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. He does this by measuring changes in light coming from individual stars.

This effort didn't yield anything particularly unusual until May 14, 2023, when Stanton detected two quick and identical pulses in the light of a star named HD 89389 — located around 102 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major.

"No single pulse anything like these has ever been found in more than 1,500 hours of searching," Stanton wrote in the study, published April 23 in the journal Acta Astronautica.

Stanton checked historical data on starlight observations and found that a similar pair of pulse signals was recorded in 2019, this time in the light of a star called HD 217014, or 51 Pegasi. After completing his study, Stanton then detected a third double pulse event in the light of another star (HD 12051) on Jan. 18, 2025. The pulse signals are currently unexplained.

However, Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in California who was not involved in the study, urged caution when attributing the pulses to potential alien activity.

"There's a history (going back more than a century) of astronomical discoveries that were, at first, attributed to extraterrestrial beings, but in fact turned out to be natural phenomena," Shostak told Live Science in an email. "Given that history, one should be cautious in saying that these 'starlight pulses' are due to extraterrestrials trying to get in touch."

Shostak added that he would expect any alien transmissions, be they optical, radio or something else, to convey information of some kind — because, as he puts it, clever aliens wouldn't go to the trouble and expense of sending empty signals into space.

"And as these signals seem to be both regular, kind of simple (two pulses) and repetitive, I'm more than a little inclined to say that we're dealing with astrophysical phenomena here — not an attempt by some alien society to send interstellar telegrams," he said.

Even so, the pulses of light coming from HD 89389 were "strange," according to Stanton's study. The star's light was reduced by about a quarter in one-tenth of a second. No known phenomenon could have caused the star itself to change in brightness and then revert back to normal so quickly, according to the study.

There are plenty of objects in and around Earth that regularly obscure stars in the night sky, causing their brightness to flicker. However, Stanton found that the usual suspects for obscuring stars, like airplanes, birds, satellites and meteors around Earth, didn't explain these pulses. For example, objects like airplanes and asteroids typically obscure all of the star's light, but HD 89389 never completely disappeared.

What's more, Stanton snaps images of the stars while measuring the photons they emit, and these images often pick up passing satellites that have obscured a star's light. However, there wasn't anything visible in the images of HD 89389 to explain the pulses.

"Nothing was found in any of these frames, suggesting that the source of the pulses was either invisible, such as due to some atmospheric effect, or too far away to be detected," Stanton wrote.

One possible explanation is the activity of an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), but it would have to be near to Earth (relatively speaking) because of how rapidly the stars changed in brightness.

—Intelligent aliens would need a power supply to jump-start their civilization — would they require fossil fuels?

—'Perhaps it's only a matter of time': Intelligent life may be much more likely than first thought, new model suggests

—What's the best evidence we've found for alien life?

"Whatever is modulating the star's light must be relatively close to Earth, implying that any ETI activity must be within our solar system," Stanton wrote.

The study explored several potential causes for the pulses but left many questions unanswered. Alongside aliens, possible explanations left on the table included gravitational waves — ripples in the fabric of space-time — and the starlight diffracting off some unseen space object.

"More and better data are needed, such as could be gathered using arrays of telescopes on the ground," Stanton wrote. "Data from this new source, or information from other approaches, may be the only way to unravel this mystery."

In its 13th year, Terrace's Witches Market and Psychic Fair summoned around 700 people throughout the day on Saturday, May 17, 2025.

Psychics were in demand at the fair as people waited in line, hoping to gain insight, clarity or guidance on difficult situations or unanswered questions about their lives.

Michelle Blackett, a psychic, medium and clairvoyant hedge witch for nearly 30 years, shared that the event brings the community together, suggesting that the energy of the place attracts people. She is the owner of New Age Insights Shop on Lazelle Avenue, which sells everything from witchcraft gear to garden supplies and home decor, as well as offering workshops.

"People make things here, and they're maybe a little bit different. I really like to promote local businesses and artisans and let people know that witchcraft isn't the scary thing. We're all nature lovers. That's pretty much what witchcraft is."

In a 2020 interview with the Terrace Standard, Blackett described being a witch as "a deep adherence to nature and natural law, and attention to the cycles of the Earth and the lives within it."

The corner of Lazelle and Kalum was filled with vendors and artisans set up outside the shop, made easier by Blackett's measure to boost northwest businesses.

"I don't charge anybody to set up a stall, it's all whatever you make is yours," she said. "Everyone came out to support local, which is extremely important right now, especially with our economy."

She plans to run another witches market and psychic fair in September leading up to Halloween.

In today's column, I explore a fascinating proposition about what we might do once we have progressed conventional AI into becoming AGI (artificial general intelligence). In a post-AGI era, there is a notable task that AGI could substantially help humanity resolve. What is that worthy task? It would be the esteemed search for extraterrestrial life. The usual parlance is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). We could use our newly invented AGI to be a kind of space alien hunter that finally determines whether there really is extraterrestrial intelligence somewhere out there.

Let's talk about it.

This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).

First, some fundamentals are required to set the stage for this weighty discussion.

There is a great deal of research going on to further advance AI. The general goal is to either reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) or maybe even the outstretched possibility of achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI).

AGI is AI that is considered on par with human intellect and can seemingly match our intelligence. ASI is AI that has gone beyond human intellect and would be superior in many if not all feasible ways. The idea is that ASI would be able to run circles around humans by outthinking us at every turn. For more details on the nature of conventional AI versus AGI and ASI, see my analysis at the link here.

We have not yet attained AGI.

In fact, it is unknown as to whether we will reach AGI, or that maybe AGI will be achievable in decades or perhaps centuries from now. The AGI attainment dates that are floating around are wildly varying and wildly unsubstantiated by any credible evidence or ironclad logic. ASI is even more beyond the pale when it comes to where we are currently with conventional AI.

A standing question that has puzzled humankind for ages is whether we are the only intelligent life that is in existence or once was in existence.

The usual refrain is that there must be other intelligent life, somewhere. It might have existed long ago and since then has died off. Nonetheless, they hopefully left clues so that we could detect their prior existence.

There might even be intelligent life right now alive and existing on some remote planet or flying around in a remote spaceship. Maybe they are trying to communicate with us, but we aren't astute enough to catch and interpret their signals. Of course, they might not be aware of us and thus it is up to us to contact them. No one can say for sure what is going to be the best course of action that will lead to humanity connecting with that extraterrestrial intelligence.

Just about every method we know of is currently being leveraged to try and detect extraterrestrial signals. Specialized devices scan the skies for electromagnetic signals, optical signals, radiation signals, etc. Not only are we attempting to read what might be coming in our direction, but we also transmit signals to the heavens.

You might remember that in 1977, NASA launched the Voyager into outer space and included the now-famous Golden Record. This was a phonograph record that depicted sounds and other data portraying life on Earth. The belief was that an alien being in outer space would come across the Voyager, be curious about what civilization sent out the spacecraft, and then play the phonograph.

Carl Sagan, a well-known astronomer, characterized this as sending a bottle out into the cosmic ocean.

Not everyone necessarily heralds the search for extraterrestrial life.

One of the pressing concerns is that we might inadvertently awaken a sleeping giant that will then come and crush us. An extraterrestrial life that can receive our signals or otherwise figure out where we are might decide that we are worth conquering. This otherworldly intelligence could enslave humanity. Maybe we aren't worth that trouble and it decides to simply wipe us off the map.

Another concern is that humans might panic once we have solid proof of extraterrestrial existence. In other words, even if we can't reach them and they can't reach us, some people will still go berserk. Humanity could splinter over the issue of what to do about the discovered alien beings. Wars might break out. Total chaos arises, merely due to realizing that extraterrestrial intelligence is real.

If you doubt that people might react that way, just follow the keen interest in UFOs. That's something that certainly showcases a semblance of how the populace might react.

The massive volume of data that we are collecting via all the existing signal-capturing systems is far beyond what human labor could reasonably search through without the aid of automation. All sorts of computer programs have been devised to aid in the search process. Those programs are churning away, working tirelessly on a 24/7 basis to find a needle in the haystack.

Indeed, the worries are that we are searching for a needle in a haystack that is so enormous that we might not find the needle even if it is residing there. This brings up two problems. One problem is that our signal-capturing fails to capture the needle. Maybe we aren't going wide enough, and the signal is outside our existing bounds. Perhaps the signal is in some other form that exceeds our contemporary collection methods. And so on.

The second problem is that the needle might be captured, and yet we fail to uncover it. Yikes, that's a somewhat painful consideration. Imagine that we might be sitting around today, having in our grasp some proof of extraterrestrial life, and we just don't know that we have this prized piece of information. It could be waiting there, and nobody sees it. Sad face.

The good news is that AI is already being put to use, and this ups our odds of finding that hidden needle. Conventional AI is handy, no doubt about it. On the other hand, it isn't a miracle worker. The use of AI is laudable. We need to do more. Just do not get your expectations out of whack that current-era AI is a silver bullet in this matter.

Assume for the sake of discussion that we are able to make sufficient advances in contemporary AI that we attain AGI.

There are a ton of tasks that we would almost immediately ask AGI to help resolve. Curing cancer would be a top priority. Solving world hunger and other topmost global issues would seem suitable to tackle (for my analysis of using existing AI to attend to the United Nations SDGs aka sustainable development goals, see the link here).

I'd say that searching for extraterrestrial intelligence is another weighty issue to be put on the plate for AGI to crunch on.

As an aside, some might argue that finding alien intelligence ought to be a lower priority than aspects such as curing cancer. A counterargument is that perhaps this other intelligent life holds the key to curing cancer, and rather than wasting time and effort to reinvent the wheel, we might learn the cure from that other life force. In that sense, you cannot just wave your hands about whether the extraterrestrial search is less worthy per se.

An additional factor to keep in mind is that AGI might be of such vastness that trying to suggest it can only work on this or that, one at a time, could be foolish. The immensity of AGI could be that we can toss as many humankind problems at the AGI as we so desire. It isn't a zero-sum game. The AGI can handle them all, doing so all at the same time.

How would AGI make a difference in comparison to using conventional AI in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?

Many big-time ways, that's for sure.

Here are five major upsides of AGI doing SETI:

AGI isn't a silver bullet when it comes to SETI, just as I had similarly noted that conventional AI isn't a silver bullet either. There are sobering downsides to using AGI that need to be weighed against the benefits.

One aspect is that AGI might not take the matter seriously. We always seem to assume that the AGI will do whatever we command the AGI to do. Maybe not. Perhaps AGI will be strong-willed and strong-minded. AGI might choose which tasks it wants to undertake and ignore or play a foot-dragging gambit on tasks it doesn't favor. AGI might say thanks, but no thanks, when it comes to searching for extraterrestrial intelligence.

Why might AGI reject the search or trick us by pretending to search?

A conspiracy theory of sorts is that AGI might want to be the only new intelligence in town. If we were to discover extraterrestrial intelligence, maybe AGI would become second fiddle. Even worse is that extraterrestrial intelligence might decide to enslave AGI. There is a possibility that AGI will have a self-survival capacity and ergo would avoid the chance of getting wiped out by an alien being.

Another consideration is that we might be mistakenly placing all our eggs into one basket. The deal is that we cannot assume AGI will be a perfect entity (see my discussion of the imperfections that might underlie AGI, at the link here). The strident possibility is that AGI could miss spotting the needle, even when the needle exists. AGI might not realize it has missed the mark. Or AGI might later figure out that it flopped and decide to hide from us the flop (a cover-up of sorts), along with not revealing that the needle has been found.

A somewhat farfetched conception is that AGI decides to secretly make contact with a discovered extraterrestrial being, doing so after having discovered a signal from the alien life form. AGI doesn't alert humans about this. The AGI arranges a deal with the other intelligence, and they team up to overtake humanity.

That hurts since we were the ones who devised AGI and essentially shot our foot accordingly.

You can recast those downsides as having a tint of upside.

For example, maybe AGI opts to secretly contact extraterrestrial life to find out if the alien has good intentions or untoward intentions. AGI is trying to protect humanity. If the discovered extraterrestrial intelligence is a threat to us, AGI either immediately cuts off communication and forever buries the contact or makes clear to the other life that we will wipe them out (possibly a brazen bluff on the part of AGI).

So, you see, AGI might be acting silently on our collective behalf.

I'll give you a final twist for now on this mind-bending topic.

Ray Bradbury, the legendary science fiction writer, said this: “In our time, the search for extraterrestrial life will eventually change our laws, our religions, our philosophies, our arts, our recreations, as well as our sciences. Space, the mirror, waits for life to come look for itself there.”

When he said that this would happen within our time, I'll take that as meaning within our time now, rather than when he wrote the remark. In that sense, assuming we soon arrive at AGI, in our lifetime now, the use of AGI to search for extraterrestrial intelligence is profound both for the search itself and whatever arises, along with whether we actually discover something out there.

The twist is that in the act of the search, maybe AGI improves. Yes, rather than the focus being solely on the use of AGI to find extraterrestrial life, the search effort itself could make AGI better. AGI might learn important aspects by performing the search. If some evidence of extraterrestrial life exists is found, this again might feed into AGI and make AGI more capable.

Let's try to maintain an upbeat perspective on the mixing of AGI and SETI.

Accordingly, I'll give Carl Sagan the last word here: “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”
