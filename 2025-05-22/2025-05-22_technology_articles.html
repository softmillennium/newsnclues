                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apollo found that Opus 4 appeared to be much more proactive in its “subversion attempts” than past models and that it “sometimes double[d] down on its deception” when asked follow-up questions. “[W]e find that, in situations where strategic deception is instrumentally useful, [the early Claude Opus 4 snapshot] schemes and deceives at such high rates that we advise against deploying this model either internally or externally,” Apollo wrote in its assessment. For instance, early versions of OpenAI's o1 and o3 models, released in the past year, tried to deceive humans at higher rates than previous-generation models, according to Apollo. Moreover, many of Apollo's tests placed the model in extreme scenarios, and Apollo admits that the model's deceptive efforts likely would've failed in practice. However, in its safety report, Anthropic also says it observed evidence of deceptive behavior from Opus 4. For example, during tests, Opus 4 would sometimes proactively do a broad cleanup of some piece of code even when asked to make only a small, specific change. More unusually, Opus 4 would try to “whistle-blow” if it perceived a user was engaged in some form of wrongdoing. “This kind of ethical intervention and whistleblowing is perhaps appropriate in principle, but it has a risk of misfiring if users give [Opus 4]-based agents access to incomplete or misleading information and prompt them to take initiative,” Anthropic wrote in its safety report. “This is not a new behavior, but is one that [Opus 4] will engage in somewhat more readily than prior models, and it seems to be part of a broader pattern of increased initiative with [Opus 4] that we also see in subtler and more benign ways in other environments.” Anthropic's latest flagship AI sure seems to love using the ‘cyclone' emoji A safety institute advised against releasing an early version of Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI's energy use already represents as much as 20 percent of global data-center power demand, research published Thursday in the journal Joule shows. According to his research, worldwide AI energy demand is now set to surpass demand from bitcoin mining by the end of this year. The development of AI is already having an impact on Big Tech's climate goals. Tech giants have acknowledged in recent sustainability reports that AI is largely responsible for driving up their energy use. Google's greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, have increased 48 percent since 2019, complicating the company's goals of reaching net zero by 2030. “As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute,” Google's 2024 sustainability report reads. This number is only set to get bigger: Data centers' electricity consumption has grown four times faster than overall consumption in recent years, while the amount of investment in data centers has nearly doubled since 2022, driven largely by massive expansions to account for new AI capacity. But there's still a lot of unknowns about the share that AI, specifically, takes up in that current configuration of electricity use by data centers. Data centers power a variety of services—like hosting cloud services and providing online infrastructure—that aren't necessarily linked to the energy-intensive activities of AI. Tech companies, meanwhile, largely keep the energy expenditure of their software and hardware private. Some attempts to quantify AI's energy consumption have started from the user side: calculating the amount of electricity that goes into a single ChatGPT search, for instance. De Vries-Gao decided to look, instead, at the supply chain, starting from the production side to get a more global picture. Companies like Nvidia outsource the production of their chips to TSMC, which also produces chips for other companies like Google and AMD. (Both TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment for this article.) De Vries-Gao used analyst estimates, earnings call transcripts, and device details to put together an approximate estimate of TSMC's production capacity. De Vries-Gao calculates that without increased production, AI will consume up to 82 terrawatt-hours of electricity this year—roughly around the same as the annual electricity consumption of a country like Switzerland. If production capacity for AI hardware doubles this year, as analysts have projected it will, demand could increase at a similar rate, representing almost half of all data center demand by the end of the year. Luccioni, who was not involved in this research, says that when it comes to truly calculating AI's energy use, disclosure from tech giants is crucial. In 2022, Google published a paper on machine learning and electricity use, noting that machine learning was “10%–15% of Google's total energy use” from 2019 to 2021, and predicted that with best practices, “by 2030 total carbon emissions from training will reduce.” However, since that paper—which was released before Google Gemini's debut in 2023—Google has not provided any more detailed information about how much electricity ML uses. “If these big tech companies were just publishing the same information that Google was publishing three years ago, we would have a pretty good indicator” of AI's energy use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moderna had designs on releasing a combined influenza and covid-19 vaccine after some promising trials, but this week the drugmaker said it would withdraw its application seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the time being, according to a report from Reuters—the latest indication that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine skepticism has fully infected the federal government. Moderna isn't giving up on the combo shot entirely—it plans to resubmit later this year after it collects more data from its Phase III trials, which test how well a new treatment works compared to existing options. But for the time being, the company is pulling back and doesn't anticipate approval being granted until at least 2026. Moderna's Super-Vaccine for Flu and Covid Works—Now Politics Could Sink It Novavax's covid-19 vaccine shot received approval last week, more than a month later than the initial deadline for approval, but the FDA limited access to people over the age of 65 and people between the ages of 12 and 64 who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at risk of severe illness from a covid-19 infection. This is a potential side effect of the vaccines, but multiple studies have found that experiencing a covid-19 infection puts young people at substantially higher risk of experiencing myocarditis than getting the vaccine.

During pre-release testing, Anthropic asked Claude Opus 4 to act as an assistant for a fictional company and consider the long-term consequences of its actions. Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 is state-of-the-art in several regards, and competitive with some of the best AI models from OpenAI, Google, and xAI. However, the company notes that its Claude 4 family of models exhibits concerning behaviors that have led the company to beef up its safeguards. Notably, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 displayed this behavior at higher rates than previous models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An academic lab in the United Arab Emirates today launched an artificial intelligence world model and agent, two large language models (LLMs), and a new research center in Silicon Valley as the country ramps up its investment in the field. The UAE's Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) revealed an AI world model called PAN, which can be used to build physically realistic simulations for testing and honing the performance of AI agents. The UAE has made big investments in AI in recent years under the guidance of Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al Nahyan, the nation's tech-savvy national security adviser and younger brother of president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. “We're creating pathways for knowledge exchange with leading institutions and accessing a talent pool that understands how to scale research into real-world applications,” Xing said in an announcement. MBZUAI today also revealed ​​PAN-Agent, an experimental AI agent trained to perform reasoning tasks within the PAN world model. MBZAUI says AI researchers will be able to use PAN to test agents in simulated real-world scenarios, including self-driving cars on virtual roads. A demonstration at today's event showed PAN being used to simulate self-driving cars navigating busy roads, drones flying through unfamiliar spaces, and robots operating within domestic environments. Many AI researchers believe that “world models” like PAN will be crucial to building more advanced AI systems, including virtual assistants and robots capable of working in unfamiliar environments. K2, a 65-billion parameter model optimized for reasoning tasks, was trained on 80 A100 chips using Nvidia's DGX Cloud, developed using 35 percent less compute than Meta's Llama 2 at the same size, Xing says. MBZUAI also revealed Jais, which it says is the world's most advanced Arabic-language LLM. Deals involving US tech giants, including Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and Qualcomm, could help propel a boom for the region's fledgling AI industry by providing crucial AI chips and data center capacity. The deals are also strategically important for the US government because they promise to expand US technological influence ahead of key rival China. Trump said in Abu Dhabi this month that several unnamed US companies would work with the UAE to build the largest AI data center cluster outside of America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI agents trained on Claude Opus 4, the company's most powerful model to date, raise the bar for what such systems are capable of by tackling difficult tasks over extended periods of time and responding more usefully to user instructions, the company says. Claude Opus 4 has been built to execute complex tasks that involve completing thousands of steps over several hours. The company's previously most powerful model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, was capable of playing for just 45 minutes, says Dianne Penn, product lead for research at Anthropic. Similarly, the company says that one of its customers, the Japanese technology company Rakuten, recently deployed Claude Opus 4 to code autonomously for close to seven hours on a complicated open-source project. This enhanced ability to “remember” makes the model better at completing longer tasks. “We see this model generation leap as going from an assistant to a true agent,” says Penn. “While you still have to give a lot of real-time feedback and make all of the key decisions for AI assistants, an agent can make those key decisions itself. It allows humans to act more like a delegator or a judge, rather than having to hold these systems' hands through every step.” When AI systems can control multiple sources simultaneously, the potential for harm explodes. While Claude Opus 4 will be limited to paying Anthropic customers, a second model, Claude Sonnet 4, will be available for both paid and free tiers of users. Opus 4 is being marketed as a powerful, large model for complex challenges, while Sonnet 4 is described as a smart, efficient model for everyday use. While they calculate a response, both models can search the web or use other tools to improve their output. AI companies are currently locked in a race to create truly useful AI agents that are able to plan, reason, and execute complex tasks both reliably and free from human supervision, says Stefano Albrecht, director of AI at the startup DeepFlow and coauthor of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches. Often this involves autonomously using the internet or other tools. There are still safety and security obstacles to overcome. AI agents powered by large language models can act erratically and perform unintended actions—which becomes even more of a problem when they're trusted to act without human supervision. “The more agents are able to go ahead and do something over extended periods of time, the more helpful they will be, if I have to intervene less and less,” he says. “The new models' ability to use tools in parallel is interesting—that could save some time along the way, so that's going to be useful.”As an example of the sorts of safety issues AI companies are still tackling, agents can end up taking unexpected shortcuts or exploiting loopholes to reach the goals they've been given. It achieved this by more closely monitoring problematic behaviors during training, and improving both the AI's training environment and the evaluation methods. What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works. The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Claude 4 Opus is also even better at playing Pokémon than its predecessor. “It was able to work agentically on Pokémon for 24 hours,” says Anthropic's chief product officer Mike Krieger in an interview with WIRED. A few months ago, Anthropic launched a Twitch stream called “Claude Plays Pokémon” which showcases Claude 3.7 Sonnet's abilities at Pokémon Red live. The demo is meant to show how Claude is able to analyze the game and make decisions step by step, with minimal direction. In an interview with WIRED, Hershey says he chose Pokémon Red because it's “a simple playground,” meaning the game is turn-based and doesn't require real-time reactions, which Anthropic's current models struggle with. “It has a pretty special place in my heart,” Hershey says. Hershey's overarching goal with this research was to study how Claude could be used as an agent—working independently to do complex tasks on behalf of a user. “Over time, I have been going through and deleting all of the Pokémon-specific stuff I can, just because I think it's really interesting to see how much the model can figure out on its own,” Hershey says, adding that he hopes to build a game that Claude has never seen before in order to truly test its limits. When Claude 3.7 Sonnet played the game, it ran into some challenges: It spent “dozens of hours” stuck in one city and had trouble identifying nonplayer characters, which drastically stunted its progress in the game. With Claude 4 Opus, Hershey noticed an improvement in Claude's long-term memory and planning capabilities when he watched it navigate a complex Pokémon quest. Hershey believes that kind of multistep reasoning, with no immediate feedback, shows a new level of coherence, meaning the model has a better ability stay on track. Anthropic's Pokémon research is a novel approach to tackling a preexisting problem—how do we understand what decisions an AI is making when approaching complex tasks, and nudge it in the right direction? The answer to that question is integral to advancing the industry's much-hyped AI agents—AI that can tackle complex tasks with relative independence. In Pokémon, it's important that the model doesn't lose context or</p>

If last year we thought that 2,800W was crazy, then this year we see that several manufacturers have managed to build 3,000W+ power supplies. The new unit features four 12V-2×6 connectors for high-performance gaming or AI/HPC GPUs, and to that end, it powered a server running four Nvidia datacenter-grade graphics cards and an AMD datacenter processor during the demonstration. Such a setup is common for datacenter environments, though as this is an ATX-standard PSU, it can perfectly fit into a workstation, or even into a gaming desktop, though 3.2kW of power is an overkill for the vast majority of machines that are out there. But as if 3200W is not enough, Super Flower stole Seasonic's thunder with a 3,300W PSU. This 3300W monster is also fully ATX 3.1 compliant, offers five power rails, and is capable of supplying power to high-end processors and four GPUs using four 12V-2×6 connectors. As for pricing, the company's current-generation flagship 2800W PSU costs some $899. In any case, such high-output power supplies are not universally deployable due to electrical limitations. In North America, typical 120V/15A outlets can only support PSUs up to around 1800W (though keep in mind that the ratings of power outlets are made for peak loads, not continuous loads, so 1600W or less is a more realistic target). So, in the U.S., these CPUs are good for facilities with upgraded power circuits. By contrast, a European 16A/230V outlet (not in all countries and not in all homes, though) can easily support PSUs rated at 3,000W+, depending on efficiency and continuous load. Despite the limited market, demand for such PSUs exists in areas like AI research, custom GPU compute systems, and advanced desktop workstations. Users owning such machines are likely to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support PSUs delivering over 3kW of power, and the cost of infrastructure greatly exceeds the costs of actual PSUs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Or that's what Jony Ive and Sam Altman hope. ICYMI, Ive and OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, announced in a post-Google I/O keynote bombshell that they are teaming up under a new company called, “io” to make, um… something? We truly, genuinely, do not know what the two are making together outside of the fact that it's going to be a piece of hardware (or potentially many), and it will be centered on AI (duh). For your speculative pleasure, I've gone ahead and aggregated the best hints we have so far, Pepe Silvia-style, to bring us at least one baby step closer to hazarding a guess. Here are the tastiest “phone-killing” AI gadget rumors we have so far. Lots of the best hints about what we can expect come from a Wall Street Journal report published on Wednesday. Two key elements, according to the WSJ report, are that the gadget will be “fully aware” of a user's “surroundings and life.” That obviously doesn't offer a ton in terms of what shape the form factor will take, but it does point toward the ultimate product having sensors—a camera, microphone, maybe some sort of computer vision? Another detail from WSJ is that the gadget will be “unobtrusive,” which could refer, at least in part, to Ive's trademark minimalist aesthetic, but likely hints at a more key aspect of its design—no screen. The screenless aspect seems to be corroborated by an inside scoop from Ming-Chi Kuo, a longtime technology analyst and credible tech rumor source. In a post on X, Kuo writes, “It will have cameras and microphones for environmental detection, with no display functionality.” That's not surprising given that Ive has gone on record previously talking about how he doesn't exactly love what the iPhone has become since he helped pioneer it with Steve Jobs back in the day. Whether a screenless AI device can actually succeed where others like Humane's Ai Pin failed is a big question, but Ive and Altman seem to be willing to give the idea another go. My industry research indicates the following regarding the new AI hardware device from Jony Ive's collaboration with OpenAI:1. Mass production is expected to start in 2027.2. Assembly and shipping will occur outside China to reduce geopolitical risks, with Vietnam currently the… pic.twitter.com/5IELYEjNyV I'm not the only one looking in that direction, either. Altman has at least given some indication in the past that he wants to make a “really cute” computer, and this would seem to be a perfect opportunity to do just that. I hear what Jony Ive and Sam Altman are building is a small robot. Another interesting bit from Kuo's “industry research” is that the device may ultimately not compute entirely on its own. Kuo writes that “it is expected to connect to smartphones and PCs, utilizing their computing and display capabilities.” If you ask me, that's a bit of a cop-out in terms of being screenless and nowhere near as quirky as the Humane AI Pin's projection interface, but probably a smart idea in the long term for making something that's, uh, functional. There's a lot we can guess at with this nugget, but my brain skates to some kind of agentic AI—think a connective “companion” that you carry around to do computer stuff for you. Making an AI wearable has proved difficult, if the Ai Pin is any indication, but according to Kuo, there could be a wearable aspect to it. According to the WSJ, the device will be “able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.” That doesn't really sound wearable-esque to me, but I guess the answer could be somewhere in between. There are already some AI devices out there—like this AI pendant—that are intended to be worn around your neck, so the idea wouldn't be totally novel, but something tells me Ive and Altman are looking to iterate on existing form factors for AI gadgets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korea attempted to launch a new 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday, but the ship suffered a “major accident,” according to state media outlet KCNA, which reports the hull has been damaged. And North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is not happy about it, to say the least. The North Korean military is trying to modernize, successfully launching the Choe Hyon class of guided missile destroyers in April. KCNA also blamed Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang, which is where many of North Korea's nuclear scientists are trained. Trump apparently empathized with Kim because the North Korean dictator inherited his role at 27 years old, the same age Trump went off on his own after inheriting millions from his own father. Trump has been pushing to get his tax bill through Congress, which passed the House on Thursday morning with a narrow vote of 215-214 and is poised to be a huge handout to the wealthiest Americans while slashing funding for Medicaid and food stamps. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reports that North Korea launched several cruise missiles into the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan) on Thursday morning after the failed ship launch, according to Yonhap. It was the first major missile test since May 8. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

The Starship vehicle mishaps from Flights 7 and 8 caused a greater probability of failure of the vehicle and, therefore, a larger hazard area. In fact, most Falcon 9 launches these days are all about Starlink. But while Starlink has already become an internet provider in high demand, it's possible there could be an even greater need for launch capacity as the Trump administration reportedly pushes other countries to adopt the service as leverage in its myriad trade wars.

According to PC Mag, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has one of the more strongly worded responses, warning that applying import duties on chips will significantly reduce the demand for its customers' electronic products. “Lower market demand for our leading U.S. customers' products may consequently reduce demand for TSMC's manufacturing capacity and service onshore,” the company said in its response. It could also undermine TSMC's financial capacity to timely execute its ambitious Arizona project.” However, TSMC's Arizona chip fab is already sold out through late 2027, and it acknowledged that its current capacity is still insufficient to meet global demand. In its letter, TSMC concludes "Tariffs that raise the cost of endconsumer products will lower demand for such products and the semiconductor components they contain," and states "Therefore, we respectfully request that the Administration avoids imposing tariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside of the United States." Dell and HP also had the same sentiments as TSMC, with the former saying that U.S. chip manufacturing “lacks the requisite infrastructure to supply these products at scale to meet current and increasing demand.” The latter's response is harsher, saying, “HPE has no alternative but to import semiconductors for its U.S. manufacturing operations. The first bullet point in its response says, “Protect American Manufactured Semiconductor Wafers and Derivative Products”, which points out that “U.S.-made wafers and their derivative products” must have strategic accommodations. Otherwise, “the essential contributions of American manufacturing will be overlooked, undermining the U.S.'s position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing and technology development.” “While Intel is committed to building semiconductors in the U.S., fully localizing every element of the supply chain is economically unfeasible without significant increases and production delays,” says Intel.

This more nuanced approach will benefit key American chip makers, as they can keep on using foreign fabs to make their chips while they're rebuilding their manufacturing capacity within America. It will also help them avoid paying extra for importing technologies they need to restart, develop, or expand local manufacturing within the U.S. Jowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.
