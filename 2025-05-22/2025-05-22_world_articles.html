                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Almost all of those interviewed for the report said officials ignored their repeated attempts to request asylum. Dozens of non-Costa Rican nationals who were deported to Costa Rica by the Trump administration in February say they did not receive an asylum screening interview before being expelled, according to a report released by Human Rights Watch on Thursday. In some cases, U.S. officials separated families when carrying out the expulsions to Costa Rica. The United States expelled 200 third-country nationals, including 81 children, to Costa Rica on two flights at the end of February 2025.They were fleeing war, persecution, or other serious threats. In a new report, HRW documents the US expulsions: https://t.co/M5Jd088Sxq pic.twitter.com/AAYo2wUqFB Human Rights Watch interviewed dozens of the migrants sent to Costa Rica and heard stories from those people that, “if true, indicate that people fled persecution based on factors such as ethnicity, religion, gender, family associations, and political opinion.” Some of the people whom Human Rights Watch spoke to had been in Mexico and made appointments to present themselves at a U.S. point of entry to seek asylum through an application developed by CBP, CBP One. When the Trump administration canceled all pending appointments through CBP One, some went to U.S. checkpoints to request asylum, while others crossed irregularly, such as by climbing over or through gaps in the border wall and then sought out or “waited for” U.S. border agents, according to the report. Once apprehended, those who spoke to Human Rights Watch reported conditions such as freezing temperatures, little access to showers, and families being separated while being held at immigration processing centers. The people interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported that they were not given the necessary documents required to be issued during a deportation proceeding. Human Rights Watch says those deported were then initially subject to arbitrary detention in Costa Rica, and in practice they were not allowed to freely leave the center where they were being held except under certain circumstances. The Costa Rican government says they were not “detained” and indicated instead that freedom of movement was limited for their own safety, according to the report. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem posts copy of department's letter to university on X The Trump administration has said it is halting Harvard University's ability to enroll international students and has ordered existing international students at the university to transfer or lose their legal status. In it Noem said: “I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked.” “The revocation of your Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification means that Harvard is prohibited from having any aliens on F- or J-nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic school year. This decertification also means that existing aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status must transfer to another university in order to maintain their nonimmigrant status,” Noem continued. Noem justified the decision by saying: “This action should not surprise you and is the unfortunate result of Harvard's failure to comply with simple reporting requirements … Consequences must follow to send a clear signal to Harvard and all universities that want to enjoy the privilege of enrolling foreign students, that the Trump administration will enforce the law and root out the evils of anti-Americanism and antisemitism in society and campuses.” The former governor of South Dakota also accused Harvard of “fostering violence, antisemitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist party on its campus”. In a separate press release, the homeland security department said: “Secretary Noem is following through on her promise to protect students and prohibit terrorist sympathizers from receiving benefits from the US government.” “Every tool available they should use to try and change this. It could be all the legal resources suing the Trump administration, whatever they can use the endowment to, whatever they can use their political network in Congress,” Gerdén said, adding: “This should be, by far, priority number one.” International students make up about 27% of the university's population. A Trump-appointed antisemitism taskforce has pointed to “just how radical Harvard has become” as nationwide anti-war protesters – including students – demonstrated against Israel's deadly onslaught on Gaza, which has killed at least 53,000 Palestinians in the last year and a half. The Trump administration has also ordered the university to dismantle its diversity, equity and inclusion programming, restrict student protests, and disclose admission details to federal officials. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, said in April that “no government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian armed forces are creating a “security buffer zone” along the border between Russia and Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday. Enemy firing points are being actively suppressed, the work is underway,” Putin said. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said the plan was “aggressive” and demonstrated that “Russia is the obstacle of peace efforts now.” Related article Ukraine, Russia say drone strikes continue after Trump-Putin call Thursday's announcement was made ahead of an expected prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia on Friday – an outcome of last week's face-to-face talks in Turkey, the first time the two countries have held direct talks at any level in three years. “(We must) help people return to their native villages, settlements, (and) where security conditions allow, restore all transport and other infrastructure,” Putin added. The Russian leader is planning on hosting a dedicated meeting to discuss the “restoration” projects, Russian state media reported on Thursday. Twelve civilians – including two children – were injured in a Ukrainian strike on the town of Lgov in Kursk, the region's acting governor said Thursday. According to an initial assessment, four vehicles, two houses and one apartment building were also damaged in the “massive” strike, the official said. Putin also said during his visit that Ukrainian forces were trying to move toward the Russian border, according to RIA Novosti news agency. Kyiv launched its offensive into the Russian border territory last August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – and had held control of parts of the region until late last month. Kyiv had intended on using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks. Such dialogue did not materialize until last week, when teams from Kyiv and Moscow met in person in Turkey to begin discussing an end to the war and agreed upon a prisoner exchange – 1,000 people from each side. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia had received Ukraine's proposed list of prisoners of war to be exchanged in Friday's expected swap, according to Russian state media. “Yes, indeed, we have received it now,” Peskov was reported as saying when asked about the Ukrainian list. We are working to ensure that this result is achieved,” Zelensky posted. CNN's Lex Harvey and Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A summer reading list that was part of a syndicated insert in the once-storied Chicago Sun-Times newspaper and elsewhere promoted a bunch of books that didn't exist, even if their purported authors were real. When readers noticed, the freelancer who had been hired by a third party to write the guide admitted that he had used AI. In a statement, the Sun-Times confessed that the work had not been reviewed by their editors and had been presented to readers without acknowledging that it came from a third party. “This should be a learning moment for all journalism organizations,” it said. “Our work is valued – and valuable – because of the humanity behind it." The blunder drew headlines and many red faces, and probably ruined at least one person's career – not to mention that it prevented real books that authors have actually laboured over from being promoted. But it was also an illustration of the current hollowed-out media landscape. There was a much more serious error reported by multiple media outlets around the world this week – one that has not only failed to be prominently corrected, but has been repeated again and again even after the clarification was made. When I first heard a report on the CBC about the famine in Gaza being projected to kill 14,000 babies in 48 hours if aid did not reach them, I thought it seemed off. When I went looking, it appeared to check out: the number came from a United Nations official, speaking to the BBC. It was widely reported and cited in political discussions. But at any point, did any of the journalists who repeated that number have a moment like I did and think: hmmm, that doesn't make sense? As it turns out, the UN official was wrong. He was quoting from a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) that warned of 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition in young children in Gaza between April, 2025 and March, 2026. Even once the error became clear, it was still being quoted – for instance, by CBC Radio's flagship news program, The Current. Here's what also happened on Wednesday: two staff members of Washington's Israeli embassy were gunned down outside a Jewish museum there. The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were about to be engaged. Mr. Lischinsky‘s last activity on X was sharing an Israeli official's criticism of what he (and many others) have called the “blood libel” of the erroneous 48-hours statistic. To be absolutely clear, there is no evidence of any connection between the inaccurate reporting around this figure and this horrible crime. But it should remind us that, especially in this charged environment, when the media gets both the message and the facts wrong, it can be more than just embarrassing - there can be real-world consequences. Did you hear Donald Trump berate a reporter that same day in Washington? NBC‘s Peter Alexander had asked about the gift of a decked-out private 747 from Qatar, which has raised obvious ethical and security concerns. You know what they say: there's no such thing as a free jet. How did Mr. Trump respond to the absolutely fair question? “No more questions from you.” He also went off on ABC and CBS. These reporters are brave – not for asking pointed questions to a belligerent man-baby who debates by insult and yelling “fake news,” but for continuing to do their jobs with integrity in a high-pressure climate now dripping with authoritarian chill and inflamed by the irresponsible rhetoric of the world‘s most powerful person. We must do our best – to prove the media-haters wrong, and get it right. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary says Trump is ‘saddened and outraged' by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC Suspect's home raided after shooting of Israeli embassy staff In a preview of coming events, Leavitt looks ahead to Trump's birthday, which coincides with the US army turning 250. President Trump will be joined by veterans, active-duty troops, wounded warriors, Gold Star families and patriotic Americans from across the country. Trump will attend the G20 summit in Canada from 15 to 17 June, Leavitt confirms. Leavitt says “hatred has no place in the United States”. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), the US's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has condemned political violence as “completely unacceptable” after a deadly attack on Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC, and said that the crime does not reflect or represent the millions of Americans peacefully advocating for an end to US support for the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza. We condemn last night's deadly attack on Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC. While millions of Americans feel extreme frustration at the sight of the Israeli government slaughtering Palestinian men, women and children on a daily basis with weapons paid for with our taxpayer dollars, political violence is an unacceptable crime and is not the answer. Peaceful protest, civil disobedience and political engagement are the only appropriate and acceptable tools to advocate for policy change in our nation, including an end to US support for the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza. Yechiel Leiter, a hardline supporter of Israel's war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank, also told reporters: Israel has a right to exist that goes back over 3,000 years, long before there was anything called Palestine as a geographic location. For the uninitiated, here's more about Leiter from my colleague Andrew Roth: He says Donald Trump just spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu. He repeats the claim that there has been a wave of violent antisemitism across US university campuses. A Republican push to dismantle clean energy incentives threatens to reverberate across the US by costing more than 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households and threatening to unleash millions more tonnes of the planet-heating pollution that is causing the climate crisis, experts have warned. A major tax bill moving through the Republican-held House of Representatives will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US. Under the reconciliation bill, tax credits for cleaner cars will end this year, with incentives for wind, solar and even nuclear energy projects scaled down and then eliminated by 2032. Clean energy manufacturing tax credits will be axed by 2031, while Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances will get no further subsidy after the end of this year. “This bill is worse than what people envisioned – it pulls the rug out from facilities banking on these incentives, it raises everyday household costs by hundreds of dollars and undercuts any sort of action on climate change,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan climate policy thinktank. “You can't overstate how significant this will be in weakening the US's position. With inflation, tariffs and rising electricity use, it really couldn't come at a worse time. Facing a barrage of false claims from Donald Trump that white people were being persecuted in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa remained composed, pushed back politely and even tried to joke with Trump, earning him praise back home, reports Reuters. His conduct was in keeping with the proud diplomatic tradition of President Nelson Mandela. Repeatedly interrupted by Trump, Ramaphosa calmly challenged claims that minority Afrikaners were the targets of a “white genocide”, the once fringe theory has been exponentially amplified by Trump and his South African-born ally Elon Musk. The way he handled Trump's onslaught was mostly drawing praise back home on Thursday. Ramaphosa's extensive network was evident in the Oval Office, where he was accompanied by luxury goods billionaire Johann Rupert, South Africa's richest man, and by champion golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen. “It was pragmatic of him to bring the golfers and Rupert, they are the sort of people Trump likes to speak with,” said Mathekga. Even after Trump began his attacks and played a video that falsely purported to show thousands of graves of white farmers in South Africa and flipped through printouts of news stories he claimed were of white people killed in the country, Ramaphosa tried to defuse tensions with humour. “I wish you did,” he said, before resuming his attacks. The Trump administration then aimed to block Khalil from a “contact visit”, only permitting him to meet with his wife and son from behind a barrier. After days of legal fighting, triggering claims by Khalil's attorneys that he is being subject to political retaliation by the government, a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz, intervened last night, allowing the meeting to go forward on Thursday morning. Farbiarz is currently considering Khalil's petition for release as he appeals a Louisiana immigration judge's ruling that he can be deported from the country. Federal authorities have not accused Khalil of a crime, but have sought to deport him on the basis that his prominent role in protests against Israel's war in Gaza may have “undermined US foreign policy interests”. Khalil is scheduled to appear before that immigration judge, Jamee Comans, for a routine hearing later today. Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, co-founder of the Mizrahi Family Charitable Fund and friend and colleague of Sarah Milgrim, one of the two Israeli embassy staffers shot dead last night in Washington DC, says she has a “broken heart” in a tribute she wrote to Milgram published in the Times of Israel. Sarah was a young, passionate, and brilliant environmental advocate. Just eight days ago, I spoke with her about an upcoming climate initiative. Recently, I attended an Earth Day event she co-organized, which featured Israeli environmental nonprofit leaders. Her loss is devastating not only to her family and friends but to the entire global environmental and Jewish communities.” The president wrote that the bill “includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for the Golden Dome.” He added that the “Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination”. “We were shocked and saddened to learn that an AOIA employee has been arrested as a suspect in this horrific crime,” the statement reads. A federal judge has blocked Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs. US district judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump's goal to dismantle the department. They said it left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including supporting special education, distributing financial aid and enforcing civil rights laws. Bomb technicians were also reportedly present at the scene. One sign read “Justice for Wadea,” a reference to the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy killed in Chicago two years ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israel will not end its genocide in Gaza until it achieves its goal of the total forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, as outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump in his “Riviera” plan that experts say would violate international law. He said that the only way Israel will end its assault is if Palestinians in Gaza are totally disarmed and Trump's plan is realized — meaning that Gaza will be emptied of Palestinians, either by death or expulsion. In other words, Netanyahu has said that Israel will not agree to stop its slaughter until it can declare total victory. “I am ready to end the war on clear terms that will ensure Israel's security — all the hostages returned home, Hamas lays down its weapons, its leadership is overthrown, Gaza is completely demilitarized and the Trump plan is implemented,” Netanyahu said. Hamas said that Netanyahu's statements are yet another way of sabotaging any negotiations over a ceasefire agreement and guaranteeing that there will be no captive exchange. Top human rights experts have said that the plan is outrageous and represents forced displacement, a crime worse than ethnic cleansing. Netanyahu called Trump's plan “brilliant” and “revolutionary” in his remarks. This plan has been widely denounced by humanitarians, who would be kicked out of the Strip and replaced by world powers whose goal is not to serve the people of Gaza, but to seize further control over Palestinian land and advance the genocide. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

MOSCOW, May 22. /TASS/. A decision has been made to establish a security buffer zone along the Russia-Ukraine border, Russian troops are currently engaged in implementing this initiative, President Vladimir Putin announced during a meeting with government officials.

"We have approved the creation of a necessary security buffer zone along our borders. Our armed forces are actively working to accomplish this task," Putin stated.

He emphasized that, given the recent developments in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions, immediate efforts are required to restore and rebuild areas affected by recent events. This includes assisting local residents in returning to their native villages, provided security conditions allow. Furthermore, it is essential to rehabilitate transportation networks and other infrastructure, ensure the smooth operation of industrial and agricultural enterprises, and support entrepreneurs and their employees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has brought nine more children from Russian-occupied territories to Ukrainian-controlled areas, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said on May 22. So far, only around 1,300 of them have been safely brought to Ukrainian government-controlled territory. Among the rescued children is a girl whose life was in danger due to the lack of adequate medical care in the occupied territories, and a boy who, along with his mother, was locked in a basement by Russian forces while his father was tortured in a nearby room, Yermak said. Others include two sisters who didn't leave their home for nearly three years because of constant shelling and the presence of Russian tanks, and a teenage girl who was cut off from online schooling due to communication blockades imposed by Russian forces. "These children lived through horrors," Yermak said in a statement. "We are fulfilling the president's task: to bring all children back home." The rescue mission was conducted as part of Bring Kids Back UA, a national initiative spearheaded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and coordinated by his office to return deported children to their families and communities. Kyiv has repeatedly stated that returning all these children is a key condition for any future peace agreement with Russia. On May 8, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Russia's forcible deportation and Russification of Ukrainian children, calling it a "genocidal strategy" aimed at erasing Ukrainian identity and demanding the unconditional return of all abducted minors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Ukrainian defense manufacturers have issued a public letter to President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to lift export restrictions on domestically produced military-grade equipment, particularly drones, to help the sector grow and integrate better into Europe's security architecture. The open letter, signed by leading representatives of Ukraine's defense-industrial sector, highlights the strategic potential of the country's homegrown military technologies, from drones to electronic warfare systems, and calls for decisive political action to authorize the controlled export of surplus weaponry to allied nations. "It is time to demonstrate that Ukraine is capable of being not only a party that receives international support, but also a full-fledged partner that exports security through cooperation, technology, and its own experience," the letter reads. Industry leaders have previously said many smaller firms are burning through capital with no lifeline in sight. But drone producers earlier told the Kyiv Independent that those waivers are nearly impossible to obtain — even for companies the government cannot afford to contract. The system, they say, blocks access to global markets just as foreign demand is surging. "As Europe grapples with transatlantic uncertainty and armed conflicts escalate worldwide, our strategic partners are actively seeking to strengthen their defense capabilities through innovative and affordable technological solutions," the letter reads. Kateryna Mykhalko, executive director of Tech Force in UA, told the Kyiv Independent in May 2024 that Ukraine manufactures a lot of drones, but "not all of them can be used in the army." "Export is one way to ensure that companies do not go bankrupt, develop their R&D, and perhaps in the future the military will need their products," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amichai Chikli accuses Western leaders of ‘giving backing' to hatred against Jews after two embassy workers killed An Israeli minister has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “emboldening the forces of terror” after two staff members at his country's embassy were killed in Washington DC. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were expected to get engaged, left a reception for diplomats near the city's Jewish museum on Wednesday night when a stranger armed with a handgun approached them and opened fire. Amichai Chikli, Israeli diaspora affairs minister, said the world must hold to account the “irresponsible leaders in the West who give backing” to hatred against Jews and Israelis, “whether through appeasement, double standards, or silence”. Mr Chikli said: “French president Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have all, in different ways, emboldened the forces of terror through their failure to draw moral red lines. Gideon Sa'ar, Israeli foreign minister, also lashed out at world leaders, and said “this is what happens when world leaders surrender to the Palestinian terrorist propaganda. “I was worried… that something like this would happen – and it did. Mr Chikli and Mr Sa'ar's comments came after a diplomatic crisis erupted this week when Canada, France and UK threatened to sanction Israel over its failure to end the war in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid in. The UK froze trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers this week, drawing harsh criticism from Israel. Sir Keir has threatened Israel with “concrete actions” if it keeps restricting aid to Gaza and demanded an end to its renewed offensive. “Anti-Semitism is an evil we must stamp out wherever it appears.” Minutes later, when officers arrived, Rodriguez allegedly admitted to carrying out the shooting. “He grabbed a red keffiyeh out of his pocket and started a ‘Free Palestine' chant, ‘There's only one solution, Intifada revolution',” Ms Kalin said. According to his LinkedIn page, he had a master's degree in government, diplomacy and strategy from Reichman University, Tel Aviv, and a bachelor's degree in international relations from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Paying tribute, Zineb Riboua wrote on X: “Yaron Lischinsky was the finest friend I've ever had, brilliant, kind and endlessly thoughtful. And I have lost a dear friend who made every moment brighter.” The second victim was named as Sarah Milgrim, a Jewish American embassy employee. They were in the prime of their lives. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” Ms Smith said that authorities had not received any warning of a potential terror threat and that Rodriguez, from Chicago, was not previously known to police. Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered Israeli embassy security to be boosted around the world in response to the incident. Donald Trump, the US president, said: “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now. “Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Make no mistake: we will track down those responsible and bring them to justice.” “We will confront this moral depravity without fear.” He described the victims as a “beautiful couple” who “came to enjoy an evening in Washington's cultural centre”. “The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of Free Palestine was a young couple about to be engaged,” Mr Leiter said. “The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.” She said: “The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city and in our country. “I want to be clear that we will not tolerate violence or hate in our city... we will not tolerate acts of terrorism.” Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, which organised Wednesday night's event for young diplomats, said in a statement on X: “We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue. Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington DC. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice. Earlier, Danny Danon, the Israeli UN ambassador, announced that “employees” had been injured but did not give details on their condition. He said: “The fatal shooting that took place outside the event, that took place at the Jewish Museum in Washington DC, in which Israeli embassy employees were also injured, is a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, Wednesday night, authorities said. The slain staffers, who the Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs named as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were a couple who officials say were soon to be engaged. At around 9 p.m. outside the museum, they were approached by a gunman who opened fire and killed them, officials said. The suspect, whom DC police identified as 30-year-old Chicago native Elias Rodriguez, pretended to be a bystander after the shooting, an eyewitness told CNN. He is currently in custody, according to authorities. The shooting, which took place in the heart of the Hill, has shaken the Jewish community at a time of heightened global tensions, as US-led attempts to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas remain unsuccessful and fighting in Gaza continues. Tensions are also high across US college campuses where hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested amid polarized debates over the right to protest Israel's military actions and accusations of antisemitism. Related live-story 2 Israeli Embassy staff members killed outside Jewish museum in Washington, DC “We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters late Wednesday. “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Rodriguez is being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X. “Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” Bongino said. “At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families,” he said. Police Chief Smith said Rodriguez was allegedly seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four and shooting two of them with a handgun. According to Sara Marinuzzi, an eyewitness who spoke with CNN, the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once inside the building and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming responsibility for the attack. Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard Rodriguez say, “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.” Rodriguez, who was taken into custody on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” according to eyewitness Yoni Kalin. “At first I didn't recognize them as gunshots,” he told CNN over the phone. “I just didn't realize he was the perpetrator.” He added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn't get us where we need to be” he added. When officers arrived on the scene minutes after the shooting, they found “one adult male and one adult female unconscious and not breathing,” Smith told reporters late Wednesday. “Both victims succumbed to their injuries,” she said. “We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read. They were in the prime of their lives,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also said in a social media post Thursday. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” Leiter earlier shared with reporters that the couple was about to be engaged. “A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. “My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nunavut-set comedy stars Anna Lambe as Siaja, a plucky, young Inuk mother. In a supporting role is the show's soundtrack, which mixes originals songs and Inuktitut covers by Inuk artists with classic pop recorded by Britney Spears, Stevie Nicks, Alanis Morissette and more. North of North music supervisor Michael Perlmutter, who just won a Canadian Sync Award for best soundtrack in a comedy series, spoke to The Globe and Mail about the unique role the music plays in connecting north and south. You collaborated with North of North show runners Stacey Aglok MacDonald and Alethea Arnaquq-Baril on the show's music concept. Can you talk about those early discussions? Early on, it felt like music was going to be a character. We also wanted to show that an Inuit community was still connected with the rest of world. So, we used songs by Britney Spears, Caroline Polachek, Alanis Morissette, the list goes on. What about using music to support characters, such as the lead, Siaja? The idea was to create a fun, upbeat, female-centric mix. We were connecting a lot of dots through her character. So we have Riit's cover of Dua Lipa's Levitating and Angela Amarualik‘s cover of Kelis's Milkshake. And you're probably familiar with Elisapie, who covers Stevie Nicks's Dreams. I did notice a character wearing an Elisapie T-shirt. Her Inuktitut version of Dreams was previously recorded, but, elsewhere, you had Inuk musicians recording covers specifically for the show. I don't know if it's standard in the business, but in the last five or ten years I think you're seeing it a bit more. Riit's Levitating turned out to be super cool. There are time constraints as well, right? It's a creative choice, if you have the time. But it all depends on the project. With this show, it was hand in glove We wrote the rightsholders long letters about what we were doing and what the show is about. We also sent lyrics in Inuktitut that had been translated. They were really excited about the idea. Did the Netflix money allow you to afford all these songs? How big was the song licensing budget? I would say that there was a budget. We explain what the show is about. This was a project people could get behind. Do you think the Dua Lipas and Alanis Morisettes are involved in the process, or is it their managers, labels and publishers? Caroline Polachek's camp seemed excited by it. Now that the show is a hit and has been renewed for a second season, does the dynamic shift? Are you getting pitched by publishers now? Publishers, labels, mothers, daughters, dog walkers, friends, cousins, they all want to be on a successful show. I've had emails already, suggesting a playlist for the second season. I'm not really responding to those just yet. We wanted something that reflected Siaja's state of mind. How about the string quartet cover of Keane's Somewhere Only We Know? Siaja has what might be a fever dream. She's running toward a man, and we have this beautiful, romantic piece supporting that scene. But where that show had a theme song, yours doesn't. What Stacey and Alethea wanted to do was use a different theme song every episode, whether it plays for five seconds at the beginning or whether it rolls into the next scene for another 15 seconds. Not that there's anything wrong with the same 30-second song every episode. We just wanted a surprise of some kind.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korean state media reported a “serious accident” during the attempted launch of a 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday. He observed the incident and issued a stern rebuke, news outlets said. According to reports, the slide system beneath the ship's stern activated prematurely, resulting in a failure of the slides to move in parallel and damage to the vessel. Officials attributed the incident to “inexperienced command and operational carelessness.” Kim condemned the mishap as an unacceptable act of criminal negligence and ordered immediate repairs. He instructed that the warship be fully restored before a major meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in June. No photos or video footage of the incident have been released by Pyongyang. Last month, North Korea unveiled a new destroyer, the Choe Hyon, and conducted a weapons demonstration shortly afterward. According to reports, the warship fired cruise missiles designed to strike targets at various ranges, an anti-aircraft missile, and a 127mm automatic gun during the test.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SHANGHAI, May 22. Algeria has officially joined the New Development Bank (NDB) under BRICS, the bank's President Dilma Rousseff announced. "On behalf of the New Development Bank, I truly congratulate Algeria on joining the bank," the NDB press service quoted her as saying. "Algeria plays an important role not only in the economy of Northern Africa, but also on a global scale, and will definitely contribute to enhancing the NDB's position in the global financial arena," Rousseff emphasized. According to the NDB president, the financial organization is ready to cooperate with Algeria in the field of investment. "Together with Algeria, we will work to finance impactful projects that drive progress, improve lives, and contribute to development," she emphasized. For his part, Algerian Finance Minister Abdelkarim Bouzerd said that the country's accession to the BRICS bank "will create promising opportunities for collaboration and mutual support." "This membership is a testament to our belief in this institution's vital role in financing global development, and its status as a key player capable of providing alternative and innovative solutions to promote the growth and resilience of its member countries' economies," the minister noted. The New Development Bank was established by the BRICS countries based on an intergovernmental agreement signed at the sixth summit in Fortaleza in July 2014. Its goal is to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other developing countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. NIKITA LALWANI is a Nonresident Scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. SAM MARULLO is a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Progress. Industrial policy, long eschewed in policy circles, had come back in vogue as a way to strengthen supply chain resilience for industries critical to economic and national security. Moving the legislation through Congress required a multiyear process that involved lengthy negotiations and complex maneuvering. Washington was out of practice when it came to industrial policy, which the United States had largely abandoned since the Cold War. So there was no playbook available to the new CHIPS Program Office, which was established to administer the bill's $39 billion in semiconductor manufacturing incentives (another $11 billion or so was for semiconductor-related research and development). It's too early to pass a final judgment on how well it did: the semiconductor industry is fast-moving and cyclical, and many projects are just getting underway. CHIPS set itself up for success in part thanks to clever statutory drafting and early choices on hiring, goal setting, and structure. Of course, there is no one way to do industrial policy, and the details will vary by sector and circumstance, but one constant is that large federal programs require the government to work quickly, efficiently, and well. Most important, industrial policy requires clarity of purpose: a concrete set of specific objectives to guide investments and against which to measure success. For CHIPS, having a director that did not require Senate confirmation was an early advantage, since it meant that Michael Schmidt—whom Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo tapped to head the office—was able to get working right away. During the Biden administration, confirmations took an average of 192 days from official submission—nearly three times as long as they took under President Ronald Reagan. That is time an industrial policy program cannot afford to waste. Most government programs take months to get off the ground. In its first few months, however, the CHIPS team released its first funding opportunity for commercial chip fabs, published an investments strategy paper, and hired dozens of staff across investments, strategy, legal, and external affairs. At the same time, the point of industrial policy is to meet economic and national security objectives, not just earn market returns. So the CHIPS team also needed staff that could evaluate deals based not just on financial terms but also by judging whether they would improve supply chain resilience, meet the needs of the defense industrial base, and strengthen cybersecurity. Hiring for these roles is easier said than done. In 2024, it took the government more than 100 days, on average, to hire new employees. Typical government hiring, through competitive public job announcements, takes significantly longer. That's one reason that, according to Jennifer Pahlka, who helped found the U.S. Digital Service, roughly half of all competitive federal job announcements fail, resulting in no hire. To build up its full-time staff, meanwhile, the CHIPS Office sought permission from the OPM to use two expedited hiring authorities that were critical to the program's success: direct hiring, which bypasses most HR screenings, and excepted service hiring, which allows managers to hire without HR involvement. The CHIPS Act itself also included a special hiring pathway, allowing the program to recruit its most senior staff quickly and pay them above-standard government rates. For industrial policy to work well, recruiting is essential. The government needs to draw sharp minds from finance, industry, and other federal agencies. For workers in the private sector, a federal job means much lower pay; it might also mean long commutes or relocation to Washington. When the ask was made directly, most people said yes. This strategy should be clear, provide concrete goals and metrics, and be accessible to the public so that Americans can judge whether the program is succeeding on its own terms and whether those terms are the right ones. By specifying clear criteria by which applications for funding would be evaluated and by publishing a vision of success that set specific production objectives across the semiconductor industry, the CHIPS office could manage expectations for stakeholders both within and outside government. Importantly, the vision for success served as a guide to actual investment decisions. CHIPS tasked teams to evaluate how every potential deal would advance the program's aims. In working on individual deals, however, it's easy to get caught up in negotiations with specific companies over minute details and lose sight of the bigger picture. To offset that effect, the office also established an investment committee, composed of CHIPS leadership and a few outside experts, whose job was to recommend deals to a committee of senior Commerce Department leaders based on a portfolio-level view of the office's investments. To manage industry expectations and ensure that there was enough money for a broad array of projects, CHIPS made clear that successful applicants would generally receive grants worth no more than 15 percent of a project's capital expenditures. A successful industrial policy also must incorporate foreign, state, and local governments. Industrial policy is not about onshoring all production to the United States. Instead, industrial policy should identify which components must be made in the United States and work with friendly partners to create robust and resilient global supply chains for those that cannot be. For CHIPS, those partners included Costa Rica, Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Taiwan, many of which had their own chip subsidy programs. To avoid duplicative efforts and to prevent companies from playing countries off each other in search of the highest award, CHIPS hired an international team responsible for monitoring global subsidies, developing a global strategy, and working with the White House and State Department to communicate or reinforce specific requests of foreign partners. CHIPS also developed close relationships with state and local governments, which provided their own subsidies in addition to controlling site selection and various permitting levers. To be sure, officials outside an industrial policy program—in a legislative affairs office, on a communications team, or at the National Security Council—can spot gaps or missing priorities. But although many of them know the importance of their functions, few are able to trade off between them—to decide, for example, when a national security imperative outweighs a labor concern, or vice versa. It could help for them to have a full-time coordinator at the White House, as CHIPS did, tasked with moving the program forward and resolving conflicts before they resulted in significant delay. A White House coordinator can also help ensure a comprehensive approach to industrial policy that aligns funding with other tools, such as export controls, tariffs, and government procurement. Consider the National Environmental Policy Act, a law that requires the federal government to evaluate possible environmental impacts of proposed action. NEPA reviews come on top of ordinary permitting requirements and apply only to federal projects. Although well intentioned, such reviews can take years, and if an opponent of the project sues, even longer. The original version of CHIPS required NEPA reviews for CHIPS projects; to comply, the office built an environmental team and published a 200-page programmatic environmental assessment. But including a NEPA waiver in the initial law, and broadening it to cover all projects, would have saved a lot of time and effort. Congress can also act as a source of friction. Ideally, the statute that creates any new program will include sufficient money and authorities to achieve its goals, but that is not always the case. Asking Congress to address an urgent need can take months or even years, as was the case for the NEPA exemption for CHIPS projects. Careful legislative drafting—including waivers of other laws when necessary—can make a big difference. Appropriating the entire budget of the program up front can help a program make long-term plans without worrying about political disruptions. Finally, state and local governments can create permitting bottlenecks, which lead to years of delay. CHIPS, for its part, explicitly rated applications based on how quickly they could be constructed, including permit timelines. This created incentives for interested states to strengthen their processes and adopt reforms, such as creating fast tracks and a single permitting point of contact for a project. CHIPS also engaged early and often with local governments to break through logjams when they arose. When making difficult decisions, the U.S. government often justifies outcomes by reference to a scrupulously fair, diligent, and transparent process. Such processes often lead to the right outcomes, and strictly following them can help protect ambitious government programs from legal consequences and reputational harm when some investments inevitably fail. But they can also be inflexible, counterproductive, and time-consuming. The rules run 180 pages long with 12 appendices, and it can be difficult to parse what is mandatory and what is merely standard practice. Because many of these rules are ill suited to ambitious industrial policy, Commerce appealed to Congress to include in the bill a special exemption from grant rules known as “other transaction authority.” A typical government grant simply reimburses applicants for the cost of their activities, which means that negotiations over cost are limited if they happen at all. But CHIPS wanted to have holistic negotiations with companies over how many and what kind of fabs companies would build and how much funding the government would provide—an iterative process that was critical to ensuring projects met ambitious economic and national security goals. Unlike the traditional government grants process, in which applicants set project scope, most CHIPS negotiations involved pushing applicants to build more, which paid off handsomely when companies such as TSMC agreed to construct additional fabs in the United States. Another source of procedural delay are statutes such as the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires two separate comment periods to evaluate the necessity and burden of providing information to the public, making it difficult to quickly announce funding opportunities. A critical job for early staff is to identify and, to the extent possible, work around such obstacles by leveraging statutory exceptions and other available “fast track” procedures. Finally, designing an industrial policy involves difficult tradeoffs between speed and nuance. But rate of return is a difficult number to model, and small changes in assumptions can lead to big changes in the result. A simpler approach might have opened negotiations over grant size at a fixed percentage of total costs, avoiding drawn-out debates over model assumptions. CHIPS calculated that a more involved process was worth it for larger fab projects, particularly to signal to the biggest companies that the team was ready for serious, financially sophisticated negotiations. When it came to designing a funding process for semiconductor suppliers, which are smaller and sometimes less well-resourced than other program applicants and for which long negotiations are impractical, CHIPS followed the simpler approach, fixing most awards at ten percent of the project's capital expenditures. The program faced early pushback, for example, for embodying “everything-bagel liberalism”—an attempt to shoehorn too many social and economic goals into a national security program. There were no signs that the language deterred companies from participating, and many companies spoke publicly about the need for affordable childcare options to meet workforce demands. This is not to say industrial policy programs should never include additional policy requirements, but these should always be in service of the overall goal: onshoring sufficient production capacity for technologies critical to economic and national security. In addition, getting early design choices right does not inoculate a program against issues down the line. This is especially true for programs, such as CHIPS, that target a cyclical and sometimes unpredictable industry. NEPA delays remain a concern for projects that were not exempted from its reviews. And some external statutory requirements, such as retroactive prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act, have slowed and complicated funding negotiations. It requires scaling up production quickly and carving out a place in government that can act like a private-sector startup by staffing up, implementing new processes, and finding creative ways to avoid delays. But with the right playbook, it can become a more hospitable one. At the same time, policymakers should push for structural reforms to make government work better. Under the best of circumstances, industrial policy is an uphill battle. Making smart early decisions can make the climb a little easier.
