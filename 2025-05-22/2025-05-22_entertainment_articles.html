                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talent agent and Sound Talent Group (STG) owner Dave Shapiro, 42, was among those killed in a fiery plane crash in San Diego, Calif., in the early morning on Thursday (May 22), according to a statement from his agency. “We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,” said a spokesperson for Sound Talent Group. Thank you so much for respecting their privacy at this time.” Kid Cudi Expected to Testify in Diddy Trial Later This Week Shapiro and two other STG employees were killed when their 1985 Cessna Citation reportedly crashed around 4 a.m. on Thursday (May 22) in the Tierrasanta neighborhood. Billboard is not naming the two other victims at this time at the request of company officials, who are trying to notify family members. The plane was also carrying other passengers who have not yet been identified, officials tell Billboard, noting that there were no survivors. A well-known music agent, Shapiro launched STG in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen following successful careers at the Agency Group and United Talent Agency. He also operates the Velocity Records music label, whose roster has included Thursday, Concrete Castles and Craig Owens. Shapiro was also an avid pilot with more than a decade of flying experience and was the owner of Velocity Aviation, through which he offered pilot instruction. Known around the music industry as an adventurous spirit, Shapiro's aviation website describes his thrill-seeking lifestyle and pursuit of adrenaline. Besides aviation, Shapiro was a lifelong supporter of independent music and hard rock, punk and indie acts that didn't fit within music's mainstream.

Levi, who is now building his own studio, told Variety that voicing his views will benefit his work in the long run, despite knowing that certain filmmakers now will refuse to collaborate with him. “I know that there are people that would prefer not to work with me now because of my opinions,” Levi said. They haven't given me any specific names, but there are people who prefer not to work with me at this time. I knew that was probably going to happen.

He added that he believes his career will flourish in its own way, on its own path: “I know it to be true because I've gotten messages from lots of people who I won't name but who were very grateful to me for taking the stand that I took,” Levi said.

Horrified by the country of his birth and heavy with the weight of its sins, Nadav Lapid has created modern cinema's most splenetic filmography by fighting his Israeliness as if it were an incurable virus infecting his body of work. 2019's eruptive “Synonyms” was a semi-autobiographical identity crisis about a man who flees to Paris because he's convinced that he was born in the Middle East by mistake, while 2021's “Ahed's Knee” was a similarly personal scream into the wind — this one rooted in the blue-balled impotence of artistic resistance amid an exultantly genocidal ethnostate. Spasming with anger where Lapid's previous features (“Policeman” and “The Kindergarten Teacher”) searched for hope, both of these movies were fringed with a sense of resignation that they fought tooth-and-nail to shake off. As a result, I naturally assumed that his follow-up feature — written in Europe before the events of October 7, 2023, and then furiously reworked around them as Lapid conceded to the futility of escaping his background — would either be the wildest film that Lapid has ever made, or the most defeated. Related Stories ‘Love on Trial' Review: Koji Fukada Explores Injustice in the World of J-Pop Zachary Levi Knows Some Filmmakers ‘Prefer Not to Work' with Him After Speaking Out on Politics: ‘I Didn't Make This Decision Blindly or Casually' As sincere in its satire as it is satirical in its sincerity, the deliriously provocative “Yes” is a veritable orgy of self-loathing surrender that reaffirms Lapid as the world's most visceral director on a shot-by-shot basis. In a movie that unfolds like an Ecstasy-addled cross between Pier Paolo Pasolini's “Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom” and the Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” Lapid doubles down on the frenzied violence of his filmmaking at the same time as he fully embraces his growing appetite for submission. Here, in a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his dancer wife who afford a life for their newborn by acquiescing to every demand made of their talent and bodies by Tel Aviv's militaristic ruling class, Lapid doesn't rage against the worst monstrousness of the modern age by speaking truth to power, but rather by volunteering his characters to get crushed under the heel of its boot. And then — with a literalness no one else would dare — by forcing them to lick that boot so clean the whole world can see the dehumanizing nature of Israel's crimes reflected in its leather. Lapid isn't much interested in making a clear political argument, and even less so in trying to convince any potential fence-sitters to fall on the right side of history. On the contrary, this is a film that firmly believes Israel's atrocities to be self-evident, and it's only interested in exhausting itself for a viewership that already feels the same way. Indeed, “Yes” is such a singularly vital addition to post-October 7 cinema because Lapid — sick of bashing his head against a wall in a hopeless attempt to change his own mind — knows that arguing against Israel is no longer enough to save anyone from it. Shadowed by the sense of ambivalence it shows towards its own value, “Yes” maintains that any movie worth making on this subject would have to do something bolder than just picking between the two sides of a massacre. And so it careens in the opposite direction with the same physical force that Lapid tends to pan his camera, reveling in the golem-like emptiness required to passively subscribe to a war until its characters are so debased by what that requires of them that they can hardly stand to look at each other without throwing up. “Give up as early as possible,” Y plans to advise his infant son (born at midnight on October 8, 2023, and naively saddled with the name Noah). “Submission is happiness.” It's a credo that he and his partner Jasmine (Efrat Dor) embody with fundamentalist devotion. When a much older woman asks them to come back to a creepy mansion where the walls are decorated with the taxidermied heads of her own (living) relatives, Y and Jasmine ravenously tongue fuck her ears until she comes. They do every drug they're offered, screw anyone who asks, and effectively “yes” their way into the highest levels of the Israeli war machine — all between dropping Noah off at daycare in the morning and picking him up at night. At home, Y and Jasmine love each other with the same abandon as they thoughtlessly obey their overlords, and Lapid creates a domestic idyll so alive with manic feeling that I'm convinced he could be the next Casavettes if he weren't so inescapably stuck being himself. It's a tamer but equally vibrant expression of the demented bacchanalia that Lapid creates around these characters whenever they go outside. There's no use separating fact from farce in a film whose most grounded scene finds two people sucking face on the “Hill of Freedom” that overlooks the ruins of Gaza — pillars of fresh black smoke still rising in the distance as bomber jets rip through the sky. It's “Zone of Interest” without the need for a garden wall. Eventually, after an hour of the most irrepressibly exuberant filmmaking I've ever seen, that same Russian billionaire makes Y an offer that he can't — and, per his custom, obviously won't — refuse: Write the music for a bloodthirsty new rallying cry that will galvanize the Israeli people in their fight to erase Palestine from the map. Y responds to the offer with an uncharacteristic show of hesitation, but the riches he's offered as a reward prove too compelling to turn down; anything that might allow him to realize his dream of raising Noah in a nowhere country, with a non-existent language that only their family will know how to speak. As Y sees it, there are only two words that matter in the world to begin with: No. Any person who doesn't say one of them is implicitly saying the other. In the queasiest scene of a film with no other kind, Leah spits out a horrifying rapid-fire monologue that details several of the most heinous crimes that Hamas committed on October 7, but her speech doesn't “justify” Israel's response or give Y the ammunition he needs to write an anthem on its behalf. On the contrary, it allows him to see Tel Aviv's hedonism in a new light. Absent any coked up yacht parties to distract her from reality, committing the graphic details of those murders to memory is just Leah's way of saying “yes” to what Israel is doing in her name. That you can feel Lapid so purposefully letting the air out of the tires doesn't make the film's disjointed third act feel like any less of a comedown from its first, but there's a reckoning to be had as reality catches up with Y and quite literally forces him to face the music. There's obviously a moral dimension to that downshift, and it's true that Bronz's puppy dog eyes seem to grow a little sadder with each scene, but “Yes” never frames Y's arc as a path from barbarity to righteousness. Or to quote the name of the song that Y is tasked with scoring: “From Destruction to Redemption.” It doesn't extend any pity to its protagonist, or offer him real forgiveness for his collaboration either, but there's a measure of understanding in its belief that so many artists are just a few benign yesses away from becoming a worm like Y — especially at a time when their art can feel so pointless and inconsequential in the face of the world's cruelties. To that point, the film's uncertain ending suggests that Lapid doesn't know where Y goes from here, or even could go from here — either morally or geographically. If he did, Lapid would probably be there already. But “Yes” isn't searching for the “correct” response to Y's dilemma so much as it's using him to frame that dilemma for what it is. And yet, the ultimate power of this movie's radically different paces and modes is found in how they combine to suggest that people can't live normally while perpetrating horror — whether in Israel or anywhere else. And yet, in the dead-end surrender of his most feverish and ungovernable film so far, one abiding truth manages to tunnel out the bottom and come out the other side of Y's story: If there is only so much to be gained from saying “yes,” then there is only so much to be lost from saying “no.” Subscribe here to our newly launched newsletter, In Review by David Ehrlich, in which our Chief Film Critic and Head Reviews Editor rounds up the best new reviews and streaming picks along with some exclusive musings — all only available to subscribers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A John Doe who accused pioneering hip-hop artist Afrika Bambaataa of child molestation and sex trafficking has won a civil case in New York State's Supreme Court. Court records reviewed by Rolling Stone reveal that the plaintiff's motion for a default judgment was “granted without opposition” by Judge Alexander M. Tisch because Bambaataa, who has faced numerous accusations of molesting boys, never showed up to court. Bambaataa's manager did not immediately reply to a request for comment, and Rolling Stone was unable to immediately reach an attorney for the DJ-producer. That year, three Bronx men accused Bambaataa of molestation, including Hassan Campbell and Ronald Savage. Last August, Savage told AllHipHop, “Bambaataa is not a pedophile and, in my eyes, he was doing something that was consensual with someone that he thought was of age.” He now claims that he met Bambaataa at a club while using a fake ID, noting, “I wish, back in 2016, I remembered about the fake ID.” In 2016, an emotionally charged phone call leaked where Zulu Nation member Mickey Bentson chastised Savage for his abuse accusations, telling him, “You are trying to destroy a brand.” On the call, Savage said, “You know how long I've been holding this shit in. I just could not take it anymore.” Since then, Savage and Bambaataa have seemingly reconciled, taking a picture together last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beastie Boys have very nearly settled a lawsuit in which they accused Chili's of copyright infringement over a social media ad that parodied the “Sabotage” video, Billboard reports and court records confirm. The band sued Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's Grill & Bar, last July, alleging that the use of the Ill Communication song falsely implied that Beastie Boys endorsed Chili's. Universal Music Group (UMG) subsequently sued Brinker for using unlicensed music in dozens of other Chili's ads. (The label has also now settled with Brinker International.) The Beastie Boys' impending settlement follows mediation between the parties this month; terms of the agreement have not been revealed. They expect to file a formal dismissal on July 7, according to the court document. The Beastie Boys lawsuit alleged copyright infringement and trademark rights violations over an ad that, per the lawsuit's description, featured “three characters wearing obvious 70s-style wigs, fake mustaches, and sunglasses,” in the style of the Spike Jonze–directed 1994 video for “Sabotage.” The group, which does not license songs for third-party advertising, originally sought $150,000 in monetary damages, a takedown of the commercials, and an order preventing Brinker from using their work moving forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's tax bill, which Republicans passed in the House of Representatives overnight on Thursday, will slash funding for Medicaid, food assistance, and Medicare to finance a new set of tax cuts for the rich. It also includes tax breaks for gun silencers. In a speech at 4 a.m. on Thursday, as Republicans were pushing through their tax bill, Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) took credit for the initial provision, which will eliminate a $200 excise tax on gun silencers. The lawmaker owns a gun shop worth millions of dollars. “My Democrat colleagues have asked: How did this get in the bill, what was the deal, and who asked for it,” Clyde said. I believe the speaker, with the purest of motive, simply wanted to restore a constitutional right.” Before his time ended, he added, “And who asked? (These changes appear in the manager's amendment that Republicans released late Wednesday and passed Thursday.) Clyde owns a gun shop, Clyde Armory, in Athens, Georgia, and the building it is housed in — which could best be described as a gun castle. The store, which lists silencers for sale on its website, was previously placed under an enhanced federal monitoring program, according to The New York Times, after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives “found that more than 25 guns sold there had been used in crimes within three years of their purchase.” Everytown for Gun Safety, the anti-gun violence advocacy group, slammed Republicans' silencer tax breaks in a statement Thursday. “There's a reason silencers have been regulated for nearly a century: They make it much harder for law enforcement and bystanders to react quickly to gunshots,” said the organization's president, John Feinblatt. “I have no idea why we think it's a good idea to repeal a tax on silencers when we are going to feed fewer children in our country as a result of this. Earlier this month, Clyde introduced legislation, called the “Constitutional Hearing Protection Act,” to deregulate and eliminate the excise tax on silencers. “As an ardent defender of our Second Amendment liberties, I'm working to remove all infringements on our God-given right to keep and bear arms,” Clyde said in a press release at the time. “By deregulating suppressors, eliminating the costly $200 tax stamp on these firearms, and avoiding additional taxation, my legislation offers a constitutional solution to increase Americans' access to suppressors.” Clyde was one of four late conservative holdouts on the Trump tax bill who demanded that the legislation do more to cut Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans.

The poor may not have health insurance or food assistance once Republicans pass this bill, but at least they won't have to deal with the “draconian tax,” as Clyde put it Thursday morning, on gun silencers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starting in early August, stars of the surreal David Lynch and Mark Frost-created saga will be sitting down for nostalgic conversations in cities across the U.S., from Tysons, Virginia, to Seattle, Washington. Ray Wise (who played Leland Palmer), Harry Goaz (Deputy Andy Brennan) and Kimmy Robertson (Lucy Moran) as well as Twin Peaks: The Return executive producer Sabrina S. Sutherland will share their experiences on the series and swap behind-the-scenes stories at the ticketed events. “It's sad that I won't be able to call him each night to let him know how the show went as I had promised. But I look forward to celebrating his work each night and having him in my heart instead.” The tour (see all events here) also includes two stops at iconic series locations in Washington state. (The event promises tea — no word yet on coffee and cherry pie.) A watercooler hit when it premiered on ABC in 1990, Twin Peaks have been credited with helping to create prestige television as we now know it with its continuous mystery structure, cinematic flourishes and devoted fan community. After Twin Peaks was canceled in its second season, Lynch returned to the Pacific Northwest with Fire Walk With Me, which was considered a box office and critical failure upon release, but has since been reappraised (and gotten the Criterion Collection treatment). In 2017, Lynch and Frost smashed expectations with their Showtime limited series Twin Peaks: The Return, which both confounded and delighted audiences with its idiosyncratic structure but typical (at least of Lynch's work) lack of reassuring answers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Dot's new verse on "Family Ties" to SZA bringing out Lizzo for a "Special" surprise, here are the best moments from the first LA stop of their Grand National Tour. “You said you feel the love, right?” Kendrick Lamar asked SZA after performing their twinkling 2018 hit collab “All the Stars” during the first LA tour stop of their Grand National Tour at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium Wednesday night (May 21). The two dove head over heels into “Love” from his 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN., with SZA's honeyed vocals taking the track's featured artist Zacari's place. While Dot has been hailed as a generational hater for vanquishing Drake in last year's monthslong epic rap war, the stadiums he and SZA have been dominating for the last month since the tour started don't feel like battlefields. Sincere and cheeky love songs like “Snooze” and “Kiss Me More” share the stage with scathing and calculated diss tracks like “Euphoria” and, of course, the five-time Grammy-winning juggernaut “Not Like Us.” The Grand National Tour serves as a well-deserved victory lap for Lamar, who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year, and SZA, whose 2022 blockbuster album SOS has continued breaking Billboard 200 chart records three years later. As both superstars embarked on separate and at times intertwined trips down memory lane throughout the show, their modes of transportation were very different, yet very them. Lamar pulled up in his sleek black 1987 Buick GNX and frequently flexed his signature whip on stage, while SZA's “ride” was a gigantic animatronic ant named Anthony (because why not) that carried her throughout “Kitchen.” Shortly after, she sang Rihanna's “Consideration” lyric about “ridin' in on a pale white horse,” but that couldn't be further from the truth. One can only dream of RiRi returning to any stage for their first joint performance of the song since the 2016 Brit Awards, but SZA did surprise concertgoers with her “best friend” Lizzo. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as of this week (chart dated May 24), and samples Luther Vandross' 1982 hit “If This World Were Mine.” Well, if you're Kendrick Lamar and SZA, it certainly feels like it is. After Lizzo caught a vibe at the after party for SZA's Not Beauty brand in Brooklyn earlier this month, SZA brought out her “best friend for energy and positivity,” she announced before the pop star popped out for a precious performance of the “Special” remix. Even though he brought out his younger cousin Baby Keem to perform “Family Ties” during one of their MetLife Stadium stops earlier this month, Lamar held his own with a new verse. “Ay, you n—as will never compare to me/ F— poppin' in, I'mma declare the streets/ My mama said ‘be scared of God'/ On God, they better be scared of me/ Beverly playing, I was making a right/ Pop punani ain't making it right/ Told you, you would fight my fight/ I'm buckling up,” he rapped. Following “Snooze,” SZA re-emerged onto the stage in a glimmering chrysalis gown with wings during “Crybaby” and caught flight mid-song. She eventually shed the long skirt and completed her metamorphosis into a beautiful butterfly before jumping into her Hot 100 top 10 hit “Nobody Gets Me.” “I wrote this about my ex-fiancé. He hates me,” she said matter-of-factly before encouraging her fans to sing along for him. When asked during one of the deposition video skits if she thought she would have hit songs without dysfunction in her relationships, SZA responded, “No, so grateful. It's a poignant reminder that personal growth and prosperity don't come without its own set of challenges, but the end result make everything worth it. SZA has certainly found her sweet spot in the buddy comedy world. After fighting with her bestie/roommate (played by Keke Palmer) while facing eviction in their critically acclaimed One of Them Days film earlier this year, she took on the role of Dot's nagging little sister during one of the video sketches as the two pulled up to the gas station – in his GNX, no less – and bickered over which snacks he needs to pick up. “What is it, chimmy chua?” he asked her, acting puzzled over the pronunciation of the sweet, salty and spicy Mexican delight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former HGTV couple Christina Haack and Tarek El Moussa, who were married from 2009 to 2018 and hosted the hit show “Flip or Flop,” rarely open about their religious beliefs with fans. Haack and El Moussa, who share custody of Brayden and their 14-year-old daughter Taylor, both shared multiple videos in their Instagram Stories from Brayden's baptism on May 20, including footage of a pastor dunking their son in a baptismal pool inside a church. Haack wrote over a video of the moment, “Special day for our boy. El Moussa shared a photo of he and Haack with Brayden, which she re-shared, and wrote, “Big day for Bray Bray!! In a video taken behind-the-scenes at the church before Brayden's baptism, El Moussa asked his smiling son, “Where are going, Bray? El Moussa wrote over the video, “No nerves, just excitement. After Brayden's baptism, El Moussa shared video from an outdoor family luncheon that included his second wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, and their two-year-old son Tristan, as well as Haack's five-year-old son Tristan, from her previous marriage to TV personality Ant Anstead. Haack and El Moussa rarely open up about their religious backgrounds and beliefs, but their son attends a private, Christian school in southern California that's connected with the Baptist church where he got baptized. That same year, both El Moussa and Haack shared that they were inspired by Tim Storey, a life coach who has an honorary degree from Bethany Theological Seminary, per his website, and founded the Congregation Family Church in 2015. In May 2017, as he and Haack were in the midst of their divorce, El Moussa shared a Facebook photo from attending church with Storey and wrote, “Sundays are the best days 💙 Love quality time with the kids and of course church with Pastor @TimStoreyOfficial.” “He's changed my life,” El Moussa continued, “and so many others, for the better and can do the same for you!” That December, Haack told Country Living Magazine that as part of her holiday plans, she was “volunteering with Pastor Tim Storey, serving meals at the Los Angeles Mission on Dec. 22. Giving all year round is really important to me, and especially during the holidays.</p>

It's frustrating when TV storylines keep us in suspense for literal years, as was the case of Severance season one to season two. While the same (real) time will not lapse between the Apple TV+ series' second and third seasons — Ben Stiller promises! — we don't have to wait until season three to re-engage in some Severance season two-finale cliffhanger chatter. The Hollywood Reporter grabbed Britt Lower while she was on a break filming Netflix's adaptation of Harlan Coben novel I Will Find You (Lower is “still a redhead” for that one, she says) to ask her all the burning questions about her other streaming drama. The Baltimore Ravens Spoofed 'Severance' for Their Schedule Reveal. Did Mark S. (Adam Scott) make the right decision at the end of season two, when he chose himself and Helly R. over his Outtie/Mark Scout and Gemma Scout/Ms. How much do you know about season three? When you do theater, of which I do a fair amount, I do live performance — someone gave me this analogy the other day that I've been really thinking about. You do a play and you go out at the end to do a bow, and that bow is not only to receive applause, which is so lovely, but also it's a way to thank the audience for coming to the show, to honor the audience by saying, “Hey, this would be weird if we were doing this to an empty room. In TV and film, we don't have that immediate audience response, right? There's a year or two between when we step into the character's perspective and when the audience sees it. So, doing press and getting to see how the fans are impacted by what we've done is our chance to take that bow. That it somehow has a resonance with the audience, and we're on this journey together. My personal opinion is that art is this chance for us to to think about what really makes us human. I did not know that it was Helly and Helena when I auditioned, but once I got the news that I was going to get to be Helly R., then Dan Erickson and Ben Stiller told me the full scope of season one and that all of the Innies get this little glimpse of who they are on the outside. A trend has been one actor playing twins — is it like that for you? I'm always trying to come up with new analogies. It's these two parts of the same person. They share some of the same psychology, because they have a subconscious that's shared, but it's their consciousness that's different, right? Their subjective experience of awareness, of being awake, is separate in the same way that, as an actor, I share the same body as Helly, and I share some of the same subconscious space. Fans pretty quickly picked up on the physical differences you bring to the characters, like their different postures. Can you talk about creating that tool for yourself? She moves with a lot of conviction and determination. When did you first learn what Cold Harbor is? For season two, I had the pleasure as an actor of now stepping into that weird world of the Lumon higher-ups and seeing what it's like to be a Lumon worker as Helena, and how everyone's always watching each other — and the extent to which Helena is aware of what's happening in the company is also a little mysterious. She knows a lot, but there are also things kept from different departments within Lumon. I had to know at least what Cold Harbor was as Helena. But the extent to which she knows what it is, I'm not certain. I know you've said that was definitely Helly R. in the season two finale and not Helena (again pretending to be Helly R.) — but are you sure Dan (Erickson) and Ben (Stiller) didn't lie to you about that to get a certain performance? If you track the whole episode and you see Helly trapping Milchick (Tramell Tillman) in a bathroom, her friend, Dylan (Zach Cherry), comes to help. In season one, [Helena tells Helly] she isn't a person and has no right to make choices about her body. She was like, “This has no meaning to me whatsoever, get me out of here at all costs. Get me out of here.” The question of season one is, who am I in relationship to this work, which doesn't have meaning to me (Helly)? All of these Innies have this new information about who they are, and it makes them even hungrier for purpose and meaning in their lives. So then to see her on that tri-desk at the end saying, “They give us half a life and think we won't fight for it?” I just can't believe that anyone else would have said that. Well, again, I'm gonna go back to that question of, are Innies people? Like, Helena says to Helly R., “I am a person, you are not. I make the decisions, you do not.” So I think embedded in your question is: Is he allowed to make a decision? So, you have to put yourself in his shoes. These Innies have been stripped of so much already, right? Seasons one and two of Severance are streaming on Apple TV+.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lindsay Hubbard questioned Andy Cohen about her status on ”Summer House.” On the May 21 episode of “Watch What Happens Live,” the Bravo TV veteran reacted to a question about her future on the show now that she is a mother. Hubbard then looked at Cohen and asked him point blank, “So where do we go from here, Andy? Fans reacted on social media, with one noting, “ANDY KNOWS SOMETHING.” Others agreed that it's high time for a new show with the OGs. ”We need a ‘summer in the city' spin off! Seeing their business ventures, events, family life etc,” one fan wrote on Instagram. In season 9, Lexi Wood, and Bailee Henderson, both 27, were introduced to fans. Batula, who will turn 34 this summer, admitted she “can't keep up” with the Gen Z crowd that sometimes shows up at the Hamptons party house. “My husband [Kyle Cooke] definitely can't, but you know, it's fun having younger people in the house too. I feel like it keeps me young and in the know, but I think that there's a world where people need to, like, graduate out.” It could either follow the current cast as we get older, or you know, we could sort of break off and it can go back to being young and partying and introducing more of those fun Gen Z kids,” she said. Fellow “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo has been vocal about feeling she has started to “age out” of the original “Summer House” party premise. Co-star Jesse Solomon has said he hopes to have one final “hurrah” with the veteran cast members, who include Batula, Cooke, Hubbard, and Carl Radke. Speaking with Us Weekly just before the Bravo reality show usually starts production, Solomon said, “There's gotta be a season 10 with the OG cast. The cast for “Summer House” season 10 has not been confirmed by Bravo.</p>
