                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum, Solana and Dogecoin Jump as Bitcoin Sets Another Record Price Bitcoin keeps rising Thursday, inching up to yet another all-time high mark after beating its four-month-old record on Wednesday. And that momentum appears to be spreading to other top coins, which have put up even larger daily gains than Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin just hit a new record price of $111,808, per data from CoinGecko, continuing upward after first breaching the $110,000 mark late Wednesday. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap has completed a significant rebound after dipping to under $75,000 in early April amid President Trump's growing global trade war. As Trump's tariffs push has cooled amid deals with key trading partners, investors are again growing comfortable with risk-on assets, propelling crypto and stocks alike. Other the last day, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have all jumped by about 7%, beating Bitcoin's own daily gain. Ethereum currently sits at $2,662, pushing its monthly gain to a whopping 56%, while Solana is priced at $179 (up 24% this month) and Dogecoin has barked its way up to $0.242 for a nearly 41% spike in the last 30 days. Looking broadly to the top 100 coins by market cap, the biggest gainers over the past day are Worldcoin (WORLD), up 36% and propelled by a sizable $135 million token sale announced Wednesday, along with the HYPE token of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid (up 23%) and rising meme coin Fartcoin with its 17% climb.

Credit: AP/Gillian Flaccus It's not an official holiday – yet – but for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts “Bitcoin Pizza Day” is still special. The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John's pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it's giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world. Stay in the know on jobs, retail and all things business across Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy. Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to “mine” bitcoin more effectively. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price. Is the bitcoin amount I'm offering too low?” he wrote. But the next day, Hanyecz said he'd successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John's pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, “Digital Gold.” “A great milestone reached,” said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz. “I don't think anyone could have known it would take off like this.” After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning — a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon. Army nurse who made history ...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sui-based DEX Cetus has been hit by an apparent hack, with onchain data showing rapid asset drainage despite the team portraying the incident as a “bug.” Update (May 22, 2025, 1:27 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add further data and statements by Hacken. Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets. Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction. A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company's Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia. Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. Knock-on effects have already become apparent, with the Sui-based money market, Scallop, halting all borrowing on its protocol. However, blockchain analysts and compliance firms are raising concerns about the project's transparency. Onchain data service Onchain Lens stated in an X post that “the attacker gained control of all SUI-denominated pools, exploiting over $200M, and has also started moving $USDC.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blockchain Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC), first to market providing decentralized deposit insurance for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, proudly announces an appointment to the BDIC Board of Advisors, James R. Owens. Co-Founder Paul Kohli of BDIC Hong Kong celebrated the news stating, “James will play a critical role in advising BDIC on its technical strategy, specifically in the areas of exchange and wallet connectivity, as well as innovations in smart contract architecture bringing his experience and industry knowledge to the team,” Kohli continued. With a career spanning over four decades in software engineering, telecommunications and data science, James R. Owens brings unparalleled technical expertise to BDIC. In 1991, Owens founded Webstar Technology Group, Inc., a company that revolutionized data transmission in the cable television industry by developing COAX software — an early system capable of compressing video and television signals without quality loss, enabling multi-frequency carriage across limited bandwidth infrastructure. His subsidiary, Centaflix, was acquired just 10 months after launch and now forms the backbone of streaming infrastructure used by platforms like Netflix. Beyond media, Owens made his mark in hospitality tech, deploying check-in systems for Best Western and IHG hotels. In 2014, he launched Softtech, a data compression firm that evolved into early AI development by 2015. Owens successfully took Webstar Technology Group, Inc. public, listing the company under ticker WBSR on OTC markets before transitioning leadership in early 2024. While his current consulting contracts include work on compression technology in AC/DC electrical systems for sustainable energy and secure architecture design for satellite companies, Owens has also been working on cyber-wallet data transfer protocols the last two years with providers in PanAsia and Latin America. Their proprietary risk assessment algorithms combine traditional actuarial science with blockchain-native analytics in a way that creates true innovation,” said Owens. “I'm particularly impressed by how their smart contract architecture solves the oracle problem that has plagued similar projects, creating a seamless claims verification system that maintains both security and efficiency,” stated Owens when asked about the technical build. “His deep technical knowledge in both compression and streaming tech, coupled with his foresight in blockchain and AI, align perfectly with our mission to create a safe, global infrastructure for cryptocurrency adoption through the incorporation of the BDIC deposit insurance platform.” Glusman continued, “Following our announcement of 3PointOLabs last month focusing on our brand efforts, it was time to put the spotlight on our technical team as we will be announcing major collaborations in coming weeks.” Owens' appointment further reinforces BDIC's vision to normalize cryptocurrency use through decentralized insurance technology that can scale securely with mass adoption. His guidance will be instrumental as BDIC prepares for the next phase of development internationally, including the expansion of its coverage tiers, exchange partnerships, technological advances in wallet security. “Their wallet integration system maintains security while simplifying the user experience, making insurance accessible to both institutional and retail participants. By leveraging blockchain-powered smart contracts and advanced risk assessment algorithms, BDIC provides a vital safety net for cryptocurrency investments, ensuring trust, security, and long-term value in the digital economy through deposit insurance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liquid's TVL milestone showcases Bitcoin's growing role in tokenized assets and financial infrastructure. Today, the Liquid Federation has announced that the Liquid Network has surpassed $3.27 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. “Surpassing the $3 billion threshold marks a pivotal moment for both Liquid and Bitcoin, signaling the evolution of Bitcoinʼs ecosystem into a full-fledged platform for global financial markets,” said the CEO and Co-Founder of Blockstream Dr. Adam Back. “As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, and demand for regulated asset tokenization accelerates, Liquid is better positioned than ever to bridge Bitcoin with traditional finance and drive the next wave of capital markets innovation.” The announcement follows growing interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), with major moves such as BlackRock's decision to tokenize a $150 billion Treasury fund. Liquid supports over $1.8 billion in tokenized private credit and offers products like U.S. Treasury notes and digital currencies through Blockstream's AMP platform. Governed by over 80 global institutions, Liquid was launched in 2018 as Bitcoin's first sidechain. It is now preparing for a major upgrade with the mainnet release of Simplicity, aimed at expanding its smart contract capabilities. Recent bootcamps and important meetings with policy makers in Asia, Europe and Latin America reflect the network's growing global presence. Established in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is the oldest and most established source of trustworthy news, information and thought leadership on Bitcoin.</p>

Stablecoin issuers with assets above 10 billion dollars will be regulated at the federal level, while states will oversee smaller issuers with less than 10 billion dollars in assets. Bitcoin and altcoins are rising because investors see BTC as a safe haven asset after Moody's downgraded the US credit rating. The safe-haven appeal has pushed investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have added over $4.2 billion in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $43 billion. For example, the House of Representatives passed the “big, beautiful bill” that will add around $3.8 trillion in additional debt, according to some estimates. Fears over the rising U.S. debt and deficit have led investors to pull back from U.S. assets, especially equities. The U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to 99.6, while bond yields have surged.

The wallet tied to the Cetus Protocol exploit — 0xe28b50 — currently holds over 12.9 million SUI, valued at approximately $54 million at current prices. On-chain data shows the address has a net worth exceeding 32.9 million SUI (approximately $137 million), suggesting the attacker may have already bridged or swapped funds through multiple paths. This confirms the scale of the exploit and further pressures Sui's DeFi infrastructure, as major token pools and pairs remain drained.

The service aims to enhance payments with tokenised deposits for swift transactions

HSBC said its tokenised deposit programme can convert traditional bank deposits into digital tokens on a blockchain platform. As a result, payments through the service have the potential to cost less and take less time than traditional banking systems, according to Lewis Sun, HSBC's global head of domestic and emerging payments for global payments solutions.

The tokenised deposit infrastructure would enable corporate clients to make real-time Hong Kong and US dollar payments and transfer between HSBC Hong Kong wallets 24 hours a day, HSBC said.

The application was currently limited to use in Hong Kong and would expand to Asian and European markets in the second half of the year, it said.

“Tokenised deposits, when supported by regulated financial institutions, can offer a safe and fully compliant approach to improving payments and cash management for [companies],” Sun said.

“Hong Kong is an international financial centre committed to driving digital money innovation. This service sets a new benchmark for efficiency and innovation in digital money solutions for [companies].”

Ant International, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post, was the first client to complete an instant fund transfer using deposit tokenisation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Asda's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling,” said Madeleine Stone, Big Brother Watch. Privacy campaigners have filed a legal complaint with the UK's Information Commissioner, arguing that retail giant Asda's use of live facial recognition cameras in its supermarkets is “unlawful”. Big Brother Watch further alleged that the supermarket uses the biometric profiles of certain shoppers to create an alert if they enter a store and shares these profiles, along with allegations of unwanted conduct, between stores, however, staff do not provide or receive photos from the police. “Asda's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling, and risks violating the privacy rights of thousands of people,” said Madeleine Stone, senior advocacy officer at Big Brother Watch. “Facial recognition surveillance turns shoppers into suspects by subjecting customers browsing the supermarket aisles to a series of invasive biometric identity checks. However, in response, Asda said that the technology was only being implemented for a limited period in its Greater Manchester stores, with an Asda spokesperson telling DIGIT: “Like all retailers, our stores are subject to unprecedented levels of retail crime and on average four Asda colleagues were assaulted at work every day last year. “We have launched this trial in five stores for a limited period to assess how it can keep colleagues and customers safe. “This trial uses Asda's existing CCTV system and fully complies with all data protection regulations.” In 2019, the retailer denied using facial recognition cameras at its Preston store, insisting that the tech was only being used to improve CCTV quality and deter thieves without logging any personal information from customers. Six years later, this latest trial hit headlines last April with Asda reportedly being swamped by more than 5,400 complaints in what Big Brother said was a backlash from the public for using intrusive surveillance technology, a claim that the retailer roundly rejected, saying it had only received 89 emails about the trial through its official channels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The famous pizzas from Laszlo Hanyecz's May 22, 2010 Bitcoin Pizza Day purchase Today, bitcoin fans around the world are savoring pizza to celebrate Bitcoin developer and miner Laszlo Hanyecz's famous pizza order on May 22, 2010. On this day 15 years ago, Hanyecz paid another early bitcoin adopter 10,000 BTC in exchange for two large Papa John's pizzas. Laszlo Hanyecz's original Bitcoin Pizza Day post on May 18, 2010. His request was fulfilled by ... More another Bitcointalk users four days later. Bitcoiners observe this greasy, bitcoin-themed simulacrum of Thanksgiving with commiseration as much as celebration, because those 10,000 BTC are now worth more than $1 billion. But what most people don't realize is that Hanyecz may have spent as much as 79,000 BTC on follow-on pizza purchases that year, a sum that would be worth more than $8.7 billion today. Hanyecz noted that Bitcointalk, the popular forum focused on discussions about bitcoin that Hanyecz used to facilitate the original Bitcoin Pizza Day purchas, was full of users giving away bitcoin to newcomers by the hundreds or thousands. In fact, he was so pleased by the trade that he kept the offer open from May 22 until August 4, 2010, after which point he posted on Bitcointalk, saying, "I can't afford to keep doing it since I can't [mine] In the same post, he thanked “everyone who bought [him] pizza already,” so ostensibly he made additional pizza purchases between the May and August window. Fast forward four years, Hanyecz wrote about his erstwhile bitcoin fortune in another post. “I spent it all on pizza,” he said, with a link to the bitcoin address listed in his first ever Bitcointalk post to prove it. The wallet now ironically holds only enough to purchase a large pizza with the current BTC-USD rate, and it was effectively drained of its last significant bitcoin holdings in June 2011. The wallet's total outflows amount to a little over 81,432 BTC. In 2009 and 2010, Bitcoin's block reward was 50 BTC per block (plus transaction fees), and since bitcoin blocks are mined every ten minutes on average, this means that Hanyecz's 81,432 BTC fortune represented roughly 1.5% of all mined coins at the time. Hanyecz was a prolific developer in Bitcoin's early days. Not only did he design Bitcoin's first MacOS client, but he also was the first person – beside Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – to discover that bitcoin miners could generate new coins with graphics cards. But GPUs upgraded them with 10 times more computing power to generate new bitcoin. With Pandora's box opened, Hanyecz's discovery also elicited a polite reprimand from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. As detailed by Nathaniel Popper in his book Digital Gold, “Satoshi had mixed feelings” about this early introduction of GPU mining, which the Bitcoin creator seemed to have anticipated. And with that, we're left with a burning question: Did Hanyecz divest himself of his bitcoin fortune as a form of absolution for hastening Bitcoin's mining centralization? After all, why should he when the topic at hand – Bitcoin Pizza Day – is a constant reminder that he traded a future, multi-billion dollar fortune for mediocre pizza?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the metric began a downtrend on April 24, more than 1 million ETH have left exchanges to private wallets for potential long-term holding. As a result, ETH's supply on exchanges has reached its lowest level since August 2024. Similar to previous weeks, whales with a balance of 10K-100K continued leading the buying activity, growing their holdings by a net of 670K ETH in the past nine days. However, smaller holders have been distributing, with their total balance declining by 110K ETH during the same period. Despite dominant spot buying pressure, ETH continues to move range-bound near the $2,500 mark. ETH Futures Bubble Maps show increased trading volume whenever prices move below or above $2,500, making it a critical level that could define the top altcoin's next major trend. After closing near $2,500 on Tuesday, ETH briefly surged above $2,600 on Wednesday but saw a rejection just below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A move above $2,850 could see ETH rally toward the $3,250 resistance, while a breakdown below $2,100 could send its price to the $1,688 support. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is testing its moving average line as its histogram bars are about to flip negative. A successful cross below will signal rising downward pressure. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged above $110,000 for the first time on Wednesday, surpassing its previous record set just before President Donald Trump's January inauguration. The cryptocurrency gathered momentum this week after the Senate on Monday voted to advance a bill that establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, said the bank would allow clients to buy bitcoin. These latest developments reinforce expectations that Washington remains committed to developing a crypto-friendly regulatory framework and highlight the accelerating corporate acceptance of digital assets. The digital currency has gained about 45% since hitting an early-April low of around $76,000, when investors fled risky assets amid growing concerns about global trade tensions that have since subsided. Below, we break down the technicals on bitcoin's chart and identify crucial price levels that investors will likely be watching. Moreover, it's worth pointing out the move higher has occurred on decline trading volume, indicating that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. In another win for BTC bulls, the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day MA on Wednesday to form a golden cross, a chart event indicating further upside. Let's use technical analysis to project a potential bullish price target above bitcoin's record high and also identify three crucial support levels worth monitoring during future retracements in the cryptocurrency. Investors can project a price target above bitcoin's record high by using the bars pattern tool. We apply this technique by taking the cryptocurrency's trend higher from late April to early May and repositioning it from Sunday's low. We selected this prior trend as it commenced following a narrow consolidation range, similar to how the current move higher has started. This area would likely provide support near a horizontal line that connects a series of trading activity on the chart stretching back to last November. Finally, a more significant drop opens the door for bitcoin's price to revisit lower support around $92,000. Investors may seek entry points in this area near the two moving averages, which closely align with a range of peaks and troughs that developed on the chart between November and March.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high this week, briefly surging to $110,000 after the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill in the US Senate fueled optimism for regulatory clarity under President Donald Trump. While Bitcoin led the charge, altcoins have yet to confirm whether they'll follow BTC's breakout or continue lagging behind. The weekly relative strength index (RSI) sits just below 70, not yet overbought, giving bulls more runway. The 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) also continues to hold as solid dynamic support near $82,000. With increasing volume, the breakout appears to have technical strength. Ethereum has bounced nearly 50% from its local bottom and now approaches a decisive resistance near $2,950, which coincides with the lower trendline of its long-term ascending channel. This region also aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level from its $4,800 peak. A confirmed breakout above this zone would open the path to the channel's upper trendline near $4,800, reinforcing a broader bullish thesis. However, the weekly RSI still hovers around neutral levels, suggesting ETH needs strong momentum to push through this supply zone. While Bitcoin and Ethereum flash bullish patterns, XRP paints a starkly different technical picture. After failing to flip the $2.80 resistance into support, XRP/USD has traced a rounded top with lower highs, weakening its market structure.

This squeeze pattern frequently precedes volatility surges, which are characterized by a sharp price swing as compressed momentum finds direction. Although currently muted, volume lends credence to the compression narrative. XRP has a history of exhibiting explosive behavior after low-volume plateaus close to important technical thresholds. Since the RSI is close to 60, there is still space for the asset to rise without going into overbought territory right away. Latent bullish energy waiting for a catalyst is indicated by this technical setup. XRP is currently recovering from a multi-month downward trend, and its recent breakout above that structure earlier this month has not been disproven from a wider market structure standpoint. A continuation rally could be in the works based on the current price action, which points to a sound retest of support. As the long consolidation comes to an end and a new bullish leg begins, Ethereum has formally broken out of its descending trendline. Beyond simply being a technical milestone, this breakout could serve as the basis for Ethereum's long-awaited reversal and a push toward the crucial $3,000 mark. Its importance as a psychological and technical floor, which bulls successfully defended in the face of wider market hesitancy, is confirmed by the response from this level. In bullish times, this pattern frequently serves as a continuation structure, and ETH's follow-through has reinforced that assertion. No, Bitcoin Price Is Not Overheated Yet, Bullish Data Emerge On-chain Further upward movement is still possible, particularly in a breakout scenario, even though the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving toward overbought territory. This move could draw in sidelined buyers and start a new round of bullish activity if Ethereum can keep up the momentum and clear this region with increasing volume. Ethereum's technicals are pointing in the direction of a sustained increase. The level of $3,000 is now firmly on the horizon, and ETH may soon enter its next significant push if market conditions continue to be favorable. With the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) progressively approaching the longer-term 200 EMA, Shiba Inu is displaying early indications of a possible golden cross formation. In terms of price, SHIB has been comparatively steady in recent sessions, circling around the 100 EMA just above important support levels. The token is forming a base once more in anticipation of a catalyst that will push it higher following its previous unsuccessful breakout attempt above the 200 EMA. An impending momentum shift may be signaled by the 50 EMA's current proximity to the price action, but this needs to be confirmed. This setup could easily fade away before reaching full crossover status if there is not much buying pressure. Inflows from large holders have increased by more than 1100% in the last week, while outflow activity has also increased significantly. This implies that whales are paying more attention, though not necessarily in a positive way. Instead of accumulation, the opposing flows suggest redistribution or strategic repositioning. Now everyone's watching to see if the 50 EMA can continue to close the 200 EMA gap and set off a golden cross. Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions.
