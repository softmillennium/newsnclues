                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside derived from Rehmanniae Radix, has therapeutic potential in neurologic diseases due to its diverse biological activities. This review summarizes the research advances and therapeutic potential of catalpol for a wide range of neurologic disorders, including depression, cognitive impairment, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The common mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of catalpol on these neurologic disorders are closely related to antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, as well as the capacity to promote neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Despite the promising results from experimental studies, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as identifying direct binding targets, assessing toxicologic effects, and understanding pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, well-designed and controlled clinical trials should be conducted to validate the efficacy and safety for treating various neurologic conditions. This review provides compelling evidence supporting catalpol as a promising natural neuroprotective agent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women who choose to stop treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are putting their health at risk, and have to weigh their desire to have children and breastfeed against a risk that we know very little about. In two ongoing clinical trials, researchers establish a new standard for human lactation studies that includes sampling of breast milk and plasma from both mothers and breastfed infants. The lack of scientific evidence is an ethical problem for women and doctors, considering that around 70 percent of women need to use medicines sometime during their pregnancy. In many cases, women are recommended to refrain from breastfeeding or stop using their medicines. However, breastfeeding has benefits for both mother and child." Mats G. Hansson, senior professor of biomedical ethics, Uppsala University's Centre for Research Ethics & Bioethics, head of two ongoing clinical trials 95 percent of all medicines have not been studied well enough to include safety information for pregnancy and breastfeeding on the label. The current standard for lactation studies uses animal data and concentrations of medicines in mother's milk, using PB/PK to estimate how much of a particular substance transfers to the baby. BMJ Open has just published a protocol for a new golden standard for clinical lactation studies, looking at the concentration of prednisolone in the mother's milk, and plasma from both mother and infant. Prednisolone is prescribed for several conditions, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, a chronic and debilitating condition that requires long-term treatment. Samples are biobanked and analyzed with regard to pharmacokinetic properties of the medicines and transfer from breast milk to infant plasma. With biobanking and the obtainment of informed consent for future, yet unspecified research, the protocol opens for long-term follow up of medication effects on breastfeeding infants. Women are recruited through a network of clinical centres in Sweden, and the samples are stored for future research in a network of breast milk biobanks managed by BBMRI-ERIC. According to Mats G. Hansson, this ensures the study is part of a larger European infrastructure, making future research possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although terms like "common" and "unlikely" may sound descriptive enough, experts in medical decision-making suggest that leaving out numbers may be misleading for patients. In a paper published on April 29 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, a team of researchers and clinicians explained that patients often overestimate risk estimates, like possible side effects or medical conditions, when given only verbal descriptions. They encourage doctors not to shy away from including numbers, offering a list of five science-backed tricks on how to make those numbers count. One of the purposes of this paper is to help physicians figure out how to communicate numeric information about risks so that patients can understand and use them to make better choices, take charge of their health and be healthier long term." Peters, also director of the Center for Science Communication Research at the UO, draws on two decades of research on how patients understand numbers and make decisions. She said it's a common concern that patients won't understand numerical information, as about a third of American adults have limited numerical skills. But she's found that people often prefer getting numbers. According to her previous studies, people rated messages more trustworthy and their messenger more expert when they provided data. Han of the National Cancer Institute and Clara N. Lee at the University of North Carolina, Peters hopes their recommended strategies will facilitate stronger shared decision-making between patients and their health care providers. "There's a whole raft of strategies that you can use, some of which might be more appropriate in one situation versus the other," she said. "But by choosing one of them, you can help people use statistics more than they typically would. Physicians often default to verbal terms, knowing that a sizable portion of American adults struggle with simple numeric concepts, Peters said. But research has shown that people better understand risks and react appropriately when numbers are discussed alongside verbal descriptions. "When you present numeric evidence, like the likelihood of side effects for a prescription medication, what ends up happening is that it helps correct people's original expectation," Peters said. "They're much less likely to overestimate the risk and are more likely to take on a physician's recommendations." Do: "Headache is a common side effect and occurs in 7 percent of people." Don't: "Headache is a common side effect." When patients are overwhelmed by medical information, they may rely on mental problem-solving techniques, like gut feelings, pre-existing beliefs and anecdotes they've heard from others. Numbers said alone can be meaningless, so Peters suggests using evaluative labels, like "a 6 percent risk is generally considered poor," or comparisons to indicate whether it's high or low risk. Do: "Ninety-three percent of patients survive with treatment A compared to 99 percent who survive with treatment B." Don't: "Ninety-three percent of patients survive with treatment A." In some cases, being upfront about the uncertainty of whether a patient will be a part of the 40 percent side or the 60 percent side of a risk, for example, can help convey to patients how seriously they should take it. Do: "Estimates of the chance of something happening are only a best guess based on the scientific knowledge we have right now. We do not know your personal real risk because of things about you that have never been studied and we don't yet understand." Don't: Present numeric risk information as unerringly precise and correct. So doctors can use the teach-back technique, Peters said, in which they ask their patient to repeat what they understood and found important. The physician can then insert more information to either correct what's wrong or remind them of something. Such strategies also can be used by patients to advocate for themselves, Peters said. If told about a possible side effect, they can ask how statistically likely it is. If given too many possible side effects or treatments, they can request to simplify the information to the most important facts. Peters plans to conduct a series of studies to test which of the five strategies is the most effective. She also is interested in how storytelling and anecdotes affect patient decision-making. "Physicians have very limited time in any one appointment and are often faced with a similar patient over and over," Peters said. "What that means is, if you're trying to help them better communicate with patients, you've got to provide things that are fast and scripted so that everyone can make informed decisions about their care."

DISCLOSURES |  May 22, 2025  



Mariana Chavez MacGregor, MD, MSc, shares her enthusiasm for the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting, particularly for its relevance to early-stage breast cancer. She highlights key sessions focused on treatment optimization and de-escalation for HER2-positive patients, along with important updates on the management of HR-positive breast cancer in premenopausal women, including the SOFT, TEXT, and ASTRRA trials.

Dr Chavez MacGregor also points to new research on elinzanetant for managing vasomotor symptoms associated with endocrine therapy. Additionally, she is eager to attend the Dr Bernard Fisher Memorial Annual Clinical Science Symposium, which will explore circulating tumor DNA and its role in monitoring early-stage breast cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>circPVT1 has emerged as a key regulator in disease progression and clinical outcomes. However, its prognostic relevance and association with clinicopathological parameters in solid malignancies remain to be fully elucidated. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI, with a cutoff date of December 31, 2024. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0 to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessing the impact of circPVT1 expression on overall survival (OS) and its association with clinicopathological characteristics. This analysis included 27 clinical studies encompassing a total of 2,219 patients. This association was particularly notable in lung cancer (HR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.51–2.88, P < 0.001) and osteosarcoma (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.38–1.97, P < 0.001), with similar trends observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Our meta-analysis indicated that elevated circPVT1 expression levels are closely linked to unfavorable OS in tumor patients. circPVT1 has the potential to act as both a prognostic indicator and a molecular target for solid tumor therapy. Future research should focus on validating these findings through large-scale, multicenter prospective studies to further establish the clinical utility of circPVT1 in cancer management.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's good news for people with migraine who take common drugs before or during pregnancy-a new study found no increase in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD in their children. The study, which looked at drugs used for migraine attacks called triptans, is published on May 21, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study does not prove that there is a link between these drugs and neurodevelopment disorders. These results are encouraging for people with migraine, who may be taking these drugs before they even know that they are pregnant, and this is helpful information for their physicians, who can make more informed decisions about treating people with debilitating migraine attacks." Of those, 21,281 people, or over 80%, had taken triptans in the year before they became pregnant and 4,929 of those with migraine had not taken any triptans during that time. For those who took the drugs, researchers divided them into four groups: people who had low use of triptans and stopped using them before pregnancy (42%); people who increased using triptans six months before pregnancy and stopped using them in early pregnancy (31%); people who had moderate triptan use before pregnancy and continued into early pregnancy (21%); and people who used triptans before and during pregnancy (6%). Then researchers followed the children born for an average of eight years and up until they were 14 years old for some. Overall, 1,140 children, or 4.3%, were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder during the study. When researchers adjusted the results to account for other factors that could affect the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as a parent having a neurodevelopmental disorder, folic acid intake or use of other drugs such as opioids or antidepressants, they found no increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders among children exposed to triptans prenatally. "While symptoms often improve during pregnancy, about 8% of people experience worsening attacks during pregnancy, which can lead to increased risks of both maternal and fetal complications, so it's vital to have treatment options available." A limitation of the study was that researchers did not verify that people took their migraine medications, only that they filled their prescriptions, so the actual drug exposure may be different than the estimates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In women with dense breasts (breasts with relatively low levels of fatty tissue) and a negative mammogram, supplemental imaging techniques detect early-stage cancers, with imaging techniques three times more effective than ultrasound, finds a phase 3 randomized control trial published in The Lancet. Women with extremely dense breasts, about 10% of those aged 50-70 years in the UK, face a fourfold increased risk of breast cancer compared to those with the least dense breasts. Mammograms are less effective for detecting early-stage cancer in dense breasts, as the tissue can hide tumors on the breast x-rays. Previous studies have shown MRI and ultrasound are effective supplementary imaging methods, but this study is the first to compare them with contrast mammography in women with normal mammograms and dense breast tissue. Over 9000 women in the UK with dense breasts and a negative mammogram were randomly allocated to one of three different supplementary techniques. Authors highlight that although this study shows the scans can detect additional small cancers which are likely to save lives, further research is needed to confirm whether they could reduce the number of deaths due to breast cancer, to establish the risk of overdiagnosis and to estimate the cost benefit ratio of implementing a supplemental imaging strategy for breast cancer screening. In addition to the relevance for the UK's breast cancer screening programme, this study has global implications for all countries where screening is undertaken for women with dense breast tissue."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prophylactic radiation therapy to the contralateral breast significantly delayed the onset of contralateral breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants with early breast cancer. The 10-year contralateral breast cancer rates were lower among those who received radiotherapy than among those who did not. “This novel approach, albeit controversial, is supported by the findings that highlight the need for a larger international trial,” the authors concluded. The study, led by Ella Evron, MD, Oncology, Kaplan Medical Institute, Rehovot, Israel, was published online in JAMA Oncology. Higher rates of estrogen receptor positivity and endocrine treatment for the index breast cancer, as well as elective risk-reducing mastectomy, in the control group could have contributed to the lower-than-expected rate of contralateral breast cancer. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was also lower than expected, which could have affected the findings. This trial was funded by the Israel Cancer Association. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest. This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.
