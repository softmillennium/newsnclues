                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Players are currently completing their preparation ahead of the tournament starting on Sunday, with the players discovering today who they will face in the opening match. As with any big sporting event, the world will be hoping and praying to see some early shocks and we look at three seeds who could be in danger of an early exit after the draw was made. It sounds crazy to suggest that the world number three might be in danger of an early exit at a tournament that he's reached the final of, but Alexander Zverev really is like a box of chocolates at the moment. He was moaning about the balls at the Italian Open, and after entering the Hamburg Open for some match practice, he was dumped out in the second round by Alexandre Muller. The Polish performer knows all about causing shocks in tennis, following his exploits at Wimbledon in 2021 when he defeated Roger Federer in his final appearance at the All England club. Hurkacz hasn't had a glowing start to 2025, though, and drawing Joao Fonseca is a bit of a nightmare for the player who would have loved nothing more than a few straightforward rounds to try and progress in the tournament. It's also important to add into the mix that clay is far from Hurkacz's favourite surface and Fonseca might even start their first round match as the favourite to progress to round two. It's worth mentioning here that Tsitsipas is usually solid on this surface and in 2021, he reached the final and looked on course to claim a first Grand Slam title. Much like Zverev, however, you just never know what is going to happen when Tsitsipas steps onto the court and his form has once again been somewhat sporadic this year. He was dumped out in the first round of the Australian Open in January and in France, he will come up against tricky Argentine performer Tomas Martin Echeverry in the first round, which should provide him with a stern test.</p>

Sabalenka's quarter provides a projected Rome rematch against Zheng Qinwen, who scored her first meeting over the world No. Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals and semifinals of her last two Roland Garros appearances and will play her first match against Kamila Rakhimova. Zheng gets a tough path starting with 2021 Roland Garros finalist Anastasia Pavluyuchenkova, and she could face rising star Alexandra Eala in the second round.Eala has been one of the biggest stories of the 2025 season, the Filipina teenager storming into the Miami Open semifinals with wins over Australian Open Madison Keys and Swiatek, ultimately pushing eventual finalist Jessica Pegula through three tough sets. 1 Naomi Osaka gets a popcorn first-rounder against No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, who missed most of the clay-court swing due to injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grigor Sargsyan, a 28-year-old Armenian man known as 'the Maestro', was thought to be the ringleader of a massive match-fixing scheme, organised via encrypted messaging, involving dozens of low-ranked players in small tournaments with little prize money. “The impression we're getting is that it is very commonplace,” one official told The Associated Press as up to 180 players were suspected of having worked with the syndicate, fixing matches, sets or games in exchange for payments of 500 to 3,000 euros ($570 to $3,400). He had about 180 players in his portfolio, and there are probably about 1500 players in the world rankings, so that adds up to a very high percentage of potentially fixed matches”, said Kronow Rasmussen. Kronow underlines that WTA, ATP and ITF are partly responsible for having created the problem around match-fixing because prize money for many lower-ranked players doesn't even begin to cover the massive expenses for coaching, training, food, travel and accommodation. It's really a big mess”, says Kronow Rasmussen. Every tournament has a set amount of prize money, which varies dramatically depending on the type of event and while a ticket for the first round of a Grand Slam tournament (players who make it to the first round of Wimbledon's main singles draw take home £60,000) can cover all expenses for a whole year, paychecks and ranking points available continue to decrease for lower levels of tournaments. Jamie Loeb, who is currently ranked 305 on the women's WTA Tour, also says that prize money distinctions are often misleading. That amount is split up amongst everybody, plus taxes, plus expenses, so most of the time you're losing money at those tournaments, even if you win”, said Loeb to ESPN. With financial insecurity constantly hovering like a black cloud over the lives of young tennis players struggling to make ends meet, it is not surprising that some players are tempted to cut corners if they are asked to fix matches by shady businessmen, according to Frederik Lochte Nielsen, former winner of the Wimbledon doubles tournament and current Danish Davis Cup captain. “There is no doubt that, when you have a system that is organised like it is today, where people play for peanuts and someone comes and asks if you want $10,000 to lose the first set, then there are many who are tempted, which you can also see because there are many who get caught,” Lochte Nielsen tells Flashscore. “Tennis is an incredibly attractive sport to bet on because there are matches all year round and you make bets per point, so I think that will always be a huge problem”, adds Lochte Nielsen who has previously admitted that he was offered money to lose on purpose but immediately chose to turn it down. Still, there is evidence that the system was far from effective, as a report in 2018 uncovered a "tsunami of corruption in lower-level tennis." The report pointed out that lower-level tennis had turned into a fertile breeding ground for match-fixing due to the number of players struggling to make a living, few people watching the matches in person, and the ITF's decision to sell official live scoring data in 2012. Seven years later, nothing has changed, says Kronow Rasmussen. "A number of organisations pat themselves on the back, when they find a tennis player who has cheated, but they usually never find the perpetrators and it would be better if athletes were trained not to accept money, or prize money was offered at a size that enabled players to live a decent life," adds Kronow Rasmussen, who underlines that he doesn't think any tennis player enjoys cheating. "I think 70% of tennis players do it out of necessity rather than because they think it's fun to cheat. Nobody thinks it's cool to lose on purpose. "But if you get 5000 euros, you might look through it because the family needs to have food on the table," concludes Kronow Rasmussen.</p>

Interview: Becker, who coached Djokovic from 2013-2016, gave his thoughts on the six-month partnership At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Boris Becker revealed he is “lost for words” that Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray's coaching partnership has ended after just six months. Yet Djokovic's results have nosedived since, with just one final appearance in Miami, and he lost his first matches on the clay of Monte Carlo and Madrid. As such, last week, the pair jointly announced that they have gone their separate ways, with Djokovic adding this week he “couldn't get more” out of the partnership. But three-time Wimbledon champion Becker, who coached Djokovic between 2013-2016, believed the pair would continue working together until at least The Championships, which start on 30 June. “I'm a little bit surprised that they would end their working relationship just a week before Roland-Garros,” Becker told The Independent, ahead of the French Open beginning this Sunday. I really wanted to see them both at Wimbledon, actually. “Andy knows a thing or two about winning Wimbledon, he's very popular there. I thought it would be an advantage for Novak to have Andy in his corner. “I'm a little bit lost for words [as to] why they've broken up just before the second grand slam.” Djokovic, who turned 38 on Thursday, is a seven-time winner at Wimbledon but has lost in the final to Carlos Alcaraz in the last two years, while Murray won the tournament in 2013 and 2016. Becker, who will feature on TNT Sports's coverage of Roland-Garros, coached Djokovic to Wimbledon titles in 2014 and 2015, and the German, 57, said he considers the 24-time grand slam champion like a “younger brother”.

So, who can he talk to that knows more? “I think he has tennis left in him, but he has to be realistic,” Becker added, regarding Djokovic's future in the sport. The Serb won his first match on clay this year at the Geneva Open on Wednesday, beating Marton Fucsovics in straight sets. He faces Matteo Arnaldi in the quarter-finals on Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heading into Thursday's draw for the French Open, there was only one huge storyline: Where would Iga Swiatek, the women's champion four of the last five years, end up? 5 seed, meaning one of the top four seeds would have to face the most accomplished clay courter of their generation in the quarterfinals. The loser of that random drawing? Jasmine Paolini, who lost to Swiatek in last year's final and comes to Roland Garros in top form, having just won the Italian Open in her home country. 2 seeded American still seeking a second Grand Slam title after winning the 2023 US Open, will begin this year's French as a pretty solid favorite to make the final given how the draw shook out. Gauff, who recently lost in the finals of Rome (to Paolini) and Madrid (to Sabalenka), even avoided tricky opponents in the early rounds – at least on paper. 30 Anna Kalinskaya, has never advanced beyond the second round in Paris. In the fourth round, she would be projected to face former Roland Garros winner Barbora Krejcikova, who is coming off a back injury and hasn't played an official match this year. In the quarterfinals, Gauff would potentially play No. And Gauff's most likely semifinal opponents would be No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, whom she's beaten twice in routine fashion on clay recently, or No. 3 seeded American Jessica Pegula, who is much more comfortable on hard court than the French surface. Meanwhile, if Sabalenka is going to make the final, she must deal with several stumbling blocks including potentially a quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, who won the Olympics last year at Roland Garros, and whoever emerges from the Paolini/Swiatek quarter. Of course, Swiatek may not even get there because she is potentially lined up for a round of 16 match with Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, whom she has never beaten in six matches.</p>

The 2021 US Open champion has never beaten Swiatek in her career. Raducanu suffered an injury scare just four days before the French Open in a three-set defeat to Danielle Collins on Wednesday. Fellow Brit Katie Boulter could face a challenging second-round match of her own. 1 is scheduled to play Madison Keys if she beats a qualifier. As far as other British interest goes, Sonay Kartal will play Erika Andreeva in the opening round, while Jodie Burrage has a meeting with America's Collins. Draper will start against Sinner's compatriot Mattia Bellucci. Jacob Fearnley, who is playing in the French Open for the fist time in his career will play 40-year-old former French Open champion Stan Wawrinka in the first round. Cameron Norrie was also handed a tough draw. The Brit will have to get past Daniil Medvedev if he is to progress beyond the first round.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys: From Triumph to Turmoil – Will the Former Slam Champion Overcome Recent Struggles at Roland Garros? Madison Keys, once basked in the glory of her Australian Open victory, is now facing a tumultuous journey filled with challenges and doubts as she gears up for the upcoming French Open at Roland Garros. The American tennis star soared to new heights by clinching her maiden Grand Slam title, but the aftermath of her triumph has proven to be more exhausting than she could have ever imagined. After her historic win in Melbourne, Keys was forced to take a hiatus from the sport due to a leg injury, missing crucial tournaments in the Middle East before returning for the BNP Paribas Open. Despite her initial resurgence at the Indian Wells, where she reached the semifinals, Keys' form has been inconsistent in recent tournaments. Disappointing early exits at the Miami Open, Charleston, and Rome have raised concerns about her readiness for the challenges ahead in Paris. The American's struggles on clay courts further exacerbate doubts about her performance at Roland Garros. While she has shown flashes of brilliance in past editions, including semifinal and quarterfinal appearances, her recent track record suggests a potential uphill battle in Paris. With critics questioning her ability to replicate past successes on the Roland Garros clay, all eyes are on Madison Keys as she seeks to overcome her recent setbacks and make a lasting impression at the upcoming Grand Slam event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BERLIN: If there is one tennis player who knows how to beat the odds when they are stacked against him, it is 24-times Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. The 38-year-old Serbian's bid for a fourth French Open crown looks more unlikely than in many years, with Djokovic struggling for form since his run to the Australian Open semifinals back in January before retiring injured. Since then Djokovic, who has 99 tour titles to his name and is in the twilight of a glorious career, has reached only one final and has not lifted a trophy this year. After two early losses in Monte Carlo and Madrid, it was clear that Djokovic's attempt to claim a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam could be his hardest yet. “(It is) kind of a new reality for me, I have to say, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament,” Djokovic said after his early Madrid exit. Instead he picked up a surprise wild card for the Geneva Open this week, in what looks like a last-ditch attempt to get some more matches on clay under his belt before Paris. News of the wild card came as Djokovic split with his coach Andy Murray after only a few months working together. Djokovic appointed fellow former world number one Murray ahead of this year's Australian Open and the Serb said at the Qatar Open in February that he would continue working with the Scot for an indefinite period. That time, however, ended abruptly last week with the Djokovic-Murray partnership yielding no titles and one losing final in Miami. Their partnership is now officially over as Djokovic heads toward the French Open in a cloud of uncertainty over his form and future. The world number six has struggled to assert his dominance after winning three out of the four Grand Slams in 2023. There is even more uncertainty over his chances of reaching the last major goal in his illustrious career: adding that elusive 25th record Grand Slam to his collection to move past Margaret Court on the all-time winners' list. “The Final Qualification Tournament is always a thrilling, do-or-die moment in the build-up to Rugby World Cup — and it's fitting that we bring it to a world-class destination like Dubai,” Robinson said. He added: “As we head toward the most inclusive and globally representative tournament ever, with 24 teams competing in an expanded format and at least one nation from each of our regional associations, this final step on the ‘Journey to Australia 2027' will be a celebration of ambition, resilience and the global spirit of rugby. We cannot wait to see which team earns the final place and joins us for what promises to be a unique celebration of rugby and Australia in 2027.” With 24 teams, a round of 16 stage, and a total of 52 matches, it will be the largest Rugby World Cup to date, aimed at increasing opportunities for emerging nations and enhancing the overall fan experience. As the global qualification process reaches its final chapter, all eyes will turn to Dubai this November. In modern parlance, it is what techies would call a “disruptor,” to say the least. It will take a lot more, however, for sporting fans of earlier generations to get their heads around the concept of the Enhanced Games, which were officially announced on Wednesday and will take place next year in Las Vegas. Saudi Arabia's Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al-Saud, founder and CEO of KBW Ventures and chairman of the Kingdom's Sports For All Federation, is the region's first, and to date only, investor in the tournament that allows athletes to use performance-enhancing substances without being subjected to testing. “Look, I like to think of myself as a progressive investor, venture capital typically backs very nascent ideas,” he told Arab News. “As someone who is pretty involved in sports on both personal and business levels, I think there is a segment of the world who would like to push the limits of human potential,” Prince Khaled said. All questions in sport that someone like me is curious about, and very eager to see. I want to see real-world application, and a competitive approach.” He accepts that this idea, with all the ethical points and counterpoints it evokes, might take a long time to be accepted in mainstream sports. The world wasn't ready for most fresh concepts. At the most basic level people weren't even ready for ride-hailing, now it is considered a must for many all over the world, he said. That doesn't mean they should never be done. “Elite athletes who have never been granted the opportunity to experiment with body autonomy and enhancement exploration can now sign up if they so choose,” said Prince Khaled. “If you want to talk sports in specific, I also think the world wasn't ready for MMA, but it's now one of the biggest crowd draws out there.” The Games is for those who choose to enroll and compete with enhancements. It is ethical; the ethics rests in equality, safety and transparency. “There is a disclosure protocol, and everyone knows that everyone else is applying the same types of enhancements and experimenting with biohacking. Prince Khaled is known to be the Middle East North Africa face of venture capital, with investments across artificial intelligence, biotechnology, agricultural and food technology, as well as in the sports-adjacent sector, robotics and broadcast technologies. One of his biotechnology bets, Colossal Biosciences, recently made headlines with its reported $10.2 billion valuation. “I met the co-founder of Enhanced Games (Aron D'Souza) at a private conclave staged by FII (Future Investment Initiative) last year in Riyadh. Some of the foremost figures were present; from stakeholders from the Saudi Health in All Policies committee, to scientists, to entrepreneurs and investors.” “I do think the Enhanced Games can play an important role here; how better to analyze the effects of enhancement than on elite athletes? People who are in the best possible shape physically that they can be naturally, and then build on that,” he said. Established figures, including Australian swimming coach Brett Hawke, have backed the idea. At the age of 31, four-time Olympic Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev will take part in the Enhanced Games, having received a $1 million prize for breaking the long-standing 50-meter freestyle world record with a time of 20.89 seconds. However, having not consistently been at the top of the sport, he sees these Games as an opportunity to make up for missed opportunities. “One year at the Enhanced Games could earn me more than six Olympic cycles combined,” Gkolomeev told Arab News. “I've never had this kind of support; doctors, nutritionists, therapists, all working to make me better.” No, but this will definitely spark some honest and much-needed discussions about the irregularities between sporting rules and different governing bodies, and the allegations of unfair treatment levied against some athletes over others.” “Democratizing access to aging solutions is what first interested me in the Games, and then I began to think of the implications on sport. “I'm sure you know about the politics involved when deciding which athletes were accused of using enhancements, in several instances countries felt their athletes were unfairly targeted. I bet if you ask the athletes that felt they were wrongly maligned, they would be pretty quick to agree that politics played a role.” “To my knowledge, there are two cohorts, one is enhanced with their own resources and medical guidance, and one cohort that is officially under the Enhanced Games,” said Prince Khaled. “They will definitely have better medical guidance and access to the latest in monitoring methodologies and technologies with the Enhanced Games than they have ever had in their professional sporting careers.” “Everyone knows one of the biggest barriers to elite athletics is cost,” he added. “To bring this conversation full circle, this is something enabled by funding, and in venture capital, funding is, most of the time, allocated to groundbreaking entities and ideas.” Prince Khaled said he is a “cautious believer in biohacking” which is, simply stated, the optimization of nutrition to enhance energy, cognitive function, and overall health and well-being. “KBW Ventures is invested in biotechnology, health tech, medtech, and with the Enhanced Games, I consider it kind of an ultimate biohacking opportunity for elite athletes,” he said. “I expect that so much valuable scientific data on reversing biological age, and repair and so much more is going to come out of the Enhanced Games,” Prince Khaled added. “On a separate note, the athletes that participate in the Games have to undergo what is termed health testing, ensuring that they are fit to compete. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the world of athletics was shaken to its core when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of the gold medal he had won with a world record time of 9.79 seconds. Since then, many other athletes have been banned from participating, or stripped of medals, for similar offences with increasingly less fanfare and shock. It remains a tough, if not almost impossible sell, for a sporting community brought up on the concepts of fair play and the dangers of performance-enhancing drugs. Whether the world is ready for these Games, and how the future will judge these developments, remain open questions. Tyrese Haliburton was a bit premature after he mimicked Hall of Famer Reggie Miller's infamous “choke” sign at Madison Square Garden. Nevertheless, Haliburton and his Indiana Pacers teammates made certain the gesture didn't come back to haunt them in a 138-135 victory in overtime over the New York Knicks on Wednesday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. Haliburton scored 31 points and Aaron Nesmith added 30, highlighting an 8-for-9 performance from 3-point range by making five treys during the final 3 1/2 minutes of regulation. “It's unreal,” Nesmith said of his sizzling shooting. I love it when that basket feels like an ocean and anything you toss up, you feel like it's going to go in. It's so much fun.” Haliburton appeared to win it following a friendly carom off the rim on an apparent 3-pointer at the buzzer, only for replays to show that his toe was on the line. But we finished it in overtime,” Haliburton said. Miller famously flashed the gesture toward Knicks superfan Spike Lee while leading a Pacers comeback in a playoff game in 1994. The third-seeded Knicks will look to bounce back in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series on Friday in New York. When you lose it's the worst thing ever,” said Knicks star Jalen Brunson, who finished with 43 points. Making sure we have each other's backs.” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle also kept it in perspective after the game. We're not gonna get too excited about this,” he said. Game 2's gonna be another war.” Andrew Nembhard sank a 3-pointer and two layups in OT, the last lay-in giving Indiana a 136-135 lead with 26.7 seconds to play. An attempted pass to Brunson deflected off his fingers and out of bounds, and former Knick Obi Toppin's dunk extended the advantage to three with 10.9 seconds left. Brunson and teammate Karl-Anthony Towns misfired on 3-point attempts in the final moments. Pascal Siakam scored 17 points, Nembhard finished with 15 and Myles Turner added 14 for the Pacers. Towns collected 35 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks. Towns sank 4 of 8 shots from 3-point range, a big improvement after he made just 3 of 19 attempts from beyond the arc in New York's six-game series victory over the Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals. Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby each scored 16 points in the loss. Brunson committed his fifth foul with 10:05 remaining in the fourth quarter and retreated to the bench after T.J. McConnell made a free throw to pull Indiana within 94-92. The Pacers did themselves no favors by fouling Miles McBride and Towns on 3-point attempts, with the duo combining to make 5 of 6 free throws. “I feel like our intensity dropped,” said New York's Josh Hart, who amassed eight points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. Louisiana native Dustin Poirier is locked for a UFC BMF title fight in his home state to conclude his career, as New Orleans will host Poirier's battle with title-holder Max Holloway to highlight the July 19 card at the Smoothie King Center. Both fighters are coming off losses in title fights, however. Poirier (30-9) submitted to Islam Makhachev last June, while the 33-year-old Holloway (26-8) lost in knockout fashion to Ilia Topuria in October. “For Dustin Poirier to be able to finish his remarkable UFC career in New Orleans is special,” UFC executive vice president Peter Dropick said in a news release. “Thank you to the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation, the Louisiana Office of Tourism, New Orleans & Company and Smoothie King Center for helping us make this happen. “It's been 10 years since we've held an event in New Orleans, we know the fans are ready for us to be back!“ The Octagon will also play host to ranked middleweights No 10 Marvin Vettori (19-8-1) and No. 11 Brendan Allen (24-7), who will do battle for the first time in an official capacity at UFC 318. The two were slated to fight at UFC Vegas 90 last April, though Vettori pulled out. The rest of the lineup includes newly announced fights between Kyler Phillips (12-3) and Vinicius Oliveira (22-3) at the bantamweight level, Jimmy Crute (12-4-2) facing Marcin Prachnio (17-8) in light heavyweight and Carli Judice (4-2) battling Nicolle Caliari (8-3) at women's fly. NEW YORK: The case for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was simple. He's the best player on an Oklahoma City Thunder team that had the best record this season and set a league mark for margin of victory. If that wasn't enough, he also won the scoring title. It's now seven straight years that a player born outside the US won MVP, extending the longest such streak in league history. And when it happened, Gilgeous-Alexander said a life of moments — getting cut, traded, overlooked, celebrating, the wins, the good times — all flooded into his mind. “I don't think there's enough emphasis on how much off the court influences on the court,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “And once I became better off the court my career started to skyrocket. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, getting 88 of the 100 possible third-place votes. 11 pick in the 2018 draft — averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game this season, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record. He becomes the second Canadian to win MVP; Steve Nash won it twice. “He set the foundation,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of Nash. “He was the first Canadian basketball player I knew of. And Gilgeous-Alexander is the first guard to win MVP since James Harden in 2018. “His confidence that he has in himself and the confidence that he instills in every one of his teammates, including the coaches.” Jokic — a winner of three of the last four MVP awards — was second, despite a season for the ages. He averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game, the first center to average a triple-double and the first player since all those stats were tracked to finish in the NBA's top three in all three of those categories. Russell Westbrook did it four times and Oscar Robertson once, but only one of those triple-double seasons led to an MVP win. Antetokounmpo, who averaged 30.4 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, was third. Now, it's Gilgeous-Alexander — a son of Ontario, where hockey reigns — carrying the MVP flag. He was fifth in the voting two years ago, second behind Jokic last year, and used being so close to the award as fuel this season. “And last year, all it meant was that more people thought I shouldn't have won than should have won. This year I wanted to change the narrative and have it flipped. Detroit's Cade Cunningham and Minnesota's Anthony Edwards tied for seventh, Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth and three players — the Los Angeles Clippers' Harden, New York's Jalen Brunson and Cleveland's Evan Mobley — tied for 10th. The other awards that were part of that voting process and have already been unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning coach of the year, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels winning most improved player, San Antonio's Stephon Castle winning rookie of the year, Cleveland's Evan Mobley winning defensive player of the year, New York's Jalen Brunson winning clutch player of the year and Boston's Payton Pritchard winning sixth man of the year. The award came at a price for Gilgeous-Alexander, who is in line for an extension that will easily top $300 million and could even see him make about $1 million per regular-season game in 2030-31 and 2031-32.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matteo Berrettini has officially withdrawn from the French Open as his nightmare injury run continues. 28 has not played Roland Garros since his quarter-final run in 2021 after years of on-and-off physical issues. Berrettini also retired from his last two tournaments, the Masters 1000s in Madrid and Rome. Berrettini's withdrawal was announced just three hours before the main draw ceremony is due to take place in Paris on Thursday afternoon. The Italian will be replaced by a lucky loser. I was surprised at how my body reacted up to a certain point," Berrettini said following his third-round retirement. I had to pull out one more time. I did not want that thing there to happen again." Just in    Zverev 'threw up 37 times' before suffering big upset ahead of French Open This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Berrettini also retired while facing Britain's Jack Draper in the third round of the Madrid Open a few weeks ago. The 2021 Wimbledon runner-up has since revealed that he is facing an oblique injury, similar to an issue that sidelined him from the tour a few years ago. "It is close to a point where I have hurt before, I don't know what is wrong with my obliques. The feelings, unfortunately I know them well because I've been there over and over again," he added. In 2022, Berrettini missed the entire clay season after undergoing emergency surgery for a hand injury. An abdominal and oblique issue kept him out of the tournament in 2023 and, last year, he said he was "not quite ready" to return to competiton in Paris after suffering with illness. It's been a tough few years for Berrettini, who peaked at No. 6 in the world three years ago and reached his only Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in 2021, losing to Djokovic. Berrettini will be hoping to recover in time for the grass swing as he thrives on the surface. He is defending 165 ranking points from reaching the Stuttgart final last year and is a two-time former champion at London's Queen's Club.

Will Naomi Osaka's much-anticipated Roland Garros outfit be inspired by the cherry blossom? Osaka revealed Tuesday that her sneaker muse for the clay-court major is the flower known as sakura in her native Japan. "Spring is sakura season," Osaka wrote in the caption. "The girlies are gonna love this one." "This special design is a luxurious take on an ornate bouquet from the French Baroque time period," the apparel-maker added on its website. Osaka has been designing eye-catching custom outfits with Nike since 2019, and in April, she wrote on the social media app Threads that she was "treating every Grand Slam like the Met Gala" when it came to her future outfits -- getting fans excited for the creativity she no doubt has in store. At the Australian Open, Osaka first revealed that blossoms would play a big part in her on-court fashion on major stages this season. "The Australian Open's the happy Slam, so I thought it was really fitting for it to have a sunny theme," she noted, and teased more to come. "Every Slam this year will have a flower-themed shoe. 1 will fully unveil her spring threads when the main draw kicks off on May 25.

The massive upgrade will expand fan space, luxury lounges and athlete perks Arthur Ashe Stadium, the grandest stage in tennis, is set for an $800 million reinvention that promises to serve both fans and players a serious upgrade—without so much as a single delay in play. Announced Monday by the USTA, the transformation is the largest investment in the history of the U.S. Open and will completely modernize the stadium, build a state-of-the-art Player Performance Center, and usher in a new era for one of New York's most iconic sporting events. The renovation will unfold over three phases through 2027, carefully scheduled to avoid disrupting the 2025 or 2026 tournaments. The new look will include a Daniel Libeskind-designed Grand Entrance, expanded concourses (up 40-percent), more elevators and escalators, vastly improved food, drink, and retail spaces and 2,000 additional courtside seats. Two new luxury suite levels and sleek hospitality lounges will bring a level of comfort and glam typically reserved for the Met Gala. “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis, which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years,” said USTA CEO Lew Sherr. “It also provides us the opportunity to give the players that compete in that stadium an unparalleled space that will enable them to perform at their best.” That includes athletes getting their own $250 million playground in the form of a new Player Performance Center. Perched atop a four-story structure on the west side of the stadium, the facility will feature indoor and outdoor training turf, spa-style locker rooms, lounges and a private cafe. The center will also boast a new players-only courtyard and an exclusive entryway, giving the world's top competitors the backstage treatment they deserve. The architectural heavy-hitters behind the redesign include ROSSETTI (the original Ashe Stadium architect), Libeskind (of World Trade Center fame), and hospitality design expert Garrett Singer, known for building out buzzy clubs and restaurants across the country. And in a refreshing twist, the entire project is fully self-funded by the USTA—no taxpayer dollars required.
