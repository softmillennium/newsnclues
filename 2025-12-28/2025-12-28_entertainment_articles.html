                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brigitte Bardot, the French actress who was named the original “sex kitten,” has died, according to her foundation. “The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation,” the foundation, which fights to protect animals, announced on its website Sunday. “The Brigitte Bardot Foundation wishes to honor the memory of an exceptional woman who gave everything for a world more respectful of animals,” it added. “We extend our sincere condolences to her family, loved ones, the municipality of Saint-Tropez and its residents, and all those who share this cause. The foundation's Bruno Jacquelin told the Associated Press that Bardot had been hospitalized last month and that she passed away in her home in Southern France. No funeral or memorial service arrangements have been made. Bardot's cause of death was not disclosed. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Bardot was launched as an international sex symbol in 1956 when she starred as a sexualized teen bride in the movie “And God Created Woman.” The film, which was directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, featured scenes of Bardot dancing on tables naked, marking a groundbreaking portrayal of female sexuality during a conservative time. A decade later, she reemerged as an animal rights lobbyist and started her animal rights foundation after selling movie memorabilia and jewelry.</p>

While she patiently awaits Disney and Lucasfilm's next move with regard to Star Wars, Ridley has been releasing a couple well-received indies per year, save for Disney's highly acclaimed sports biopic, Young Woman and the Sea (2024). Zak Hilditch's contemplative zombie thriller, which premiered at 2025's South by Southwest, chronicles Ava Newman (Ridley) as she journeys from America to Tasmania in hopes of finding her husband alive. The U.S. military botched a nearby weapons test that obliterated the population of Tasmania, creating either a pile of dead bodies or zombies that gradually become more aggressive. Patrick Ball, Alden Ehrenreich to Make Broadway Debuts in 'Becky Shaw' Her and her husband's struggle to conceive a child slowly chipped away at their union, so she is simply looking for closure in whatever form it takes. “I knew a couple people that were going through IVF at the time. It can take a toll emotionally and physically on women, but also on their relationships while they're going through it. In May of 2025, Ridley wrapped her first romantic comedy opposite none other than Solo: A Star Wars Story star Alden Ehrenreich. Alden and I were supposed to do a movie together ten years ago. It ended up not happening, but we became buddies, so I was really thrilled when he came on,” Ridley says. Ridley and Ehrenreich's promotion of The Last Resort will undoubtedly lead to some awkward Star Wars questions, but Ridley's husband, Tom Bateman, has them both beat. In August, he wrapped his own romcom called The Love Hypothesis, which is based on Ali Hazelwood's novel of the same name. The twist is that the book was born out of fan fiction that centered on his wife's Star Wars character, Rey, and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Bateman's character is even named Adam after Driver. “To be clear, Tom didn't know that [The Love Hypothesis] was fan fiction, and I didn't remember that it was fan fiction. So he had a number of auditions, and then he was told when he got the part that it was fan fiction, which was news to him,” Ridley shares. So I'm really looking forward to seeing the film. Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Ridley also discusses the next collaboration between her and Bateman following 2024's Magpie, as well as her favorite film of 2025. Ava is an American who's doing volunteer dead body retrieval in Tasmania, and she's singled out at times for being a “Yank.” With the majority of We Bury the Dead's cast and crew being Australian, did you also feel like a fish out of water? I've never felt more a part of things. Actually, no, I have felt this a part of things before, but this was still a really, really wonderful experience. So I felt so much in the fabric of everything, and I didn't feel like a fish out of water. After playing mothers in The Marsh King's Daughter and Magpie, do you think that context was helpful for this woman who'd desperately been trying to get to that position? I knew a couple people that were going through IVF at the time. It can take a toll emotionally and physically on women, but also on their relationships while they're going through it. So that actually felt really [palpable] at the time. You're used to playing other people, but not like that. Did any of those disturbing circumstances creep into your psyche at all? Or does your work generally not follow you home? At the beginning of all of that, Ava is really listening to Riley, and she's really understanding in many ways where he's coming from. There's a desperation to his grief that feels more apparent than Ava's, but they're also mirroring each other in some ways. It then takes that very strange, creepy turn. But that sequence certainly felt properly frightening in the moment. In my mind, one of the defining images of you is your emotional audition video for Star Wars: The Force Awakens over a decade ago. When you have to cry on screen now, something you do several times in We Bury the Dead, is it similar to a light switch? Can you just turn it on and off? For me, crying isn't always the way we show sadness. So when it came to We Bury the Dead, I didn't know what some of these scenes would end up being. But I certainly didn't know how some of the scenes in this film were going to go, and that's really a testament to [writer-director] Zak [Hilditch] and the amazing cast and crew. I can always tell that you have a spidey sense for when the Star Wars questions are about to start, and you're always a good sport about it. That being said, when you were weighing your upcoming Philippines-set movie (The Last Resort) with Alden Ehrenreich, how much did the inevitable Star Wars questions affect your decision? Alden and I were supposed to do a movie together ten years ago. It ended up not happening, but we became buddies, so I was really thrilled when he came on. Alden's fictional son, Ben Solo, made headlines recently. You said that Adam Driver volunteering that information was the biggest surprise of the year, and you're right, he's usually very reluctant to talk about Star Wars. Was the second biggest surprise of the year when the writer of Magpie (Ridley's husband, Tom Bateman) said he was going to be acting in a movie that began as fan fiction about Rey and Kylo Ren? To be clear, Tom didn't know that [The Love Hypothesis] was fan fiction, and I didn't remember that it was fan fiction. It wasn't until we got to Montreal [for filming] that someone again said that it was fan fiction, and I was like, “Huh.” So I'm really looking forward to seeing the film. Sources say that it's very good, and I think it will be really charming and really fun. As far as a Magpie follow-up, whatever that may be, has Tom been delivering pages to you fairly often? He has two or three other scripts that are ready to go. I also read the first draft of something that he just did, which is amazing. There's a pattern in your work that began with Rey ten years ago, and it continues all the way through Ava in We Bury the Dead. You often play characters who are either lonely or alone for prolonged stretches. I guess there can be a lot of drama in that. The Last Resort, which I made with Alden, really does buck that [loneliness] trend. I mean, there is an element of loneliness to the person I play in that, but she really finds so much joy in the people around her. So it was really fun to do that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brigitte Bardot, one of cinema's most iconic sex symbols who quit the business to focus on activism, has died at age 91. “The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation,” the foundation announced on Sunday. A cause of death and date was not immediately available. Becoming a global celebrity thanks to 1956's And God Created Woman, in which she played a liberated, unapologetically libidinous teenager, Bardot broke barriers in the depiction of eroticism on screen. “To tell you the truth, I don't feel all that exceptional,” she said in a 2014 interview. That interest led to a stint in ballet, and later modeling. Her appearance on the cover of magazines such as Elle caught the eye of director Marc Allégret, who was interested in possibly casting her in his next film. The project never ended up happening, but it was how Bardot met aspiring filmmaker Roger Vadim, whom she married in 1952. Bardot appeared in a series of mostly unremarkable pictures — including her English-language debut in the 1955 hit comedy Doctor at Sea — before And God Created Woman. Playing Juliette, an 18-year-old orphan tempting every man in Saint-Tropez, Bardot oozed playful sex appeal. In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther aptly (and somewhat crudely) summed up the movie's appeal: “This round and voluptuous little French miss is put on spectacular display and is rather brazenly ogled from every allowable point of view. What's more, she moves herself in a fashion that fully accentuates her charms. The movie made Bardot a superstar — not just in France but overseas, where demand for more of her films quickly skyrocketed. Asked around the time of And God Created Woman whether she wanted to be thought of as a serious actress, she responded, “I will be a serious actress when I'm older.” Labeled a “sex kitten” in the press, Bardot continued to portray characters who flaunted their sexuality, including in the 1958 crime-thriller In Case of Adversity, which saw her play a murder suspect who seduces Jean Gabin's married attorney. But after their divorce a year later, she was determined to prove that her stardom wasn't simply because of him, even though they continued to occasionally collaborate in later years. Amos Poe, Punk Rock Filmmaker Behind 'The Blank Generation,' Dead at 76 Gil Gerard, ‘Buck Rogers in the 25th Century' Hero, Dead at 82 Earning a Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar nomination and proving to be another commercial triumph, The Truth contains arguably Bardot's finest performance — indisputable evidence that she could be a “serious actress,” but on her own terms and on her own timetable. Plus, it was impossible not to think about her character's dilemma — a free-spirited young woman trying to escape a repressive upbringing — and not connect it to the similar break Bardot had orchestrated from her family. Bardot continued to enjoy a string of hits — including the 1962 romantic drama A Very Private Affair, which took inspiration from her life story — while expanding her list of acclaimed directors with whom she collaborated. But although by that point Bardot had long established her bona fides as a legitimate actress — she shined in Contempt as a chilly, brittle wife being used as a professional bargaining tool by her husband (Michel Piccoli), a floundering screenwriter — Godard's producers reportedly forced him to include shots of her nude to help bolster the box office. Working with, among others, her future lover Serge Gainsbourg, she released Brigitte Bardot Sings and B.B., finding her greatest success with their 1968 collaborative album Bonnie and Clyde, which featured their dreamy, effortlessly cool duet on the title track. Although she was quite fond of her romantic comedy The Bear and the Doll, in which she plays a woman trying to woo Jean-Pierre Cassel's musician, as the 1970s beckoned, her stardom began to fade. After starring in 1973's The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot, she quit acting. Instead, she started speaking out about the mistreatment of animals. In a 2014 interview, she reflected on her long struggle to stop everything from the wearing of fur to the slaughter of dolphins: “It is a battle. A fight against cruelty, stupidity, and the indifference of humans,” she declared. In her 2003 memoir A Cry in the Silence, Bardot disparaged members of the LGBTQ+ community, using a homophobic epithet and referring to them as “circus freaks.” She also railed against what she perceived as “the Islamization of French society.” Accused of inciting racial hatred, Bardot was fined 5,000 Euros, which was not the first time she had been accused of such crimes. (Later, in 2007, she publicly blasted the Muslim practice of killing sheep as part of Eid al-Adha: “I am fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its acts,” she wrote at the time.) Bardot further angered fans in 2018 by expressing no sympathy for her fellow performers who called out predatory men in the wake of #MeToo. Then when they tell the story afterwards, they say they have been harassed … in actual fact, rather than benefit them, it only harms them.” Bardot claimed she had never experienced such harassment, asserting, “I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a pretty little ass. Kennedy Center President to ‘Seek $1 Million in Damages' Against Musician Over Nixed Christmas Show How Much Did Bad Bunny's Residency Actually Generate For Puerto Rico? Chevy Chase Was Put Into an 8-Day Coma While Hospitalized for Heart Failure She made good on her promise to never return to acting, but nonetheless remained forever etched in the culture's mind as a great film beauty challenging taboos in the depiction of sexuality on screen — forever the picture of youthful exuberance and endless possibility. Not that Bardot noticed as she devoted herself to animals rights and closely guarded her privacy. She granted journalists few interviews — a rare exception was in 2012 for Vanity Fair. Today, there are more regulations on cars than for animals.” As for her years as a so-called sex kitten, those were just distant memories that she was happy to have forgotten. “The other day, I came across And God Created Woman on TV,” she said, “which I haven't seen in ages. I have better things to do than study myself on a screen.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"You got anything we could look out for? Kanye West made an unannounced appearance during a comedy show by Deon Cole at the Hollywood Improv on Saturday night (Dec. 27), briefly stepping onstage and confirming that a new album is in the works. Cole shared footage from the night on Instagram after the show, posting a short clip and writing, “About last night. Harry Styles Quietly Releases Surprise 'Forever, Forever' Music Video After confirming that he enjoyed the set, West laughs as Cole pokes fun at his famously restrained reactions. “You weren't giving me no sympathy laughs, right?” Cole asks in the clip, drawing a grin from West as the crowd reacts. “You got anything we could look out for?” Cole asks. West responds without elaboration: “New album,” prompting loud cheers from the room. Cole follows up with a joking request to appear on an interlude on the forthcoming project, then asks whether West could send him a care package of clothes — which West agrees to — before exiting the stage. Back in November, Ye also popped up during Travis Scott's Circus Maximus show in Japan last for an unannounced set at the Belluna Dome in Tokorozawa on Nov. 8.In fan-shot footage circulating online, West — who had his face covered — pulled off his mask mid-show to roaring applause before launching into his 2007 anthem “Can't Tell Me Nothing.” Scott remained onstage as a hype man and support act throughout Ye's mini-set, which included hits like “Runaway,” “Heartless,” “Flashing Lights,” “Stronger,” and “All of the Lights.” The duo performed together in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as part of Scott's two-night Japan stopover. Ye will also return to Italy to headline the brand new Hellwatt Festival, which will take place at the RCF Arena over three weekends, from July 4-18, and will be officially presented in late January or early February 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asghar Farhadi remembered the filmmaker and playwright, who died due to complications from cancer, as his "great teacher." Prominent Iranian film and theater writer-director Bahram Beyzaie died in the U.S. on Friday due to complications from cancer, according to independent journalist Mansour Jahani. Fellow Iranian director Asghar Farhadi called Beyzaie his “great teacher” in a tribute message. “Bahram Beyzaie, my great teacher, whose works, words, and above all, his love for the culture of this land I have followed with all my heart, has now left this world in exile,” Farhadi wrote. “I have truly never known a more Iranian person than Bahram Beyzaie in this day and age, and how bitter it is that this most Iranian of Iranians, thousands of miles away from Iran, turns a blind eye to the world.” Bahram Beyzaie was born in Tehran on Dec. 26, 1938, and grew up in a family of poets and literary scholars. Perry Bamonte, Guitarist and Keyboardist for The Cure, Dies at 65 Considered one of the leaders of Iranian New Wave cinema, Beyzaie's award-winning films, screened at festivals around the world, in addition to Bashu, include Downpour (1972) and Killing Rabids (2001). He reconstructed indigenous forms of Iranian theater in his own film and stage projects. He wrote scholarly works that examined the origins of One Thousand and One Nights and its connection with other significant works in Persian literature. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, he was forced to resign from Tehran University, and his work was censored or banned by the government. He left Iran in 2010 and joined Stanford as a lecturer in Iranian studies, where he staged several plays and conducted workshops on Iranian mythology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Poehler hilariously recalled her Boston roots emerging during an argument on a plane. “I remember being on a plane with you,” Poehler's “Saturday Night Live” co-star Ana Gasteyer recalled during an episode of Poehler's “Good Hang” podcast earlier this week. “You got into a fight with a guy,” Gastyer continued, noting that her baby Frances — who is now 23 years old — “was on the plane with us.” “It's a long story, but what happened was a first-class guy, which we were in first class too, was like, ‘Excuse me, I'm trying to — you're being too loud in first class,'” Poehler explained. Gasteyer married husband Charlie McKittrick, in 1996, and along with Frances, the longtime couple share son Ulysses. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. They also co-starred in Tina Fey's iconic 2004 comedy “Mean Girls,” with Poehler memorably playing “cool mom” to Rachel McAdam's popular Regina George character. Gasteyer, meanwhile, played the mother of Lindsay Lohan's character, Cady Heron. In 2019, the comedic icons teamed up for “Wine Country,” which also starred Fey, Rachel Dratch, Emily Spivey, Maya Rudolph, and Paula Pell. While looking back on their time together on “Saturday Night Live,” Poehler and Gasteyer both admitted to being “obsessed” with lifestyle maven Martha Stewart — whom Gasteyer is famous for flawlessly imitating. “Martha, I'm not going to invite you on the show because I'm too scared, but please listen and know that you're something else,” Poehler quipped.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 30 years, Eddie Murphy has moved on from his beef with Saturday Night Live and David Spade over the flop of 1995's Vampire in Brooklyn. Spade recently clarified that he and Murphy are “all good” after reuniting at last year's SNL50: The 50th Anniversary Special, noting that he previously made the Oscar nominee “hate me overnight” after a joke at his movie's expense. “It was weird going from being a super fan to having him hate me overnight, and to try to win him back for the last 25 years,” he explained on his and Dana Carvey's Fly on the Wall podcast. I was on ‘Weekend Update', on SNL, new to the show, making fun of all the celebrities and I made fun of him and it didn't go well. Spade added, “Actually, he had it out. Because I did feel a little guilty about it. And he did make some sense, I just didn't like that because he was a hero.” During his ‘Spade in America' segment on the Dec. 9, 1995 episode of SNL, Spade went after several celebs of the time, including Murphy and Vampire in Brooklyn. Noting he's seen Murphy “once or twice” since the joke, having been on good terms at the NBC sketch comedy show's 25th anniversary special in February. Last year, Murphy called the joke “a cheap shot” and “racist,” adding that “it was personal.” “In the long run, it's all good. Following his own legendary 1980-'84 stint as an SNL cast member, Murphy officially buried the hatchet with his alma mater when he returned to host in 2019, earning him his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

To step away from the chaos and be ok with it.” And while it will probably be the hardest decision you've ever made, and will continue to be on a daily basis, you can build the home you always wished for.” Roth's fans flooded the comment section of her post with supportive messages about how she has broken the cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SPOILERS: This post contains details about The Copenhagen Test, Season 1 As The Copenhagen Test hits Peacock, viewers will undoubtedly develop some trust issues towards Melissa Barrera‘s spy character Michelle. With Season 1 now available on the streamer, the actress told Deadline that was one of her favorite aspects of the femme fatale role in Thomas Brandon's sci-fi thriller, which also stars Simu Liu as intelligence agent Alexander Hale, whose mind is hacked by a mysterious enemy using the intel to bring down his agency. “It was an interesting challenge, and unlike anything else that I've ever done, where I'm having to give in a little bit and trust that the prep that I'm doing and the levels of these versions of the character that I'm portraying will pan out, even though I don't know where they're going,” explained Barrera. Barrera's Michelle plays a thrilling game of manipulation with Alexander, infiltrating his life to gauge whether or not he's a threat. As Michelle, Barrera was left nearly as in the dark as the audience about the character's mysterious backstory, which is never quite revealed amid multiple layers of lies and deceit. “So, for me, I'm a very controlling, planning kind of person as an actor,” she added. “I kind of had to let go and be like, ‘You know what? I'm not going to know, because they're still writing and I don't know where they're going to take her.' Starring opposite Liu, Barrera had “the most fun” during their fight scene, which she describes as having “very Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibes.” Meanwhile, the Shang-Chi star praised her as “a spectacular action star in the making.” Two years after Barrera was unceremoniously fired from the Scream franchise, the actress is grateful for the fans who continue to support her work and “in their way, kind of lift me up,” following a recent Scream 7 boycott in her honor. Read on about Melissa Barrera's complex The Copenhagen Test character, her hopes for Season 2 and her reaction to the Scream 7 boycott. DEADLINE: One thing I love about Copenhagen Test is there's kind of a rom-com element within the spy thriller. MELISSA BARRERA: I am always drawn to romance. And so, I thought that it was so cool that there was that element in this show, particularly, and that I got to be a part of it, because I would have gotten FOMO if it wasn't my character involved. But I do love the performance within the performance within the performance of that dynamic and that you don't really know how much of that connection is real and how much of that is performance on either side. And so, I think as an audience member, those that are drawn to the relationship will always be kind of rooting for them, for that to be real. DEADLINE: Yeah, I definitely gasped a few times while watching it. DEADLINE: And what was it like playing Michelle, who obviously has such a complicated past? She has to prep in the same way that us doing movies and TV would, and really commit to a character for a lot longer than someone that is just acting on set would have to. So, I wasn't stressing out about all the information that I didn't have, because we started shooting the show, and I didn't have all the scripts, so I didn't know where they were going to take her. And it was an interesting challenge, and unlike anything else that I've ever done, where I'm having to give in a little bit and trust that the prep that I'm doing and the levels of these versions of the character that I'm portraying will pan out, even though I don't know where they're going. So, for me, I'm a very controlling, planning kind of person as an actor. I kind of had to let go and be like, “You know what? I'm not going to know, because they're still writing and I don't know where they're going to take her.” And that was exciting in a way and anxiety-inducing in another way. And sometimes, I was like, “I'm going to play this a few different ways and you guys are going to use the take that you feel will be best for whatever comes next because I don't know where you're taking me.” So, it was kind of like an interesting experiment. DEADLINE: And I really appreciated how you never really discover what happened in Michelle's past, and then at the end, Parker burns the file. So, I'm wondering if you and Thomas discussed her backstory, or is it something you kind of filled in in your head. I had an idea of what I needed it to be for me to be able to play that moment of relief, and what she's running away from, because for her to accept this mission where she knows that if she becomes visible and recognizable by the enemy, that means that she can't work anymore. So, I'm like, what could make a person take on that mission? And so I had to fill in that storyline, but I hope that I get a Season 2, so that we can learn more about her and see more of what her life is and what she ran towards or ran away from. It's an exciting character for me in a very different way than other characters have been. DEADLINE: Well, I definitely hope there's a Season 2, especially after that little teaser at the end of her being a “loose end,” but I also love the dynamic between Michelle and Parker. I felt like they're just girls bonding over gaslighting boys, and it's my favorite. BARRERA: Yes, there's a level of innocence and unexpectedness to that friendship. And I love that pairing because it feels very high school. It feels like, even though they're in such a high-stakes situation, girls are girls, women are women, and like the existential crises that we go through are kind of always the same since we're teenagers. The way that I played those scenes with Parker, I tried to keep it always in truth, obviously, but keep it ambiguous enough to where you could believe that she's being honest and that she's letting herself be vulnerable and let Parker in, like it's actually a genuine relationship. But if tomorrow, the writers decide that in Season 2, it was all fake and she actually never—it wouldn't surprise me if she was also playing Parker. DEADLINE: There are quite a few fight scenes in here, and I just have to say you're such a badass, watching you. I think I was very much looking forward to that final fight with Simu, just us in his apartment, because it was very Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibes, and I would have loved if it was like five times as long. I could have just kept going, 'cause he's such a fun scene partner to have, not only in acting scenes, but in physical scenes. So, he's got it down, and I had to do a lot of training and a lot of practicing, a lot of rehearsals to get to the point where I didn't have to think about the fighting and think about what comes next, and I could focus on the storytelling. And we had an incredible stunt team that was very patient with me. I asked for a million extra sessions on my days off, and they would always be available to me. I just wanted Michelle to really look like she's been in this life for a while, and she knows what she's doing, and there's a reason that she keeps getting paired on these important missions where she is trusted to protect this person or take him down, and I love physical stuff. And so, that was a fun day on set, because we got to move through the whole apartment. I would have loved it if we like destroyed the whole thing, but you know, I think we still had scenes to shoot in different order, so we couldn't really do that. DEADLINE: Separately, the trailer for Scream 7 came out recently and a lot of people have even started a boycott. How does it feel to have these loyal fans after the last two years? BARRERA: Obviously, having support always feels great, and I'm so grateful for the love that I've been shown, and for the support and the new people that have come into my life, and that are now supporting the other things that I'm doing and that are trying to, I think in their way, kind of lift me up.
