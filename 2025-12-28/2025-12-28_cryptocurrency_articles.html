December 28, 2025 @ 7:55 am By Omar Faridi 

The Securities and Exchange Commission recently filed charges against purported crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin Tech, Berge Blockchain Technology, and Cirkor, and investment clubs AI Wealth Inc., Lane Wealth, AI Investment Education Foundation, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation alleging that they defrauded retail investors “out of more than $14 million in an elaborate investment confidence scam.”

Laura D'Allaird, Chief of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit said:

“This matter highlights an all-too-common form of investment scam that is being used to target U.S. retail investors with devastating consequences. Our complaint alleges a multi-step fraud that attracted victims with ads on social media, built victims' trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals and promised profits from AI-generated investment tips, then convinced victims to put their money into fake crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated. Fraud is fraud, and we will vigorously pursue securities fraud that harms retail investors.”

According to the complaint, from at least January 2024 to January 2025, AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, AIIEF, and Zenith “operated so-called investment clubs using WhatsApp and solicited investors to join the clubs with ads on social media.”

The clubs gained investors' confidence with supposedly “AI-generated investment tips before luring investors to open and fund accounts on purported crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor, which falsely claimed to have government licenses, as alleged.”

The investment clubs and platforms then allegedly offered “Security Token Offerings” that were “purportedly issued by legitimate businesses.”

In reality, no trading took place on the trading platforms, which “were fake, and the Security Token Offerings and their purported issuing companies did not exist, according to the complaint.”

When investors tried to withdraw their funds, the complaint “alleges that the defendants further defrauded victims by demanding that they pay advance fees.”

In all, the defendants misappropriated at least “$14 million from U.S.-based retail investors and funneled those funds overseas through a web of bank accounts and crypto asset wallets, as alleged.”

The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, charges the defendants “with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”

The SEC seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties “against all of the defendants, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor.”

The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Assistance has issued an investor alert warning investors that fraudsters may “use popular social media platforms and messaging apps to lure investors into scams, and never to rely solely on information from group chats in making investment decisions.”

The SEC noted that it encourages investors to “use Investor.gov to check the background of anyone offering or selling them an investment.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's recent rebound is reshaping the conversation around digital assets and prompting some in the industry to rethink long-standing investment habits. As prices climb and interest returns, a representative from LCPC AI described responsible blockchain computation as "a long-term requirement" for the sector's future. The surge in bitcoin values has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers, highlighting how quickly digital markets can recover from downturns and why infrastructure stability is increasingly in focus. Bitcoin's value has risen to roughly $1.1 billion, reflecting renewed investor confidence and fresh capital flowing into the market. LCPC AI in November cited anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and rising interest in decentralized finance as key drivers of this momentum. This insight underscores why some investors are seeking more stable, infrastructure-oriented platforms. For everyday users, this shift changes how crypto participation works. Bitcoin's volatility — often amplified by thin liquidity and speculative trading — makes short-term moves unpredictable and can lead to rapid losses for investors who rely on quick trades. LCPC AI offers an alternative: automated contracts that execute and record activity directly on the blockchain. The environmental impact of crypto continues to draw attention. While some operations remain energy-intensive, especially when powered by fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, newer systems are experimenting with lower-impact designs. LCPC AI powers its computing network with renewable energy and uses automated monitoring to optimize efficiency. While this doesn't eliminate the broader environmental challenges of crypto, it demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can move toward cleaner, more accountable operation, highlighting the environmental costs of mining and the potential for more sustainable designs. Such approaches not only reduce carbon impact but also make digital investments more reliable and appealing to risk-conscious participants. LCPC AI also incorporates multiple security measures, including multisignature verification, Cloudflare protection, and McAfee certification. As the market fluctuates, the company frames consistent, verifiable processes and energy-aware computing as tools to help stabilize an industry long defined by rapid swings and speculation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine snagging one of the best altcoins to buy now at a discount while a fresh GameFi contender heats up, right as holiday liquidity floods back in. Enter the Tapzi presale, which has sold nearly 111 million tokens in its group stage, drawing eyes to blockchain gaming's next wave. Among the best altcoins to buy now, Tapzi stands out in Web3 gaming with its skill-to-earn model. This moment matters for 2025 investors because GameFi projections hit $39 billion by year-end, per industry trackers, up from stagnant play-to-earn setups. Traditional models burned player time without real rewards, leaving a gap for skill-based platforms like Tapzi. Tapzi fills that void, blending chess and checkers challenges with a vibrant NFT marketplace powered by TAPZI, the best gaming crypto currently in the market. Analysts eye a 13% push to $140 if support sticks, fueled by Bitcoin's 1.3% daily gain and post-holiday rallies. Spot ETFs launched in recent months add tailwinds, even with modest inflows amid risk-off moods. Grayscale and Bernstein forecast Bitcoin at $150,000 in 2026, pulling Solana along—SOL often mirrors BTC moves. A Solana-Cardano bridge looms, promising liquidity boosts and cross-chain hype. These factors make Solana one of the best cryptos to invest in right now, trading as a top crypto under 1 cent alternative when viewed against its growth trajectory. The Tapzi presale captures this energy, advancing through group stages with 111 million tokens sold from its 5 billion fixed supply. No gas fees let players focus on skill-to-earn matches, from strategy games to quick challenges, building a user retention loop rare in blockchain gaming. This setup contrasts with play-to-earn pitfalls, where inflation erodes rewards. Early backers already eye 3x unrealized gains versus traditional projects that drain funds without payoff. Hedera thrives on low-fee enterprise apps but risks 2026 stagnation at $0.111 amid saturation. Sui pushes DeFi scalability yet contends with price slides in choppy markets. Tapzi carves a GameFi niche, prioritizing skill over speculation, players govern via decentralized models, unlocking NFT avatars and mobile upgrades by early 2026. Solana's ecosystem, with its speed for DeFi and NFTs, indirectly elevates Tapzi-like projects. Solana's dip offers entry into one of the best altcoins to buy now, while the Tapzi presale accelerates as a top GameFi bet, with 111 million tokens gone, signaling momentum.

Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, has taken a new step into the crypto space by issuing the country's first loan secured by cryptocurrency. The pilot loan was given to Intelion Data, one of Russia's biggest Bitcoin mining companies. The bank said the goal is to understand how crypto-backed lending could work in practice under Russian conditions. The bank also hinted that similar loans could be offered in the future, not just to miners but also to companies that already hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Intelion Data's CEO, Timofey Semenov, welcomed the move and called it an important moment for the mining industry. He added that if this model works well, it could be expanded across Russia's growing mining sector. Sberbank's deputy chairman, Anatoly Popov, said that crypto regulation in Russia is still developing. He explained that the bank is ready to work closely with the Central Bank to build clear rules and proper infrastructure for digital asset services. Earlier this month, Sberbank said it was also experimenting with decentralised finance tools and supports a gradual approach to legalising cryptocurrencies in Russia. At the same time, the Russian central bank has said it may allow everyday citizens to trade crypto, but only within strict yearly limits.

However, Sberbank hinted that it will look to issue similar loans in the future. “The regulation of the digital currency market is still in its infancy in Russia,” said Anatoly Popov, Sberbank's deputy chair. “We are ready to work with the Central Bank to develop relevant regulatory solutions and create the infrastructure for launching similar services.” “This pilot deal allows us to test mechanisms for working with digital security, which could form the basis for future regulation,” Popov added. “If proven effective, this [kind of financing] could be scaled up and used [widely] in the Russian mining industry,” Semenov said. Earlier this month, Sberbank said it was testing a range of decentralised finance, or DeFi, tools. Sberbank rivals like VTB, meanwhile, have gone a step further, suggesting they want to accommodate their customers' desire to buy and sell “real crypto.” It is also developing its own gas power station, as well as turnkey mining data centre construction projects for industrial enterprises with idle power capacity. The central bank, meanwhile, said this month that it is prepared to let ordinary Russians trade crypto within an annual limit of just over $3,800.</p>

Earlier this month, Sberbank said it was testing a range of decentralised finance, or DeFi, tools. Sberbank rivals like VTB, meanwhile, have gone a step further, suggesting they want to accommodate their customers' desire to buy and sell “real crypto.” It is also developing its own gas power station, as well as turnkey mining data centre construction projects for industrial enterprises with idle power capacity. The central bank, meanwhile, said this month that it is prepared to let ordinary Russians trade crypto within an annual limit of just over $3,800.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the biggest coordinated inflows of the year was recently seen in Ethereum staking, and it was not from anonymous wallets engaging in gaming. As the market chops sideways, Bitmine, Tom Lee's Fundstrat-backed company, is aggressively pushing ETH into staking, thereby locking up supply at scale. Bitmine has staked 342,560 ETH over the last two days or about $1 billion at current prices, according to on-chain data. Batch deposit contracts were used to route the transfers, which were divided into clean repeated tranches of 28,320 ETH each. Bitmine staked 74,880 ETH or roughly $219.2 million in a short amount of time on Dec. 27. About four hours prior, SharpLink Gaming went in the opposite direction, redeeming 35,627 ETH (roughly $104.4 million). As a result, staking inflows continued to predominate, supporting the larger trend of long-term positioning as opposed to short-term liquidity hunting. This is significant because staking at this level is a structural bet on Ethereum's base layer economics rather than merely a yield play. When that occurs during a phase of consolidation or correction, the available supply tends to be compressed just as volatility is beginning to dry up. Ethereum's price is presently trapped below important moving averages, and the chart displays a contracting structure following a protracted decline. Given the billion-dollar inflows for staking, it could be beneficial. Big organizations do not unintentionally stake themselves into vulnerability. It does not really matter if the price moves sideways for another month or breaks higher the following week. What's important is that a sizable portion of ETH recently became illiquid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This acquisition is poised to not just strengthen Yuga Labs' technical capabilities but also significantly expand its potential to merge NFTs with gaming. By acquiring Improbable's Unreal Engine platform, Yuga Labs can build an enhanced ecosystem for its products, most notably something significant for the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). With a robust integrated gaming infrastructure in place, the company looks to build advanced experiences using NFTs. This is especially pertinent in the realm of NFTs where high volume, expensive item sales can result in a spending frenzy. What are the notable features of Improbable's technology? Improbable's tech is particularly known for its high-fidelity graphics as mentioned earlier. This means the user experience in Yuga products should be top-notch. Combine that with functional game mechanics, and it becomes a platform that might keep players engaged for extended sessions, which translates to extended periods of potential transactions. How does this acquisition impact the broader NFT and gaming discussions? As NFTs are making their way into the mainstream, it is becoming clear that video game capable of producing rich environments is a core component of this broader crypto narrative. The concerns about spending and transaction volume are not baseless. If Yuga Labs can marry those two components—performance and transaction volume—there may be a recipe not just for successful, continued NFT adoption but an evolution in how games and crypto work together. Is Yuga Labs the standard for blockchain gaming? Specifically, if Yuga Labs is able to provide an example of something done well, will everyone else follow suit? On one hand, the industry likely experiences some leaks in user experience and transactions through this effort. On the other hand, can this experience make blockchain gaming viable? Right now, most crypto games have a reputation for being pricey, often featuring low-quality experiences to the average user. What did Yuga Labs say about the acquisition? When Yuga Labs publicly commented on this, they provided a slight clue. They wrote, “This acquisition gives us access to foundational technology that will make way for deeper and richer DeFi use cases in our ecosystem.” This hints that they're building something larger than the moment, as is Yuga Labs' style. What might we see come from this acquisition? But it raises important questions—a higher ceiling doesn't preclude a risk of repeated failures in execution. There's something teasingly elusive about such a concentration of technical and market power. We are still very much in the infancy of how this might look, but as Yuga Labs champions these gaming technologies, is this the future of gaming? Will crypto entities look to build with these high-performance capabilities? The company is building a new frontier, and they'll need to avoid tripping over their own feet to pave the way. But how many companies have an established IP like  BAYC? Unless they find a way to turn it into fiat for cash in the process, it's a tough slog ahead. It's going to be interesting how this plays out over time, but there's probably miles yet to travel this year. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is holding steady within a descending range, showing little directional conviction, while several altcoins are quietly building strength. As the market consolidates, these smaller assets could hint at early upside moves before BTC breaks out. Key Resistance In Focus: $90,588 And The Descending Trendline Unless BTC can close above these levels, the current decline may continue. This lower zone is viewed as a strong support area where buyers may step in. Thus, a clear reversal confirmation is key before considering any significant upward move. Meanwhile, a daily close above $94,130 would confirm that the blue descending trend has been broken, potentially signaling a shift to sustained bullish momentum. LTF Moves Show Less Impulse, But Structure Holds The recent moves on the LTF appear more like noise and do not affect the broader wave count, and confidence in a leading diagonal for wave 1 remains intact. Putting Elliott Wave analysis aside for a moment and leaning on standard technical analysis, BTC is clearly respecting a defined range. Bullish confirmation will come if BTC manages to close and hold above $90,500, which would invalidate the current bearish scenario and signal the potential for a more sustained upward trend. On the altcoin side, momentum appears to be holding, suggesting potential upside. Outperformance is already visible in altcoins like XPL, indicating that while BTC consolidates, some alts are starting to push higher. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.
