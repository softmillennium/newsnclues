                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most wide ranging quantitative analysis of research on complementary and alternative treatments for autism has found no strong evidence that these approaches are effective. The review also found that safety was often overlooked, with many treatments never properly evaluated for possible risks. It examined 248 meta analyses, drawing on results from 200 clinical trials that together involved more than 10,000 participants. The researchers focused on complementary, alternative and integrative medicines (CAIMs) used to treat autism. These included animal assisted therapies, acupuncture, herbal medicine, music therapy, probiotics, and Vitamin D supplementation. Autistic people may experience challenges with communication, understanding others' thoughts or emotions, managing sensory overload, coping with unfamiliar environments, and engaging in repetitive behaviors. As a result, interest in alternative treatments is widespread. "Many parents of autistic children, as well as autistic adults, turn to complementary and alternative medicines hoping they may help without unwanted side effects," says Professor Richard Delorme, Head of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Robert Debré Hospital in Paris. "However, it is necessary to carefully consider evidence from rigorous randomized trials before concluding that these treatments should be tried." To assess the full scope of existing research, the team conducted an umbrella review, a method that combines findings from multiple meta analyses to provide an overall big picture assessment. This allowed us to evaluate the full body of evidence across different treatments. Ultimately, we hope this tool will support autistic people and practitioners in choosing together the best treatment." Although a small number of treatments showed signs of potential benefit, most were backed by weak or low quality evidence, making the reported effects unreliable. The researchers also raised concerns about safety, noting that fewer than half of the treatments had been assessed for acceptability, tolerability, or adverse events. Professor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at the University of Southampton and co senior author, emphasized the importance of looking beyond individual studies. "This study shows that when people want to know whether a treatment is effective, they shouldn't just look at one single study. The research was funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR).
