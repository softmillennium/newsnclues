                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will Carlos Alcaraz claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the third time next season? 1 is fresh off a season in which he won a career-high eighth titles and earned 71 match wins according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Clive Brunskill of Getty Images photographed a day of the 22-year-old's training in Murcia on 24 December to provide fans a look into Alcaraz's efforts on and off the court. Nearly two weeks ago the news broke that Alcaraz had split with longtime coach Juan Carlos Ferrero. The 22-year-old has been training under the watchful eye of Samuel Lopez, who formally joined his team ahead of last season. Alcaraz is an Australian Open triumph from completing the Career Grand Slam. He is also an eight-time ATP Masters 1000 titlist. Alcaraz is next scheduled to compete in Melbourne at the Australian Open. Earlier this year, he made the quarter-finals at the event before falling to 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DAVID KANE: Point of order, if we're going to see a Career Grand Slam happen next season, it will most likely come from a combination of Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner (although shoutout Stan Wawrinka, who is ostensibly a Wimbledon win away from the same achievement). Swiatek and Alcaraz are both missing the Australian Open, while Sinner fell just short of the boxed set last spring at Roland Garros. Melbourne has historically been a tough tournament for Alcaraz, who will be playing his first major without Juan Carlos Ferrero, and Sinner is still much more confident on quicker surfaces than clay. Therefore it stands to reason that Swiatek may be most likely to complete the career set Down Under, though she will face formidable opposition from the likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Amanda Anisimova, and Elena Rybakina.VICTORIA DUVAL: No. On the men's side, Jannik Sinner was so solid at last year's Australian Open and Carlos Alcaraz was equally so at Roland Garros and US Open. I foresee them splitting slams once again next year. On the women's side, there are several solid candidates who can make slam title pushes that might keep Iga Swiatek from winning the Australian Open.

COCO VANDEWEGHE: Yes, I don't see why Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner can't both do it this year! If they get close again, does scar tissue become a concern?PAUL ANNACONE: Yes. I believe Iga Swiatek will get there next year and win the Australian Open. BRETT HABER: Even though Jannik Sinner was one point away at Roland Garros, I think Carlos Alcaraz has the best chance in Melbourne.
