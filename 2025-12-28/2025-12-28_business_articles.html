                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to forge a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face differences over major issues including territory as Russian air raids pile pressure on Kyiv. Zelenskyy called it Russia's response to the U.S.-brokered peace efforts. The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X. Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv's control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday's talks might produce. Putin said on Saturday that Moscow would continue waging its war if Kyiv did not seek a quick peace. Russia has steadily advanced on the battlefield in recent weeks and months, claiming control over several more settlements on Sunday. The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a U.S. proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelenskyy said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan. Kyiv residents interviewed by Reuters on Sunday expressed a mix of hope and skepticism over the talks. "I want for this to be over - but this is what our side wishes for," said Stanyslav, a 44-year-old soldier who declined to provide his last name. "We don't have any leverage in this situation." Zelenskyy's in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States. Writing on X ahead of talks, Zelenskyy said that "a lot can be decided before the New Year" but that peace depended on strong support from Kyiv's partners. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms. It has also proposed shared control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where power line repairs have begun after another local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency said on Sunday. Zelenskyy, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of its territory per day in 2025. Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO. Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack NATO members. The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan, which emerged from talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November. Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and U.S. negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelenskyy along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained "a just and lasting peace" that preserved Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country's security and defence capabilities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heading into 2026, investor focus could shift from fixed-income instruments to attractive dividend stocks, given a lower interest rate backdrop. Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choices, as these experts assign their ratings after conducting a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Oil and gas giant Chevron (CVX) is this week's first dividend pick. Following meetings with Chevron's management, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on CVX stock with a price target of $178. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on the energy company, with an "outperform" rating and a price target of $164. Todd noted that while the ongoing scenario of an unfavorable crude backdrop and positive refining business has affected Chevron's performance, his meetings with the management reflected the company's solid position. The analyst contends that Chevron's capital efficiency is underappreciated. He added that given the declining capex and operating expenses, the benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) that have yet to materialize, and a resource base that is better than feared, Chevron's free cash flow (FCF) annual growth outlook of 10% per year seems conservative. Additionally, Todd argued that "while investors may continue to worry about TCO [Tengizchevroil joint venture] contract extensions, lingering post-2030 resource depth questions are misguided." In this matter, the analyst noted that aside from the projects included in Chevron's official plan, management is upbeat about additional opportunities presented by improved global access (especially in the Middle East), a rise in exploration activities, and expansion and technology-driven prospects. 868 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Restaurant company Darden Restaurants (DRI) owns a portfolio of brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on Feb. 2, 2026. Following the company's mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on Darden stock with a price target of $225. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $218 with an "outperform" rating. Saleh noted that Darden posted a mixed, but "mostly positive," quarter, with better-than-anticipated comparable sales fueled by improved traffic at the company's major brands. "Its strategy of under-pricing inflation, leaning on delivery, and offering a desirable menu resonated with guests, driving another quarter of sizable industry outperformance," said Saleh. The five-star analyst highlighted that high beef prices continued to be a headwind and weighed on the quarter's restaurant margins and earnings per share (EPS). That said, Saleh is optimistic about Darden achieving its guidance, as beef costs appear to have peaked, labor cost pressures are easing, and management is relying slightly on price increases to offset commodity costs. Overall, Saleh continues to be impressed by the momentum in Darden's sales, and although earnings haven't kept pace yet, they are expected to improve going forward. 641 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. This week's third dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. The company announced a dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on Dec. 30, 2025. In his latest research note on business development companies (BDCs), RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee called Ares Capital one of his favorite BDC names for 2026 and reaffirmed a buy rating with a price target of $23. TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned an "outperform" rating to ARCC stock with a price target of $24. While Lee is less constructive on the BDC space heading into 2026 due to a potential decline in net interest income (NII) and return on equity (ROE) from lower base rates, he remains bullish on Ares Capital. In particular, he cited management's confidence in sustaining dividends at current levels despite expectations of lower base rates. Among the key strengths, Lee noted ARCC's dominant position in the BDC market, its extensive scale, and strong originations in the Ares direct lending platform. He also highlighted Ares Capital's more than 20 years of experience. "In our view, ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share generation plus potential net realized gains," said Lee to support his bullish stance. 341 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

As part of my first-person coverage for Business Insider in 2025, I asked people with aspirational jobs their formulas for success — including how tech workers in various stages of their careers landed cutting-edge AI jobs. But one remarkably simple piece of advice kept coming up: gain real-world experience with AI technology to help get your foot in the door. Here's how they applied this principle in their own careers. When Patrick Leung, who joined Google in 2007, first saw a demo for a calling assistant that used AI, which would later be called Google Duplex, he was blown away by how realistic the voice sounded. Although he'd been exposed to machine learning and AI concepts during previous company projects, he'd never worked on building models and had to retool himself on the job. Leveraging the expertise around him, including by having lengthy conversations with colleagues who explained how the system worked, helped him become proficient in AI. He's continued to work with AI in the later stages of his career. For instance, a friend with no coding experience used AI to personalize outreach messages for recruitment purposes at her job and improved her response rate. If there aren't opportunities to do something like this in your current job, use AI in your spare time and put it on your résumé, Leung said, adding that people who can demonstrate they can wield LLMs effectively are going to find jobs. Sophia Sun essentially put Leung's advice into action when she pitched a project that would use AI to help customers at Kajabi, the creator commerce platform she worked for as a senior product manager. The tool Sun envisioned would help content creators generate marketing content, such as blog posts and short-form videos, for TikTok and Instagram. She started working on the project in April 2023, alongside engineering and marketing teammates. Seeing it through to its March 2024 launch was a learning curve for Sun, who had never built an AI product before. That July, Sun started a new job at Microsoft as a senior AI product manager, and told Business Insider she thought her end-to-end experience with building an AI product helped her land the role. Sun's playbook for breaking into AI was to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. When OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Mostofa Adib Shakib knew the world was going to change. Shakib spent time learning about AI from books, videos, and research papers, and he built software projects to gain proficiency with agentic AI, such as a tool to help Bangladeshi professionals optimize their résumés. In February 2025, he started an AI contractor role with Mercor, which, around the time of his interview with Business Insider, earned him a handsome sum of $6,400 a week. While being a full-time employee at a company offers stability and benefits, it would restrict his time, meaning he could only focus on gaining agentic AI skills on weekends, he said. Shakib advised people interested in staying relevant in the tech industry to embrace change, rather than fear it, and to focus on upskilling. Although Devi Parikh completed a Ph.D. in computer vision in 2009, before going on to become a senior director of GenAI at Meta years later, she said not to assume you need a Ph.D. to break into AI. As the cofounder and co-CEO of the AI company Yutori, she doesn't consider Ph.D.s much when hiring, but looks for people with relevant practical experience, such as training models, she said. Other potential avenues into interesting AI work include spending time at startups or big labs, or trying side projects that make use of open source code and online communities. Starting and executing projects has been instrumental to her career success, Parikh said. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she started working on a YouTube series called "Humans of AI," where she interviewed AI researchers about their daily habits.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. As social-media algorithms get better at tailoring content to individual user interests, the opportunity for stars like MrBeast, Charli D'Amelio, or Khaby Lame to show up across feeds becomes much harder, Duchscher said. Social-entertainment platforms like YouTube and TikTok benefit from diversifying their talent pools with more creators rather than becoming too reliant on megastars to drive consumption, he said.

Duchscher's talent management firm, Night, works with other large creators like Kai Cenat and Hasan Piker, but the company is thinking about finding new talent who dominate a particular content niche, even if that means they have a smaller set of loyal fans. Night operates a separate venture arm that invests in creator businesses. The strategy of finding niche creators who can sell products is increasingly popular among creator economy businesses. For example, the investment firm Slow Ventures is writing $1 million to $3 million checks for creators who are popular in a particular content category and have plans to expand beyond media. "There's going to be a subset of creators that are very entrepreneurial, have deep trust and expertise in a specific vertical, and are builders," Slow's Megan Lightcap told Business Insider earlier this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine was in no hurry for peace and if it did not want to resolve their conflict peacefully, Moscow would accomplish all its goals by force. Putin's remarks on Saturday, carried by state news agency TASS, followed a vast Russian drone and missile attack that prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to say Russia was demonstrating its wish to continue the war while Kyiv wanted peace. Zelenskiy is to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to seek a resolution to the war Putin launched nearly four years ago with a full-scale invasion of Russia's smaller neighbour. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin's remarks. Russian commanders told Putin during an inspection visit that Moscow's forces had captured the towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Artemivka in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Kremlin said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine's military rejected Russia's assertions about Huliaipole and Myrnohrad as false statements. The situation in both places remains "difficult" but "defensive operations" by Ukrainian troops are ongoing, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in a statement on social media. The Southern Command of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Telegram that "fierce fighting" continued in Huliaipole. "However, a substantial part of Huliaipole continues to be held by the Defence Forces of Ukraine." Verifying battlefield claims is difficult as access on both sides is restricted, information is tightly controlled and front lines shift quickly, with media relying on satellite and geolocated footage that can be partial or delayed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Online retailer Coupang's founder Kim Bom apologized for the first time for a recent leak of customer data and pledged to unveil a compensation plan as soon as possible, in a statement posted on the South Korean company's website. Coupang's U.S.-based chairman said in Korean that he "sincerely apologizes" for the data breach, which was first revealed in November, and also pledged investments and reforms to prevent data breaches. Kim has faced intense criticism in South Korea for failing to attend parliamentary hearings held in Seoul earlier this month on one of the country's worst data breaches. On Sunday, Rep. Choi Min-hee of the ruling Democratic Party posted on Facebook a photo of a document that Kim sent to the National Assembly saying he would again be unable to attend a hearing, scheduled for this week, citing other appointments. "What in his schedule could be more important to him than this hacking incident?" "Kim is insulting the public." Kim said the company, in cooperation with the government, has restored all leaked personal information and confirmed that data from 3,000 of Coupang's 33 million customers had been saved by a suspect on his personal computer but was neither transferred nor sold to any third party. Coupang will announce a compensation plan for South Korean customers as soon as possible, he said, without elaborating. South Korean lawmakers are seeking to take legal action against the company's billionaire founder, arguing the New York-listed online retailer earns most of its revenue from sales in South Korea. Kim said Coupang had worked closely with the South Korean government's investigation into the breach, while maintaining confidentiality. We want to hear from you.

At an udon shop, drivers and construction workers — some of whom looked to be in their 60s — were slurping noodles. The server said she knew people who have owned nearby restaurants and shops for decades. After settling back at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, I noticed that the older workers I had encountered in the city worked as crossing guards, cleaners, gift shop owners, taxi drivers, or wholesale workers. In interviews, dozens of American researchers said government benefits fall short for millions of older Americans each year, adding that the US could look to countries like Japan for inspiration. Business Insider's "80-over-80" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. Japan, like many of its neighbors, has experienced rapid aging over the last few decades.

Comparatively, this demographic comprises about 18% of the US population, and roughly one in five works. The US has not aged as rapidly as East Asia, although increased longevity and lower birth rates have propelled aging enough that by 2030, the Census Bureau projects there will be more Americans 65 and older than under 18. Seven researchers studying aging workforces in Japan and South Korea told Business Insider that keeping older workers employed at higher levels has helped both countries mitigate economic disaster and severe labor shortages. The US also lacks a comprehensive healthcare system like Japan's, with worse general health metrics. For the US, Japan may offer a different glimpse into what an older workforce can look like. Japan is often the first country many think about when discussing aging. America's oldest workers also frequently worked in these professions, particularly construction and education, according to Business Insider's analysis of Census Bureau data. Legislation has encouraged companies to offer work opportunities until the age of 70, while former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida committed one trillion yen over five years for reskilling efforts. Japan also has Silver Human Resource Centers, which provide part-time work and skills training for older people, as well as the government's Lifetime Employment Support Office. The World Economic Forum notes that 80% of Japanese workers hope to continue working in some capacity after retirement. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides employers with subsidies if they can convert older contract workers to permanent jobs. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in a paper from April that Japan has alleviated many potentially disastrous economic outcomes of hyper-aging. Kirkegaard told Business Insider that despite Japan's unique socioeconomic and aging circumstances, the country may be a model for its neighbors, as it raised female employment levels, expanded immigration pathways, and became more integrated with foreign economies. "In many ways, the Japanese labor market was always much more receptive to the idea of employing workers at high ages because they tend to be healthy and motivated and do the type of service-sector jobs that you could do at a high age," Kirkegaard said. "Even if Japan has done better than any other country, it doesn't mean that older workers in Japan have the same labor force participation or earnings potential as does prime-age workers," Kirkegaard said. Much like in the US, many Japanese companies assume older workers require more training and costs. Japan's hierarchical workplace structure also means it's often harder for an older worker to climb the ranks. Population aging contributes to critical labor shortages, according to Haruki Seitani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund and coauthor of a working paper on aging and AI in Japan. His research found that as Japan's labor force ages, productivity growth at work falls. Many older Japanese workers earn money out of necessity, said Yasuo Takao, a political scientist at Curtin University in Australia. Japan has struggled to expand employment among its older population, he said. "Japan's wage structure is harsh for older workers because it is built on an aging seniority system that inflates wages in mid-career and then resets them sharply at retirement age to control labour costs," Takao said. Takao said that older Japanese work at rising rates because labor shortages sometimes force firms to retain workers. Projections put the labor shortage at upwards of 6.4 million by 2030, and many companies have opted to automate tasks or give employees more work instead of hiring older workers. Pension reforms have also made work more imperative for some older workers. Japan has a two-tier mandatory public pension system that relies on contributions, which is "highly sensitive to population aging," Takao said. "If Japan can transition from quantity-driven senior employment to quality-driven, skill-aligned senior employment, it stands to gain a powerful long-term demographic dividend: higher productivity, lower fiscal strain, stronger innovation capacity and a healthier, more engaged older population," Takao said. "In this sense, treating older workers as a source of economic strength, not a cost to be managed, may be one of Japan's most important growth strategies in the decades ahead." Takao said the US can avoid the "Japan trap" of older workers needing to work by acting earlier to expand phased-retirement opportunities and protect older workers' earnings. The US can learn from this discrepancy by providing more assistance to women who want to hold steady employment during their parenting and caregiving years. When it comes to AI, Japan may be a cautionary tale. Seitani said that AI could help aging-related labor shortages in occupations like transportation services, construction, and clerical work. Additionally, the research suggests limited mobility between jobs with high and low AI exposure among Japanese occupations. Kirkegaard said many countries may have to adjust their lower retirement ages and more robust safety nets as they age, so older residents aren't as reliant on the social safety net, which might crumble if the demand exceeds the available resources. "Ultimately, Japan's experience shows that aging societies require more than labor-supply fixes. They demand a broader redesign of pensions, work norms, care systems and urban infrastructure," Takao said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Market pros say this age group — dubbed the "Grey Pound" or "Silver Spenders" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new "idle rich." "Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. "Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle," he added. Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning. Alyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort. Day-to-day life for "a lot of" them is still "quite tough and normal," but there are others who are "just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets," he said. This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods "that they've never had before," as well as for "higher-end" wealth management and insurance services. These customers are increasingly seeking out "content, story, getting involved, a purpose" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added. He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products. "The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry," said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the "Silver Pound." He said people living their "Saga years," a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030. Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a "materially undervalued" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added. Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children. "Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness," Coatsworth said of the cohort. Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment. "Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend," Coatsworth told CNBC via email.
