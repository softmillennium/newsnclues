                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nalden, who co-founded the file transfer service WeTransfer in 2009 along with Rinke Visser and Bas Beerens, is not pleased with the company's direction after the service was acquired by Bending Spoon last year — and he doesn't mince his words about it. “Bending Spoons doesn't really care about people, and even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch. Post-acquisition, WeTransfer made a confusing move related to transfer link experiences and laid off 75% of its staff. Around this time, Nalden had creatives reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized that he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer with the original ethos of the service around simplicity. The service is called Boomerang, and you can use it to transfer files without logging in. “Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I've always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that is just, it's all about user experience, it's ease of use, it's the simplicity of sharing something quickly, and that just saves time. You don't need to sign up, you don't need to verify via email,” Nalden told TechCrunch about the ethos of the service. For casual users, the non-login experience would be sufficient, but it has its limits. Nalden is clear that with this new service, he doesn't want to offer advertising to users and keep a simple structure for payment. “I just want to offer a tool that works for users. Nalden noted that a lot of design is to please investors, and he feels that stripping down the experience is a refreshing change. While companies are looking to add more and more AI features, Nalden said that he is largely using AI to build the product, but he doesn't want to use it around user-facing features. Boomerang is available on the web, but the company said it is planning to release a dedicated Mac app soon.

Claimed to be the world's smallest of their kind, these nanoscale robots are expected to find applications in medicine, microscale manufacturing, and other areas. Remarkably, the researchers contend that these robots will cost only one penny each to manufacture. Penn Engineering was responsible for the physical structure and features of these microscopic robots, while Michigan scientists gave the robots their ‘brains.' This is similar to the scales of many microorganisms, and as such, they face different physical challenges than the robots with which we are most familiar. With the challenges of drag and viscosity that such tiny robots will face, it was decided to make them ‘swimmers.' However, to keep them small, the scientists designed an entirely new propulsion system so that moving parts (such as limbs) wouldn't be needed for locomotion. Interestingly, these robots generate an electric field that “nudges ions in the surrounding solution,” allowing them to “swim.” Adjusting this ion field can help robots move in complex and/or coordinated patterns. Having no moving parts also makes them highly durable; for example, they can be picked up with a micropipette without being damaged. Another challenge of their tiny size was the power supply. To be fully programmable, autonomous robots, these tiny machines need on-board processing, and this is where the expertise of the University of Michigan was applied.

According to the source blog, the robot's physical components get their smarts courtesy of a highly efficient processor, memory, and sensors. Meanwhile, to retrieve data from the robots and their sensors, they have been programmed to perform a honeybee-like waggle dance using their propulsion systems. The first test sample carried a temperature sensor, which is good for all kinds of analytical tasks. However, it would not be challenging to switch the sensor. Despite all this advanced technology at play, the researchers say that these fully programmable, autonomous robots “can be fabricated cheaply at scale,” costing only a penny each to produce.

We've seen a lot of brands launch high refresh rate monitors this year, pushing ever closer to that 1,000 Hz barrier, a feat that HKC has now also achieved. Previously, we saw the company tease a 1,000 Hz monitor a few months ago, and now it has been unveiled as the AntGamer ANT275PQ MAX. Pushing over 1,000 FPS at 1080p would be challenging for most GPUs, and most game engines don't yet support those levels. So, if 1,080 Hz seems too much in a situation, you can always switch to the monitor's native 1440p resolution that will still offer you 540 Hz, plenty for cutting-edge esports gaming. We don't know anything apart from those specs, but we can speculate that it's a 27-inch monitor given the "275" naming convention. As a TN panel, we can only expect so much in terms of color accuracy and contrast levels, and we doubt there will be any local dimming on a model focused solely on gamers. Black frame insertion can help; however, it's not really useful at such high refresh rates. At the time this monitor was first teased, its price in China was close to $1,000, putting it above several high-end OLED and Mini-LED options. Instead of a white backlight, it will have separate red, green, and blue mini-LEDs making up the 4,788 dimming zones, offering unparalleled color performance. Before this, TCL CSOT has demo'd a 4K 1,000 Hz panel as well, followed up by an 8K 1,000 Hz option, albeit those were not production models.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Ubisoft has been forced to take all Rainbow Six Siege servers offline after the game was hacked by unknown entities. The company confirmed on X at around 9:10 AM EST on Saturday, December 27, that there was an incident with the title, with its Service Status page reporting an Unplanned Outage across all platforms as of the time of writing.

The company has yet to explain what is happening, especially as it's likely still trying to figure out what's going on and how it can regain control of the game, but this silence has led to frustration among players. While we don't know the extent of the damage yet, it's advisable for anyone with a Ubisoft account, especially one tied to Rainbow Six Siege, to change and update their passwords as a precaution. In the meantime, there's nothing we can do except wait. While there have been larger, more damaging hacks in the past, this is one of the first instances in recent history where an apparent breach has taken down an entire game. Steam was also a victim of a cyberattack in the same year, with hackers potentially stealing information from over 35 million users.

Nemix, an American company, has just listed a whopping 2 TB of DDR5 ECC RAM on Amazon for $38,999, while you can also find the same sticks in a 4 TB configuration for $76,999.99 on Nemix's website. Spec-wise, you're looking at four kits of 2 x 256 GB sticks for two terabytes — 512 GB per box, eight sticks total — and eight kits of 2 x 256 GB sticks for four terabytes, running at 6400 MT/s with a CAS latency of 52 across both configs. You can get a Ford Mustang in lieu of that 2 TB setup, or a Tesla Model S instead of the 4 TB option. Even before the current component crisis, server memory has always been more expensive than standard desktop memory because it's registered and error-correcting (ECC), which makes it RDIMM rather than UDIMM. See, in normal DDR5 RAM that we use in our gaming computers, bit flips occur rarely, but they're mostly harmless beyond a crash. Servers can't afford that; they need the utmost stability, so they choose ECC memory that can actively correct single-bit errors on the fly. Therefore, server memory is fundamentally still DDR5, still using the same modules, but it's different enough to warrant the added cost. You've been able to purchase high-capacity DDR4 server RAM for some time. We found Nemix's own 2 TB kit for $13,468.89 on Amazon, which was only hiked by around $6,000 in the past few months. Over the past month, even this kit has experienced a similar ~$6,000 increase. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. We should point out that you can build a Mac Studio cluster with 2 TB of RAM for around $50,000, so this might actually not be a great deal depending on who you are. However, if you're running a server and need this kind of pool, you're already past being shocked at these prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you've worked in the sleep industry long enough, you're going to hear one question resurface time and time again: “How much melatonin should I take?” The answer will vary from person to person, and the best person to deliver it is your doctor. To be clear, I'm not a doctor (although my family really wishes I were), but I am a certified sleep science coach and professional mattress tester of five years and some change. I also asked David Kuhlmann of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to give insight into best practices when it comes to melatonin (and sleep supplements, for that matter). It's the hormone your brain produces naturally as part of its circadian rhythm, or the internal clock your body has to keep you on a natural, daily sleep schedule. Your pineal gland is in charge of making it, and sunlight signals it to slow down production so you can wake up and go about your day. Though your brain is already producing melatonin, the idea of taking a supplement is that it jump-starts your sleep cycle. And do it before starting any supplement, melatonin included. Or you could experience side effects from mixing melatonin and medications. Let's avoid the late-night WebMD doomscrolls and check off that box first. Another reason to talk to a licensed health care provider ahead of jumping on the melatonin train is that they can give you a tailored recommendation on how to go about getting melatonin, either in supplement or even nutritional form. Or, as Kuhlmann recommends to me, bypassing it altogether, for many reasons—one of which is possible unforeseen side effects, like GI upset. The University of Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review has reported that the FDA evaluates supplements on a dietary basis, pretty much like what is done for food or medication. According to Pieter Cohen in an interview for the American Medical Association, the FDA actually evaluates supplements as a “subcategory of food” and not medication. Kuhlmann corroborated this for me, emphasizing that “increased access” and the fact that brands are not as “tightly regulated” in the market have led to dangerous outcomes. There's a whole lot of gray area for what's OK and what's not before a product hits the market, and even after it's sold to customers. It's the equivalent of shrugging, saying “Whoopsie, your fault,” and putting responsibility on a brand to make it right—which, as The Regulatory Review also points out, they don't always do. He describes it as a toss-up on how much melatonin you are actually ingesting versus what the product is actually advertising, not to mention any other additives being used and how that will react with your body chemistry. Kuhlmann also expressed to me that he personally “wishes that melatonin would be available as a prescription, not to limit access, but it could help with the quality of melatonin people are able to get.” This is yet another reason why it's much better to get a doctor involved than to throw caution to the wind and get a product that might not be effective or could even be counterfeit. Brands may try to sell you their “secret sauce” with all sorts of claims, and that's not just for melatonin, but for all supplements. Two things I always watch for with supplements, even with guidance from my doctor: Does it have a CGMP certification, and is there any data to back up the marketing claims? But even with this kind of baseline, it's hard to tell what additives are used in a supplement and how that can counteract its effects or react with your body chemistry. If your doctor gives you the go-ahead to use melatonin, follow their advice. Melatonin also can't do all the heavy lifting, and timing is crucial. As part of maintaining good bedtime habits, he also emphasizes the importance of taking it on time, at the same time, nightly. This will help establish the wind-down routine your brain follows via its circadian rhythm; as we established earlier, melatonin is supposed to lead this process. If you're keen on keeping melatonin in your bedtime routine, WIRED reviewer Molly Higgins tested and recommends Onnit's Instant Melatonin Spray, which comes in two flavors: mint and lavender. The standard serving size—six oral sprays—equals 3 milligrams of melatonin, which she found immediately made her sleepy. For those of you who are just researching options, consider these alternatives. Case in point: You took a CrossFit class for the first time and are ready to conk out right after you manage to get dinner and a shower. Something else to consider: Perhaps relying on melatonin or a sleep supplement is treating a symptom you're dealing with, as opposed to the actual issue impacting your sleep. It's hard to overstate the importance of sleep hygiene and bedtime routine habits—a sleep supplement won't be the end-all and be-all. Also, no caffeine after a certain time of day—you know your body best, but I'd say early afternoon at the very latest. Also, I'm sorry to my fellow readers and late-night scrollers, but devices need to be put away an hour or more before bedtime. All it knows is there's still “daylight” that you need to be awake for, and that prolongs the falling-asleep process. Other alternatives to supplements in the pursuit of better sleep can include sound machines (my favorite is above), where various frequencies of noise lull you to sleep. And maybe melatonin is a different sort of band-aid over the reality of your sleep situation, meaning that your mattress may need to be replaced. Supplements may not be the answer, after all, but more of a sleep space upgrade—all things to consider!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sarah Sajedi was visiting Phi Phi Island, Thailand, when she was dazzled by the beautiful scenery of the Andaman Sea. However, when she looked down at her feet, she saw that the white sandy beach was covered with plastic debris, most of which was from plastic bottles. Thus, as a doctoral student at Concordia University in Canada, Sajedi reviewed over 140 scientific papers to determine the effects of plastic bottles on the human body. She found that people ingest an average of 39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles per year from food and drinking water, and those who use bottled water on a daily basis ingest nearly 90,000 more microplastic particles into their bodies. “Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency, but it is not something that should be used in daily life,” Sajedi explains. Microplastics are plastic particles ranging in size from 1 micrometer (1/1,000 of a millimeter) to 5 mm. These particles are invisible to the naked eye, but are constantly being generated during the manufacturing, storage, transportation, and decomposition of bottles. Unlike other plastic particles that enter the body through the food chain, those derived from plastic bottles are of concern because they are ingested directly with drinking water. It has also been linked to various types of cancer. Governments around the world are working on legislation to limit plastic waste. However, regulations are currently limited mainly to items such as plastic bags, straws, and packaging materials. In contrast, there is little regulation of plastic bottles, which are feared to have a direct impact on health. While some regions in the US and Canada have begun to take positive steps, a global regulatory framework is still in its infancy. Plastic pollution is not only an environmental issue, but also a public health challenge. Access to safe drinking water for everyone is one of the basic human rights, but in the long run, a sustainable water supply that does not depend on plastic bottles is needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As first reported by Bloomberg, China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission issued a document Saturday that outlines proposed rules for anthropomorphic AI systems. The rules are written in general terms, not legalese. They're clearly meant to encompass chatbots, though that's not a term the document uses, and the document also seems more expansive in its scope than just rules for chatbots. It covers behaviors and overall values for AI products that engage with people emotionally using simulations of human personalities delivered via “text, image, audio, or video.”The products in question should be aligned with “core socialist values,” the document says. Gizmodo translated the document to English with Google Gemini. Gemini and Bloomberg both translated the phrase “社会主义核心价值观” as “core socialist values.” Under these rules, such systems would have to clearly identify themselves as AI, and users must be able to delete their history. People's data would not be used to train models without consent. These products also have to be designed to pick up on intense emotional states and hand the conversation over to a human if the user threatens self-harm or suicide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X in his announcement of the “head of preparedness” job at OpenAI on Saturday. In exchange for $555,000 per year, according to OpenAI's job ad, the head of preparedness is supposed to “expand, strengthen, and guide,” the existing preparedness program within OpenAI's safety systems department. This side of OpenAI builds the safeguards that, in theory, make OpenAI's models “behave as intended in real-world settings.”But hey, wait a minute, are they saying OpenAI's models behave as intended in real-world settings now? In November, a filing from OpenAI's lawyers cited rule violations as a potential cause of Raine's death.Whether you buy the abuse argument or not, it's clearly a big part of the way OpenAI makes sense of what its products are doing in society. Altman acknowledges in his X post about the head of preparedness job that the company's models can impact people's mental health, and can find security vulnerabilities. We are, he says, “entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.” The head of preparedness at OpenAI, then, is someone who will thread this needle, and “[o]wn OpenAI's preparedness strategy end-to-end,” figuring out how to evaluate the models for unwanted abilities, and design ways to mitigate them. The ad says this person will have to ”evolve the preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.” This can only mean figuring out new potential ways OpenAI products might be able to harm people or society, and come up with the rubric for allowing the products to exist, while demonstrating, presumably, that the risks have been dulled enough that OpenAI isn't legally liable for the seemingly inevitable future “downsides.” It would be bad enough having to do all this for a company that's treading water, but OpenAI has to take drastic steps to bring in revenue and release cutting edge products in a hurry. In an interview last month, Altman strongly implied that he would take the company's revenue from where it is now—apparently somewhere north of $13 billion per year—to $100 billion in less than two years. Altman said his company's “consumer device business will be a significant and important thing,” and that “AI that can automate science will create huge value.” So if you would like to oversee “mitigation design” across new versions of OpenAI's existing products, along with new physical gadgets, and platforms that don't exist yet, but are supposed to do things like “automate science,” all while the CEO is breathing down your neck about needing to make approximately the same amount of annual revenue as Walt Disney the year after next, enjoy being the head of preparedness at OpenAI. Try not to fuck up the entire world at your new job. A chatbot never forgets (unless you opt out of memories). The company just announced a major corporate development hire.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. We're so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat. The world is full of such shapes—ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis, and physics. Today, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said Fabrizio Bianchi, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “Until the 1800s, ‘space' meant ‘physical space,'” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain—the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions. In Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined. But by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces—ones that aren't flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. A triangle's angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward. The mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking. But some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology—his father was a pastor—before being drawn to mathematics. Bernhard Riemann is widely considered one of the greatest mathematicians in history. His work revolutionized geometry, topology, number theory, and more. On June 10, despite a fear of public speaking, he described a new theory in which he generalized Gauss' ideas about the geometry of surfaces to an arbitrary number of dimensions (and even to infinite dimensions). Gauss was immediately impressed with the lecture, which involved not just math but also philosophy and physics. But most mathematicians found Riemann's ideas too vague and abstract to be of much use. “Many scientists and philosophers were saying, ‘This is nonsense,'” Ferreirós said. And so, for decades, the work was largely ignored. Riemann's lecture didn't appear in print until 1868, two years after his death. Riemann had introduced a concept that could encompass all possible geometries, in any number of dimensions. A concept that would change how mathematicians view space. The term “manifold” comes from Riemann's Mannigfaltigkeit, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.” An ant living on the circle will never know that it's actually round. But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, and it will never look like a straight line. Similarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it'll look like a flat 2D plane. Manifolds address a problem that mathematicians would otherwise have to deal with: A shape's properties can change depending on the nature and dimension of the space it lives in (and how it sits in that space). Mathematicians avoid such ambiguities by focusing on the manifold's intrinsic properties. The defining property of manifolds—that at any point, they look Euclidean—is immensely helpful on that front. Because it's possible to think about any small patch of the manifold in terms of Euclidean space, mathematicians can use traditional calculus techniques to, say, compute its area or volume, or describe movement on it. To do this, mathematicians divide a given manifold into several overlapping patches and represent each with a “chart”—a set of some number of coordinates (equal to the manifold's dimension) that tell you where you are on the manifold. Crucially, you also need to write down rules that describe how the coordinates of overlapping charts relate to one another. The collection of all these charts is called an atlas. You can then use this atlas—whose charts translate smaller regions of your potentially complicated manifold into familiar Euclidean space—to measure and explore the manifold one patch at a time. If you want to understand how a function behaves on a manifold, or get a sense of its global structure, you can break the problem up into pieces, solve each piece on a different chart, in Euclidean space, and then stitch together the results from all the charts in the atlas to get the full answer you're seeking. Today, this approach is ubiquitous throughout math and physics. Manifolds are crucial to our understanding of the universe, for one. And the three-dimensional space we see around us is also a manifold — one that, as manifolds do, appears Euclidean to those of us living within it, even though we're still trying to figure out its global shape. “So much of physics comes down to understanding geometry,” said Jonathan Sorce, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. Small changes in the double pendulum's initial conditions lead it to carve out very different trajectories through space, making its behavior hard to predict and understand. This allows researchers to translate their physical questions about the pendulum into geometric ones, making them more intuitive and easier to solve. This is also how they study the movements of fluids, robots, quantum particles, and more. And they analyze high-dimensional datasets—such as those recording the activity of thousands of neurons in the brain—by looking at how those data points might sit on a lower-dimensional manifold.
