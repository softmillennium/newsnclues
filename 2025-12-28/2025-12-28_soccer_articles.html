                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid never-ending criticism over the price of World Cup tickets next summer, FIFA was quick to point to a “more affordable” option when it rolled out tickets at $60 for loyal fans of individual nations. Soccer's governing body has come under intense scrutiny over the cost of World Cup tickets, primarily due to criticisms surrounding dynamic pricing, which has led to ticket prices surging to unprecedented heights, as described by Football Supporters Europe (FSE) as a “monumental betrayal” of fans. FIFA allocates 8% of match tickets to individual associations as part of the PMA allocation, but initially made no Category 4 tickets available, leading FSE to estimate that it would be five times more expensive for a fan to follow their country all the way to the World Cup Final than it was in Qatar in 2022. Meanwhile, the vast majority of tickets – sold to fans regardless of their national affiliations – can be resold on FIFA's official resale platform, which places no limit on the price that a ticket might reach, leading to some ticket prices ballooning to even greater heights as fans essentially began trading them as stock options. Criticisms of FIFA's ticketing policy appeared to force soccer's governing body to relent by introducing Supporter Entry tickets priced at $60 for all 104 matches at the World Cup. But that move does not go nearly far enough to address the affordability issues facing this tournament. Those tickets, available to a nation's “top cappers,” do not go far enough to cover all supporters who have loyally followed their team throughout the qualifying process. FIFA has also declined to increase allocations to individual associations, with the new low-cost tickets instead eating into the existing 8% allocation. A further 40% of a nation's PMA allocation will be designated Supporter Value Tier tickets, which are more affordable than some market-rate tickets but still rise well above $200. England's Supporter Value Tier tickets, for example, start at $220 for a group-stage game, roughly double the cost of a ticket to watch England against Spain in the Euro 2024 final. As a result, a significant number of match-going supporters will be shut out from the affordable tier and forced to pay potentially astronomical sums of money to follow their country next summer. FSE issued a statement last week welcoming FIFA's climbdown and stated that the move amounted to a recognition by FIFA of the “damage” its ticketing policies had caused. “Based on the allocations publicly available, this would mean that at best a few hundred fans per match and team would be lucky enough to take advantage of the $60 prices, while the vast majority would still have to pay extortionate prices, way higher than at any tournament before,” FSE said in a statement. Billy Grant, a member of England's Football Supporters Association who has followed the English national team to every World Cup since 1986, said FIFA's ticketing policy was “not justifiable,” adding that it has created “a lot of bad feeling” among match-going fans. Grant added that FIFA's climbdown was “not good enough” because it still prevents a number of loyal England supporters from securing affordable tickets allocated to the Football Association. “FIFA has, in effect, turned its nose up at fans who have made the game what it is, made the World Cup what it is,” Grant told amNewYork. FIFA stated that the tournament's pricing model reflects “existing market practice” for major entertainment and sporting events in North America, also citing North America's established secondary ticket market. We are focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing but also prospective fans. FIFA, however, did not adjust its pricing models to reflect market trends during previous World Cups held by host nations with a lower cost of living than the United States, including in South Africa in 2010, when tickets averaged $139 per game. UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, made 14% of all Euro 2024 tickets available through the Fan First tier and provided 37% of all tickets to individual associations, dwarfing similar categories at the upcoming World Cup. The result was a festival of soccer across Germany, with iconic scenes of orange-clad Dutch fans dancing in the streets behind a double-decker bus in Dortmund going viral across social media. Some estimates, meanwhile, placed 100,000 Scottish fans in Stuttgart ahead of their clash with Hungary at the tournament.

Soccer tourists, who do not support a particular nation but may pay an extortionate rate to experience going to a World Cup game, might wear the right colors and make noise at the games they attend, but the atmosphere could be inauthentic, Grant said. “You will have a stadium that's full, and people will make noise… but they don't know the songs, and they don't know the actions,” Grant said. He also expressed concerns about fan congregations before and after games at the tournament, stating that supporters who picked up tickets to a game involving nations they are not affiliated with will not create the same kind of scenes that genuine Dutch and Scottish fans created in Germany. The most recent iteration of the tournament saw 50 million applications for roughly 2.3 million tickets, a figure that would have also seen ticket prices spike enormously if UEFA had deployed dynamic pricing measures. There appears to be some belief, among a cohort of American social media users at least, that World Cup tickets should go to the highest bidder and fans prepared to pay exorbitant sums of money. But FIFA, as a self-described non-profit organization, should recognize that a much larger proportion of tickets should be distributed at an affordable rate on merit to fans who have followed their teams around the world, not based on how deep their pockets are.

Christian Pulisic finished the year on a high note on Sunday, something that many U.S. soccer fans hope that he will duplicate at next year's World Cup. The U.S. men's national team standout tallied the opening score for A.C. Milan in its 3-0 triumph over Hellas Verona in Italian Serie A. Pulisic has been hampered by injuries, limiting his time for club and country. He is tied with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez, whose team hosted Atalanta later in the day. His club moved into first place in the league, a point ahead of Napoli, 2-0 winners at Cremonese and two ahead of archrival Inter. Right place, right time for Captain America 🔥That's now 10 goals in only 15 matches in all competitions this season for Christian Pulisic 💪🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/mmAwPhwlXQ Pulisic volleyed home from close range at the far left post a minute into first-half stoppage time. Milan head coach Massimo Allegri told DAZN that Pulisic is far from his best due to his injuries, including a healing hamstring. “He's doing well, even though he's not yet in peak physical condition because of this minor issue with his hamstring,” Allegri said. During the 2024-25 Serie A campaign, Pulisic recorded 17 goals and 12 assists in 50 matches. He has written about New York City FC, New York Cosmos, the New York Red Bulls and both U.S. national teams and has penned a soccer history column for the Guardian.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rather than dropping in level, they arrive at the 2026 World Cup in top form, having qualified as leaders of the CONMEBOL qualifiers. Despite this strong performance, Toni Kroos opted to exclude them from his four candidates to win the tournament, instead backing a surprising national team. In a recent appearance on Romario's YouTube channel, making clear his four favorite national teams to win the 2026 World Cup: “Spain, Portugal, France, and there may be a surprise, I would say Morocco… Germany are always there. I don't see them among the top five favorites, but just like Brazil, if they surprise me, that's great.” Choosing Spain, Portugal, and France stirs little controversy, as these national teams consistently dominate on the global stage. However, Toni Kroos surprised many fans by selecting Morocco as a top contender. Despite being in top form, considering the African side as major contenders for the title seems bold, given they have yet to reach their first final in the tournament's history, but their promising roster may hint towards a historic victory. Unlike the previous world champions, Lionel Messi's national team has managed to stay relevant, making a gradual renewal of its roster. Toni Kroos of Germany celebrates the 2014 FIFA World Cup victory. Since the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo as a global superstar in Portugal, they have established themselves as one of the most important national teams. After winning their first three titles in history, coach Roberto Martinez now has a roster where the blend of experience and youth points to dominance in the tournament. Unique tribute for Argentina captain ahead of 2026 FIFA World Cup in the works Led by Vitinha and Joao Mendes, Portugal have managed to consolidate a very appealing sporting project. By keeping players like Dibu Martinez, Nicolas Otamendi, Rodrigo de Paul, and others, it aims to become two-time world champions—something that hasn't happened in 64 years, with Brazil being the last to achieve it after winning the 1958 and 1962 editions. A teammate of Lionel Messi at Inter Miami spoke about what it means to play alongside him. Erling Haaland is surging with ruthless efficiency, Lamine Yamal continues his meteoric rise, and — in a twist few expected — Lionel Messi has re-entered the debate entirely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 19-year-old defender is instead focused on representing England at the senior level, a stance that reflects his growing confidence after an impressive run of performances at Old Trafford. Born in London, Heaven qualifies to play for Ghana through a grandparent, and officials from the Ghana FA have been tracking his progress closely over the past year. Ghana have been placed in the same World Cup group as England, alongside Croatia and Panama, meaning Heaven could theoretically have faced the Three Lions had he chosen to change allegiance. Heaven has represented England consistently at the youth level and remains firmly in that pathway. His decision comes amid a period of rapid development at club level, with the defender establishing himself in Manchester United's first-team picture following his February move from Arsenal. Ruben Amorim has been vocal in his praise of Heaven's progress, highlighting why the teenager feels confident enough to set his sights high on the international stage. Speaking after recent performances, Amorim said: "I am really pleased with Ayden. The United boss pointed to Heaven's composure and learning curve as key traits behind his rise. Amorim also hinted at how quickly Heaven has gone from squad option to serious contender. "He trained really well and, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place," he added, a statement that reinforces why Heaven now sees England, rather than Ghana, as the ultimate destination for his international career. Earlier this season, he suffered an ankle injury while playing for England's Under-20 side against Switzerland in October, forcing him off at half-time and ruling him out of November's fixture against Japan.

In the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins. But away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva. Here, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O'Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year. You can't snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild. Anka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else. Miller: I don't think I'll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year. Miller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I'll never forget. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some. Feringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact. James: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul. Anka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too. One of football's great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP. Feringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else's villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter. James: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest's 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder. Forest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. Anka: The two biggest games of McTominay's 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland's qualification for the 2026 World Cup. I undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success. Also, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don't think there's a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men's game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he's always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh. “That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz Either Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny. Or Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really. Feringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports' Halo and Joey Barton. Anka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good. Miller: Troy Parrott's miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can't remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? The way Liverpool's 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah's outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. Anka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season. Miller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak. O'Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago… I really don't know why everyone kept panicking. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest's owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed. Anka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025. Miller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup. O'Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw. James: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. UEFA's judgement was harsh but I wouldn't go that far. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion. Anka: The Women's Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria's Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco's federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”. Miller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser in the final men's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave. The latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH O'Neill: I wasn't there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota. It came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. Close second: Jack Grealish's first for Everton against Crystal Palace. I was convinced I'd be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me. James: Paris Saint-Germain's third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele's backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Thank you for voting, the fun doesn't stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Josh Tymon's volley, for Snoop's Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Anka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so… Amad's edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off. Declan Rice's perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable. Miller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I'm going to be like that. It's hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest. O'Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women's football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees. “I spent some time playing men's football. But it really wasn't my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Since coming out, football has been my escape. “Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. It's my escape, and the fact that it's trying to be taken away from us is not fair.” Feringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.” Ange Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient. Elite players just don't say things like that. If only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists. Anka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland. “People might think I'm an idealist as a person but not at all. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! Miller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they've served up before”. What do you mean, ‘It's just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this'? Feringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Anka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners' medal.</p>
