James Cameron told Fox News Digital Leonardo DiCaprio almost passed on playing Jack Dawson in "Titanic" because he thought the role was too easy. Leonardo DiCaprio spent the holiday week leaning into love. The actor was seen getting cozy with his girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti during a Los Angeles lunch and shopping date — showing rare PDA that turned heads and fueled relationship buzz. DiCaprio, 51, and Ceretti, 27, kicked off their outing with lunch at Architecture Café, where the pair sat close, as she appeared to wrap her arm around the Hollywood actor. They looked relaxed and affectionate during their intimate outing. Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti were spotted enjoying lunch, shopping, and sweet PDA during a rainy day out on Melrose Place. PDA has long been a rarity for DiCaprio, who typically keeps his relationships low-key. Inside the boutique, DiCaprio and Ceretti were seen sharing a sweet kiss — another uncommon moment from the usually reserved Hollywood star. The affectionate exchange offered a glimpse into the couple's growing comfort together, even in public settings. DiCaprio kept things casual in a black sweatsuit and matching hat, while Ceretti opted for an understated look and was photographed with a Chanel bag by her side. The two appeared to be all smiles during their rare outing. The sighting comes after the Hollywood couple were seen enjoying a sun-soaked summer yacht trip in August, where they were also seen keeping things relatively low-profile. Natasha Poonawalla, Christian Louboutin, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti attend the Summer Gala by Gala One Saint-Tropez 2025. Ceretti wore an animal-print bikini while DiCaprio kept it simple in a black bathing suit. The two were first romantically linked in 2023. Earlier this year, Ceretti gave a rare and intimate look into what it's like dating the famous actor. PDA has long been a rarity for DiCaprio, who typically keeps his relationships low-key. When asked if she believes there's a "risk" in being labeled DiCaprio's "girlfriend," she replied, "Yes." "As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of' – or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying," Ceretti said in an interview with Vogue France. So, it's not nice to think that you can't love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you." Ceretti revealed that the two had met in Milan but declined to share any specific details. Stephanie Giang-Paunon is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A subway rider swipes his MetroCard in a turnstile as he enters the 34th St. subway station, July 23, 2007, in New York. Russell Chin, left, helps Angie Hoyle, 3, of the Brooklyn borough of New York, as she tries on a hat made of MetroCards shaped as the Brooklyn Bridge during the Easter Parade on New York's Fifth Avenue, March 23, 2008. Lev Radin poses for a picture with his MetroCard collection, Dec. 10, 2025, in New York. Shoppers swipe their MetroCards as they enter the subway turnstiles, Nov. 29, 2024, in New York. Now, more than three decades later, the gold-hued fare card and its notoriously finicky magnetic strip are following the token into retirement. The last day to buy or refill a MetroCard is Dec. 31, 2025, as the transit system fully transitions to OMNY, a contactless payment system that allows riders to tap their credit card, phone or other smart device to pay fares, much like they do for other everyday purchases. Transit officials say more than 90% of subway and bus trips are now paid using the tap-and-go system, introduced in 2019. Major cities around the world, including London and Singapore, have long used similar contactless systems. In the U.S., San Francisco launched a pay-go system earlier this year, joining Chicago and others. The humble MetroCard may have outlasted its useful life, but in its day it was revolutionary, says Jodi Shapiro, curator at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn, which opened an exhibit earlier this month reflecting on the MetroCard's legacy. Before MetroCards, bus and subway riders relied on tokens, the brass-colored coins introduced in 1953 that were purchased from station booths. “There was a resistance to change from tokens to something else because tokens work,” Shapiro said on a recent visit to the museum, housed underground in a decommissioned subway station. “MetroCards introduced a whole other level of thinking for New Yorkers.” Officials even briefly toyed with the idea of an quirky mascot, the Cardvaark, before coming to their senses. Artists from David Bowie and Olivia Rodrigo to seminal New York hip hop acts, such as the Wu-Tang Clan, the Notorious B.I.G. and LL Cool J, have also graced the plastic card over the years, as have iconic New York shows like Seinfeld and Law & Order. “Not only photos of landmarks, skylines, but also about people who live and make New York special.” During her failed 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. Senator from New York, took an excruciating five swipes at a Bronx turnstile. In fairness, her chief Democratic opponent at the time, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a native Brooklynite, didn't even appear to realize tokens had been discontinued. Unlike the MetroCard rollout, OMNY has required little adjustment. Riders reluctant to use a credit card or smart device can purchase an OMNY card they can reload, similar to a MetroCard. The new system also allows unlimited free rides within a seven-day period because the fare is capped after 12 rides. It'll max out at $35 a week once the fare rises to $3 in January. Near Times Square on a recent morning, Ronald Minor was among the dwindling group of “straphangers” still swiping MetroCards. The 70-year-old Manhattan resident said he's sad to see them go. He has an OMNY card but found the vending machines to reload it more cumbersome. “It's hard for the elders,” Minor said as he caught a train to Brooklyn. “It's just like everything else, just something to get used to,” he said as he headed uptown.</p>

Petty Officer Scott Ruskan speaks with Fox News' Lawrence Jones in Kerrville, Texas, to reflect on the heroic rescue mission as Central Texas continues to reel from the devastation left by the flash floods. In a year marked by disaster and devastation, it was quiet bravery, from Coast Guard rescue swimmers to local firefighters, emergency crews and everyday citizens, that turned moments of crisis into stories of survival. On July 4, 2025, catastrophic flash flooding along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, Texas, devastated Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp that had been operating for nearly a century. Dick Eastland, the longtime director and co-owner of Camp Mystic, died while trying to save campers as fast-rising floodwaters tore through the campgrounds before dawn. Eastland, who had led the camp since the 1970s, was widely remembered by former campers and staff as a father figure and selfless leader whose final moments reflected a lifetime spent protecting children in his care. Debris and damage in Camp Mystic cabin split with a photo of Dick Eastland (Reuters/Sergio Flores; LeslieEastland/Facebook) "It doesn't surprise me at all that his last act of kindness and sacrifice was working to save the lives of campers," said Paige Sumner, a former camper and friend of Eastland. Twenty-seven girls and counselors were killed when the Guadalupe River surged through a low-lying area of the camp, rising from 14 feet to 29.5 feet in just 60 minutes. The destructive flooding ultimately killed at least 136 people across Central Texas, triggering widespread scrutiny of emergency preparedness and warning systems. Community leaders and lawmakers paid tribute to Eastland's bravery, calling his final actions emblematic of the quiet heroism displayed during one of the deadliest natural disasters of the year. A United States Coast Guard rescue swimmer from New Jersey was hailed as a hero for his role in lifesaving efforts during the deadly flash floods in Central Texas. Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan, 26, was credited with saving 165 people as the only triage coordinator on the ground amid the chaotic flood response near Camp Mystic and surrounding areas. Destroyed cabin at Camp Mystic after flooding hit Texas. "United States Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer and Petty Officer Scott Ruskin [sic], directly saved an astonishing 165 victims in the devastating flooding in central Texas. His selfless courage embodies the spirit and mission of the @USCG," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X. Ruskan described spotting a large crowd of "about 200 kids at a campsite" and focusing rescue efforts there to get as many people to safety as possible. A decorated former police officer and former Baltimore Orioles minor league player died while rescuing swimmers caught in a rip current off the coast of South Carolina in July, according to authorities and family members. Chase Childers, 38, entered the water near Pawleys Island on July 13, 2025, after people were reported in distress. Former police officer Chase Childers died in a rip current in Pawleys Island, SC after attempting to rescue others. "We would like to provide additional information on Sunday's incident," the Pawleys Island Police Department said in a statement. Sadly, Mr. Childers was caught in the rip current, as well. Emergency responders recovered Childers' body about 90 minutes after the initial distress call, with assistance from Midway Fire Rescue and the U.S. Coast Guard. Officials praised first responders for their efforts and offered condolences to the family. According to a GoFundMe created in Childers' memory, he was a devoted husband and father who displayed "extraordinary courage and selflessness" while saving a family of five, putting their lives above his own. During his law enforcement career in Cobb County, Georgia, Childers received a lifetime achievement award for saving several lives, the page said. On Feb. 1, 2025, an active shooter incident erupted during a band competition at Pasadena Memorial High School in Texas, when an 83-year-old man, identified as Dennis Brandl, opened fire inside the school auditorium. One person, a 26-year-old percussion technical consultant, was shot in the shoulder and transported to a Houston-area hospital, where he remained conscious and was expected to recover. Before police could fully respond, a group of four fathers known as the "band dads" — all of whom had military or law enforcement backgrounds — sprang into action. A group of four tactically-trained band dads jumped into action and apprehended an active shooter at a band competition at Pasadena Memorial High school. "As soon as everyone was screaming and yelling, gunshots fired, Joe and myself looked at each other and ran straight to the door," Army veteran Adam Curow told FOX 26. "By the time we got inside, Polo and Abram were right behind us as a band-dad team." Pasadena ISD police officers, along with civilians and community members, helped restrain Brandl until law enforcement secured the scene. Joe Sanchez, who was attending the event, for their decisive actions. "When danger struck, HPD Sergeant Joe Sanchez didn't hesitate," the department wrote in a statement on X. Sanchez was among those who quickly stepped up to protect lives. A dramatic ocean rescue unfolded aboard a Disney Dream cruise ship after a 5-year-old girl fell overboard while the vessel was sailing in international waters between the Bahamas and Port Everglades, Florida, authorities said. A father and his daughter were rescued after falling overboard from the Disney Dream cruise ship, June 29, 2025. Investigators said the father located his daughter and treaded water with her until rescue crews arrived, as the ship's "man overboard" alert sounded and crew members launched an emergency response. Security video corroborated the family's account, and officials credited the ship's crew with executing a swift rescue due to their man-overboard training. Authorities said the family, who live out of state, requested privacy, calling the outcome a blessing in what could have been a tragic incident.

Burt Kearns has written a new book on the late Oscar winner, "Marlon Brando: Hollywood Rebel." Johnny Carson's tenure on NBC's "The Tonight Show" produced many iconic moments. In the new book, "Love Johnny Carson," Carson's superfan Mark Malkoff details some of the most legendary moments on the show, including a blowup between Hollywood juggernauts, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Marlon Brando. According to the book, Brando and Gabor appeared on the show alongside one another in May 1963, when Carson filmed episodes of the show live from Burbank, California. "Brando walked out drunk and sat down next to Johnny's previous guest, socialite and actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, who had been promoting her new face cream," Malkoff wrote. Brando and Gabor came to blows during an episode of "The Tonight Show" in 1963. While the two started off cordial, with Brando "calling Zsa Zsa fascinating and charming," the love between them quickly faded, as Gabor began interrupting Brando constantly. Things continued to spiral downward after Brando "told a weak knock-knock joke that garnered polite applause," which Gabor pointed out, saying, "Only for Marlon Brando would they applaud for that." "Zsa Zsa changed the subject back to her face cream, rehashing the product's incomparable benefits. Malkoff continues by saying that the conversation soon turned into an exchange of insults, after which "Zsa Zsa got up and stormed off the set," while a still-drunk "Brando offered a sly smile." Gabor ended up storming off set after the conversation turned to exchanging insults. Throughout his career, the actor received eight Academy Award nominations, winning in 1955 and 1973 for his roles in "On the Waterfront" and "The Godfather," respectively. The actor worked in Hollywood for over 50 years and had over 40 credits to his name, including both feature films and television projects. He died in July 2004 at the age of 80 from respiratory failure related to pulmonary fibrosis and congestive heart failure. "Marlon Brando is one of the great men of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and we lesser mortals are obligated to cut through the s--- and proclaim it," Jack Nicholson told Rolling Stone in August 2004. "This man has been my idol all of my professional life, and I don't think I'm alone in that. The impact of movies is enormous, and his impact in the movies was bigger than anybody else's – ever. "To me, Marlon Brando was the greatest ever," he later added. "That's a truth I hold to be self-evident. But it's like what Bum Phillips said once: 'If he isn't in a class by himself, it sure takes a very short time to call the roll.'" Lori Bashian is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunday marks the initial phase of Myanmar's first general election in five years, held under the supervision of its military government while a civil war rages throughout much of the country. Critics say the election is designed to add a facade of legitimacy to military rule, which began after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. Voting is underway in Myanmar's controversial general election. Officials of the Union Election Commission prepare to count votes at a polling station, during the first phase of general election, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Sunday, Dec. 28, 2025. An official of the Union Election Commission counts ballots at a polling station, during the first phase of general election, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Sunday, Dec. 28, 2025. Voters line up to cast their ballots at a polling station in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Sunday, Dec. 28, 2025. Voters line up to cast their ballots at a polling station, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Sunday, Dec. 28, 2025. Final results won't be known until after two more rounds of voting are completed later in January. It's widely expected that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has governed Myanmar since an army takeover in 2021, will then assume the presidency. The military government has presented the vote as a return to democracy, but its bid for legitimacy is marred by the absence of formerly popular opposition parties and reports that soldiers used threats to force voters' participation. While more than 4,800 candidates from 57 parties are competing for seats in national and regional legislatures, only six are competing nationwide with the possibility to gain political clout in parliament. Subsequent phases will take place on Jan. 11 and Jan. 25, but 65 townships won't participate in the election because of ongoing armed conflicts. Final results are expected to be announced by February. It wasn't clear if or when the authorities would release aggregate figures of Sunday's voting, although counts were publicly announced at local polling stations. Military rule began when soldiers ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. It blocked her National League for Democracy party from serving a second term despite winning a landslide victory in the 2020 election. They argue that the results will lack legitimacy because of the exclusion of major parties and government repression. “An election organized by a junta that continues to bomb civilians, jail political leaders, and criminalize all forms of dissent is not an election — it is a theater of the absurd performed at gunpoint,” Tom Andrews, the U.N.-appointed human rights expert for Myanmar, posted on X. However, the election may provide an excuse for neighbors like China, India and Thailand to say that the vote represents progress toward stability. Western nations have maintained sanctions against Myanmar's ruling generals because of the military's anti-democratic actions and the brutal war against opponents. According to a count carried out at one polling station in Yangon after the polls closed, only 524 of 1,431 registered voters — just under 37% — cast their ballots. Of those, 311 voted for the pro-military Union Solidarity and Development Party, suggesting that opposition calls for a voter boycott may have been heeded. “I am voting with the feeling that I will go back to my village when it is peaceful,” she told The Associated Press. A resident of southern Mon state, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Khin, for fear of arrest by the military, told the AP that she felt compelled to go to a polling station because of pressure from local authorities. Suu Kyi, Myanmar's 80-year-old former leader, and her party aren't participating in the polls. She is serving a 27-year prison term on charges widely viewed as spurious and politically motivated. Her party, the National League for Democracy, was dissolved in 2023 after refusing to register under new military rules. Other parties also refused to register or declined to run under conditions they deem unfair, and opposition groups have called for a voter boycott. Amael Vier, an analyst for the Asian Network for Free Elections, noted a lack of genuine choice, pointing out that 73% of voters in 2020 cast ballots for parties that no longer exist. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 22,000 people are currently detained for political offenses, and more than 7,600 civilians have been killed by security forces since 2021. Armed resistance arose after the army used lethal force to crush nonviolent protests against its 2021 takeover. A new Election Protection Law imposes harsh penalties and restrictions for virtually all public criticism of the polls. There were no reports of major interference with the polls, though opposition organizations and armed resistance groups had vowed to disrupt the electoral process. Both the military and its opponents believe power is likely to remain with Min Aung Hlaing, who led the 2021 seizure of power. I am not the leader of a political party,” he told journalists after casting his vote.</p>

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera joins ‘America Reports' to report on the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. A Honduran national had an "unlucky" encounter with Border Patrol enforcement on Friday. The woman allegedly ran a red light in Slidell, Louisiana, and rammed into an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) vehicle, U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino wrote on X. "Apparently she never learned the lesson that red means stop," Bovino wrote. "Not ‘accelerate and collide with a government vehicle actively enforcing federal law.'" A Honduran national was allegedly behind the wheel of a car that ran a red light and crashed into an ICE vehicle in Louisiana, according to officials. She was then arrested by federal agents. Lucky for us," Bovino continued in the post. "Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto and rape," Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ICE has reportedly apprehended approximately 370 people in the area, according to a Dec. 18 update. "DHS is making the New Orleans community safer as it continues to arrest illegal alien drug dealers, hit-and-run criminals, and one monster who was convicted for arson and threatening a person with intent to terrorize," McLaughlin said. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino at a New Orleans convenience store Dec. 3. The DHS reported that it has deported more than 622,000 individuals in 2025 as of Dec. 19. The department also reported that 2.5 million illegal immigrants have left the country, and an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations have occurred since President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. Details about the Honduran woman were not made publicly available. DHS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, speaking at the Israel National Security Studies conference, says President Donald Trump has been clear that Iran will not be allowed to go nuclear. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country is engaged in what he described as a "total war" with the U.S., Israel and Europe. In an interview published Saturday by Iranian state media, Pezeshkian said that he believes the Western powers want to bring Iran "to its knees," The Times of Israel reported. "In my opinion, we are at total war with the United States, Israel and Europe," Pezeshkian said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian speaks with Fox News Channel's Martha MacCallum during an interview on Sept. 25 in New York City. "If one understands it well, this war is far more complex and difficult than that war. "Here, they are besieging us from every aspect, they are creating problems for us in terms of livelihood, culturally, politically, and security-wise." Despite the strain, Pezeshkian claimed Iran's military emerged stronger following its June conflict with Israel, according to The Times of Israel. "Our beloved military forces are doing their jobs with strength and now, in terms of equipment and manpower, despite all the problems we have, they are stronger than when they attacked. So if they want to attack, they will naturally face a more decisive response," he said.

Tensions remain high following a brief but intense air conflict in June that was kicked off by Israel. President Donald Trump will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week. On June 22, President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces had launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated." A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Iran and Israel took effect on June 24.
